The Court reiterates that in accordance with its established case-law, the right of freedom of movement as guaranteed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 is intended to secure to any person a right to liberty of movement within a territory and to leave that territory, which implies a right to leave for any country of the person's choice to which he may be admitted. In particular, a measure by means of which an individual is denied the use of a document which, had he so wished, would have permitted him to leave the country, amounts to an interference within the meaning of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Bartik v. Russia, no. 55565/00, § 36, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; Timishev v. Russia (dec.), nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, 30 March 2004; and Napijalo v. Croatia, no. 66485/01, § 68, 13 November 2003).

The applicant would not be a party to such proceedings and would only be informed of the Commission's decision. It follows that an application to the Interagency Commission does not give the person employing it a personal right to the exercise by the State of its supervisory powers, and that such an appeal does not therefore constitute an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention (see Belevitskiy v.

The Court reiterates that the test as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society” involves showing that the action taken was in pursuit of that legitimate aim, and that the interference with the rights protected was no greater than was necessary to achieve it. In other words, this requirement, commonly referred to as the test of proportionality, demands that restrictive measures should be appropriate to achieve their protective function ( compare with point 14 of the Human Rights Committee's General Comment on Article 12 of the ICCPR, cited in paragraph 24 above)."

                "“49. The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant's ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported “protective function” of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning'State secrets'. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of'State secrets'became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that'the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of'State secrets '' (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph [24] above)."

The Parliamentary Assembly's Opinion on Russia's request for membership of the Council of Europe indicates that the repeal of restrictions on international travel for private purposes was regarded as a necessary condition for membership of the Council of Europe, as the organisation of States adhering to the principles of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law (Preamble to the Statute of the Council of Europe) ... The express mention in the Parliamentary Assembly's Opinion on Russia's accession request of Russia's undertaking to cease restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggests that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe. Indeed, many member States of the Council of Europe have never had a comparable restriction in their legislation, whereas many others have abolished it during the process of democratic reforms ... However, Russia's undertaking to abolish that restriction has not been implemented and the relevant provisions of domestic law have remained in force to date ... ”",

                "51. The Court reiterates its constant approach that it takes into account relevant international instruments and reports, and in particular those of other Council of Europe organs, in order to interpret the guarantees of the Convention and to establish whether there is a common European standard in the field. Where there is a common standard which the respondent State has failed to meet, this may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases (see Tănase v. Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, § 176, ECHR 2010 ‑ ..., and Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, § 85, 12 November 2008). An overview of the situation in the Council of Europe Member States demonstrates that at present Russia has remained the only Member State that has retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of “State secrets”. Whereas Western European Member States have never imposed such restrictions, Central and Eastern European States abolished them during the process of democratic transition. Azerbaijan was the last one to remove that restriction in December 2005 (see paragraph 22 above). On the international level, the UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual's right to leave the country merely on the ground that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see paragraph 24 above in fine ). In Russia, however, the impugned restriction has remained in force to date, despite the Russian Government commitment to abolish it with immediate effect, adopted in 1996 as a condition for its membership of the Council of Europe (see Opinion no. 193 (1996) on Russia's request for membership of the Council of Europe, cited in paragraph 20 above). Russia did not enter any reservation to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 when ratifying the Convention. Having regard to the established common European and international standard, the Court considers that the Russian Government were under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining the restriction in question."

The Court reiterates that, as in the Bartik case, the confidential information which the applicant possessed could be transmitted in a variety of ways which did not require his presence abroad or even direct physical contact with anyone. The Government's claim that the applicant would be abducted by foreign intelligence services or terrorist organisations while abroad appears to be mere conjecture not supported by any actual assessment of the security risks in the applicant's individual case because of the blanket nature of the prohibition on private international travel in respect of all those who, like the applicant, had had access to State secrets in the past."

The applicant's status as a military serviceman or the fact that he acknowledged the possibility of a restriction in 1999 do not alter the conclusion that the restriction failed to achieve the protective function that had been previously assigned to it. Even though the Court has previously accepted that the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, §§ 73 and 103, Series A no. 22; Kalaç v. Turkey, 1 July 1997, § 28, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV; Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 50 and 51, Reports 1998 ‑ I; Hadjianastassiou v.

Russia, no. 69519/01, § 86, 2 2 October 2009 ), such a restriction must in all cases be commensurate with its protective function.

The applicant has been affected by the restriction on his right to travel abroad for a considerable period of time, that is, for more than five years following the termination of his employment.

The ensuing report of 8 February 2008 considered that Mr X. was having difficulty seeing the child, as for a while the mother had unilaterally interrupted the father ’ s visits ( for example, nine out of fourteen overnight stays with the father had not occurred and six consecutive Sunday visits had been missed), and that the mother was not cooperating with children ’ s services. Consequently, the establishment of an educational programme had not been successful. It found on the one hand that the first applicant ’ s anger towards the father was persistent and involved the child. On the other hand the father had shown consideration and put the needs of the child first. He sincerely loved his daughter and was cooperating with children ’ s services. The father and the child had a warm and caring relationship, and the child felt comfortable and happy in his presence. It appeared however that the child might have fears of losing her loved ones, probably due to the various moves, which had also detached her from members of her extended family. The report therefore advised the grant of temporary sole custody to the father, with regular supervised visits by the mother, until this could be reversed. It concluded that schooling should be in accordance with the custody decision, as this would be favourable to the child ’ s emotional stability, notwithstanding the unfortunate moves of house. It also advised psychotherapeutic and parental education support for the parents, together with further monitoring by children ’ s services."

Consequently, even where a mother has been deprived of parental rights - and indeed that is one of the causes of the dispute which she has referred to the Court - her standing as the natural mother suffices to afford her the necessary power to apply to the Court on the child ’ s behalf, too, in order to protect his or her interests. Moreover, the conditions governing individual applications are not necessarily the same as national criteria relating to locus standi. National rules in this respect may serve purposes different from those contemplated by Article 34 of the Convention and, whilst those purposes may sometimes be analogous, they need not always be so (see Scozzari and Giunta v.

They considered it inconceivable that an abduction planned with children ’ s services would have been endorsed by the judge. Similarly, the restrictions placed on the mother on the basis of her alleged intention of removing the child were unfounded, as the first applicant had shown reasons, by means of the relevant certification, why the child could not attend certain visits with Mr X. As a result of the impugned decision which found for joint custody, the first applicant could only see her daughter for a few hours (up to 11 August 2008 ), having every time to make a trip to San Marino from Italy, and unlike the father she was not able to take the child on holiday for a few days."

It followed that the domestic court did not exercise any supervision of the work of children ’ s services in that respect. Another supposedly independent expert, the psychologist in charge of monitoring the meetings held at X. ’ s house, was the psychologist of a committee with which relatives of X. were involved. They further submitted that their expert, a psychological consultant for the Council of the Order of Psychologists of San Marino (“the Order”), had not been in accordance with the reports drawn up by children ’ s services, which, in her view, had not been supported by scientific evidence.

The Government pointed out that in June 2007 the mother had taken the child to Italy, notwithstanding the decision of 17 April 2007, which held that the child should remain in San Marino ( see paragraph 22 above ), and from 2007 the first applicant had repeatedly refused to allow contact with the father, contrary to the decree of 25 June 2007 (paragraph 29 above). Thus, the impugned decision had been taken in the best interest of the child, having considered that the father was the parent who would have allowed contact with the other parent. The court ’ s conclusion had been based on the objective findings by children ’ s services following their monitoring of the parent-child relationships, which repeatedly found that the mother was hindering the child ’ s contact with the father, to the extent that in 2009 they feared the second applicant was suffering from Parental Alienation Syndrome (paragraph 9 7 above )."

They were judge auxiliaries /assistants, representing the institutional instrument allowing the court to acquire all the necessary elements to correctly evaluate any decision related to custody and adoption. Children ’ s services, as public employees, were subject to Public Employment Law and to supervision by the Social Security Institute. Failure to abide by the duties imposed could lead to disciplinary sanctions as imposed by law through the Disciplinary Board. Children ’ s services personnel were qualified individuals, with degrees in psychology and/or pedagogy with a two year specialisation course in Psychology or with at least five years ’ service in the health sector, who have been successful in a public competition and whose profession therefore guaranteed their independence and impartiality. Moreover, such qualities had often been confirmed by L. C. , a court expert, whose authority in child therapy was indisputable. In reply to the third- party intervener, the Government considered that the dual role carried out by children ’ s services was functional, enabling parents to reach agreements in the best interest of the child.

In their view a violation of Article 6 § 1 persisted, in that after nearly three years the appeal proceedings against the impugned decision had not yet been terminated. This delay was not understandable in view of the delicate situation, the best interest of the child and her rights under Article 8. Moreover, the Italian Government were of the view that the deterioration in the second applicant ’ s health from 2009 onwards could have been due to incompetence on the part of children ’ s services, as evidenced by the Associazione Pro Bimbi ’ s submissions (see below).

It receives support from, inter alia, the Ministries of Public Instruction, Health, Justice, and Foreign Affairs. They submitted that in 2009 they had received a number of requests from separated parents in respect of their loss of parental rights and/or joint custody. Some of these cases had turned out to be extremely alarming from the point of view of the right to joint parenting and regular contact rights. These complaints mainly concerned children ’ s services. During the association ’ s discussions on child custody, strong criticisms of children ’ s services were voiced by parents, in particular in respect of their lack of qualifications and ineffective support for parents. Many spoke about their distressing experiences in trying to see their children, particularly in cases of parents with dual nationality, who publicly complained that they had faced discriminatory treatment from the services. The association therefore invited children ’ s services and the Council of the Order of Psychologists of San Marino (“the Council”) to attend subsequent sessions. Unlike the Council, children ’ s services did not send any representatives. The Council ’ s representative, in reply to questions set, confirmed that in San Marino it sufficed to have a degree in pedagogy without a further professional qualification to be employed by children ’ s services.

The association also considered that it was anomalous for the staff of children ’ s services to assume conflicting roles, namely the function of public officials reporting to judges and also as mediators providing support for families and children. Concerned about the above matter, the association had sent letters to the head of the Institute for Social Security, who was in charge of children ’ s services.

Family life in the Contracting States encompasses a broad range of parental rights and responsibilities in regard to care and custody of minor children. The care and upbringing of children normally and necessarily require that the parents or an only parent decide where the child must reside and also impose, or authorise others to impose, various restrictions on the child ’ s liberty. Thus, the children in a school or other educational or recreational institution must abide by certain rules which limit their freedom of movement and their liberty in other respects. Likewise a child may have to be hospitalised for medical treatment. Family life in this sense, and especially the rights of parents to exercise parental authority over their children, having due regard to their corresponding parental responsibilities, is recognised and protected by the Convention, in particular by Article 8 (see Nielsen v.

Accordingly, the Court is entitled to have regard to that process to determine whether it has been conducted in a manner that, in all the circumstances, is fair and affords due respect to the interests protected by Article 8. What has to be determined is whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and notably the serious nature of the decisions to be taken, the parents have been involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide them with the requisite protection of their interests. If they have not, there will have been a failure to respect their family life and the interference resulting from the decision will not be capable of being regarded as “necessary” within the meaning of Article 8 ( see W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 62 and 64 in fine ).

In each of their decisions they relied on detailed and complete reports from the children ’ s services (see, for example, paragraphs 22, 28, 38, 50 and 77 ) which were drawn up following constant and specific requests by the domestic courts. These reports were a result of the constant monitoring performed by the service.

It reiterates that the national authorities having the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned are better placed than the international judge to assess such needs. The Court considers that the measures adopted do not appear manifestly arbitrary or unfair. In consequence, it is not for the Court to enter into a detailed assessment of the most appropriate contact arrangements. It suffices for the Court to note that these rights were not denied or suppressed at any moment, the applicants having maintained constant and regular contact with each other, and the first applicant having retained joint custody over the second applicant. While supervision and often limitation as to the venue of contact meetings (the father ’ s residence), must have restricted the purpose of visits between mother and child, limiting to some extent their contact and the opportunity to develop their relationship - a matter which was in both of their interests and particularly the child ’ s, whose interest is paramount - the Court considers that monitoring by the child services was necessary to allow the domestic courts to make informed decisions as to custody and contact rights. Moreover, such monitoring also served to ensure the child ’ s well being. The Court is ready to accept that while there was no threat of violence or serious health issues (see, a contrario, Gluhaković v. Croatia, no. 21188/09, § 63, 12 April 2011 ) there could have been a risk of psychological abuse as evidenced by the suggestions that the child might develop Parent Alienation Syndrome, thus justifying the father ’ s presence at meetings. This having been said, the Court refutes the Government ’ s argument that such limitations were necessary as a precautionary measure against a possible abduction by the first applicant. The Court notes that when the first applicant moved to San Marino, she had informed the judge (see paragraph 26), similarly, when requested to submit the second applicant ’ s passport she did so (see paragraph 56). While she appeared to be more hesitant to submit the second passport, the Court notes that in the meantime it was Mr X. who had requested a second passport and who was allowed to travel with the child (see paragraphs 70 and 92). Moreover, it had been repeatedly stated by the courts that travel was banned unless authorised by it (see paragraphs 51, 70 and 99), a measure which in principle deterred unilateral decisions to take the child away. Furthermore, the Court notes that there is nothing in the case file which gives objective grounds for any fear of the applicants ’ absconding, particularly since the first applicant ’ s family lived in Rimini, not far from San Marino, and indeed any mere suspicions or fears which Mr X. might have had had neither been substantiated nor confirmed by the courts. Lastly, the Court notes that the presence of the parties ’ lawyers had not been court ordered, and indeed it was the children ’ s services that requested the court to prohibit such a practice (see paragraph 69 above).

As to the applicants ’ contention that the children ’ s services were biased and unqualified, the Court considers that quite apart from the submissions made by the third-party intervener association, the matter remains unsubstantiated, and in any event the Court has not discerned any proof of the lack of effectiveness of such a service, particularly where, as in the present case, the proposals made by the service do not appear to be manifestly arbitrary or discriminatory. While it is true that the domestic courts have a duty to exercise constant vigilance, particularly as regards action taken by social services, to ensure the latter ’ s conduct does not defeat the authorities ’ decisions (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], cited above, § 179), the Court notes that in the present case, the applicants had ample possibilities to criticise and contest the children ’ s services qualifications, actions and findings in the contentious proceedings, as in fact the first applicant had done in relation to the children ’ s services failure to facilitate her contact rights (see paragraphs 46, 48 and 56 above). Moreover, when at issue, the domestic courts considered that the children ’ s services were made up of reliable experts (see paragraph 110 above)."

In assessing whether the domestic courts ’ reasons were also sufficient for the purposes of Article 8 § 2, the Court will notably have to determine whether the decision-making process, seen as a whole, provided the first applicant with the requisite protection of her interest."

Indeed she had presented ample submissions to the domestic courts as evidenced by the voluminous documentation submitted to the Court. As to the hearing of 19 February 2008 on the merits of her and Mr X. ’ s requests, the Court considers that given the fact that the first applicant ’ s representative had been duly notified of the date of the hearing (see paragraph 43 above), that at the actual hearing she had originally been represented by co-counsel, and that she had had the opportunity to submit written pleadings, it cannot be said that her involvement had not been effective at that stage. This is more so in view of the fact that in cases concerning a person ’ s relationship with his or her child there is a duty to exercise exceptional diligence in view of the risk that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the matter. In this light, and bearing in mind that the decision of 19 February 2008 only confirmed the retention of a joint custody regime which had previously been decided (see paragraphs 28 and 38 above ) the Court finds reasonable the refusal of the domestic court to adjourn the hearing."

As to the overall length of the proceedings the Court notes that the first applicant intervened in the custody and contact proceedings in December 2006 and the proceedings are to date still pending. However, it is evident from the facts of the case that there have not been any significant lapses of inactivity, or adjournments for reasons related to internal organisation (see, a contrario Veljkov v. Serbia, no. 23087/07, § 88, 19 April 2011 and Wildgruber v. Germany, nos. 42402/05 and 42423/05, § 61, 21 January 2010 ). Indeed it also transpires that the parties ’ requests for urgent hearings had been immediately followed up, with the domestic courts calling on extraordinary hearings of their own motion when necessary (see, for example, paragraph 43 above). Thus, although parallel proceedings and the fact that the courts had to decide a number of ancillary matters simultaneously must have detracted from the required speediness of custody proceedings, the Court considers that overall the domestic courts appear to have dealt with the proceedings with the requisite diligence."

In so far as the applicant argued that she had been denied access to the proper documentation, namely that by a decision of 17 July 2008, the first applicant was denied access to the video recordings of her visits with the second applicant, the Court considers that the information contained in those recordings was pertinent to the applicants ’ relationship and could have allowed the first applicant to become aware of any apparent negative points which could have influenced the judge against her and if necessary take them into account, in future, with a view to improving the relationship with her child. The only reason given by the domestic court for such a refusal was that the applicant had no right to such materials, children ’ s services being the judge ’ s auxiliary (see paragraph 77 above). The Court is not persuaded by this reasoning and no other compelling reasons supporting their refusal to provide the video recordings have been put forward. However, it notes that nine months later the parties ’ requests for CTU recordings and all relevant documentation had been granted (see paragraph 10 4 above), thus, the first applicant could make use of such relevant information for the purposes of the proceedings which were still ongoing. Thus, the initial refusal cannot suffice to conclude that the State failed to comply with its positive obligations to ensure respect for the first applicant ’ s private and family life."

It demonstrates very clearly the extent of the difference between the applicant ’ s treatment on Asinara and classic detention in prison or strict arrest imposed on a serviceman (see the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, p. 26, par. 63). Deprivation of liberty may, however, take numerous other forms. Their variety is being increased by developments in legal standards and in attitudes; and the Convention is to be interpreted in the light of the notions currently prevailing in democratic States (see notably the Tyrer judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, pp. 15-16, par. 31).",
                "Whilst the area around which the applicant could move far exceeded the dimensions of a cell and was not bounded by any physical barrier, it covered no more than a tiny fraction of an island to which access was difficult and about nine-tenths of which was occupied by a prison. Mr. Guzzardi was housed in part of the hamlet of Cala Reale which consisted mainly of the buildings of a former medical establishment which were in a state of disrepair or even dilapidation, a carabinieri station, a school and a chapel. He lived there principally in the company of other persons subjected to the same measure and of policemen. The permanent population of Asinara resided almost entirely at Cala d ’ Oliva, which Mr. Guzzardi could not visit, and would appear to have made hardly any use of its right to go to Cala Reale. Consequently, there were few opportunities for social contacts available to the applicant other than with his near family, his fellow \"residents\" and the supervisory staff. Supervision was carried out strictly and on an almost constant basis. Thus, Mr. Guzzardi was not able to leave his dwelling between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. without giving prior notification to the authorities in due time. He had to report to the authorities twice a day and inform them of the name and number of his correspondent whenever he wished to use the telephone. He needed the consent of the authorities for each of his trips to Sardinia or the mainland, trips which were rare and, understandably, made under the strict supervision of the carabinieri. He was liable to punishment by \"arrest\" if he failed to comply with any of his obligations. Finally, more than sixteen months elapsed between his arrival at Cala Reale and his departure for Force (see paragraphs 11, 12, 21, 23-42 and 51 above).",
                "It is admittedly not possible to speak of \"deprivation of liberty\" on the strength of any one of these factors taken individually, but cumulatively and in combination they certainly raise an issue of categorisation from the viewpoint of Article 5 (art. 5). In certain respects the treatment complained of resembles detention in an \"open prison\" or committal to a disciplinary unit (see the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, p. 26, par. 64). On 20 January 1976, the Milan Regional Court had let it be understood that it did not regard that treatment as satisfactory. The administrative authorities also had some misgivings for they investigated the possibility of taking remedial measures; since they did not pursue the matter in the face of the expense involved and the time needed, the Ministry of the Interior decided in August 1977 to strike Asinara out of the list of places for compulsory residence (see paragraphs 2 0 and 43 above). Two telegrams from the Ministry to the Milan Chief of Police, dated 19 and 23 August 1977 and concerning one Alberti Gerlando, establish that this decision was not unconnected with application no 7367/76 even though Mr. Guzzardi had already left Cala Reale; the Government appended these telegrams to their memorial of May 1980. Several items of the documentary evidence filed thus show that the island was not suitable for a normal application of the 1956 and 1965 Acts. This was eventually recognised by the Italian State.",

The report referred to indications that although the applicant claimed to be working in the building trade, he was actually engaged in illegal activities and belonged to a band ( cosca ) of mafiosi; it listed four convictions pronounced against him in 1965, 1967, 1969 and 1972 and described him as \"one of the most dangerous\" of individuals.",
                "Following an application made in accordance with this recommendation by the State prosecutor on 14 January 1975, the Milan Regional Court (2nd Criminal Chamber) directed on 30 January that Mr. Guzzardi be placed under special supervision for three years, the measure to be combined with the obligation to reside \"in the district ( comune ) of the island of Asinara\", a locality that had been designated by the Ministry of the Interior. In its decision the Court further directed that the applicant should:",

                "In a memorial of 10 February 1975, his lawyer, Mr. Catalano, challenged the decision on a number of grounds, alleging that it was invalid and unjustified. He submitted, in particular, that on Asinara his client could neither find employment nor live together with his wife and child; there was thus an inconsistency between the reasoning and the operative provisions of the decision of 30 January. In addition, the decision referred to a non-existent district since in point of fact the island was no more than a sub-division of the district of Porto Torres ( Sardinia ). Mr. Catalano requested the Court of Appeal, in the first place, to quash the decision in its entirety; in the alternative, to limit it to special supervision without an order for compulsory residence; in the further alternative, to designate a district in Northern Italy where the applicant might find work, live with his family, meet with his lawyer in order to prepare his defence in the criminal proceedings and attend, as and when necessary, an urological clinic to receive the treatment required by his state of health."

                "However, on 14 February the prosecuting authorities requested the Court of Appeal to revoke or suspend the aforesaid order. They pointed out that during his detention on remand Mr. Guzzardi had refused to submit to analyses in the University of Milan urological clinic; that experts considered that he was probably not suffering from any serious illness; that his covert intention was to use hospitalisation as a means of escape; that section 3 of the 1956 Act did not prohibit an order for compulsory residence in a given locality within a district; that the Court of Cassation had so held in two judgments, one of which concerned precisely the island of Asinara, which was, besides, \"potentially\" one of the best places in Italy for tourism.",

In his view, his client was physically and mentally a prisoner ( carcerato ) on Asinara; he was vegetating there in conditions worse than those of his detention on remand.

As regards Mr. Guzzardi ’ s health and the absence of violation of section 3 of the 1956 Act, the Court of Appeal relied in substance on the arguments that had already been invoked by the prosecuting authorities on 14 February (see paragraph 14 above, second sub-paragraph). It found no good reason for regarding Asinara as an unsuitable locality for compulsory residence. It emphasised that the contested measure was designed to separate the individual from his milieu and render his contacts with it more difficult. This requirement took precedence over other problems, such as the absence of regular employment and of adequate accommodation for a family; moreover, at the time of his marriage the applicant could not have hoped to live with his wife and son since he was then in detention on remand and under a serious charge. His criminal record, the most disquieting criminal activities in which he engaged under the cloak of honesty, his violent character and his exceptional cunning showed that he presented a marked danger to society ( spiccata pericolosità sociale ). Supervision of such an individual was sufficiently important to justify the curtailment of other individual legal interests taken into account by the law ( l ’ affievolimento di alter situazioni giuridiche soggettive che la legge prende in considerazione )."

                "(i) It was not permissible under section 3 of the 1956 Act to make an order for a person ’ s compulsory residence - which amounted to subjecting him to a \"judicial sanction\" limiting his private and family liberty ( libertà privata e famigliare ) - on any scrap of land ( qualunque pezzo di terra), such as Asinara, regardless of its area ( quali che siano i metri quadrati entro cui si deve osservare il soggiorno ), rather than on the whole of the territory of a district. The contrary interpretation adopted by the Court of Appeal was \"restrictive and aberrant\" and disregarded a man ’ s right to private and family life ( alla vita privata e famigliare ) which was guaranteed by the European Convention and the Italian Constitution. If the Court of Cassation were nevertheless inclined to follow that interpretation, it should refer the matter to the Constitutional Court.",
                "(ii) The Court of Appeal ’ s statement that Mr. Guzzardi did not need any particular medical treatment was a misrepresentation of the facts ( travisamento dei fatti ).",
                "The law did not permit any curtailment of legal interests which it protected, conferred and made mandatory (non consent[iva] veruno affievolimento di situazioni giuridiche tutelate, volute e pretese proprio dalla legge ). It followed that the Court of Appeal had applied the law incorrectly (errata applicazione della legge ) when it held that the necessity for special supervision justified such curtailment.",
                "(iii) Finally, the reasoning was contradictory ( contraddittorietà ) in various respects. Thus, the Court of Appeal had - without an investigation on the spot - deemed Asinara to be suitable for the execution of the measure complained of although the applicant would not there be able to comply with the directives contained in the Milan Regional Court ’ s decision.",

Likewise, the \"curtailment\" of, and the \"undoubted limitations\" on, \"various rights of the individual concerned\" stemmed directly from the application of measures which had on numerous occasions been recognised to be in conformity with the Constitution, for example in a judgment delivered by the Constitutional Court on 15 June 1972.",

First of all, it affirmed that the implementation of preventive measures was a matter within the competence of the police authorities ( pubblica sicurezza ) and not of the judge supervising the execution of sentences. It added that exigencies of the protection of society justified the special form of isolation undergone by those sent to Asinara, namely individuals who were extremely dangerous.

In order to bring a case before the Commission, a \"person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals\" must claim to be the victim \"of a violation ... of the rights set forth in [the] Convention\".

However, Mr. Guzzardi initially invoked only Articles 3, 8 and 9 (art. 3, art. 8, art. 9) of the Convention and Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2) (see paragraph 53 above). Whilst the characterisation in law to be given to a contested measure was a matter for the trial judge, the Commission had overlooked another general principle, that is to say the obligation to limit the decision to facts adduced by the litigant. In order to find a violation of Article 5 (art. 5), the Commission had relied on circumstances which Mr. Catalano had mentioned neither in his first letter, dated 17 November 1975, nor in the application form and explanatory memorandum of 30 January 1976, those circumstances being the restriction to 2.5 sq. km. of the area reserved for persons in compulsory residence, the almost permanent supervision, the impossibility of making social contacts and the length of the compulsory residence.

This was so, for example, as regards the designation of the district where the person was to reside: the court merely \"took formal notice\" of the place \"specified\" by the administrative authority and, subject where necessary to a review of lawfulness, \"recorded\" the latter ’ s choice.

They criticised the applicant for not having challenged before the courts the compatibility of the 1956 and 1965 Acts with the first two paragraphs of Article 13 of the Italian Constitution, these being paragraphs which were said to correspond to Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention (see the written observations of 3 September 1976, 21 January 1977 and 21 February 1977). They repeated this objection on later occasions, and finally in their memorial of 15 March 1978 to the Commission (at pages 17 to 19), which was appended to their memorial of December 1979 to the Court."

The submission summarised at paragraph 65 above were not put to the Commission by the Government until the memorials and oral pleadings of 8 February, 9 February and 15 March 1978. Nevertheless, certain passages in the application form of 30 January 1976 and on other written statements by Mr. Catalano might have led the Government to believe that the application was challenging the compulsory residence order as such and, indirectly, the 1956 and 1965 Acts (see the Government ’ s observations of 3 September 1976, at pp. 9 and 14; of 21 January 1977, at pp. 2 and 4; of 21 February 1977, at p. 1). The admissibility decision (see paragraph 5 of the section entitled \"The law\" and item 2 of the operative provisions) and subsequently a letter dated 14 March 1977 to the parties (see paragraph 5 of the report) showed that the Commission \"was [primarily] interested in the living conditions\" at Cala Reale, \"the situation complained of\" by Mr. Guzzardi. The decision and the letter would appear to have prompted the Government to supplement their initial argument in order to adapt it to the Commission ’ s approach (see, mutatis mutandis, paragraph 59 above). Developing a case in this way is not, in the circumstances, incompatible with the requirements of a proper administration of justice (see the above-mentioned Artico judgment, pp. 13-14, par. 27); there is accordingly no estoppel.",

Consequently, the question whether the first branch of the preliminary objection is substantiated concerns solely the alleged breach of Article 5 (art. 5) (see the above-mentioned De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment, p. 31, par. 55)."

In January 1975, at the outset of the procedure ordering compulsory residence, the applicant could not yet claim that he was deprived of his liberty by reason of the 1956 and 1965 Acts; for he was still in detention on remand in connection with criminal investigations being carried out in his respect, he did not know whether the Milan Regional Court would approve the State prosecutor ’ s proposal and he had no personal experience of the fate of individuals sent to Cala Reale (see paragraphs 9, 10 and 12 above).",
                "On the other hand, as soon as he had arrived on Asinara, he did complain to the Court of Appeal of his situation on that island which, according to him, was not suitable for a proper application of the 1956 and 1965 Acts. He asserted that he was physically and psychologically a prisoner on Asinara and was vegetating there in conditions worse than those of his detention on remand. He even described Cala Reale as a \"veritable concentration camp\". He requested that an investigation be carried out on the spot and invited the Court of Appeal to quash in its entirety the first instance decision of 30 January 1975; in the alternative to limit it to special supervision without an order for compulsory residence; in the further alternative, to direct that he be transferred to a district in Northern Italy (see paragraphs 13 and 16 above).",
                "The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on 12 March 1975. It found no good reason for regarding Asinara as an unsuitable locality for compulsory residence. It emphasised that the contested measure was designed to separate Mr. Guzzardi from his milieu and render his contacts with it more difficult. This requirement took precedence over other problems. Supervision of an individual as dangerous as the applicant was sufficiently important to justify the curtailment of other individual legal interests taken into account by the law (see paragraph 17 above).",
                "Mr. Guzzardi then appealed to the Court of Cassation. In his memorial of 3 April 1975 (see paragraph 18 above), he asked that Court, inter alia, to hold, if need be after referring the matter to the Constitutional Court, that section 3 of the 1956 Act and in any event the Constitution did not permit compulsory residence to be ordered on any scrap of land, regardless of its area, such as Asinara. The appeal was dismissed on 6 October 1975.",

                "The Court does not agree with this view. Admittedly, it is for each Contracting State to establish appropriate courts and tribunals, to set the limits on their jurisdiction and to lay down the conditions for bringing cases before them. However, Article 26 (art. 26), which refers to \"the generally recognised rules of international law\", should be applied with a certain degree of flexibility and without excessive regard for matters of form (see the Stögmüller judgment of 10 November 1969, Series A no. 9, p. 42, par. 11; the above-mentioned Ringeisen judgment, pp. 37-38, par. 89 and 92; the Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 17, 29 in fine; the Commission ’ s decision of 11 January 1961 on the admissibility of application no. 788/60, Austria v. Italy, Yearbook of the Convention, vol. 4,",
                "Both on appeal and in cassation Mr. Guzzardi complained of a series of factors which, taken together, could in the Court ’ s opinion be regarded as a deprivation of liberty. He did not, it is true, rely expressly on Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention; he confined himself to mentioning the Convention as a whole in the general context of the living conditions at Cala Reale. However, a more specific reference was not essential in the circumstances since it did not constitute the sole means of achieving the aim pursued. Before the Italian courts, the applicant adduced arguments such as to show that the manner in which the 1956 Act had been applied to him resulted in the measures restricting an individual ’ s liberty authorised by that Act being transformed into a veritable deprivation of liberty suffered in a locality which he went so far as to describe as a concentration camp in which he was imprisoned. He therefore derived from the Italian legislation pleas equivalent, in the Court ’ s view, to an allegation of a breach of the right guaranteed by Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention (see paragraph 71 above). In so doing, he provided the national courts, in particular the Court of Appeal, with the opportunity which is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by Article 26 (art. 26), namely the opportunity of putting right the violations alleged against them (see the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 29, par. 50; the Airey judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 10, par. 18). If his appeal to the Court of Cassation proved unsuccessful, on account of the impossibility of emphasising the issue of deprivation of liberty with the degree of precision called for, this was probably due to the limits on the powers of that Court: having jurisdiction on issues of law, it could scarcely take cognisance as an issue of fact of the situation obtaining on Asinara nor find in the decision of the Court of Appeal any material on which it could determine whether there existed a condition of detention incompatible with Italian law, of which the Convention forms an integral part."

The Court of Appeal, after instructing its registry to obtain information from the carabinieri in Sassari, came to the conclusion that neither the applicant ’ s state of health nor any other good reason caused Asinara to be unsuitable as a place for compulsory residence; the Court explained in detail why it judged a \"curtailment of ... individual legal interests taken into account by the law\" to be warranted on the facts (see paragraphs 14, 15 and 17 above). The Court of Cassation, for its part, accepted the submissions of the public prosecutor and dismissed the appeal as being devoid of foundation rather than inadmissible (see paragraph 19 above).",
                "According to the Commission ’ s Delegates, the designation of the district for compulsory residence, despite its character as an administrative act, emanated from the courts even though they normally made their decision on the basis of proposals from the Ministry of the Interior. On the other hand, the Government maintained that in this connection the courts confined themselves to recording the choice effected by the administrative authorities, subject to reviewing its lawfulness. Be that as it may, an irregularity may stem from the factual conditions prevailing in the locality specified by the police; in substance this was what Mr. Guzzardi pleaded had occurred in his case.",
                "Besides, if the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation really did not have the power to exclude Asinara on account of the duty to respect the applicant ’ s physical liberty, this would simply mean, as the Commission ’ s Delegates rightly emphasised, that the remedies exercised before those courts are without relevance for the purposes of Article 26 (art. 26). In addition, the Government did not point with sufficient precision to any other legal remedy that might have been available in the matter to Mr. Guzzardi.

They further criticised him for not having challenged on appeal and then, if need be, in cassation the decision given by the Regional Court on 20 January 1976 (ibid.) This latter criticism, which was subsequently abandoned, was supplemented by another in a memorial which, being dated 21 February 1977, preceded the closure of the initial examination of admissibility (1 March 1977): the Government claimed, as they subsequently did before the Court, that the request in question was addressed to an authority lacking jurisdiction.

The first was addressed to the President of the Milan Regional Court in his capacity of judge supervising the execution of sentences and requested him to cancel the compulsory residence order; the second invited the 2nd Chamber, a collegiate body, to replace Asinara by a district that satisfied certain conditions. Both applications were dealt with on 20 January 1976, in a single decision. The Regional Court first of all declared, in contrast to an Order by the Milan Court of Appeal (dated 27 October 1975), that the implementation of preventive measures was the responsibility of the police and not of the judge supervising the execution of sentences. It did not, however, confine itself to this remark and did not decline its own jurisdiction in the matter: exigencies of the protection of society, it added, justified the special form of isolation undergone by persons residing at Cala Reale. It was apparently for this reason of substance that the Regional Court dismissed the applications (respin[s]e le istanze ), whilst letting it be understood that the applicant ’ s living conditions should be improved and directing that a copy of its decision be communicated to the Minister of the Interior and to the Sassari questore (see paragraph 20 above).",

The factors listed above were not sufficient to render the situation of persons in compulsory residence on the island comparable to the situation of prisoners as laid down by Italian law; there existed a whole series of fundamental differences that the Commission had wrongly overlooked. The distinguishing characteristic of freedom was less the amount of space available than the manner in which it could be utilised; a good many districts in Italy and elsewhere were less than 2.5 sq. km. in area. The applicant was able to leave and return to his dwelling as he wished between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. His wife and son lived with him for fourteen of the some sixteen months he spent on Asinara; the inviolability of his home and of the intimacy of his family life, two rights that the Convention guaranteed solely to free people, were respected. Even as regards his social relations, he was treated much more favourably than someone in penal detention: he was at liberty to meet, within the boundaries of Cala Reale, the members of the small community of free people - about two hundred individuals - living on the island, notably at Cala d ’ Oliva; to go to Sardinia or the mainland if so authorised; to correspond by letter or telegram without any control; to use the telephone, subject to notifying the carabiniere of the name and number of his correspondent. The supervision of which he complained constituted the raison d ’ être of the measure ordered in his respect.

                "95. The Government ’ s reasoning (see paragraph 91 above) is not without weight. It demonstrates very clearly the extent of the difference between the applicant ’ s treatment on Asinara and classic detention in prison or strict arrest imposed on a serviceman (see the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, p. 26, par. 63). Deprivation of liberty may, however, take numerous other forms. Their variety is being increased by developments in legal standards and in attitudes; and the Convention is to be interpreted in the light of the notions currently prevailing in democratic States (see notably the Tyrer judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, pp. 15-16, par. 31).",
                "Whilst the area around which the applicant could move far exceeded the dimensions of a cell and was not bounded by any physical barrier, it covered no more than a tiny fraction of an island to which access was difficult and about nine-tenths of which was occupied by a prison. Mr. Guzzardi was housed in part of the hamlet of Cala Reale which consisted mainly of the buildings of a former medical establishment which were in a state of disrepair or even dilapidation, a carabinieri station, a school and a chapel. He lived there principally in the company of other persons subjected to the same measure and of policemen. The permanent population of Asinara resided almost entirely at Cala d ’ Oliva, which Mr. Guzzardi could not visit, and would appear to have made hardly any use of its right to go to Cala Reale. Consequently, there were few opportunities for social contacts available to the applicant other than with his near family, his fellow \"residents\" and the supervisory staff. Supervision was carried out strictly and on an almost constant basis. Thus, Mr. Guzzardi was not able to leave his dwelling between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. without giving prior notification to the authorities in due time. He had to report to the authorities twice a day and inform them of the name and number of his correspondent whenever he wished to use the telephone. He needed the consent of the authorities for each of his trips to Sardinia or the mainland, trips which were rare and, understandably, made under the strict supervision of the carabinieri. He was liable to punishment by \"arrest\" if he failed to comply with any of his obligations. Finally, more than sixteen months elapsed between his arrival at Cala Reale and his departure for Force (see paragraphs 11, 12, 21, 23-42 and 51 above).",
                "It is admittedly not possible to speak of \"deprivation of liberty\" on the strength of any one of these factors taken individually, but cumulatively and in combination they certainly raise an issue of categorisation from the viewpoint of Article 5 (art. 5). In certain respects the treatment complained of resembles detention in an \"open prison\" or committal to a disciplinary unit (see the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, p. 26, par. 64). On 20 January 1976, the Milan Regional Court had let it be understood that it did not regard that treatment as satisfactory. The administrative authorities also had some misgivings for they investigated the possibility of taking remedial measures; since they did not pursue the matter in the face of the expense involved and the time needed, the Ministry of the Interior decided in August 1977 to strike Asinara out of the list of places for compulsory residence (see paragraphs 2 0 and 43 above). Two telegrams from the Ministry to the Milan Chief of Police, dated 19 and 23 August 1977 and concerning one Alberti Gerlando, establish that this decision was not unconnected with application no 7367/76 even though Mr. Guzzardi had already left Cala Reale; the Government appended these telegrams to their memorial of May 1980. Several items of the documentary evidence filed thus show that the island was not suitable for a normal application of the 1956 and 1965 Acts. This was eventually recognised by the Italian State.",

In paragraph 1 of section 1, the 1956 Act refers to \"idlers and habitual vagrants who are fit for work\", a phrase clarified by the Constitutional Court in its judgment no. 23 of 23 March 1964. In the Government ’ s opinion, the imposition on a \"vagrant\" of preventive measures restricting, or even depriving him of, his liberty was justified, under the Convention and Italian law, not so much by his lack of a fixed abode as by the absence of any apparent occupational activity (\" attività lavorativa palese \") and, hence, the impossibility of identifying the source of his means of subsistence. The existence of this danger factor, the Government continued, was recognised by the Milan Regional Court in its decision of 30 January 1975 (see paragraph 12 above); in addition and above all, that Court took notice of the far more serious risk stemming from the applicant ’ s links with mafia associations which engaged in kidnapping with a view to extracting ransoms. According to the Government, provision could not be made in an international instrument for the typically Italian phenomenon of the mafia, yet it would be an absurd conclusion to regard Article 5 par. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e) as allowing vagrants but not presumed mafiosi to be deprived of their liberty."

                "There was no reference to paragraph 1 of section 1 of the 1956 Act in either the report of 23 November 1974 of the Milan Chief of Police or the State prosecutor ’ s application of 14 January 1975 or the Regional Court ’ s decision of 30 January 1975 (see paragraph 12 above) or the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment of 12 March 1975. These authorities relied on the 1956 Act solely in combination with the 1965 Act which concerns individuals whom there are strong reasons to suspect of belonging to mafia-type associations (see paragraph 52 above). What is more, they in no way described or depicted Mr. Guzzardi as a vagrant. Admittedly, they noted, in passing, that there were serious doubts as to whether he really worked as a mason as he claimed, but they laid much greater stress on his record, his illegal activities, his contacts with habitual criminals and still more his links with the mafia. The Chief of Police even said that no state of poverty, idleness or vagrancy furnished an explanation for this criminal conduct (\"manifestazioni criminose che non hanno una causa giustificativa in uno stato di indigenza ovvero di ozio o di vagabondaggio\").",
                "Besides, the applicant ’ s way of life at the time, as disclosed by the documentary evidence filed, is in no way consonant with the ordinary meaning of the word \"vagrant\", this being the meaning that has to be utilised for Convention purposes (see the above mentioned De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment, p. 37, par. 68; cf., for the phrase \"persons of unsound mind\", the above-mentioned Winterwerp judgment, p. 17, par. 38). Although they denied it, the Government were in essence reasoning a fortiori; at the hearing of 9 February 1978 before the Commission, their Agent described Mr. Guzzardi as \"a vagrant in the wide sense of the term\", \"a monied vagrant\" (see p. 61 of the verbatim record:\" vagabondo nel senso largo dell ’ espressione \";\" vagabondo ricco \"). However, the exceptions permitted by Article 5 par. 1 (art. 5-1) call for a narrow interpretation (see the above-mentioned Winterwerp judgment, p. 16, par. 37).",
                "The Government ’ s argument is open to a further objection. In addition to vagrants, sub-paragraph (e) (art. 5-1-e) refers to persons of unsound mind, alcoholics and drug addicts. The reason why the Convention allows the latter individuals, all of whom are socially maladjusted, to be deprived of their liberty is not only that they have to be considered as occasionally dangerous for public safety but also that their own interests may necessitate their detention. One cannot therefore deduce from the fact that Article 5 (art. 5) authorises the detention of vagrants that the same or even stronger reasons apply to anyone who may be regarded as still more dangerous.",

                "It is true that there was \"reasonable suspicion of [his] having committed an offence\" and that he remained subject to charges throughout the time he spent on Asinara, but the decisions of the Regional Court (30 January 1975), the Court of Appeal (12 March 1975) and the Court of Cassation (6 October 1975) had no connection in law with the investigation being pursued in his respect: they were based on the 1956 and 1965 Acts which are applicable irrespective of whether or not there has been a charge and do not prescribe any subsequent appearance \"before the competent legal authority\" (see paragraphs 9, 11, 12, 17, 19, 21 and 45-52 above). Mr. Guzzardi ’ s detention on remand had terminated on 8 February 1975, on the expiry of the two years ’ time-limit laid down by Article 272 (first paragraph, item 2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 10 above). If - as the applicant insinuated but did not prove (see paragraph 73 in fine of the report) - the said Acts had been utilised in order to prolong the detention, it would not in that case have been \"lawful\"; whilst the French text of sub-paragraph (c), (art. 5-1-c) unlike that of sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (d), (e) and (f) (art. 5-1-a, art. 5-1-b, art. 5-1-d, art. 5-1-e, art. 5-1-f), does not contain the equivalent word\" régulière \", the English version does speak of \"lawful\" detention and the principle expressed by this adjective dominates the whole of Article 5 par. 1 (art. 5-1) (see the above-mentioned Winterwerp judgment, pp. 17-18, par. 39-40). In addition, problems might have arisen in connection with paragraph 3 of Article 5 (art. 5-3), which has to be read together with paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) (see the above-mentioned Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment, p. 75, par. 199), and even with Article 18 (art. 18).",
                "At first sight, a more likely hypothesis is that the measure complained of was taken because it was \"reasonably considered necessary to prevent [Mr. Guzzardi ’ s] committing an offence\" or, at the outside, \"fleeing after having done so\". However, in that case as well a question would arise as to the measure ’ s \"lawfulness\" since, solely on the basis of the 1956 and 1965 Acts, an order for compulsory residence as such, leaving aside the manner of its implementation, does not constitute deprivation of liberty (see paragraph 94 above). It would also be necessary to consider whether the requirements of paragraph 3 of Article 5 (art. 5-3) had been observed (see the Lawless judgment of 1 July 1961, Series A no. 3, pp. 51-53, par. 13-14). In any event, the phrase under examination is not adapted to a policy of general prevention directed against an individual or a category of individuals who, like mafiosi, present a danger on account of their continuing propensity to crime; it does no more than afford the Contracting States a means of preventing a concrete and specific offence. This can be seen both from the use of the singular (\"an offence\", \"celle-ci\" in the French text; see the Matznetter judgment of 10 November 1969, Series A no. 10, pp. 40 and 43, separate opinions of Mr. Balladore Pallieri and Mr. Zekia) and from the object of Article 5 (art. 5), namely to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of his liberty in an arbitrary fashion (see the above-mentioned Winterwerp judgment, p. 16, par. 37)."

In that connection, submitting the necessary documents to that effect, the second applicant has substantiated before the domestic authorities as well as the Court that he was a lawful resident of Germany, and that he worked as a freelance journalist. Lastly, with regard to the Government ’ s objection concerning the alleged lack of a significant disadvantage, the Court notes that the parties do not dispute the fact that the applicant was a non-resident at the material time and that his life prior to his arrest in Turkey was based in Germany. In that respect the Court considers that the effects of the travel ban on the applicant ’ s private life in so far as it prevented him from returning to his place of residence cannot be underestimated. The Court also considers that it cannot be excluded that the travel ban had pecuniary implications for the applicant. Accordingly, there are no grounds for concluding that the applicant has suffered no significant disadvantage."

                "93. In the present case, the Court notes that the travel ban was imposed on the second applicant after he was released from pre-trial detention, that is on 21 January 2003, as a preventive measure in lieu of detention. On that date he was prohibited from leaving Turkey until 25 December 2006, when his conviction for membership of a terrorist organisation became final. The travel ban was lifted on 24 June 2009 on his request, after he had served his sentence. During the proceedings, the second applicant made seven applications to the domestic courts requesting that the ban be lifted, explaining each time that the measure in question prevented him from maintaining his personal and professional ties to Germany, where he resided, and asking the courts to put in place a more appropriate measure, such as bail. The courts either failed to examine them or replied to those applications each time by merely referring to the stage the proceedings were at, without making any assessment as to whether the continuing restriction, after a certain lapse of time, was still a proportionate measure in the individual circumstances of the case (see paragraph 31 above). Since the domestic courts ’ decisions contain no consideration in relation to the applicant ’ s non-resident status and the profound implications of the travel ban on his private and professional life, it cannot be said that they weighed up the competing interests at stake. They therefore failed to provide sufficient justification for the continued ban on the applicant ’ s travelling abroad which, the Court recalls, lasted almost four years."

That evidence included the flyers that had been found in İzmir, as well as the documents, books and periodicals found in the apartments of the first applicant and the other co-accused.

Having considered the structure, methods, purpose and activities of the organisation in question, the court concluded that it was a terrorist organisation, contrary to the submissions of the accused and the public prosecutor in charge of the investigation. The court found that the amendments made to section 1 of Law no. 3713, namely the inclusion of the term “ using violence and coercion ” in the definition of a terrorist organisation, did not exclude situations where an unarmed organisation adopted violence and coercion as its aim, even when its acts only amounted to “ moral coercion” ( manevi cebir ). A contrary interpretation of the provision would render its application to unarmed terrorist organisations impossible. The court noted that even though the members of the organisation had not resorted to physical violence, they had used “ moral coercion” – such as issuing threats, as was apparent from the confiscated documents – in order to achieve their aims. The court stressed that the organisation ’ s manifesto and some of the flyers contained statements which were of sufficient gravity to coerce people morally. The relevant parts of the judgment read:",

After convening in five other congresses, namely in 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, [and] in their final and last congress of 1996, they named themselves the Bolshevik Party of North Kurdistan/Turkey and declared that their aim was to bring about an armed revolution in Turkey for the leadership of the working class, and for this reason they have engaged in the acts of distributing leaflets and declarations.",

Moreover, they have distributed and sold the publications Çağrı and Güney – which can be considered the organisation ’ s legal publications – in order to support the organisation financially.",
                "The accused have denied the accusations, in particular the existence of the organisation, and in any event have stated that their acts could not be considered crimes ... since no armed acts had been committed on behalf of the organisation ... The public prosecutor submitted that the organisation in question no longer corresponded to the definition provided for by law, in the light of the recent amendments made to Law no. 3713, and requested that the accused be acquitted.",
                "Therefore, what is at issue in the present case is whether the acts of the accused correspond to the amended definition of membership of a terrorist organisation ... In considering whether an organisation qualifies as a terrorist organisation, its structure, working methods, purpose and acts must be taken into account. The amended section 1 of Law no. 3713 requires [the use of] force and violence as an element of terror. It is sufficient for an organisation to adopt force and violence as its purpose to bring [the organisation] within the scope of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Coercion may just as well present itself as moral coercion. Terror is any criminal act committed for the purpose of achieving the ultimate goals listed in section 1 of Law no. 3713. ‘ Purpose ’ as worded in this section subsumes the purpose of using violence and force, and therefore envisages [the provision being applied] to unarmed organisations. Any conclusion that is contrary to this reasoning will render the application of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to unarmed organisations impossible, which will pave the way for them to work freely towards their goal of overthrowing democracy and the Turkish Republic. In democracies, people may be given all freedoms except for the freedom to destroy democracy. Since the legislature cannot be presumed to have given licence to organisations whose purpose is to ruin and divide the State, it necessarily follows that unarmed organisations fall within the scope of the law in question.",

However, when people establish an organisation to impose their ideas on others with the aim of changing the Constitution and bringing about the cessation of the State through violence and coercion, it can be considered that the constituent element of the crime, namely moral coercion, is presumed. In the light of this general overview, it can be considered that the acts of the accused are those of disseminating propaganda for an already existing organisation by means of distributing leaflets and thereby encouraging membership. [This] evidence obtained during the investigation has clearly revealed the aim which the accused have pursued. The ultimate purpose of the accused is to change the regime of the country by overthrowing the democracy and the Republic through a popular revolution [ ... ] thereby introducing a totalitarian regime based on Marxist and Leninist ideology. [ ... ] On pages 19, 20 and 21 of the organisation ’ s manifesto ... the Turkish Republic was insulted. [The manifesto] states that Turkey occupies lands that belong to Kurdistan and Armenia, and that the Kurdish people lead a justified resistance movement in North Kurdistan against the unjust and dirty war led by the fascist Turkish Republic. The dead terrorist İbrahim Kaypakkaya is mentioned ... On the following pages, Marxist and Leninist practices are praised and the quasi-feudal capitalist system is mentioned. The last chapter contains the party ’ s disciplinary procedures ... In a declaration which carries the emblem of the Bolshevik Party of North Kurdistan /Turkey, it is stated ‘ the history of the Ottoman Empire reeks of massacres and crimes ... 1.5 million Armenians were massacred ... and the fascist Turkish army is merely a continuation of the Ottoman Empire ... the real enemy is the fascist Turkish Republic ... unite under the red flag of the Bolshevik party in order to overthrow the fascist Turkish Republic with a democratic people ’ s revolution, and wave the red flag of Bolshevism in cities, castles, farms and mountains so that we can finally throw the fascist Turkish State into the gutters of history ... ’",

However, it is not possible to quote all of them in the judgment. They have been identified individually in the present judgment under the category of written evidence. In the light of this examination, it appears that the aim of the Bolshevik Party is to change the regime and bring about the secession of part of the national territory of Northern Kurdistan. It is considered that the organisation has started working towards these aims but has not yet engaged in armed attacks.

In doing so, the court held that there had been no official information as to the existence of an organisation called AGF, and that the flyers allegedly distributed by the accused had not borne AGF ’ s letterhead. The court further commented that in order for an organisation to be classified as illegal, some conditions had to be fulfilled. Firstly, the organisation would have to adopt an illegal purpose and an action plan in order to realise its purpose. Secondly, there would have to be information or documentary evidence relating to its action plan and purpose. Lastly, in order for an organisation to qualify as a terrorist organisation within the meaning of Law no. 3713, its action plan as such would have to contain plans or reference to acts to be committed using the methods of pressure, coercion and violence, fear, intimidation and threats.

The Court of Cassation further noted in that connection that there was no judicial precedent assessing whether the organisation could be qualified as a terrorist organisation within the meaning of sections 1 and 7 of Law no. 3713.

The offences are often vaguely and/or broadly defined such as “being concerned with terrorism” or “belonging to a proscribed organisation”. In other countries, the definition of terrorism in national laws may be so broad that it encompasses a wide range of acts of differing gravity.

As it operates to criminalize activities in support of a given violent (terrorist) political movement, there is a considerable risk that it may have an overspill effect on non-violent movements which have the same political goals as the target group, but which do not advocate (terrorist) violence in obtaining these goals.

Article 7 ECHR links the principle of legality to the commission of an act or an omission; a crime should thus consist in a material behaviour. The rights of the accused, notably the right of defence, would be nullified if the suspected person could be charged on the basis of mere expressions of terrorist ideology or support for terrorism and terrorist criminal acts: no defence is possible if the charge does not relate to facts, actions or behaviour. ”"

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see Del Río Prada v.

It also sets out, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where an individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him or her criminally liable ( see G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others v. Italy [GC], nos. 1828/06 and 2 others, § 242, 28 June 2018). When speaking of “law”, Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statute law as well as case-law and implies qualitative requirements, including those of accessibility and foreseeability (see Kasymakhunov and Saybatalov v.

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain (see Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 141, ECHR 2008 ). Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, “provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen” (ibid., with further references)."

In that connection, the parties disagree as to whether moral coercion – a concept which does not exist in the text of the applicable law – can nevertheless be regarded as subsumed by the requirement of “violence and force”, which is a constituent element of a terrorist offence under the amended versions of sections 1 and 7 of Law no. 3713."

The Court observes that at the relevant time Law no. 3713 did not contain a separate definition of a terrorist organisation. Rather, the definitions of terrorism and terrorist organisation were intertwined as formulated in section 1 of the same law. In its original version, terrorism was described as any act committed by means of pressure, force and violence, terror, intimidation, oppression or threat, with one or more of the political or ideological aims listed under that section, while an organisation was simply defined as any type of association of two or more people to pursue a common goal. In the amended 2003 version of section 1, it appears that the term “using force and violence” is referred separately from the methods of terrorism. The emphasis is put on the commission of an act through the use of force and violence and a further element – namely the impugned acts committed by members of such an organisation being criminal in nature – has been introduced. Moreover, it is no longer possible to call an association of two or more people a terrorist organisation unless their purpose of coming together is to pursue the commission of a terrorist offence."

The Government have made the argument that the applicants ’ conviction was foreseeable in accordance with the original versions of sections 1 and 7 of Law no. 3713 – in force at the time the offences were committed – given that those provisions had in any event defined terrorism in a broader sense. The Court is unable to agree with that argument on the basis of the following observations. First, the principle that more lenient provisions of criminal law must be applied retrospectively is implicitly guaranteed by Article 7 of the Convention. That principle is embodied in the rule that where there are differences between the criminal law in force at the time of the commission of the offence and subsequent criminal laws enacted before a final judgment is rendered, the courts must apply the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant (see, mutatis mutandis, Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 109, 17 September 2009, and Koprivnikar v. Slovenia, no. 67503/13, § 49, 24 January 2017). The Court also notes in that connection that in Turkish criminal law, courts are required to comply with Article 7 § 2 of the Criminal Code, in accordance with which the provisions most favourable to the offender shall be applied (see also Başkaya and Okçuoğlu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 23536/94 and 24408/94, § 51, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV)."

                "65. Secondly, although the applicants were convicted under section 7(1) of Law no. 3713 before its amendment by Law no. 5532, the domestic court ’ s final decision convicting the applicants under that provision took into account the amended 2003 version of section 1 of Law no. 3713 with respect to the definition of terrorism. Accordingly, the domestic courts reached the conclusion that the element of “force and violence” had been satisfied in the light of the finding that the applicants ’ activities had constituted moral coercion since they had adopted force and violence as their goal. Furthermore, the Court notes that the domestic courts in convicting the applicants discussed at length whether the amendments made to Law no. 3713 had restricted or broadened the term “force and violence” by limiting it to armed or physical acts of violence and force. Having concluded that a restrictive interpretation would run contrary to the purpose of the law, the domestic courts held that the term “force and violence” should be interpreted broadly and include situations where violence, although not used in the ordinary physical sense, was nevertheless adopted as a goal of an organisation. Since the domestic courts themselves applied the amended version of section 1 in conjunction with the original version of section 7 to the applicants, the Court will confine its examination of the lawfulness of the applicants ’ conviction to those versions and not to those in force at the time of commission of the offence. In that respect, the Court will examine whether the domestic courts ’ broad interpretation of the text of the law in convicting the applicants was reasonably foreseeable for the purposes of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention. In so doing, the Court will have regard to whether the interpretation in question was the resultant development of a perceptible line of case-law or its application in broader circumstances was nevertheless consistent with the essence of the offence (see, inter alia, S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, §§ 36, Series A no. 335-B, and Jorgic v. Germany, no. 74613/01, §§ 101-107, ECHR 2007 ‑ III )."

The Court observes in that connection that the Government did not present the Court with a comparable case in which an association was deemed to be a terrorist organisation on the sole basis of the nature of its written declarations and despite the absence of violent acts attributable to that organisation. It further notes that the Government did not present the Court with examples of domestic case-law that made use of the concept of “ moral coercion ” in the context of terrorist offences. The only example that mentions moral coercion in the context of offences against the integrity of the State post-dates the applicants ’ conviction and in any event cannot be deemed authoritative since it was struck down by the Constitutional Court of Turkey for being incompatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on fact-specific grounds (see paragraph 46 above)."

In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the impugned concept is compatible with the essence of the offence, that is to say, invoking it in the circumstances of the case could be considered as reasonable irrespective of whether it was invoked by the domestic courts the first time."

The Court notes in that connection that the July 2003 legislative amendments to the provisions of Law no. 3713 narrowed down the definition of “terrorism” and “terrorist organisation”. Accordingly, the domestic law included several cumulative conditions for an association to be treated as a terrorist organisation. Those conditions are, inter alia : the intent to commit criminal acts; through the use of force and violence; and additional methods of pressure, terror, intimidation, oppression or threat; for one of the listed ideological or political motives. The wording of the relevant provisions of Law no. 3713 suggests that the essence of the offence of membership of a terrorist organisation is to join an association whose goal and mode of operation is to resort to the criminal use of force, violence and mass intimidation in order to advance certain political or ideological causes. The fact that the law-makers chose to single out the use of violence as a necessary means to commit terrorism in the 2003 version of section 1 of Law no. 3713 lends support to the conclusion that actual violence or the intent to use such violence is central to the definition of the offence."

It is also undisputed that there was no evidence that the organisation in question had engaged in any violent acts or that it had intended to pursue its aims through the use of force and violence or other terrorist methods. Finally, it was the first time that the domestic courts were called to determine whether the organisation could be proscribed as a terrorist organisation since there existed no judicial precedents concerning the same organisation.

Nevertheless, the Court finds relevant the case-law of the Court of Cassation that, where domestic courts are confronted with the task of assessing for the first time whether an organisation can be classified as terrorist, they must carry out a thorough investigation and examine the nature of the organisation by scrutinising its purpose, whether it has adopted an action plan or similar operational measures, and whether it has resorted to violence or a credible threat to use violence in pursuing that action plan (see paragraphs 42 and 45 above)."

In that respect, the domestic courts relied on the information note prepared by the Security Directorate, which considered the organisation in question a Marxist-Leninist illegal organisation whose ultimate aim was to bring about an armed revolution in Turkey. The domestic courts also relied on the flyers distributed in the streets of İzmir, as well as the organisation ’ s manifesto discovered in a co-accused ’ s apartment, and found that the views expressed therein, because of their objectionable character, amounted to moral coercion of the public, therefore fulfilling the requirement of force and violence for the purposes of sections 1 and 7 of Law no. 3713."

In that respect, while the domestic courts held that the organisation in question had not engaged in any armed attacks, they did not address the question whether the organisation had adopted an action plan or similar operational measures for such a purpose. In this connection, the Court notes that there is no indication in the case-file that the organisation in question, beyond the mere proclamation of certain goals, had adopted any concrete preparatory steps or indeed any form of action with a view to carrying out violent acts.

In that respect, the Court reiterates that it is not in itself questionable that the State may apply various preventive measures restricting the liberty of an accused in order to ensure the efficient conduct of a criminal prosecution; such measures may include deprivation of liberty (see, for example, Makedonski v. Bulgaria, no. 36036/04, § 39, 20 January 2011 ). In principle, a ban on leaving the country is a minimally intrusive measure involving a restriction of one ’ s liberty. However, it is evident that a travel ban imposed on a non-resident of the country where the proceedings take place has more serious consequences on the effective enjoyment of the right to respect for private and family life than that imposed on a resident. While a resident can go on about his daily life and resume social and professional activities without significant difficulties during the period the travel ban is enforced, a non - resident whose life has been established elsewhere will suffer a major disruption in their private and professional lives. Therefore, it is all the more necessary for such measure to be justified on the basis of an individualised approach from the outset and throughout its duration. Accordingly, the domestic authorities reviewing the measure should take account of all the factors involved by means of a periodic and individual assessment (see, mutatis mutandis, Riener, cited above, § 124). An automatic blanket ban imposed on an individual without an assessment of the fair balance test falls foul of the procedural obligations of the State inherent in Article 8 of the Convention."

                "93. In the present case, the Court notes that the travel ban was imposed on the second applicant after he was released from pre-trial detention, that is on 21 January 2003, as a preventive measure in lieu of detention. On that date he was prohibited from leaving Turkey until 25 December 2006, when his conviction for membership of a terrorist organisation became final. The travel ban was lifted on 24 June 2009 on his request, after he had served his sentence. During the proceedings, the second applicant made seven applications to the domestic courts requesting that the ban be lifted, explaining each time that the measure in question prevented him from maintaining his personal and professional ties to Germany, where he resided, and asking the courts to put in place a more appropriate measure, such as bail. The courts either failed to examine them or replied to those applications each time by merely referring to the stage the proceedings were at, without making any assessment as to whether the continuing restriction, after a certain lapse of time, was still a proportionate measure in the individual circumstances of the case (see paragraph 31 above). Since the domestic courts ’ decisions contain no consideration in relation to the applicant ’ s non-resident status and the profound implications of the travel ban on his private and professional life, it cannot be said that they weighed up the competing interests at stake. They therefore failed to provide sufficient justification for the continued ban on the applicant ’ s travelling abroad which, the Court recalls, lasted almost four years."

Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, § 128, 23 May 2006 ), because, even if justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual's freedom of movement may become disproportionate if it is extended over a long period (see, mutatis mutandis, Gochev, cited above, § 49, with further references). On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from Germany (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above ). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas – with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) – the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, § 66, 3 November 2005 ). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 31, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v. Italy, no. 19675/06, §§ 19 and 49, 20 April 2010 ).

In the court's view, at that stage, when the proceedings had already lasted twelve years and thus exceeded a reasonable time, it was no longer justified to turn down the applicant's requests for permission to travel. The court reviewed the applicant's conduct between 1992 and 1998 and concluded that he had not tried to evade justice. It went on to say that in relying on the gravity of the charges against him the lower court had acted in breach of the presumption of innocence. The only relevant factor in that respect was the conduct of the accused during the proceedings. The court noted that the applicant had not obstructed the proceedings against him in any way since his release from detention, that the evidence against him was contradictory and that his family life had suffered serious disruption on account of a measure which could not be maintained forever. It also held that to allow the applicant to travel to Germany would not create a risk of his evading, because he could be re-arrested and extradited.

On 12 January 2004 the Veliko Tarnovo Court of Appeal upheld the lower court's decision, saying that the seriousness of the charges against the applicant, coupled with his two previous convictions, showed that he was a dangerous individual.

On the same day the Pleven Regional Court rejected it, observing that there was no indication that the separation between the applicant and his wife had not predated his extradition.

Such a measure was envisaged by the Code of Criminal Procedure. It was not mandatory but at the discretion of the prosecuting authorities, if they felt that there was a risk that the accused might flee abroad. It was not absolute either, because the accused could be granted permission to travel on specific occasions, if he or she made such a request. The prosecuting authorities'refusal to grant such permission was subject to judicial review. In carrying out that review the court had to have regard to the reasons given by the prosecuting authorities and the grounds relied on by the accused, taking into account the risk of flight abroad. Thus, a refusal to grant permission would be unlawful if the accused wished to travel abroad for medical treatment or on business. In the latter case, a refusal would have to be subjected to very close scrutiny, because it could cause the accused pecuniary damage. The applicant had been prohibited from travelling abroad because he had been prosecuted for murder, had sought to evade justice and had been extradited from Germany. His case was therefore different from Gochev v. Bulgaria ( no. 34383/03, 26 November 2009 ) and Baumann v. France ( no. 33592/96, ECHR 2 001 ‑ V (extracts)).

Indeed, he had been allowed to travel to Germany once and had returned to Bulgaria in time for the next scheduled hearing in his trial. However, only one of his many requests for permission to travel abroad had been granted. In refusing his other requests, the courts had relied on flawed arguments, such as the possibility for his family to settle in Bulgaria, and the possibility for him to support them in Germany on the very low salary that he could expect to earn in Bulgaria. The refusals which followed his return from Germany in the autumn of 2003 in time for the next trial hearing were particularly hard to explain."

Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, § 128, 23 May 2006 ), because, even if justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual's freedom of movement may become disproportionate if it is extended over a long period (see, mutatis mutandis, Gochev, cited above, § 49, with further references). On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from Germany (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above ). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas – with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) – the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, § 66, 3 November 2005 ). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 31, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v.

As can be seen from the bulk of their rulings, they were essentially content to rely on the justification that the applicant stood accused of a serious offence carrying a severe penalty and he had been extradited from Germany. With two notable exceptions – the decisions of 26 August 2003 and 28 February 2005 – they treated as irrelevant, or did not even mention, many of his arguments that had a direct bearing on the justification for the measure (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 37 above). An analogy may be drawn with the Court's case ‑ law under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, where the national courts'failure to address such arguments when examining requests for release from pre ‑ trial detention is regarded as highly problematic (see, among other authorities, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, §§ 58 and 61, ECHR 1999 ‑ II, and Bochev v. Bulgaria, no. 73481/01, §§ 64 and 65, 13 November 2008 ). In the Court's view, the domestic courts'stance stripped the remedy of its effectiveness."

However, as to the allegation that the remedy was not effective because on one occasion the Veliko Tarnovo Court of Appeal held that no appeal lay against the trial court's refusal to grant permission to travel (see paragraph 29 in fine above), the Court observes that the applicant could have challenged that ruling before the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraph 45 in fine above)."

As to the renewed ban, which started on 27 June 2007, the Court notes that the applicant's appeal against the court order imposing the ban was declared inadmissible – apparently erroneously in terms of Bulgarian law – on the ground that no appeal lay against it (see paragraphs 40 and 46 above). However, it remained open to the applicant to ask the same court to lift the ban (see paragraph 46 above), which he did successfully in March 2008 (see paragraph 41 above). There is nothing to suggest that an earlier application would have been less likely to succeed. Given that in certain circumstances the aggregate of remedies provided by national law may satisfy the requirements of Article 13 (see Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 77, Series A no. 116, and Glas Nadezhda EOOD and Elenkov v.

None of these matters seems to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant ’ s requests and appeals. On the contrary, the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on the risk that the applicant would abscond, a risk which must have receded in view of the amount of time which passed and the apparent inaction of the authorities conducting the proceedings. Furthermore, the authorities did not consider whether the applicant ’ s presence continued to be necessary after so many years of investigation. It is true that in August 2006 the applicant received permission to travel abroad on particular dates (see paragraph 23 above). Although she did not provide information on the reasons which motivated the grant of permission, the Court cannot but note that it was given after the ban had been applied for four years and shortly before the expiration of the statutory prescription, when it must have become clear that the proceedings stood little chance of ending with a final judgment."

None of these matters seems to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant ’ s requests and appeals. On the contrary, the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on the risk that the applicant would abscond, a risk which must have receded in view of the amount of time which passed and the apparent inaction of the authorities conducting the proceedings. Furthermore, the authorities did not consider whether the applicant ’ s presence continued to be necessary after so many years of investigation. It is true that in August 2006 the applicant received permission to travel abroad on particular dates (see paragraph 23 above). Although she did not provide information on the reasons which motivated the grant of permission, the Court cannot but note that it was given after the ban had been applied for four years and shortly before the expiration of the statutory prescription, when it must have become clear that the proceedings stood little chance of ending with a final judgment."

The second applicant had been granted such leave with undue delay, as confirmed by the letter of the acting district prosecutor. Consequently, their son had not been able to attend the interview and had had to sit the exams several days later. On that occasion the second applicant had accompanied him.

In the Court's view, an obligation not to leave the area of one's residence is a minimal intrusive measure involving a restriction of one's liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Nagy v.

In order to decide whether a fair balance was struck between the general interest in the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings and the applicants'personal interest in enjoying freedom of movement, by contrast to Luordo and the subsequent cases against Italy, the Court must ascertain whether the applicants actually sought to leave the area of their residence and, if so, whether permission to do so was refused."

The Court notes in this regard that the letter of the acting district prosecutor provides no evidence that such an application had been filed. The letter merely states that on the relevant dates the second applicant had been summoned to the Prosecutor's Office. In the absence of any evidence that the applicants had filed any other applications to leave the place of their residence and, consequently, that any such applications had been refused, the Court can not reach the conclusion that a fair balance between the demands of the general interest and the applicants'rights was upset.

It would be artificial to separate these parts of the applicants ’ criminal trial from the remainder of the criminal proceedings in their entirety.

On both occasions the prosecution opposed these decisions and successfully appealed against them to the Kyiv City Court. The Court recalls the Government ’ s submissions in the case of Salov v. Ukraine that the proceedings at issue concerned a “dispute between a prosecutor and the court and the applicant had not been a party to it” (see no. 65518/01, § 72, 6 September 2005 ). In their observations in the present case the Government stated that the applicants “supported” the decision of 22 June 1998 and “did not oppose” that of 20 April 2000. The secondary role of the applicants in these proceedings is further demonstrated by the fact that they, unlike the prosecution, had no right of appeal against the court ’ s decisions to remit the case for further investigation (see paragraph 20 above). Moreover, on both occasions, once the Kyiv City Court quashed the decisions to reinstitute the investigation in the case, the case-file was remitted to the trial court with considerable delays. The Court, therefore, finds that the State authorities were the masters of the proceedings which caused the unnecessary prolongation of the trial for five months in June-November 1998 and for one year in April 2000 – April 2001."

This pattern was followed in subsequent cases, where the duration of an obligation not to leave one ’ s place of residence varied from 13 years 6 months (see Goffi v.

The Convention permits States, in certain circumstances, to apply preventive measures restricting the liberty of an accused in order to ensure the efficient conduct of a criminal prosecution, including a deprivation of liberty. In the Court ’ s view, an obligation not to leave an area of residence is a proportionate restriction on an accused ’ s liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Nagy v.

The Court observes that the Supreme Court, using an extraordinary remedy, quashed the contested administrative decision of 11 December 2002 and the subsequent judgments on the grounds that the matter had been examined by a police officer acting in excess of his powers and that the courts had shifted the burden of proof onto the applicant in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence. It has thus been acknowledged that the impugned measure was not “in accordance with the law”. This finding makes it unnecessary to determine whether it pursued a legitimate aim and was necessary in a democratic society (see Gartukayev v. Russia, no. 71933/01, § 21, 13 December 2005 )."

The Government maintained that on 23 August 2004 the applicant had been refused entry into Russia on grounds that fell outside the scope of the Town Court's judgment of 28 October 2003. His admission had been refused on the basis of Article 55 of the Russian Constitution with a view to protecting constitutional principles, public morals and health, the rights and lawful interests of others, and ensuring the defence and security of the State."

When the Federal Security Service issued a decision in December 2002 banning his re-entry into Russia, the ground for that decision must have been the breach of residence regulations he had allegedly committed on 11 December 2002. However, after the Town and Supreme Courts determined that that breach had never occurred and ordered that the Passports and Visas Department issue him with a residence permit, there had been no lawful basis for his detention at Nalchik Airport and deportation from Russia in August 2004. The applicant considered that the developments in the case should be considered in their entirety, for his deportation in August 2004 had been a consequence of previous violations of his rights."

France, no. 33933/96, §§ 66-67, ECHR 2000-IX). A decision or measure favourable to the applicant is in principle not sufficient to deprive him of his status as a “ victim ” in the absence of such acknowledgement and redress ( see Constantinescu v.

In its decision as to the admissibility of the present application of 8 July 2004, the Court noted the Supreme Court's acknowledgement of the fact that the decision of 11 November 2002, by which the applicant had been fined for a breach of residence regulations, had lacked a sufficient evidentiary basis and had also been procedurally defective (see paragraph 29 above). The Court was not satisfied, however, that the applicant had been afforded adequate redress for the acknowledged violation of his right to liberty of movement. In particular, no compensation had been awarded and his residence permit had not been extended and made available to him. In those circumstances, the Court dismissed the Government's challenge to the applicant's status as a “victim” of the alleged violations."

The Town Court acknowledged that the decision annulling the applicant's residence permit had been unlawful and the domestic authorities issued the applicant with a new permit valid for five years (see paragraphs 30 and 32 - 33 above). That permit would normally have been sufficient for the applicant to return to Russia and to continue his lawful residence on its territory. That did not happen, however, because in August 2004 the Border Control prevented the applicant from crossing the Russian border and put him on the next outbound flight."
            ],

                "60. The Government invited the Court to consider that there existed two distinct grounds for the applicant's exclusion from Russia. The first ground was his alleged violation(s) of the regulations on residence registration, which ultimately led to the annulment of his residence permit. As regards that ground, the domestic authorities had done their utmost to have the consequences of an unlawful interference effaced : they had quashed the unlawful decisions and supplied the applicant with a new residence permit. The second ground was the decision by the Federal Security Service to ban the applicant from re-entering Russia because he posed a threat to the defensive capacity and security of the State. On the basis of that decision the applicant had been forbidden from crossing the Russian border in August 2004."
            ],
            [
                "61. The Court is not convinced by the distinction drawn by the Government. Firstly, it is impossible to establish the factual grounds on which the Federal Security Service's decision was founded because the Government have refused to provide a copy of it, citing security considerations (see paragraph 38 above). They have not furnished any information concerning the factual grounds for the decision. Secondly, as regards the legal grounds, the Court considers it anomalous that the decision of December 2002 should have been founded on a legal provision ( section 25.10) that only became effective in January 2003 ( see paragraphs 38 and 49 above). Thirdly, the exact date of the decision has not been indicated and no explanation has been given as to why its existence was mentioned for the first time on 25 October 2004, in the Government's observations on the merits, almost two years after it had allegedly been issued. No reference to that decision was made in the domestic proceedings concerning the applicant's deportation on 7 August 2003 or in the “deportation record ” of 25 August 2004. It has never been notified to the applicant or his representative. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the accuracy of the Government's submissions, in so far as they sought to rely on that decision by the Federal Security Service, is open to doubt. Even assuming that the decision of December 2002 did exist, the Government's refusal to furnish a copy of it prevents the Court from formulating its own conclusions regarding its contents. The applicant's contention that the grounds for that decision were the same as those on which his residence permit had been revoked might appear plausible. The Court will therefore assume that the refusal of entry to the applicant in August 2004 was connected with the preceding events and was relevant for the determination of his status as a “victim” of the alleged violation."

There is no indication that the applicant was ever suspected or convicted of any other offence, whether criminal or administrative. As noted above, it appears probable that the decision of the Federal Security Service barring the applicant's re-entry into Russia might have been issued in connection with his repeated failure to abide by the residence regulations. Although the domestic courts subsequently established that the applicant had not committed the administrative offence imputed to him and the residence permit was re-issued, the decision by the Federal Security Service was never revoked. On the contrary, the Government stated, in their submissions, that the possibility of revoking the residence permit on the basis of that decision was being examined (see paragraph 40 above). As a consequence, the legal obstacles to the applicant's lawful residence have not been removed, which has rendered the implementation of his right to liberty of movement merely theoretical rather than practical and effective as required by the Convention ( see Artico v. Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, § 3 3 )."

Denmark, judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, § 45). Accordingly, in the present case the Court has to ascertain whether the interference with the applicant's right to liberty of movement was “in accordance with the law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in paragraph 3 of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 and was “necessary in a democratic society” or, where it applies to particular areas only, was “justified by the public interest in a democratic society” as established in paragraph 4 (see Timishev v.

It has thus been acknowledged that the impugned measure was not “in accordance with the law”.

In their internal legal orders, the Contracting States make the rights to vote and to stand for election subject to conditions which are not in principle precluded under Article 3. They have a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere, but it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of this provision of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see the following judgments: Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, p. 23, § 52; Gitonas and Others v. Greece, 1 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, p. 1 233, § 39; Ahmed and Others v. the United Kingdom, 2 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2384, § 75; Labita v.

It is therefore appropriate to reimburse only in part the costs and expenses alleged by the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Sakkopoulos v. Greece, no. 61828/00, § 59, 15 January 2004 ).

His arrest and the criminal proceedings against him were therefore unlawful. Moreover, his arrest had been in breach of Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 144 below). The alleged risk that he would flee was not supported by concrete evidence, and was belied by his repeated appearances before the investigating authorities and his public pledge that he would cooperate with them. Also, he had been out of Georgia many times and had not once tried to flee, including after the opening of the investigation. On the day of his arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning. There had therefore been no need to detain him without a judicial warrant. The alleged risk of his obstructing the investigation was also not specifically borne out. Moreover, the investigation had already lasted several months without any instances of his having interfered with it being reported.

In particular, by law only acting, not former, members of the Government had to be prosecuted by the Minister of Justice rather than a regular prosecutor. The court went on to say that there was enough information to show that there was a reasonable suspicion against the applicant and Mr Z.T. The other pre-requisites for placing the applicant in pre-trial detention were also in place. A number of investigative steps were yet to be carried out, and as was apparent from the prosecution’s request, there was a risk that the applicant would tamper with the evidence or put pressure on witnesses. That was borne out, in particular, by the applicant’s having already tried to put pressure on a witness against him. Another factor which suggested such a risk was that the applicant had for many years held high public office and was still an influential figure in some circles of Georgian society, especially bearing in mind that the charges against him related to his time in office. Many witnesses were former subordinates of his or people under his professional or personal influence. The court also agreed with the prosecution that there was a risk that the applicant would flee.

He also argued that the Kutaisi City Court had erred by not examining in detail the lawfulness of his arrest. That arrest had been in breach of Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in particular because on the day of the arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning. It was also hard to believe that the Kutaisi City Court, which had ruled on the prosecution’s request just three or four hours after it had been made, had really studied the evidence said to give rise to a reasonable suspicion against the applicant. There were no facts or information in the case file to suggest that he had committed the offences. The lower court had also expected him to disprove the risks of flight and obstruction of justice alleged by the prosecution rather than require the prosecution to establish those risks. Its finding that the applicant had put pressure on a witness ran counter to the presumption of innocence. He had never called or threatened the head of the Border Police. The Kutaisi City Court had also disregarded the fact that in the months before his arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning several times. Neither that court nor the prosecution had pointed to evidence showing that he would flee abroad. He had travelled out of Georgia many times since the investigation had been opened. The argument that his being an influential figure in some circles suggested that he could influence witnesses made it clear that he was a victim of political persecution. His character showed that there was not even a minimal risk of his fleeing, putting pressure on witnesses or destroying evidence."

On 3 February 2005 his dead body was found along with the dead body of Mr R.U., a deputy regional governor, in a flat in Tbilisi. According to the official version of the events, the two had died accidentally from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by faulty ventilation in a gas heater. The circumstances of Mr Zhvania’s death are still a subject of heated debate in Georgia, and Georgian Dream made it one of their campaign promises in the October 2012 elections to elucidate them. Shortly after those elections, in November 2012, the investigation into Mr Zhvania’s death was renewed and is apparently still pending. The applicant was questioned as a witness in the course of that renewed investigation on 21 March 2014. During the hearing before the Grand Chamber, the Government stated that while no one had asked the applicant anything about Mr Zhvania’s death on 14 December 2013, there was still a “huge question” to him in relation to that death, in view of the lack of credibility of the version that he had put forward at the time when it had happened: that it had been due to an accident."

Mr G.Ts. also stated that during his stay in Prison no. 9 a prison officer had told him about the applicant’s removal from his cell.

It held, among other things, that the prosecution against him was politically motivated. It based that finding on the fact that even though the Georgian court had issued warrants for the arrest of both Mr D.K. and his brother-in-law, who were being sought on identical charges, and even though the two had been found together when Mr D.K. had been arrested by the French authorities, the Georgian authorities had at first only sought the extradition of Mr D.K., specifically mentioning his political responsibilities in the Interpol Red Notice.

But it noted four strongly worded public statements by the then president, Mr Hugo Chávez, made shortly before the decisions, that the licence would not be renewed because the television station was hostile to the government. Analysing those statements jointly, the court concluded that the refusal to renew the licence had in reality been meant to silence criticism of the government.

Although that court had made a passing reference to Article 205 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the second paragraph of which laid down the maximum duration of pre-trial detention, it had not made it clear for how long it was placing the applicant in custody. Since the nine-month maximum could arguably be counted separately for each charge, and since the applicant had been presented with several charges, the position in his case had been particularly uncertain. The Georgian courts’ practice of not fixing time-limits for pre-trial detention was in breach of the requirement of legal certainty. That was not offset by the possibility of subsequently seeking review of the detention because under Georgian law the bar for doing so was too high: only where “new essential issues” had arisen after the initial placement in detention."

The real purpose of his detention had been to exclude him from political life. The ulterior motives for the detention had become manifest when the applicant had been taken to the Chief Public Prosecutor on 14 December 2013 and asked for information and threatened by him.

Italy, 6 November 1980, § 102, Series A no. 39; Kemmache v. France (no. 3), 24 November 1994, §§ 37 and 42, Series A no. 296-C; and K.-F. v. Germany, cited above, § 63). Those two expressions, which overlap to an extent, refer essentially to domestic law and lay down the obligation to comply with its substantive and procedural rules (see, among other authorities, Winterwerp, §§ 39 and 45; Kemmache (no. 3), §§ 37 and 42; K.-F. v.

This in particular means that a law which permits deprivation of liberty must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application (see, among other authorities, Amuur v.

Admittedly, in three judgments the Court has said that if a national court does not fix the duration of pre-trial detention, that gives rise to uncertainty even if its maximum is clear from domestic law (see Lutsenko v.

In all three cases the national courts had also failed to give even minimally cogent reasons for ordering pre-trial detention. They are similar to several cases in which the Court found a breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention owing to the combination of a lack of any reasons for ordering pre-trial detention and a failure to fix its duration (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, §§ 136-37, ECHR 2005-X (extracts); Vladimir Solovyev v. Russia, no. 2708/02, §§ 95-98, 24 May 2007; Gubkin v. Russia, no. 36941/02, §§ 111-14, 23 April 2009; Arutyunyan v.

The whole of that period could not automatically be justified on the basis of the reasons set out in the initial decisions to place him in detention. It was therefore necessary to verify not only whether the courts had given relevant and sufficient reasons for placing the applicant in detention, but also whether they had done so when rejecting the applicant’s request for release on 25 September 2013. The initial decisions had endorsed both reasons cited by the prosecution for placing the applicant in custody: the risk that he would flee and the risk that he would obstruct the proceedings. The latter risk had been substantiated by reference to the applicant’s former high position and by his conduct during the incident of 30 November 2012. The former risk had been borne out by the applicant’s possession of a fake passport, his wife’s hasty departure abroad on the day he had been summoned for questioning, and the discovery of large sums of cash in his flat. All of those grounds had been sufficiently specific. It had therefore not been unreasonable to place the applicant in pre-trial detention."

Its object was to protect democratic values, which, as was clear from the Preamble and the Court’s case-law, underlay the entire Convention. Pluralism, free elections and political parties were key among those values. That was particularly relevant in this case, in which criminal proceedings had been used to prevent a major opposition politician from taking part in the political process. The role of Article 18 was to prevent such abuses. The question how complaints under that provision were to be made out had been answered inconsistently by the Court in its case-law. Divergences could be detected in particular with respect to the standard of proof and the types of evidence capable of showing an ulterior purpose. Those points had to be resolved in a flexible and realistic way, for instance by requiring applicants to make a prima facie case and then shifting the burden of proof to the Government, or by taking account of the broader context. In cases in which the authorities had pursued more than one purpose, the presence of even one purpose not prescribed by the Convention was sufficient to give rise to a breach."

He had informed his lawyers about the incident and then spoken publicly about it at the first opportunity. His successive accounts of it had been detailed and consistent. Senior officials had from the outset dismissed his allegations out of hand and opposed a proper investigation into them. Both investigations into those allegations had been carried out by officials who had not been sufficiently independent. The second investigation, by the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, had been opened only after the Chamber judgment. The Government’s explanation about the limited amount of time for which the surveillance camera footage was kept was unconvincing. The footage from the surveillance cameras of private establishments and the road-traffic cameras had not been properly examined and had not been provided to his lawyer, in spite of his express request. The statements by prison officers during the internal inquiry had been very brief and formulaic. Neither Mr O.P. nor Mr D.D., the main protagonists, had been interviewed in the course of that inquiry. Nor had any attempt been made to take the applicant to Mr D.D.’s office in order to check his assertion that he could recognise it. It was odd that in their statements gathered during the criminal investigation all the prison officers had been able, without referring to contemporaneous records, to recall their movements and actions on a particular day two and a half years earlier; that called their credibility into question. There was evidence from three inmates, Mr G.Ts., Mr I.P. and Mr K.T., which supported the applicant’s account and which had not been properly rebutted by the Government. The statements of Mr O.P. and Mr D.D. during the second investigation were not credible. There had been no attempt to verify the applicant’s allegations by checking the mobile telephone records of the men in the car transporting him from Prison no. 9 to the Penitentiary Department or by carrying out an identity parade. Lastly, no proper explanation had been given for the exorbitant bonuses paid to various prison officials in December 2013."

It was for the applicant to demonstrate convincingly that the authorities’ real aim had differed from the one proclaimed. A mere suspicion, however arguable, that the State’s entire legal machinery had lacked independence and had been misused was not sufficient. Otherwise, the Court would have to find a breach of Article 18 in every case in which the applicant’s status, wealth, reputation and so on gave rise to a suspicion that the restrictions of his or her Convention rights had been made for an ulterior political purpose.

The criminal cases against the applicant and other UNM figures had been the result of more than twenty thousand complaints to the prosecuting authorities, lodged after the October 2012 elections by people who had fallen victim to abuses of power during UNM’s time in office. The need to respect and redress the rights of those complainants had been underlined by the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly and by the European Union Special Adviser on Constitutional and Legal Reform and Human Rights in Georgia. An International Prosecution Advisory Panel, set up in 2014 at the initiative of Georgia’s Chief Public Prosecutor to review the materials in high-profile cases processed by the Georgian prosecuting authorities and consisting of three foreign criminal-justice professionals, had found the evidence in those cases sufficient to justify prosecution. This showed that the applicant’s arrest and pre-trial detention had only been intended to bring him before a competent legal authority on a reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence. Since there had been no breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, as confirmed by the Chamber, there was no room for a breach of Article 18 either. In fact, this was the only case in which the Court had found a violation of Article 18 in conjunction with Article 5 § 1 without having first found a violation of the latter – a possibility which had previously only been envisaged theoretically. In all previous cases, if the Court had found no breach of the Article in conjunction with which Article 18 had been pleaded, it had either not examined the complaint under Article 18 on the merits or had found no violation of that provision.

Secondly, the judgment did not clearly explain what the position was when, as had happened in that case, and as often happens in practice, there was a plurality of purposes, that is, when a restriction pursued both a purpose prescribed by the Convention and an ulterior one; it merely stated that since Mr Gusinskiy’s right to liberty had been restricted not only for the purpose prescribed under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention but also for other reasons, there had been a breach of Article 18 (ibid., §§ 77-78)."

The Court found no breach of Article 18. It started from the general assumption that the High Contracting States’ authorities acted in good faith, and held that it could only be rebutted if applicants “convincingly show[ed] that the real aim of the authorities [had] not [been] the same as that proclaimed (or as [could] be reasonably inferred from the context)” (ibid., § 255). In relation to such allegations, the Court “applie[d] a very exacting standard of proof”, and the burden of proof remained on the applicant throughout the proceedings (ibid., § 256). The Court then found that the authorities’ perception of Mr Khodorkovskiy as a serious political opponent and the benefit accruing to a State-owned company as a result of Yukos’s demise were not enough to establish a breach of Article 18 because the criminal prosecution of anyone with such a high profile would benefit his opponents, and because the charges against Mr Khodorkovskiy had been genuine (ibid., §§ 257-58). The opinions of others – political institutions, non-governmental organisations or public figures – regarding the political motivation behind the case against him were not evidence in the legal sense (ibid., § 259). The rulings of courts which had refused to extradite associates of his to Russia, or had denied legal assistance to, issued injunctions against, or made awards against the Russian authorities in Yukos-related cases, although a strong argument, were not sufficient because the evidence and arguments before those courts could have differed from those before the Court, and because, in any event, the standard of proof applied by the Court in cases under Article 18 was very high and could be different from those applied domestically.

Russia (no. 14902/04, §§ 663-66, 20 September 2011), which concerned related tax proceedings leading to Yukos’s demise, the Court likewise found no breach of Article 18. It again held that such finding could only be based on “incontrovertible and direct proof” adduced by the applicant (ibid., § 663). With reference to its conclusions regarding Yukos’s substantive complaints, it found that the authorities had legitimately acted to counter tax evasion and that it was for the applicant company to show that in doing so they had had an improper purpose (ibid., § 664). As in Khodorkovskiy, the Court held that the opinions of others on the political reasons behind the case against Yukos were of little evidentiary value for the purposes of Article 18. Since there was no evidence of further defects in the tax proceedings, it could not conclude that the authorities had misused them to destroy Yukos and take control of its assets (ibid., § 665)."

It focused instead on specific aspects of those proceedings (see Lutsenko, §§ 104 and 108, and Tymoshenko, § 298, both cited above). In Lutsenko this was the arguments in the investigator’s request to place Mr Lutsenko in pre-trial detention that, by talking to the media, he was trying to distort public opinion, discredit the prosecuting authorities and influence his upcoming trial. For the Court, that showed that the detention had pursued a reason not envisaged by Article 5 § 1 (c) – to punish Mr Lutsenko for publicly disputing the charges against him (see Lutsenko, cited above, §§ 26 and 108-09). In Tymoshenko this was statements in the prosecution’s request to place Ms Tymoshenko in pre-trial detention and in the corresponding court order which showed that the purpose had been to punish her for disrespect towards the court and perceived obstructive conduct during hearings (see Tymoshenko, cited above, §§ 30, 31 and 299)."

It did not accept that the whole criminal case against the applicants had been for an ulterior purpose, an allegation which the Court described as “sweeping” and contrasted with allegations about specific episodes in such proceedings. Even if there had been a mixed intent behind that case, the ulterior purpose was not fundamental or decisive, as the case concerned serious accusations relating to common criminal offences unrelated to the applicants’ political activities and had a “healthy core” (ibid., §§ 904-08)."

The cases concerned the pre-trial detention of, respectively, an opposition politician and blogger critical of the Government, and that of a well-known human-rights activist.

In itself, that was not enough to find a breach of Article 18, but proof of ulterior purpose – to silence or punish the applicant in the first case for criticising the authorities and spreading information that they were trying to suppress, and the applicant in the second case for his human-rights activities – derived from a juxtaposition of the lack of suspicion with contextual factors. In the first case, these were a close chronological correlation between the applicant’s blog entries, the authorities’ public statement denouncing them, the charges, and the arrest (see Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, §§ 141-43). In the second case, they were the increasingly harsh regulation of non-governmental organisations and their funding in Azerbaijan, allegations by officials and the pro-government media that activists such as the applicant were a “fifth column”, and the contemporaneous detention of other such activists (see Rasul Jafarov, cited above, §§ 156-62).",

The above survey of the case-law under Article 18 of the Convention shows that in the relatively few cases in which the Court has thus far examined complaints under that provision in some detail, it has, since Khodorkovskiy (cited above), started from the general assumption that the national authorities of the High Contracting States have acted in good faith, adding that this assumption can only be rebutted if the applicant convincingly shows that the purpose for which those authorities have restricted his or her rights under the Convention or the Protocols thereto was in reality not the one cited by them and permitted under the Convention. In other words, the Court’s scrutiny in such cases has focused on the issue of proof of bad faith in this regard."

But inasmuch as they underscore the exhaustiveness of the purposes for which the rights in the Convention may be restricted, Article 18’s terms (“shall not be applied for any purpose other than ...”) appear capable of allowing a more objective assessment of the presence or absence of an ulterior purpose and thus of a misuse of power (“ détournement de pouvoir ”, as stated in the Convention’s Travaux Préparatoires – see paragraph 154 above). Moreover, an approach that simply focuses on proof of bad faith does not sit well with that taken by the Court with respect to the restriction clauses in the Convention, which Article 18 is intended to complement. For example, in examining whether an interference with the rights guaranteed by Articles 8 to 11 is “necessary in a democratic society” for the pursuit of a legitimate aim, the Court always insists that its supervision is not limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State’s authorities have exercised their discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith (see, for example, The Sunday Times (no. 1), cited above, § 59; Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, § 68, Series A no. 130; and Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 196 (iii), ECHR 2015 (extracts)). In cases under Article 5 § 1, the authorities’ good faith is likewise only one of the elements showing a lack of arbitrariness (see Saadi, cited above, §§ 69-74).

This rule derives both from its wording, which complements that of clauses such as, for example, the second sentence of Article 5 § 1 and the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, which permit restrictions to those rights and freedoms, and from its place in the Convention at the end of Section I, which contains the Articles that define and qualify those rights and freedoms."

Its wording (“shall not be applied for any purpose other than”) matches closely the wording of those clauses (for example, Article 5 § 1, second sentence: “save in the following cases”; Article 8 § 2: “no interference ... except such as ... is necessary in the interests of”; Article 9 § 2: “be subject only to such limitations as ... are necessary ... in the interests of”; and Article 11 § 2: “No restrictions ... other than such as ... are necessary ... in the interests of”).

Since the Convention must be interpreted in a way which promotes harmony between its provisions (see, among other authorities, Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, § 68, Series A no. 28; Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 48, ECHR 2005-X; and A and B v.

Russia (I) [GC], no. 13255/07, §§ 185-86, ECHR 2014 (extracts)) – the Court finds an absence of a legitimate ground for the deprivation of liberty and accordingly a breach of Article 5 § 1."

That overview shows that although the legitimate aims and grounds set out in the restriction clauses in the Convention are exhaustive, they are also broadly defined and have been interpreted with a degree of flexibility. The real focus of the Court’s scrutiny has rather been on the ensuing and closely connected issue: whether the restriction is necessary or justified, that is, based on relevant and sufficient reasons and proportionate to the pursuit of the aims or grounds for which it is authorised. Those aims and grounds are the benchmarks against which necessity or justification is measured (see The Sunday Times (no. 1), cited above, § 59)."

That manner of proceeding should guide the Court in its approach to the interpretation and application of Article 18 of the Convention in relation to situations in which a restriction pursues more than one purpose. Some of those purposes may be capable of being brought within the respective restriction clause, while others are not. In such situations, the mere presence of a purpose which does not fall within the respective restriction clause cannot of itself give rise to a breach of Article 18. There is a considerable difference between cases in which the prescribed purpose was the one that truly actuated the authorities, though they also wanted to gain some other advantage, and cases in which the prescribed purpose, while present, was in reality simply a cover enabling the authorities to attain an extraneous purpose, which was the overriding focus of their efforts. Holding that the presence of any other purpose by itself contravenes Article 18 would not do justice to that fundamental difference, and would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of Article 18, which is to prohibit the misuse of power. Indeed, it could mean that each time the Court excludes an aim or a ground pleaded by the Government under a substantive provision of the Convention, it must find a breach of Article 18, because the Government’s pleadings would be proof that the authorities pursued not only the purpose that the Court accepted as legitimate, but also another one."

Conversely, if the prescribed purpose was the main one, the restriction does not run counter to Article 18 even if it also pursues another purpose."

Turkey (cited above, §§ 112-13 and 115) and in Georgia v. Russia (I) (cited above, §§ 93 and 95), is that, as a general rule, the burden of proof is not borne by one or the other party because the Court examines all material before it irrespective of its origin, and because it can, if necessary, obtain material of its own motion. As early as in Artico v. Italy (13 May 1980, § 30, Series A no. 37) the Court stated that that was the general position not only in inter-State cases but also in cases deriving from individual applications. It has since then relied on the concept of burden of proof in certain particular contexts. On a number of occasions, it has recognised that a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio, that is that the burden of proof in relation to an allegation lies on the party which makes it, is not possible, notably in instances when this has been justified by the specific evidentiary difficulties faced by the applicants (see, for example, Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 68, in relation to the exhaustion of domestic remedies; Baka, cited above, §§ 143 in fine and 149, and the examples cited therein, in relation to various substantive Articles of the Convention; and J.K. and Others v.

If the respondent Government in question do not heed such a request, the Court cannot force them to comply with it, but can – if they do not duly account for their failure or refusal – draw inferences (see Janowiec and Others v. Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, § 202, ECHR 2013, with further references). It can also combine such inferences with contextual factors.

Secondly, the level of persuasion required to reach a conclusion is intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made, and the Convention right at stake.

In Nachova and Others (cited above, § 147), the Court further clarified that point, saying that when assessing evidence it is not bound by formulae and adopts the conclusions supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties’ submissions.

The Minister of Prisons does not appear to have been aware of that when speaking about the case on 18 December 2013 (see paragraph 70 in fine above). The deputy head of the General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Prisons was equally unaware of that when he requested the footage two days later, on 20 December 2013 (see paragraph 73 above). The deputy Minister of Prisons who had been in charge of reforming the surveillance system in Georgia’s prisons two years previously, in 2011, stated that the footage was kept for a month (see paragraph 77 above). Indeed, it is striking that surveillance footage from an establishment as prone to violence and accidents as a prison would be preserved for a shorter time than footage from road-traffic cameras – which was in this case still available twenty days after the alleged incident (see paragraph 84 above)."

If the restriction of his right to liberty is thus seen as a whole, it is hard to regard the attempt to use it as a means to obtain such information as its chief purpose. But where the restriction of a Convention right amounts, as here, to a continuous situation, in order for it not to contravene Article 18, its chief purpose must remain the one prescribed by the Convention throughout its duration, and it cannot be excluded that the initial purpose will be supplanted by another one as time goes by (see paragraph 308 above)."

                "352. There are several elements which lead the Court to find that this was so in this case. To begin with, by the time the applicant was pressured to provide information about Mr Zhvania’s death and Mr Saakashvili’s bank accounts, the reasons for keeping him in pre-trial detention appear to have receded, which led the Court to find a breach of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in relation to the period from 25 September 2013 onwards, which was shortly before the incident of December 2013 (see paragraphs 233-235 above). Then, at that time, December 2013, Mr Saakashvili, who has since then become the target of several criminal investigations, had just left Georgia following the end of his term of office as President (see paragraphs 13 and 126 above). For its part, the investigation into Mr Zhvania’s death, which had been renewed in late 2012, had apparently not made significant progress (see paragraph 61 above). It is clear that both topics were of considerable importance for the authorities. The Government’s statement at the hearing before the Grand Chamber that there was still a “huge question” for the applicant to answer in relation to Mr Zhvania’s death is particularly telling in that regard (see paragraph 61 above). At the same time, the prosecuting authorities had the power to drop all charges against the applicant at any point without judicial control, with the consequence that the courts would have had to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him (see paragraph 153 above), and thus cause him to be released from pre-trial detention, as promised to him by the Chief Public Prosecutor, Mr O.P., if he provided the requested information. The weight which the authorities attached to the matter is also apparent from the way in which the entire incident on 14 December 2013 unfolded and was later commented upon and investigated. The applicant was taken to meet with Mr O.P., who had been appointed to the post three weeks previously (see paragraph 60 above), in a covert and apparently irregular manner, in a clandestine operation carried out in the middle of the night. The authorities’ initial reaction to the applicant’s allegations in that respect was to issue firm denials (see paragraphs 68 and 70 above), and the ensuing inquiry and investigation were, as already noted, marred by a series of omissions from which it can be inferred that the authorities were eager that the matter should not come to light. Thus, the main protagonists, Mr O.P. and Mr D.D., were not interviewed during the inquiry but only in the course of the investigation, in September 2016, nearly three years after the events, and the crucial evidence in the case – the footage from the prison surveillance cameras – was not recovered."

The attendant seizure of his passport also amounted to such an interference (see Peltonen, at p. 43; Baumann, §§ 62 ‑ 63; Napijalo, §§ 69 ‑ 73; and Nalbantski, § 61, all cited above). It must therefore be determined whether that interference was “in accordance with law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 2 § 3 of Protocol No. 4, and whether it was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of such an aim."

It is furthermore apparent from the context in which the statutory provisions which served as a basis for the measure against the applicant were enacted and later tightened (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above) that the interference was designed to discourage and prevent breaches of the immigration laws of other States, and thus reduce the likelihood of those States refusing other Bulgarian nationals entry to their territory, or toughening or refusing to relax their visa regime in respect of Bulgarian nationals. Even if the Court were prepared to accept that the interference pursued the legitimate aims of maintenance of ordre public or the protection of the rights of others, in the instant case it is not necessary to pursue this point further since in any case, as explained below, the travel restrictions failed the “necessary in a democratic society” test and its implicit requirement of proportionality."

However, this is not the main issue (contrast Nalbantski, cited above, § 56): the salient point is whether it was at all proportionate to automatically prohibit the applicant from travelling to any and every foreign country on account of his having committed a breach of the immigration laws of one particular country."
            ],
            [
                "34. The Court cannot consider such a blanket and indiscriminate measure to be proportionate. The normal consequences of a serious breach of a country’s immigration laws would be for the person concerned to be removed from that country and prohibited (by the laws of that country) from re ‑ entering its territory for a certain period of time. Indeed, the applicant suffered such consequences as a result of the infringement of the terms of his student visa – he was deported from the United States of America (see paragraph 8 above). It appears quite draconian for the Bulgarian State – which could not be regarded as directly affected by the applicant’s infringement – to have also prevented him from travelling to any other foreign country for a period of two years."

Thus, although the relevant provision gave them discretion with regard to the imposition or otherwise of the impugned measure, there is no indication that in the exercise of that discretion the authorities took into account any factors specific to the applicant, such as the gravity of the breach which had prompted his deportation from the United States of America, the risk that he might commit further breaches of another State’s immigration rules, his family situation, his financial and personal situation, or whether he had a criminal record. The Court has previously held, albeit in different contexts, that such general and virtually automatic restrictions cannot be regarded as justified under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Riener, §§ 127 ‑ 28; Bartik, § 48; Gochev, §§ 53 and 57; and Nalbantski, §§ 66 ‑ 67, all cited above)."

                "36. It is true that during the period that preceded the enactment of the statutory provision on which the order was based Bulgaria had become a source of migrants (see paragraph 20 above), and that in those circumstances it is at least arguable that the Bulgarian State could have considered it necessary, for reasons of international comity and practicality, to assist other States in the implementation of their immigration rules and policies (see paragraph 32 above). It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

The Court reiterates that the test as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society” involves showing that the action taken was in pursuit of a legitimate aim and that restrictive measures were appropriate to achieve their protective function. Examining the restriction on leaving Russia from the standpoint of the proportionality test, in the case of Bartik ( cited above, § 49 ) the Court found it deficient for the following reasons :",
                "“The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant ’ s ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported ‘ protective function ’ of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning ‘ State secrets ’. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of ‘ State secrets ’ became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that ‘ the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ... ”"

They referred to the case of Klass and Others v. Germany (6 September 1978, § 48, Series A no. 28), in which the Court acknowledged that democratic societies were threatened by highly sophisticated forms of espionage and by terrorism and that the existence of some legislation granting powers of secret surveillance was necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security. The Government interpreted the judgment in the case of Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden (no. 62332/00, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII) to mean that “the interests of national security and combatting terrorism outweighed the interests of the applicants relating to access to information about them in the security service databases”. Lastly, they cited the Commission inadmissibility decision in Peltonen v. Finland (no. 27323/95, 20 February 1995), in which the refusal to issue a ten-year travel passport to the applicant, who had evaded the military draft and moved to Sweden, was considered necessary for maintaining “ ordre public ” and ensuring national security."

The Government emphasised that the applicants had gained access to State secrets through their employment and had voluntarily accepted a temporary restriction on their rights, including the right to travel abroad (here they referred, by way of comparison, to Kwiatkowska v. Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000, in which the applicant waived some of her procedural rights under Article 6 in a murder case). They had also received a pay rise for that very reason and had been expected to abide by the terms of their contract of employment. The Government referred to Lazaridis v. Greece ((dec.), no. 61838/14, § 14, 12 January 2016), in which the Court held that any service of a military character fell outside the scope of Article 4 of the Convention, and considered that the same logic should apply to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4. The information to which the applicants had had access had been of great importance for the national defence and its confidentiality had been crucial for securing the national interests of Russia. As it was more complicated for the State to guarantee the safety of its nationals on the territory of other States, individuals who were aware of State secrets were restricted in their right to travel abroad. Restrictions were of a temporary nature and proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of State interests."

The Government acknowledged that the laws of a majority of member States did not explicitly impose a restriction on the right to travel abroad for individuals aware of State secrets. They alleged however that many countries had put in place “a secret system of measures designed to ensure State control over [such] individuals”. In Azerbaijan, the law imposed a restriction on the right to go abroad for a period of up to five years. In Belarus, the authorities determined the duration of such restrictions on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the importance of the information and the extent of damage that its disclosure would entail. The Government also alleged that, while Greek law imposed a possible restriction on the right to leave abroad on the basis of a judicial decision, the Greek Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Defence were guided by “secret internal regulations” in refusing their employees the right to go abroad. Lastly, in The Hague, intelligence operatives and military servicemen were prohibited from visiting certain countries, including Iraq, Iran and Belarus. Travelling to regions of military conflict for private purposes was likewise banned. The Government concluded therefore that Russia was not the only State that enforced similar restrictions.",

The Court reiterates that the test as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society” involves showing that the action taken was in pursuit of a legitimate aim and that restrictive measures were appropriate to achieve their protective function. Examining the restriction on leaving Russia from the standpoint of the proportionality test, in the case of Bartik ( cited above, § 49 ) the Court found it deficient for the following reasons :",
                "“The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant ’ s ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported ‘ protective function ’ of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning ‘ State secrets ’. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of ‘ State secrets ’ became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that ‘ the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ... ”"
            ],

                "94. The Court finds nothing in the Government ’ s submissions in the instant case that would warrant a different conclusion. As noted in the Bartik and Soltysyak cases, the confidential information which the applicants possessed could be transmitted in a variety of ways which did not require their presence abroad or even direct physical contact with anyone. In so far as the Government claimed that preventing the applicants from going abroad was intended to guarantee their own safety in foreign States, this argument appears disingenuous for the following reasons."
            ],
            [
                "95. If the stated purpose of the restriction on leaving Russia was to ensure the applicants ’ safety abroad, its application appears to have been inconsistent. It would seem rational to assume that the concern for the applicants ’ safety should have been greatest during their employment, so long as they had access to current sensitive information. However, rather paradoxically, it was during that period that the applicants ’ freedom to leave Russia was least restricted. Some applicants were allowed to go abroad on official business, as was Mr Berkovich who travelled more than once to France, China and Greece (see paragraph 7 above). It is more remarkable still that other applicants were authorised to leave Russia for purely private purposes; thus, Mr Boldyrev frequently visited his parents in Estonia, while Mr Litavrin and Mr Burnayev went on holidays abroad (see paragraphs 15, 30 and 47 above). The entitlement to travel abroad on business did not cease with the end of employment; the Ministry of Defence conceded as much in their reply to Mr Ilchenko ’ s challenge to the restriction (see paragraph 26 above). As it transpires, travelling for private purposes after the end of employment was the only form of travel that was restricted but the Government failed to explain the rationale behind such a selective approach to alleged concerns about the applicants ’ safety. A string of references to the Court ’ s judgments that mentioned national security in various contexts is not sufficient to lend credence to their claim."
            ],
            [
                "96. The Court finds no indication that the decisions by the Russian executive agencies restricting the applicants ’ right to travel abroad for private purposes were the result of an assessment of any security risks or of their individual situations. Even though the Constitutional Court held in 2012 that the need for the restriction had to be weighed against the concrete circumstances, such as the nature of the sensitive information, its historic and current confidential status, and the purpose of the trip (see paragraph 28 above), the Russian courts confined their review to formally verifying whether the restriction complied with the procedure for restricting their rights. Whether before or after the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, they made no attempt to evaluate whether the restriction was necessary for, and capable of, achieving the stated purpose and whether it corresponded to a pressing social need. The human cost of that formalistic approach was particularly high in the case of Mr Boldyrev. As long as he continued to work, he was able to visit his ageing parents in Estonia. After the termination of his employment, he was barred from visiting his ailing mother or attending her funeral. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances and the strong humanitarian considerations involved, the domestic authorities should have examined his request with particular care and scrutiny (compare Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 96, 6 December 2007). However, the Moscow City Court refused to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Boldyrev to justify the need to go abroad and declared that his mother ’ s poor health was “of no legal significance” (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the evolving circumstances (see Vlasov and Benyash, cited above, § 36, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "97. There remains the Government ’ s argument that the applicants forfeited their rights under Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 by entering into a contract of employment which contained such a restriction. The Court reiterates at the outset that – unlike some other Articles of the Convention such as Article 4 § 3 (d) or Article 11 § 2 – Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 does not make any distinction between civilians and members of the armed forces. Even though the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians, such a restriction must in all cases be capable of achieving its protective function, whereas, as the Court has found above, it was precisely the link between the means employed and the aim pursued that was missing in the instant case (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 53, and the case-law cited therein). In so far as the Government claimed that the applicants freely consented to the restriction, the Court observes that they did not have any influence on the terms of their employment, standard contracts making their continued employment conditional on having valid security clearance (see paragraph 51 above, and compare Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, ECHR 2006 ‑ I, and Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 48420/10 and 3 others, §§ 83 and 109, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). As the applicants pointed out, they were given a pay rise on account of their enhanced responsibility for handling confidential information. It was not compensation for their future inability to leave Russia, nor were they eligible for any such compensation after the termination of their employment as long as the impugned restriction was in force. The Court accordingly finds that the alleged waiver was neither unambiguous nor fully consensual and could not in any event affect its finding that the restriction was not related to the aim pursued."
            ],
            [
                "98. Lastly, the Court observes that, out of forty-seven member States of the Council of Europe, Russia has remained to date the only State that bars persons aware of State secrets from travelling abroad for private purposes (see paragraph 61 above). The Government ’ s reliance on the Azerbaijani law is misplaced, for – as the Court pointed out in the Soltysyak judgment in 2011 (cited above, § 51) – Azerbaijan abolished a similar travel ban in 2005. Belarus is not a member State of the Council of Europe and is not bound by the Convention provisions. Lastly, restrictions on travel to specific geographical zones that are affected by military hostilities may be called for as a measure of precaution but they are in no way comparable to the unqualified ban on leaving the applicants ’ own country that is at issue in the instant case. The UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual ’ s right to leave the country merely on the grounds that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see, for the full quote, Soltysyak, cited above, § 24). As the travel ban impugned in the instant case does not reflect an established European consensus and has no support among the Council of Europe member States, the respondent State was under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining it in place (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 51). However, the Government failed to discharge that obligation."

For many years Russia had taken no steps to amend the relevant legal provisions or practice and such a long period was clearly in breach of its undertaking to abolish the travel restrictions “with immediate effect”. The impugned restrictions affected hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens who had been waiting for too long for their abolition.

The Court has previously expressed the view that the express mention in the Opinion on Russia ’ s accession request of Russia ’ s undertaking to cease, with immediate effect, restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggested that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe (see Bartik, cited above, § 50).

However, it has not fulfilled that specific accession commitment to date, that is to say for more than twenty - two years."

                "114. On 21 December 2006 the Court gave judgment in the case of Bartik v. Russia (cited above). It found that a restriction on the applicant ’ s right to leave his own country was not necessary in a democratic society and amounted to a violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (§§ 44-52). On 10 February 2011 the Court reiterated its findings in the similar case of Soltysyak v. Russia (cited above, §§ 46-54). It pointed out that Russia was the only member State that had retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of State secrets (§ 51). In June 2012 the Russian Constitutional Court also considered a challenge to the restriction brought by one of the applicants in the instant case, Mr Ilchenko. Although it held that it was generally compatible with the Russian Constitution, it called for a departure from the purely formalistic approach and for the adoption of a more nuanced approach tailored to the requirements of the specific situation (see paragraph 28 above)."

They also mentioned that they considered adopting other measures which could be understood as a reference to the works of the Interagency Commission (see paragraphs 63 and 111 above). According to them, the Commission had produced a batch of draft documents and regulations. However, it does not appear that there was any follow-up action. As at the date of this judgment, that is to say six years later, the relevant provisions of domestic law – section 15 of the Entry and Exit Procedures Act and section 24 of the State Secrets Act – have not been amended or repealed and have retained the same absolute travel restriction on the rights of persons aware of State secrets."

                "56. The salient question is whether the ban can be regarded as proportionate throughout the entirety of that period (see, mutatis mutandis, Riener v. Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, § 128, 23 May 2006 ), because, even if justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual's freedom of movement may become disproportionate if it is extended over a long period (see, mutatis mutandis, Gochev, cited above, § 49, with further references). On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from Germany (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above ). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas – with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) – the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, § 66, 3 November 2005 ). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 31, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v. Italy, no. 19675/06, §§ 19 and 49, 20 April 2010 ).

Such a measure was envisaged by the Code of Criminal Procedure. It was not mandatory but at the discretion of the prosecuting authorities, if they felt that there was a risk that the accused might flee abroad. It was not absolute either, because the accused could be granted permission to travel on specific occasions, if he or she made such a request. The prosecuting authorities'refusal to grant such permission was subject to judicial review. In carrying out that review the court had to have regard to the reasons given by the prosecuting authorities and the grounds relied on by the accused, taking into account the risk of flight abroad. Thus, a refusal to grant permission would be unlawful if the accused wished to travel abroad for medical treatment or on business. In the latter case, a refusal would have to be subjected to very close scrutiny, because it could cause the accused pecuniary damage. The applicant had been prohibited from travelling abroad because he had been prosecuted for murder, had sought to evade justice and had been extradited from Germany. His case was therefore different from Gochev v. Bulgaria ( no. 34383/03, 26 November 2009 ) and Baumann v. France ( no. 33592/96, ECHR 2 001 ‑ V (extracts)). In the applicant's case, the national authorities had given reasons for each of their refusals to allow him to travel.

Indeed, he had been allowed to travel to Germany once and had returned to Bulgaria in time for the next scheduled hearing in his trial. However, only one of his many requests for permission to travel abroad had been granted. In refusing his other requests, the courts had relied on flawed arguments, such as the possibility for his family to settle in Bulgaria, and the possibility for him to support them in Germany on the very low salary that he could expect to earn in Bulgaria. The refusals which followed his return from Germany in the autumn of 2003 in time for the next trial hearing were particularly hard to explain."

Therefore, no ratione temporis issue arises, because Protocol No. 4 entered into force in respect of Bulgaria on 4 November 2000 (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Hajibeyli v. Azerbaijan, no. 16528/05, § 62, 10 July 2008 ). The ban was lifted on 26 May 2006, re ‑ imposed on 27 June 2007 and lifted again on 10 March 2008 (see paragraphs 38, 40 and 41 above).

Bulgaria, no. 46343/99, § 128, 23 May 2006 ), because, even if justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual's freedom of movement may become disproportionate if it is extended over a long period (see, mutatis mutandis, Gochev, cited above, § 49, with further references). On the one hand, the authorities had, at least initially, reason to be apprehensive about the possibility of the applicant's fleeing. He had left Bulgaria the day after the alleged commission of the offence, had adopted the family name of his wife, and had been extradited from Germany (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above ). Those reasons might have been sufficient to justify the ban at the beginning. However, their relevance later must surely have receded, whereas – with two exceptions (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above) – the prosecuting authorities and the courts continued automatically to rely on them right up to May 2006 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nedyalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 44241/98, § 66, 3 November 2005 ). There were many other factors militating in favour of lifting the ban, such as the amount of time which had elapsed since it had been imposed, the unreasonably slow pace of the proceedings, acknowledged by the courts on several occasions (see paragraphs 22, 23, 33, 37 and 41 above), the applicant's punctilious attendance at all hearings, also acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above), the fact that he had twice travelled to Germany and returned in time for hearings (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above), the increasingly serious disruption of his family life due to his absence, and that he could not provide adequately for his family from Bulgaria and had a young child (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). These matters do not seem to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant's requests and appeals. Indeed, in the bulk of their rulings, which appear quite stereotyped, they seem to have completely overlooked them (see paragraphs 26 ‑ 31, 35 and 36 above and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Villa v. Italy, no. 19675/06, §§ 19 and 49, 20 April 2010 ).

An analogy may be drawn with the Court's case ‑ law under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, where the national courts'failure to address such arguments when examining requests for release from pre ‑ trial detention is regarded as highly problematic (see, among other authorities, Nikolova v.

Ukraine, no. 36655/02, § 69, 8 November 2005).

Russia, no. 55669/00, § 89, 2 March 2006, and Ivanov, cited above, § 71). Article 6 of the Convention requires the courts to employ available procedural remedies in order to determine a person ’ s guilt or innocence without undue delay. This requirement is aimed at removing as soon as practicable the uncertainty concerning the accused ’ s legal position which remains throughout the entire duration of the proceedings, irrespective of whether they are pending or suspended. In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that, despite the fact that it was the applicant who requested the suspension of the proceedings, the primary responsibility for the delay caused by the suspensions, which in turn were caused by the pending commercial proceedings, rested with the domestic courts."

                "\" ... The existence of preventive measures is not in itself contrary to the Italian Constitution. The Constitutional Court has ruled that the basis for these measures is the need to guarantee the orderly and peaceful course of social relations, not only through a body of legislation penalising unlawful acts, but also through provisions intended to prevent the commission of such acts (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 27 of 1959 and judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Because of their particular object, preventive measures do not relate to the commission of a specific unlawful act but to a pattern of behaviour defined by law as conduct indicating the existence of danger to society (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Consequently, in the Italian legal system, there is a fundamental difference between criminal penalties and preventive measures. The former constitute the response to an unlawful act and the consequences of that act; the latter are a means of preventing the commission of such an act.",
                "In other words, a criminal penalty relates to an offence already committed, whereas a preventive measure is intended to reduce the risk of future offences (see, mutatis mutandis, Constitutional Court, judgment no. 53 of 1968, concerning security measures).",
                "Because criminal penalties and preventive measures are essentially different, not all the constitutional principles which should underpin the former necessarily apply to the latter. For example, the presumption of innocence enunciated in Article 27 of the Constitution does not concern preventive measures, which are not based on the criminal liability or guilt of the person concerned (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Similarly, such measures do not fall within the scope of Article 25 para. 2 of the Constitution, which prohibits the retroactive application of criminal provisions. The violation of this principle has been alleged on a number of occasions in the Court of Cassation with regard to confiscation orders under section 2 ter of the 1965 Act. The Court of Cassation has ruled, firstly, that the above principle is not applicable to preventive measures (see, for example, Court of Cassation, Piraino judgment of 30 January 1985). Secondly, the Court of Cassation has pointed out that the impugned provision is not in fact retroactive, as it relates to the property in the possession of the person concerned at the time when confiscation is ordered (Court of Cassation, Oliveri judgment of 12 May 1986) and to the unlawful use of that property after its entry into force (Court of Cassation, Pipitone judgment of 4 January 1985).",
                "In spite of these limitations, preventive measures remain open to thorough scrutiny of their compatibility with the Constitution.",
                "As far back as 1956 the Constitutional Court ruled that in no case could the right to liberty be restricted except where such restriction was prescribed by law, where lawful proceedings had been instituted to that end and where the reasons therefor had been set out in a judicial decision (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 11 of 1956).",
                "It subsequently ruled that preventive measures could not be adopted on the basis of mere suspicion and are justified only when based on the objective establishment and assessment of facts which reveal the behaviour and lifestyle of the person concerned (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "More recently it confirmed that the constitutionality of preventive measures still depends on respect of the rule of law and the possibility of applying to the courts for a remedy. Furthermore, the above two conditions are closely linked. Thus it is not enough for the law to indicate vague criteria for the assessment of danger; it must set them forth with sufficient precision to make the right of access to a court and adversarial proceedings a meaningful one (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 177 of 1980).",
                "The case-law of the Court of Cassation is in this respect entirely consistent with that of the Constitutional Court; it affirms quite clearly that proceedings for the application of preventive measures must be adversarial and conducted with respect for the rights of the defence, any violation of those rights entailing their nullity (see, for example, Court of Cassation, judgment no. 1255 of 29 June 1984 in the Santoro case).",
                "The Court of Cassation has dismissed a number of complaints alleging the unconstitutionality of the seizure and confiscation measures provided for in section 2 ter of the 1965 Act. In particular, it has ruled that the presumption concerning the unlawful origin of the property of persons suspected of belonging to organisations of the mafia type is not incompatible with Article 24 of the Constitution, which guarantees the rights of the defence, since confiscation can only take place when there is sufficient circumstantial evidence concerning the unlawful origin of the property in question and in the absence of a rebuttal (Court of Cassation, previously cited Pipitone judgment).",
                "With regard to the compatibility of seizure and confiscation measures with the right to free exercise of private economic activities and the right to peaceful enjoyment of private property (Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution), the Court of Cassation has ruled that these rights are not absolute and may be limited in accordance with the general interest.

What he complained about is, rather, that such a drastic measure was taken at this stage of the proceedings. However, seizure under section 2 ter of the 1965 Act is clearly a provisional measure intended to ensure that property which appears to be the fruit of unlawful activities carried out to the detriment of the community can subsequently be confiscated if necessary. The measure as such was therefore justified by the general interest and, in view of the extremely dangerous economic power of an \"organisation\" like the Mafia, it cannot be said that taking it at this stage of the proceedings was disproportionate to the aim pursued.",

As a result of its unlawful activities, in particular drug-trafficking, and its international connections, this \"organisation\" has an enormous turnover that is subsequently invested, inter alia, in the real property sector. Confiscation, which is designed to block these movements of suspect capital, is an effective and necessary weapon in the combat against this cancer. It therefore appears proportionate to the aim pursued, all the more so because it in fact entails no additional restriction in relation to seizure.",

On the other hand, there was an interference as regards the lorry and the nine items of real property confiscated on 16 October 1985 inasmuch as the entry concerning the lorry was not made until 10 July 1987 and that concerning the real property not until after 9 August 1991 (see paragraph 15 above).",

The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see Iatridis v.

The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole, and therefore also in its second paragraph. There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 75, ECHR 1999-III, and Immobiliare Saffi, cited above, § 49)."

The limitation on the applicant's right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions is not in itself open to criticism, particularly in view of the legitimate aim pursued and the margin of appreciation afforded by the second paragraph of Article 1. However, the risk with such a system is that it may unreasonably restrict an applicant's ability to deal with his possessions, particularly if the proceedings are protracted, as they were in the instant case in which they lasted fourteen years and eight months. The Government attributed the delays in the proceedings to the failure of the attempts to sell the applicant's house at auction and to the applicant's conduct.",

However, it finds that those actions did not significantly slow down the bankruptcy proceedings because, apart from the request for a composition with the creditors (the date of which has not been given), all the applications were made in or after 1996 and were decided expeditiously by the courts concerned (for instance, the application for a referral to the Constitutional Court was decided within twelve days and the application for a stay of the order for sale within one day).",

                "Consequently, the Court finds that there was no justification for restricting the applicant's right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions for the full duration of the proceedings, since, while in principle it will be necessary to deprive the bankrupt of the right to administer and deal with his or her possessions in order to achieve the aim pursued, the necessity will diminish with the passage of time. In the Court's view, the length of the proceedings thus upset the balance that had to be struck between the general interest in securing the payment of the bankrupt's creditors and the applicant's personal interest in securing the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.

In that connection, referring to its findings with respect to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court considers that, contrary to what the Government have affirmed, the delays in the proceedings were not attributable to the failure of the attempts to sell the applicant's house at auction or to the applicant's conduct.",

The Government contended that the purpose of preventing bankrupts from taking legal proceedings was to protect a third-party right, namely “the interests of the bankrupt's creditors”. Furthermore, the restriction applied solely to issues concerning pecuniary rights and, accordingly, was within the State's margin of appreciation. The Government added that the bankrupt was in any event represented in court by the trustee in bankruptcy. Lastly, the applicant had not sustained any loss, as he had instituted various court proceedings while the bankruptcy proceedings were pending ( for instance, an application on 5 April 1996 for a referral to the Constitutional Court and an application on 17 April 1996 for a stay of execution of the order for sale)."

It reiterates that Article 6 § 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way it embodies the “right to a court”, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, pp. 17-18, §§ 35-36). This right extends only to disputes (“ contestation ”) over “civil rights and obligations ” which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law (see, inter alia, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, pp. 46-47, § 81, and Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, pp. 16-17, § 36)."

                "85. Furthermore, the “right to a court” is not absolute. It is subject to limitations permitted by implication, in particular where the conditions of admissibility of an appeal are concerned, since by its very nature it calls for regulation by the State, which enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in this regard (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 93, pp. 24-25, § 57). However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce a person's access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired; lastly, such limitations will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if they do not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Levages Prestations Services v. France, judgment of 23 October 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, p. 1543, § 40 )."

The Court considers that the purpose of the restriction on the applicant's capacity to take legal proceedings is to assign the role of representing the bankrupt in court in respect of issues arising over the bankrupt's pecuniary rights to the trustee in bankruptcy as, once the bankruptcy order has been lodged, he is responsible for the administration of the bankrupt's assets. Indeed, it is self-evident in the Court's view that disputes over such matters may have major repercussions on the assets and liabilities of the bankrupt estate. The Court consequently finds that the restriction is intended to protect the rights and interests of others, namely those of the bankrupt's creditors. The Court must go on to examine whether the consequences suffered by the applicant were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."

Unpaid tax was also a ground to impose a prohibition against leaving Bulgaria under section 29(1)(v) of the Law on Sojourn of Aliens. Although this provision did not provide expressly for a confiscation of a foreign passport, if applied in conjunction with the relevant regulations, it clearly allowed such measure in respect of a person against whom there had been a decision prohibiting his departure from Bulgaria.

The Court finds no indication that the decisions by the Russian executive agencies restricting the applicants ’ right to travel abroad for private purposes were the result of an assessment of any security risks or of their individual situations. Even though the Constitutional Court held in 2012 that the need for the restriction had to be weighed against the concrete circumstances, such as the nature of the sensitive information, its historic and current confidential status, and the purpose of the trip (see paragraph 28 above), the Russian courts confined their review to formally verifying whether the restriction complied with the procedure for restricting their rights. Whether before or after the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, they made no attempt to evaluate whether the restriction was necessary for, and capable of, achieving the stated purpose and whether it corresponded to a pressing social need. The human cost of that formalistic approach was particularly high in the case of Mr Boldyrev. As long as he continued to work, he was able to visit his ageing parents in Estonia. After the termination of his employment, he was barred from visiting his ailing mother or attending her funeral. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances and the strong humanitarian considerations involved, the domestic authorities should have examined his request with particular care and scrutiny (compare Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 96, 6 December 2007). However, the Moscow City Court refused to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Boldyrev to justify the need to go abroad and declared that his mother ’ s poor health was “of no legal significance” (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the evolving circumstances (see Vlasov and Benyash, cited above, § 36, with further references)."

Germany (6 September 1978, § 48, Series A no. 28), in which the Court acknowledged that democratic societies were threatened by highly sophisticated forms of espionage and by terrorism and that the existence of some legislation granting powers of secret surveillance was necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security. The Government interpreted the judgment in the case of Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden (no. 62332/00, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII) to mean that “the interests of national security and combatting terrorism outweighed the interests of the applicants relating to access to information about them in the security service databases”. Lastly, they cited the Commission inadmissibility decision in Peltonen v. Finland (no. 27323/95, 20 February 1995), in which the refusal to issue a ten-year travel passport to the applicant, who had evaded the military draft and moved to Sweden, was considered necessary for maintaining “ ordre public ” and ensuring national security."

Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000, in which the applicant waived some of her procedural rights under Article 6 in a murder case). They had also received a pay rise for that very reason and had been expected to abide by the terms of their contract of employment. The Government referred to Lazaridis v. Greece ((dec.), no. 61838/14, § 14, 12 January 2016), in which the Court held that any service of a military character fell outside the scope of Article 4 of the Convention, and considered that the same logic should apply to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4. The information to which the applicants had had access had been of great importance for the national defence and its confidentiality had been crucial for securing the national interests of Russia. As it was more complicated for the State to guarantee the safety of its nationals on the territory of other States, individuals who were aware of State secrets were restricted in their right to travel abroad. Restrictions were of a temporary nature and proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of State interests."

They alleged however that many countries had put in place “a secret system of measures designed to ensure State control over [such] individuals”. In Azerbaijan, the law imposed a restriction on the right to go abroad for a period of up to five years. In Belarus, the authorities determined the duration of such restrictions on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the importance of the information and the extent of damage that its disclosure would entail. The Government also alleged that, while Greek law imposed a possible restriction on the right to leave abroad on the basis of a judicial decision, the Greek Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Defence were guided by “secret internal regulations” in refusing their employees the right to go abroad. Lastly, in The Hague, intelligence operatives and military servicemen were prohibited from visiting certain countries, including Iraq, Iran and Belarus. Travelling to regions of military conflict for private purposes was likewise banned. The Government concluded therefore that Russia was not the only State that enforced similar restrictions.",

The Court reiterates that the test as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society” involves showing that the action taken was in pursuit of a legitimate aim and that restrictive measures were appropriate to achieve their protective function. Examining the restriction on leaving Russia from the standpoint of the proportionality test, in the case of Bartik ( cited above, § 49 ) the Court found it deficient for the following reasons :",
                "“The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant ’ s ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported ‘ protective function ’ of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning ‘ State secrets ’. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of ‘ State secrets ’ became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that ‘ the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ... ”"

As noted in the Bartik and Soltysyak cases, the confidential information which the applicants possessed could be transmitted in a variety of ways which did not require their presence abroad or even direct physical contact with anyone. In so far as the Government claimed that preventing the applicants from going abroad was intended to guarantee their own safety in foreign States, this argument appears disingenuous for the following reasons."
            ],
            [
                "95. If the stated purpose of the restriction on leaving Russia was to ensure the applicants ’ safety abroad, its application appears to have been inconsistent. It would seem rational to assume that the concern for the applicants ’ safety should have been greatest during their employment, so long as they had access to current sensitive information. However, rather paradoxically, it was during that period that the applicants ’ freedom to leave Russia was least restricted. Some applicants were allowed to go abroad on official business, as was Mr Berkovich who travelled more than once to France, China and Greece (see paragraph 7 above). It is more remarkable still that other applicants were authorised to leave Russia for purely private purposes; thus, Mr Boldyrev frequently visited his parents in Estonia, while Mr Litavrin and Mr Burnayev went on holidays abroad (see paragraphs 15, 30 and 47 above). The entitlement to travel abroad on business did not cease with the end of employment; the Ministry of Defence conceded as much in their reply to Mr Ilchenko ’ s challenge to the restriction (see paragraph 26 above). As it transpires, travelling for private purposes after the end of employment was the only form of travel that was restricted but the Government failed to explain the rationale behind such a selective approach to alleged concerns about the applicants ’ safety. A string of references to the Court ’ s judgments that mentioned national security in various contexts is not sufficient to lend credence to their claim."
            ],
            [
                "96. The Court finds no indication that the decisions by the Russian executive agencies restricting the applicants ’ right to travel abroad for private purposes were the result of an assessment of any security risks or of their individual situations. Even though the Constitutional Court held in 2012 that the need for the restriction had to be weighed against the concrete circumstances, such as the nature of the sensitive information, its historic and current confidential status, and the purpose of the trip (see paragraph 28 above), the Russian courts confined their review to formally verifying whether the restriction complied with the procedure for restricting their rights. Whether before or after the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, they made no attempt to evaluate whether the restriction was necessary for, and capable of, achieving the stated purpose and whether it corresponded to a pressing social need. The human cost of that formalistic approach was particularly high in the case of Mr Boldyrev. As long as he continued to work, he was able to visit his ageing parents in Estonia. After the termination of his employment, he was barred from visiting his ailing mother or attending her funeral. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances and the strong humanitarian considerations involved, the domestic authorities should have examined his request with particular care and scrutiny (compare Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 96, 6 December 2007). However, the Moscow City Court refused to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Boldyrev to justify the need to go abroad and declared that his mother ’ s poor health was “of no legal significance” (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the evolving circumstances (see Vlasov and Benyash, cited above, § 36, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "97. There remains the Government ’ s argument that the applicants forfeited their rights under Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 by entering into a contract of employment which contained such a restriction. The Court reiterates at the outset that – unlike some other Articles of the Convention such as Article 4 § 3 (d) or Article 11 § 2 – Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 does not make any distinction between civilians and members of the armed forces. Even though the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians, such a restriction must in all cases be capable of achieving its protective function, whereas, as the Court has found above, it was precisely the link between the means employed and the aim pursued that was missing in the instant case (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 53, and the case-law cited therein). In so far as the Government claimed that the applicants freely consented to the restriction, the Court observes that they did not have any influence on the terms of their employment, standard contracts making their continued employment conditional on having valid security clearance (see paragraph 51 above, and compare Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, ECHR 2006 ‑ I, and Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 48420/10 and 3 others, §§ 83 and 109, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). As the applicants pointed out, they were given a pay rise on account of their enhanced responsibility for handling confidential information. It was not compensation for their future inability to leave Russia, nor were they eligible for any such compensation after the termination of their employment as long as the impugned restriction was in force. The Court accordingly finds that the alleged waiver was neither unambiguous nor fully consensual and could not in any event affect its finding that the restriction was not related to the aim pursued."
            ],
            [
                "98. Lastly, the Court observes that, out of forty-seven member States of the Council of Europe, Russia has remained to date the only State that bars persons aware of State secrets from travelling abroad for private purposes (see paragraph 61 above). The Government ’ s reliance on the Azerbaijani law is misplaced, for – as the Court pointed out in the Soltysyak judgment in 2011 (cited above, § 51) – Azerbaijan abolished a similar travel ban in 2005. Belarus is not a member State of the Council of Europe and is not bound by the Convention provisions. Lastly, restrictions on travel to specific geographical zones that are affected by military hostilities may be called for as a measure of precaution but they are in no way comparable to the unqualified ban on leaving the applicants ’ own country that is at issue in the instant case. The UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual ’ s right to leave the country merely on the grounds that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see, for the full quote, Soltysyak, cited above, § 24). As the travel ban impugned in the instant case does not reflect an established European consensus and has no support among the Council of Europe member States, the respondent State was under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining it in place (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 51). However, the Government failed to discharge that obligation."

The Government submitted that Russia had to implement its accession commitments in the light of the requirements of the Russian Constitution, having regard to the balance existing in the specific historic context between, on the one hand, the need to ensure its own sovereignty and security and, on the other hand, the ongoing integration into the global world. As regards Russia ’ s commitment to cease to restrict international travel of persons aware of State secrets, the Government submitted that “the intention did not imply a full repeal of the restrictions, especially since the ‘ generally accepted ’ restrictions are not set out in any document”. At present, it could only be expected that the measures for the protection of State interests would be proportionate to the aim pursued and that the national law would be further developed with a possibility of gradually repealing such restrictions at some future point in time. Lastly, the Government pointed out that on 22 June 2011 the Interagency Commission had established a working group to explore common approaches to problematic issues relating to travel restrictions on individuals aware of State secrets. Its task was to develop methodology for determining the specific duration of the restriction, taking into account the extent of their awareness of State secrets and the exhaustive list of criteria for restricting the right to travel abroad. The working group had drafted two federal laws, one Presidential decree and two Government resolutions which were in the process of being approved by the executive authorities."

The applicants submitted that Russia ’ s failure to implement its accession commitment relating to the lifting of the travel ban on individuals aware of State secrets amounted to a structural problem. That problem had been highlighted in the Court ’ s judgments in the Bartik and Soltysyak cases, which had not been executed to date as regards general measures. The situation had not changed after the adoption by the Russian Constitutional Court of judgment no. 14-P, dated 7 June 2012, which had upheld the validity of the travel ban. The applicants emphasised that the accession commitments were considered as conditions sine qua non for Russia ’ s membership of the Council of Europe and that the Parliamentary Assembly regarded the travel restrictions as incompatible with the status of a member State. For many years Russia had taken no steps to amend the relevant legal provisions or practice and such a long period was clearly in breach of its undertaking to abolish the travel restrictions “with immediate effect”. The impugned restrictions affected hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens who had been waiting for too long for their abolition. Under Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a party could not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty, and Russia had to abide by its commitments."

                "113. The Court has found in the present case that a ban on the private travel of persons who have had access to State secrets is in violation of the Convention. The Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Opinion on Russia ’ s request for membership of the Council of Europe indicates that the repeal of restrictions on international travel for private purposes was regarded as a necessary condition for membership of the Council of Europe as the organisation of States adhering to the principles of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law (Preamble to the Statute of the Council of Europe) (see paragraph 60 above). The Court has previously expressed the view that the express mention in the Opinion on Russia ’ s accession request of Russia ’ s undertaking to cease, with immediate effect, restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggested that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe (see Bartik, cited above, § 50). The Russian Federation became a member State of the Council of Europe on 28 February 1996. However, it has not fulfilled that specific accession commitment to date, that is to say for more than twenty - two years."

It found that a restriction on the applicant ’ s right to leave his own country was not necessary in a democratic society and amounted to a violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (§§ 44-52). On 10 February 2011 the Court reiterated its findings in the similar case of Soltysyak v. Russia (cited above, §§ 46-54). It pointed out that Russia was the only member State that had retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of State secrets (§ 51). In June 2012 the Russian Constitutional Court also considered a challenge to the restriction brought by one of the applicants in the instant case, Mr Ilchenko. Although it held that it was generally compatible with the Russian Constitution, it called for a departure from the purely formalistic approach and for the adoption of a more nuanced approach tailored to the requirements of the specific situation (see paragraph 28 above)."

According to them, the Commission had produced a batch of draft documents and regulations. However, it does not appear that there was any follow-up action. As at the date of this judgment, that is to say six years later, the relevant provisions of domestic law – section 15 of the Entry and Exit Procedures Act and section 24 of the State Secrets Act – have not been amended or repealed and have retained the same absolute travel restriction on the rights of persons aware of State secrets."

Furthermore, even were it justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual ’ s freedom of movement may become disproportionate and breach that individual ’ s rights if it is automatically extended over a long period (see Luordo, cited above, § 96, ECHR 2003-IX, and Földes and Földesné Hajlik, cited above, § 35)."

The letter merely states that on the relevant dates the second applicant had been summoned to the Prosecutor's Office.

Consequently, their son had not been able to attend the interview and had had to sit the exams several days later. On that occasion the second applicant had accompanied him.

In order to decide whether a fair balance was struck between the general interest in the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings and the applicants'personal interest in enjoying freedom of movement, by contrast to Luordo and the subsequent cases against Italy, the Court must ascertain whether the applicants actually sought to leave the area of their residence and, if so, whether permission to do so was refused."

The Court notes in this regard that the letter of the acting district prosecutor provides no evidence that such an application had been filed. The letter merely states that on the relevant dates the second applicant had been summoned to the Prosecutor's Office. In the absence of any evidence that the applicants had filed any other applications to leave the place of their residence and, consequently, that any such applications had been refused, the Court can not reach the conclusion that a fair balance between the demands of the general interest and the applicants'rights was upset.

Furthermore, as the Court had previously found in cases raising similar issues, in the context of criminal proceedings in Ukraine such interference with a right of a criminal suspect or an accused is in accordance with law and, in principle, pursues a legitimate aim (see, among other authorities, Ivanov v. Ukraine, no. 15007/02, §§ 87-89, 7 December 2006). It remains to be seen whether such interference was “necessary in a democratic society”."

In view of the above, the Court considers that the restriction on the applicant’s freedom of movement for a period of five years and two months was disproportionate particularly given that he was forced to stay for all that period in a foreign country and was not allowed to leave even for a short period of time. At the same time, the Court notes that the proceedings against the applicant have been pending for a considerable time and no first-instance judgment has yet been given. What is more, the preventive measure applied to the applicant was eventually lifted and, with the agreement of the domestic court concerned, the proceedings are being conducted without his presence. Therefore, the Court finds that a fair balance between the demands of the general interest and the applicant’s rights was not achieved."

                "51. As for whether the measure was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court notes the following. Firstly, the Court considers that the applicant repeatedly raised a serious argument that the criminal charge against him had become time-barred in 1999. Under the 1960 Criminal Code the limitation period for prosecution in respect of the criminal offence with which the applicant was charged was five years from the time of commission of the alleged offence (see paragraphs 27-28 above). Since the applicant had never absconded the investigation, the running of the limitation period was never stopped under the 1960 Criminal Code. Neither the domestic authorities or courts, nor the Government have alleged that there were any other circumstances stopping the running of the limitation period in the applicant ’ s case or precluding the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings on that ground. Therefore, it appears that the criminal charge in question became time-barred on 10 September 1999 and it was up to the relevant prosecuting authorities to discontinue the proceedings on that date. As for the 2000 Criminal Code, it came into force after that date and was not applicable at the material time. In any event, since the 2000 Criminal Code provided for a longer limitation period for the same offence (seven years; see paragraphs 30-31 above), it appears that, although the criminal proceedings remained pending after its entry into force, it could not be applied retroactively to the applicant ’ s situation (see paragraph 29 above)."
            ],
            [
                "52. Despite the above argument being raised repeatedly by the applicant, the domestic prosecuting authorities and courts did not address it. Moreover, the Court finds regrettable the Nasimi District Court ’ s decision of 2 6 May 2008, subsequently upheld by the Baku Court of Appeal, finding that the domestic courts had no competence under the CCrP to examine complaints against the prosecuting authorities ’ failure to decide on discontinuation of the proceedings (see paragraphs 23-24 above). In essence, this meant that in situations where the prosecuting authorities arbitrarily and unlawfully refused to discontinue proceedings in cases where the alleged criminal offence had become time-barred, a person ’ s right to freedom of movement could remain restricted indefinitely, without an adequate remedy available to him to challenge the restriction."
            ],
            [
                "53. In this connection, the Court also points out that, although in the present case the applicant did not raise a complaint about the length of the criminal proceedings under Article 6 of the Convention, the fact that the criminal proceedings have been pending for around twenty years without any procedural activity had a significant impact on the proportionality of the restriction of his right to freedom of movement under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention imposed in connection with those criminal proceedings (compare, mutatis mutandis, Hajibeyli v. Azerbaijan, no. 16528/05, § § 64-66, 10 July 2008 )."
            ],
            [
                "54. Secondly, the Court notes that, prior to the refusal to renew the applicant ’ s passport in 2006, the applicant had been issued both regular and diplomatic passports on several occasions after the criminal proceedings had already been instituted and that he had travelled abroad on a number of occasions using those valid passports. Each time he had returned to Azerbaijan, where he had an active professional political career and had served as a member of parliament for more than one term. There were no indications that he had ever had an intention to remain abroad and escape prosecution. In such circumstances, the Court sees no compelling justification for the authorities ’ refusal to renew the passport in 2006."
            ],
            [
                "55. The Court also notes that, in accordance with Article 9 of the Passports Act, following the initial refusal to issue a passport, a repeat application for a passport could be examined only after the criminal proceedings were discontinued (see paragraph 26 above). Accordingly, it appears that no further decision can be taken while the criminal proceedings are still pending, resulting in a situation where the restriction on the applicant ’ s travel abroad has remained unchanged for around nine years since June 2006."
            ],
            [
                "56. The Court reiterates that the authorities are not entitled to maintain over lengthy periods a restriction on the individual ’ s freedom of movement without a regular re-examination of its justification (see Földes and Földesné Hajlik v. Hungary, no. 41463/02, § 36, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII ). Even in cases where the restriction was initially warranted, maintaining it automatically over a lengthy period of time may result in disproportionality of the measure (see Riener, cited above, § 121, with further references ). In the present case, as noted above, there was no examination of the justification for the restriction when the applicant was initially refused a new passport in 2006 and it appears that the domestic legal system does not provide any possibilities for a regular re-examination. Accordingly, the de facto travel ban imposed on the applicant by way of refusing him a new passport constituted, in reality, an automatic, blanket measure of indefinite duration. This runs counter to the authorities ’ duty under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to take appropriate care to ensure that any interference with the right to leave one ’ s country remains justified and proportionate throughout its duration in the individual circumstances of each case."

In particular, it notes that the present complaint does not concern the lawfulness of any particular procedural step or decision taken within the framework of the criminal proceedings against the applicant. The present complaint concerns the authorities ’ refusal to issue the applicant a passport on the ground that there were criminal proceedings pending against him. The applicant argued that the criminal proceedings should have been discontinued many years before, owing to the criminal charge against him having become time-barred. At the domestic level, he complained about the PRD ’ s failure to issue a passport and the prosecuting authorities ’ failure to discontinue the criminal proceedings both in the civil proceedings and in the framework of the pending criminal proceedings under the procedure of judicial supervision. Before that, he complained directly to the prosecuting authorities, including the Nasimi District Prosecutor ’ s Office, the Baku City Prosecutor ’ s Office and the Prosecutor General ’ s Office. Accordingly, the applicant raised the same complaint in substance before the domestic authorities and courts."

Having regard to the above, the Court does not consider that an additional complaint about the lawfulness of suspension of the criminal investigation within the framework of the pending criminal proceedings could have afforded any redress in respect of the present complaint. In the present case, whether the investigation remained suspended or was resumed had no bearing on the fact that the criminal proceedings themselves were still pending and that the applicant was apparently refused a passport on that ground. In sum, the Government failed to explain how the remedy suggested by them would provide redress in the applicant ’ s situation. Thus, the Court considers that the applicant has done what could have been reasonably expected of him to exhaust domestic remedies in the present case and that the Government have been unable to demonstrate existence of a remedy that could afford appropriate redress."

The applicant submitted that, as a well-known Azerbaijani politician, he had often been invited by various international organisations and foreign institutions to attend a number of events abroad but had been unable to leave the country owing to the authorities ’ refusal to renew his passport. He argued that the interference with his freedom of movement had been unlawful, because the criminal prescription period for the alleged criminal offence had expired by the time his passport had been up for renewal and the criminal proceedings should have been discontinued on that ground."

Any measure restricting that right must be lawful, pursue one of the legitimate aims referred to in the third paragraph of the above ‑ mentioned Convention provision and strike a fair balance between the public interest and the individual ’ s rights (see Baumann v.

According to the applicant, his application for a new passport was refused by the PRD in an “informal manner” and he was informed that the reason for the refusal was the fact that criminal proceedings were pending against him. As the Government remained silent on this point and did not contest the applicant ’ s submission, the Court accepts that the applicant ’ s application for a new passport was refused without a formal decision."

Neither did the Government elaborate on this point. Nevertheless, it appears that this measure was imposed in accordance with Article 9 of the Passports Act. However, contrary to that provision, the PRD did not issue a formal decision in writing, containing an explanation of the reasons for the rejection (see paragraph 26 above). Furthermore, taking into account the applicant ’ s argument that the criminal proceedings against him should have been discontinued several years earlier owing to the expiry of the criminal limitation period, a question arises whether it was at all lawful to apply Article 9 of the Passports Act in the applicant ’ s case."

In the present case, the issue arises whether the authorities ’ actions were guided by such legitimate aims."

            [
                "51. As for whether the measure was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court notes the following. Firstly, the Court considers that the applicant repeatedly raised a serious argument that the criminal charge against him had become time-barred in 1999. Under the 1960 Criminal Code the limitation period for prosecution in respect of the criminal offence with which the applicant was charged was five years from the time of commission of the alleged offence (see paragraphs 27-28 above). Since the applicant had never absconded the investigation, the running of the limitation period was never stopped under the 1960 Criminal Code. Neither the domestic authorities or courts, nor the Government have alleged that there were any other circumstances stopping the running of the limitation period in the applicant ’ s case or precluding the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings on that ground. Therefore, it appears that the criminal charge in question became time-barred on 10 September 1999 and it was up to the relevant prosecuting authorities to discontinue the proceedings on that date. As for the 2000 Criminal Code, it came into force after that date and was not applicable at the material time. In any event, since the 2000 Criminal Code provided for a longer limitation period for the same offence (seven years; see paragraphs 30-31 above), it appears that, although the criminal proceedings remained pending after its entry into force, it could not be applied retroactively to the applicant ’ s situation (see paragraph 29 above)."
            ],
            [
                "52. Despite the above argument being raised repeatedly by the applicant, the domestic prosecuting authorities and courts did not address it. Moreover, the Court finds regrettable the Nasimi District Court ’ s decision of 2 6 May 2008, subsequently upheld by the Baku Court of Appeal, finding that the domestic courts had no competence under the CCrP to examine complaints against the prosecuting authorities ’ failure to decide on discontinuation of the proceedings (see paragraphs 23-24 above). In essence, this meant that in situations where the prosecuting authorities arbitrarily and unlawfully refused to discontinue proceedings in cases where the alleged criminal offence had become time-barred, a person ’ s right to freedom of movement could remain restricted indefinitely, without an adequate remedy available to him to challenge the restriction."
            ],
            [
                "53. In this connection, the Court also points out that, although in the present case the applicant did not raise a complaint about the length of the criminal proceedings under Article 6 of the Convention, the fact that the criminal proceedings have been pending for around twenty years without any procedural activity had a significant impact on the proportionality of the restriction of his right to freedom of movement under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention imposed in connection with those criminal proceedings (compare, mutatis mutandis, Hajibeyli v. Azerbaijan, no. 16528/05, § § 64-66, 10 July 2008 )."

Secondly, the Court notes that, prior to the refusal to renew the applicant ’ s passport in 2006, the applicant had been issued both regular and diplomatic passports on several occasions after the criminal proceedings had already been instituted and that he had travelled abroad on a number of occasions using those valid passports. Each time he had returned to Azerbaijan, where he had an active professional political career and had served as a member of parliament for more than one term. There were no indications that he had ever had an intention to remain abroad and escape prosecution. In such circumstances, the Court sees no compelling justification for the authorities ’ refusal to renew the passport in 2006."

The Court also notes that, in accordance with Article 9 of the Passports Act, following the initial refusal to issue a passport, a repeat application for a passport could be examined only after the criminal proceedings were discontinued (see paragraph 26 above). Accordingly, it appears that no further decision can be taken while the criminal proceedings are still pending, resulting in a situation where the restriction on the applicant ’ s travel abroad has remained unchanged for around nine years since June 2006."

The Court reiterates that the authorities are not entitled to maintain over lengthy periods a restriction on the individual ’ s freedom of movement without a regular re-examination of its justification (see Földes and Földesné Hajlik v. Hungary, no. 41463/02, § 36, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII ). Even in cases where the restriction was initially warranted, maintaining it automatically over a lengthy period of time may result in disproportionality of the measure (see Riener, cited above, § 121, with further references ). In the present case, as noted above, there was no examination of the justification for the restriction when the applicant was initially refused a new passport in 2006 and it appears that the domestic legal system does not provide any possibilities for a regular re-examination. Accordingly, the de facto travel ban imposed on the applicant by way of refusing him a new passport constituted, in reality, an automatic, blanket measure of indefinite duration. This runs counter to the authorities ’ duty under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to take appropriate care to ensure that any interference with the right to leave one ’ s country remains justified and proportionate throughout its duration in the individual circumstances of each case."
