                "39. The Court must ascertain whether placement on the Sex Offenders Register can be considered as a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention or whether it constitutes a measure falling outside the scope of that provision (see Ibbotson v. the United Kingdom, no. 40146/98, Commission decision of 21 October 1998, unreported, and Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999, as regards placement on a register of sex offenders and, mutatis mutandis, Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV, as regards the retention by the authorities of DNA samples taken from the applicant)."
            ],
            [
                "40. In that connection the Court reiterates that the concept of a “penalty” in Article 7 is an autonomous one and that the Court remains free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “ penalty ” within the meaning of that provision. The wording of Article 7 § 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting ‑ point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “ criminal offence ”. Other factors that may be taken into account as relevant in this connection are the characterisation of the measure in question under national law; its nature and purpose; the procedures involved in the making and implementation of the measure; and its severity (see Welch, cited above, §§ 27 and 28)."
            ],
            [
                "41. In the present case the Court notes first of all that the applicant ’ s placement on the Sex Offenders Register was indeed the result of his conviction on 30 October 2003, since placement on the register is automatic in the case of persons who, like the applicant, have been sentenced to a prison term of over five years for a sexual offence."
            ],
            [
                "42. As to the legal characterisation in domestic law, the Court observes that according to the Constitutional Council the measure in question constitutes a “ public-order measure” rather than a sanction and that, in accordance with the unequivocal provisions of Article 706-53-1 of the CCP, the Sex Offenders Register is designed to prevent persons who have committed sexual offences or violent crimes from reoffending and to ensure that they can be identified and traced (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above)."
            ],
            [
                "43. As regards the purpose and nature of the measure complained of, the Court notes that the applicant regarded the fresh obligation imposed on him as punitive. However, the Court considers that the main aim of that obligation was to prevent reoffending. In that regard, it considers that the fact that a convicted offender ’ s address is known to the police or gendarmerie and the judicial authorities by virtue of his or her inclusion in the Sex Offenders Register constitutes a deterrent and facilitates police investigations. The obligation arising out of placement on the register therefore has a preventive and deterrent purpose and cannot be considered to be punitive in nature or as constituting a sanction."
            ],
            [
                "44. Furthermore, the Court notes that, while the applicant faces a two ‑ year prison sentence and a fine of 30,000 euros (EUR) if he fails to comply with that obligation, another set of proceedings, completely independent of the proceedings leading to his conviction on 30 October 2003, would then have to be initiated, during which the competent court could assess whether the failure to comply was culpable (see, conversely, Welch, cited above, § 14)."
            ],
            [
                "45. Lastly, as regards the severity of the measure, the Court reiterates that this is not decisive in itself (see Welch, cited above, § 32). It considers, in any event, that the obligation to provide proof of address every six months and to declare any change of address within fifteen days at the latest, albeit for a period of thirty years, is not sufficiently severe to amount to a “penalty”."
            ],
            [
                "46. In the light of all these considerations, the Court is of the view that placement on the Sex Offenders Register and the obligations arising out of it do not amount to a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention and should be considered as a preventive measure to which the principle set forth in that provision, namely that the law should not have retrospective effect, does not apply."

The court also took into consideration medical reports according to which the applicant suffered from congenital heart disease which made any physical activity impossible. The report advocated his placement under an enhanced prison regime with an individual cell, no exercise or physical activity, a salt-free diet and regular medication.

                "36. The Government did not dispute the fact that the Law of 9 March 2004 had not come into force either when the offence had been committed or when the applicant had been convicted. Nevertheless, they argued that the measure complained of did not constitute a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7. They sought to demonstrate this by referring to the criteria established by the Court ’ s case-law, in particular in Welch v. the United Kingdom ( 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A ) and Jamil v. France ( 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317 ‑ B ). While the Court had found, in Jamil, that imprisonment in default was a penalty, on the ground that “[t]he sanction imposed on Mr Jamil was ordered by a criminal court, was intended to be deterrent and could have led to a punitive deprivation of liberty” (§ 32), it had also ruled that special supervision was not comparable to a criminal sanction since it was designed to prevent the commission of offences ( they referred to Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, § 43, Series A no. 281 ‑ A ). In the Government ’ s submission, that was precisely the aim of security measures including placement on the Sex Offenders Register. They could be defined as social protection measures designed to prevent persons from reoffending or to remove a source of danger. They were based not on the offender ’ s guilt but on the danger he or she represented. Hence, placement on the Sex Offenders Register was carried out “as a security measure” (Article 706-53-5 of the CCP) and was not a sanction. Point 4 of Article 706-53-2 of the CCP provided for a person ’ s details to be entered in the register even where a decision had been given discontinuing the proceedings or discharging or acquitting the person concerned on the basis of the first paragraph of Article 122-1 of the Criminal Code, according to which “persons who, at the time of the offence, were suffering from a psychiatric or neuropsychiatric disorder which deprived them of the ability to discern or control their actions [were] not criminally liable”."

In that regard, it considers that the fact that a convicted offender ’ s address is known to the police or gendarmerie and the judicial authorities by virtue of his or her inclusion in the Sex Offenders Register constitutes a deterrent and facilitates police investigations.

Lastly, the Government submitted that society ’ s interest in the prevention of sexual offences had to be weighed against the seriousness of the infringement of the applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life. In their view, the establishment of the Sex Offenders Register was part of the gradual introduction of a specific set of rules governing sexual offences, which was justified by the comparatively recent increase in awareness concerning the special character of such offences. The latter stemmed from the fact that these offenders often had personality disorders, which were a real factor in reoffending, and from the particular suffering caused to the victims, especially if they were minors at the time of the offence. Hence, the national authorities had put in place a combination of punitive and preventive measures. The establishment of the Sex Offenders Register in that connection had been aimed at filling gaps in the system of prevention in relation to the particularly serious category of sexual offences. The Government added that it was clear from the Court ’ s case-law that the Court did not dispute States ’ right, in seeking to prevent offending, to gather and store personal data provided that “ there exist [ed] adequate and effective guarantees against abuse ” ( they referred to Leander v.

Only persons who had committed the serious sexual offences referred to in Article 706-47 of the above- mentioned Code were affected, and only such offences automatically gave rise to placement on the register."

As to the other guarantees provided for by the law, the Government pointed out that the length of time for which the information was kept (twenty or thirty years) depended on the seriousness of the offence. This was a maximum period, and the persons concerned could request the deletion from the register of the information concerning them. The request could be made to three authorities: the public prosecutor, the liberties and detention judge and the President of the Investigation Division. This three ‑ pronged approach constituted a triple guarantee. In the instant case, the fact that the applicant ’ s conviction was entered in his criminal record made any request for deletion of the information in the Sex Offenders Register inadmissible. However, the applicant had the option of applying for judicial rehabilitation, which would wipe the conviction from the criminal records. Moreover, the Sex Offenders Register could be consulted only by certain authorities that were bound by a duty of confidentiality, and in precisely defined circumstances. Lastly, it was not possible to compare the data in the Sex Offenders Register with data held elsewhere."

The Court stresses that it is not its task at this stage to speculate on the sensitive nature or otherwise of the information gathered or on the possible difficulties experienced by the applicant. According to its case-law, the storing by a public authority of information relating to an individual ’ s private life amounts to interference within the meaning of Article 8. The subsequent use of the stored information has no bearing on that finding (see, mutatis mutandis, Leander, cited above, § 48, and Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, § 53, Reports 1998 ‑ II ). More specifically, the Court has already ruled that the requirement for persons convicted of sexual offences to inform the police of their name, date of birth, address or change of address falls within the scope of Article 8 § 1 of the Convention (see Adamson, cited above)."

The protection of personal data is of fundamental importance to a person ’ s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention.

In line with its findings in S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom ( [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 103, ECHR 2008 ), the Court is of the view that the need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned, not least when such data are used for police purposes. The domestic law should notably ensure that such data are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored and that they are preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above, in particular Article 5 of the Data Protection Convention and the Preamble thereto and Principle 7 of Recommendation No. R (87) 15 of the Committee of Ministers regulating the use of personal data in the police sector).

The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative.

Russia, no. 59261/00, § 96, ECHR 2006 ‑ III; Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § 57, 15 November 2007; and Ziliberberg v. Moldova, no. 61821/00, § § 32-35, 1 February 2005 )."

By its nature, the inclusion of the offence of “minor disorderly acts” in the Code of Administrative Offences served to guarantee the protection of human dignity and public order, values and interests which normally fall within the sphere of protection of criminal law. The corresponding provision of the Code was directed towards all citizens rather than towards a group possessing a special status. The reference to the “minor” nature of the acts does not, in itself, exclude its classification as “criminal” in the autonomous sense of the Convention, as there is nothing in the Convention to suggest that the criminal nature of an offence, within the meaning of the Engel criteria, necessarily requires a certain degree of seriousness (see Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 104). Finally, the Court considers that the primary aims in establishing the offence in question were punishment and deterrence, which are recognised as characteristic features of criminal penalties (ibid., §§ 102 and 105)."

The Court observes that Article 158 of the Code of Administrative Offences provided for fifteen days ’ imprisonment as the maximum penalty and that the applicant was eventually sentenced to serve three days ’ deprivation of liberty. As the Court has confirmed on many occasions, in a society subscribing to the rule of law, where the penalty liable to be and actually imposed on an applicant involves the loss of liberty, there is a presumption that the charges against the applicant are “ criminal ”, a presumption which can be rebutted entirely exceptionally, and only if the deprivation of liberty cannot be considered “appreciably detrimental” given their nature, duration or manner of execution (see Engel and Others, § 82, and Ezeh and Connors, § 126, both cited above).

There is a necessary implication in the ne bis in idem principle, enshrined in that Article, that the Contracting States have mutual trust in their criminal justice systems and that each of them recognises the criminal law in force in the other Contracting States even when the outcome would be different if its own national law were applied ([ Case C-385/01 ] Gözütok and Brügge [ [2003] ECR I-1345 ], paragraph 33).",

The above findings are further reinforced by the objective of Article 54 of the CISA, which is to ensure that no one is prosecuted for the same acts in several Contracting States on account of his having exercised his right to freedom of movement ( Gözütok and Brügge, paragraph 38, and Case C-469/03 Miraglia [2005] ECR I-2009, paragraph 32).",

On the other hand, if the material acts do not make up such an inseparable whole, the mere fact that the court before which the second prosecution is brought finds that the alleged perpetrator of those acts acted with the same criminal intention does not suffice to indicate that there is a set of concrete circumstances which are inextricably linked together covered by the notion of ‘ same acts ’ within the meaning of Article 54 of the CISA.",

The State could improve its presentation of proof with each trial, assessing which witnesses gave the most persuasive testimony, which documents had the greatest impact, which opening and closing arguments most persuaded the jurors. Corbin would be forced either to contest each of these trials or to plead guilty to avoid the harassment and expense.",

As we suggested in Vitale, the double -jeopardy clause bars any subsequent prosecution in which the government, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted. ... The critical inquiry is what conduct the State will prove, not the evidence the State will use to prove that conduct ...

Otherwise, the application of this provision would be left to the discretion of the Contracting States to a degree that might lead to results incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention (see, most recently, Storbråten v. Norway (dec.), no. 12277/04, 1 February 2007, with further references ). The notion of “penal procedure” in the text of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 must be interpreted in the light of the general principles concerning the corresponding words “criminal charge” and “penalty” in Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention respectively (see Haarvig v.

The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, as recent authorities, Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, § § 30-31, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIV, and Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § § 82-86, ECHR 2003 ‑ X )."

Russia, no. 59261/00, § 96, ECHR 2006 ‑ III; Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § 57, 15 November 2007; and Ziliberberg v. Moldova, no. 61821/00, § § 32-35, 1 February 2005 )."

By its nature, the inclusion of the offence of “minor disorderly acts” in the Code of Administrative Offences served to guarantee the protection of human dignity and public order, values and interests which normally fall within the sphere of protection of criminal law. The corresponding provision of the Code was directed towards all citizens rather than towards a group possessing a special status. The reference to the “minor” nature of the acts does not, in itself, exclude its classification as “criminal” in the autonomous sense of the Convention, as there is nothing in the Convention to suggest that the criminal nature of an offence, within the meaning of the Engel criteria, necessarily requires a certain degree of seriousness (see Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 104). Finally, the Court considers that the primary aims in establishing the offence in question were punishment and deterrence, which are recognised as characteristic features of criminal penalties (ibid., §§ 102 and 105)."

The Court observes that Article 158 of the Code of Administrative Offences provided for fifteen days ’ imprisonment as the maximum penalty and that the applicant was eventually sentenced to serve three days ’ deprivation of liberty. As the Court has confirmed on many occasions, in a society subscribing to the rule of law, where the penalty liable to be and actually imposed on an applicant involves the loss of liberty, there is a presumption that the charges against the applicant are “ criminal ”, a presumption which can be rebutted entirely exceptionally, and only if the deprivation of liberty cannot be considered “appreciably detrimental” given their nature, duration or manner of execution (see Engel and Others, § 82, and Ezeh and Connors, § 126, both cited above).

On the other hand, the charge of “disorderly acts” under Article 213 of the Criminal Code brought against the applicant had referred to the same facts as those forming the basis for his conviction under Article 158 of the Code of Administrative Offences. Given that the offence of “minor disorderly acts” as defined in Article 158 and that of “disorderly acts” under Article 213 had the same essential elements, namely disturbance of public order, the Chamber concluded that the applicant had been prosecuted for an offence of which he had already been convicted previously."

The notion of “flagrant displays of disrespect towards the community” under Article 213 essentially encompassed “utterance of obscenities [and] offensive behaviour towards others” under Article 158. The applicant referred to the jurisprudence of the Russian Supreme Court, which had held since 1978 that one act could constitute either an administrative offence of “minor disorderly acts” or a crime of “disorderly acts” but never both (see paragraph 30 above).

According to the Government, given the requirements that the administrative proceedings be conducted “speedily” and within a “reasonable time”, the domestic authorities had been unable to prosecute those actions on the part of the applicant immediately as they had been occupied with bringing the applicant before a judge. The institution of criminal proceedings had necessitated additional time and the completion of specific procedural acts.

The administrative offence was less serious than the crime since it covered merely a deviation from established social and moral norms, whereas the crime implied the use of violence and resistance against a public official. The Government pointed out that not only were “minor disorderly acts” punishable by a shorter term of imprisonment, but the conditions of administrative detention were also better than they would be in a prison where convicted criminals served their sentences.

The lay meaning of “ infraction ” or “offence” related to the offender ’ s conduct. That confusion was maintained by the instruments of international law, which in fact used both expressions (“offences” and “facts ” ). This explained why “offence” had been translated as “ les mêmes faits ” in the French version of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement signed in 1990."

Switzerland (30 July 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ V) signalled a new departure, whereby the Court accepted that different courts could adjudicate on “separate offences, even if they [were] all part of a single criminal act”.

The adoption of the “same facts” approach would enhance the credibility of the Court ’ s case-law concerning an inalienable right which must never be subject to national discretionary powers.",

                "71. The first approach, which focuses on the “same conduct” on the applicant ’ s part irrespective of the classification in law given to that conduct ( idem factum ), is exemplified in the Gradinger judgment. In that case Mr Gradinger had been criminally convicted of causing death by negligence and also fined in administrative proceedings for driving under the influence of alcohol. The Court found that although the designation, nature and purpose of the two offences were different, there had been a breach of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 in so far as both decisions had been based on the same conduct by the applicant (see Gradinger, cited above, § 55)."
            ],
            [
                "72. The second approach also proceeds from the premise that the conduct by the defendant which gave rise to prosecution is the same, but posits that the same conduct may constitute several offences ( concours idéal d ’ infractions ) which may be tried in separate proceedings. That approach was developed by the Court in the case of Oliveira (cited above), in which the applicant had been convicted first of failing to control her vehicle and subsequently of negligently causing physical injury. Her car had veered onto the other side of the road, hitting one car and then colliding with a second, whose driver had sustained serious injuries. The Court found that the facts of the case were a typical example of a single act constituting various offences, whereas Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 only prohibited people from being tried twice for the same offence. In the Court ’ s view, although it would have been more consistent with the principle of the proper administration of justice if the sentence in respect of both offences had been passed by the same court in a single set of proceedings, the fact that two sets of proceedings were at issue in the case in question was not decisive. The fact that separate offences, even where they were all part of a single criminal act, were tried by different courts did not give rise to a breach of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, especially where the penalties were not cumulative (see Oliveira, cited above, § § 25-29). In the subsequent case of Göktan the Court also held that there had been no violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 because the same criminal conduct of which the applicant had been convicted constituted two separate offences: a crime of dealing in illegally imported drugs and a customs offence of failing to pay the customs fine (see Göktan, cited above, § 50). This approach was also employed in the cases of Gauthier v. France ( ( dec. ), no. 61178/00, 24 June 2003) and Öngün v. Turkey ( ( dec. ), no. 15737/02, 10 October 2006)."

Austria ( no. 37950/97, 29 May 2001 ), the Court confirmed that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 tolerated prosecution for several offences arising out of a single criminal act ( concours idéal d ’ infractions ). However, since it would be incompatible with this provision if an applicant could be tried or punished again for offences which were merely “nominally different”, the Court held that it should additionally examine whether or not such offences had the same “essential elements”. As in Mr Fischer ’ s case the administrative offence of drunken driving and the crime of causing death by negligence while “allowing himself to be intoxicated” had the same “essential elements”, the Court found a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. It also pointed out that had the two offences for which the person concerned was prosecuted only overlapped slightly, there would have been no reason to hold that the defendant could not be prosecuted for each of them in turn. The same approach was followed in the case of W.F. v. Austria ( no. 38275/97, 30 May 2002 ) and Sailer v. Austria ( no. 38237/97, 6 June 2002), both of which were based on a similar set of circumstances."

In Manasson the “essential element” distinguishing the taxation-law contravention from the criminal-law offence was found to be “the applicant ’ s reliance on the incorrect information contained in the books when submitting his tax returns” (see Manasson, cited above). Similarly, in Bachmaier, the Court noted that the special aggravating element of drunken driving had been established only in one set of proceedings (see Bachmaier v. Austria (dec.), no. 77413/01, 2 September 2004)."

In Hauser-Sporn it held that the offence of abandoning a victim and the offence of failing to inform the police about an accident differed in their criminal intent and also concerned different acts and omissions (see Hauser-Sporn v. Austria, no. 37301/03, § § 43-46, 7 December 2006 ). In Schutte the “essential element” of one offence was the use of dangerous threat or force as a means of resisting the exercise of official authority, whereas the other concerned a simple omission in the context of road safety, namely the failure to stop at the request of the police (see Schutte, cited above, § 42)."

It is against this background that the Court is now called upon to provide a harmonised interpretation of the notion of the “same offence” – the idem element of the non bis in idem principle – for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. While it is in the interests of legal certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law that the Court should not depart, without good reason, from precedents laid down in previous cases, a failure by the Court to maintain a dynamic and evolutive approach would risk rendering it a bar to reform or improvement (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v.

The difference between the terms “same acts” or “same cause” (“ mêmes faits ”) on the one hand and the term “ [same] offence” (“ [même] infraction ”) on the other was held by the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to be an important element in favour of adopting the approach based strictly on the identity of the material acts and rejecting the legal classification of such acts as irrelevant.

As regards the proceedings brought against the applicant, the Court observes, firstly, that on 4 January 2002 the District Court convicted the applicant of an offence of “minor disorderly acts” under Article 158 of the Code of Administrative Offences. Although the District Court ’ s judgment contained only one sentence relevant to the establishment of the facts and did not mention any evidence, it may be reasonably assumed that it was based on the administrative offence report which had been compiled by the police and submitted to the District Court (see paragraph 15 above). It transpires that the applicant was found guilty in the administrative proceedings of swearing at police employees and breaching public order shortly after his arrival at police station no. 9."

Firstly, he was charged with “disorderly acts” under Article 213 of the Criminal Code for swearing at Ms Y. and Captain S. and breaching public order in the immediate aftermath of his arrival at police station no. 9. Secondly, he was charged with insulting a public official under Article 319 of the Criminal Code for swearing at Major K. in his office while the latter was drafting the administrative offence report.

Hence, there was no temporal or spatial unity between the three episodes. It follows that although in essence the applicant ’ s conduct was substantially similar during the entire day of 4 January 2002 – in that he continued to be verbally abusive towards various officials – it was not a continuous act but rather different manifestations of the same conduct shown on a number of distinct occasions (compare Raninen, cited above)."

The definition of the offence of “minor disorderly acts” under Article 158 referred to three types of prohibited conduct: “utterance of obscenities in public”, “offensive behaviour towards others” and “other acts that breach public order”. Each of these elements was in itself sufficient for a finding of guilt. Of these, the District Court took account of two elements: uttering obscenities and failure to respond to reprimands, which could be interpreted as a form of “acts that breach public order”."

This charge required the prosecution to prove that the defendant had (a) seriously breached public order or displayed flagrant disrespect towards the community; (b) used violence or threatened the use of violence; and (c) resisted a public official. The prosecution ’ s case was that the applicant had uttered obscenities at Ms Y. and Captain S. and had also pushed the latter and threatened him with physical violence. It is not the Court ’ s task to decide whether each of these elements was properly substantiated because, as it has been noted above, a conviction in the second proceedings is not a required element in order for the guarantee of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to apply, it being sufficient for the applicant to have been liable to be tried and/or to have actually been tried on these charges."

The facts that gave rise to the administrative charge against the applicant related to a breach of public order in the form of swearing at the police officials Ms Y. and Captain S. and pushing the latter. The same facts formed the central element of the charge under Article 213 of the Criminal Code, according to which the applicant had breached public order by uttering obscenities, threatening Captain S. with violence and providing resistance to him. Thus, the facts in the two sets of proceedings differed in only one element, namely the threat of violence, which had not been mentioned in the first proceedings. Accordingly, the Court finds that the criminal charge under Article 213 § 2 (b) embraced the facts of the offence under Article 158 of the Code of Administrative Offences in their entirety and that, conversely, the offence of “minor disorderly acts” did not contain any elements not contained in the offence of “disorderly acts ”. The facts of the two offences must therefore be regarded as substantially the same for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. As the Court has emphasised above, the facts of the two offences serve as its sole point of comparison, and the Government ’ s argument that they were distinct on account of the seriousness of the penalty they entailed is therefore of no relevance for its inquiry.",

Similarly, he had been prosecuted, tried and eventually acquitted of the offence of “disorderly acts”, although he had been convicted previously of an offence of “minor disorderly acts” which had the same essential elements.

By contrast, in the instant case a mere reference to the administrative proceedings against the applicant in the judgment of 2 December 2002 could not be interpreted as an acknowledgement of a violation of the applicant ’ s right not to be tried twice. No mention of the non bis in idem principle had been made in the judgment, whether as a norm of the Constitution, of international human rights law or of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As a matter of Russian law, the applicant could not benefit from that principle anyway, as the guarantee against duplication of proceedings was applicable only to “crimes”, whereas the applicant had been convicted of an offence classified as administrative.

This is the case when it is irrevocable, that is to say when no further ordinary remedies are available or when the parties have exhausted such remedies or have permitted the time-limit to expire without availing themselves of them ’ ”. This approach is well entrenched in the Court ’ s case-law (see, for example, Nikitin v. Russia, no. 50178/99, § 37, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII, and Horciag v. Romania (dec.), no. 70982/01, 15 March 2005)."

On the other hand, extraordinary remedies such as a request for the reopening of the proceedings or an application for extension of the expired time-limit are not taken into account for the purposes of determining whether the proceedings have reached a final conclusion (see Nikitin, cited above, § 39). Although these remedies represent a continuation of the first set of proceedings, the “final” nature of the decision does not depend on their being used. It is important to point out that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 does not preclude the reopening of the proceedings, as stated clearly by the second paragraph of Article 4."

On 29 May 2006 the applicant was formally indicted by the Brno municipal prosecutor for having, at least between 2000 and 8 February 2006, repeatedly abused his wife both physically and mentally while he was drunk. He was accused of having subjected her to verbal abuse, hit her on the head with his hand and fist, slapped her, held her by the throat, tried to strangle her, thrown her against the furniture or onto the ground, pushed her down stairs and kicked her. He was further accused of having hit the children, gambled away the household ’ s money on gaming machines and smashed the crockery. As a result, his wife had sustained haematomas, bruising and a fractured nose and had been obliged to seek medical assistance on that account on 26 June 2000, 18 July 2003 and 8 February 2006 following assaults committed on 2 4 June 2000, 17 July 2003 and 8 February 2006 respectively. The applicant had allegedly sought to undermine his wife psychologically in order to control her. According to the prosecutor, the applicant had thus committed the “ continuing ” criminal offence (trvající trestný čin) of abusing a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a §§ 1 and 2 (b) of the Criminal Code, given that his conduct prior to the introduction of that offence on 1 June 2004 had amounted to the offence of violence against an individual or group of individuals under Article 197a of the Criminal Code and assault occasioning bodily harm under Article 221 of the Code."

It sentenced him to a suspended term of two and a half years ’ imprisonment and placed him on probation for five years. The applicant was also placed under supervision and ordered to undergo treatment for alcohol dependency. The court based its decision on the statements given by the applicant, the victim (his wife) and several witnesses, including the couple ’ s two children – who reported, among other incidents, ten instances of the applicant verbally insulting his wife, four instances of the applicant grabbing his wife by the arms and strangling her, and verbal and/or physical assaults committed by the applicant on his wife at monthly intervals – and on documentary evidence and expert reports. It also took into account the fact that the applicant had confessed to quarrels and physical violence in his relationship with his wife; he admitted in particular that he had sometimes slapped his wife or hit her with his fist.",

Lastly, the court considered that, owing to the duration of the conduct in question, the offence committed in the present case presented a relatively high degree of danger which justified a sentence ranging from two to eight years ’ imprisonment under paragraph 2 of Article 215a of the Criminal Code. Taking into consideration the extenuating circumstances (in particular the fact that the applicant had confessed and that he had no previous convictions), it imposed a suspended sentence situated at the lower end of the range."

On this point the Supreme Court noted, referring to its ruling Tzn 12/93 of 8 December 1993, that where there was, as in the case at hand, a “ continuation of the criminal offence ” ( pokračování v trestném činu ), which was considered to constitute a single act, its classification in criminal law had to be assessed under the law in force at the time of completion of the last occurrence of the offence. That law therefore also applied to the earlier acts, provided that these would have amounted to criminal conduct under the previous law. In the instant case the Supreme Court considered that the applicant ’ s conduct prior to the amendment of the Criminal Code on 1 June 2004 had amounted at least to an offence punishable under Article 197a or Article 221 § 1 of the Criminal Code. After examining the file it also concluded that the accused ’ s actions as described in the operative part of the first - instance court ’s judgment disclosed all the legal elements of the offence of abusing a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a §§ 1 and 2 (b) of the Criminal Code. Concerning the continuation of the offence, the Supreme Court noted that the abuse itself amounted to ill-treatment characterised by a certain duration. For the offence to be regarded as having continued over a long period of time it had to have lasted for some months. As the applicant had perpetrated the offence in question at least from 2000 until 8 February 2006, that is, over a period of several years, his conduct certainly disclosed the material element of continuation of the offence of abuse under Article 215a § 2 (b) of the Criminal Code."

Two different approaches were developed by scholars and legislatures, based on a subjective and an objective view of the notion of a continuous criminal offence. According to the subjective view, which existed, for instance, in Italy (see, for example, Article 81 of the 1930 Italian Criminal Code), a continuous criminal offence was a group of acts united by a single intention, by one single criminal plan. According to the objective view, developed mainly in Germany (see, for example, Article 110 of the 1813 Bavarian Criminal Code), a continuous criminal offence was based on the repeated intention of the offender to attack the same or similar object or legally protected interest ( Rechtsgut ). Moreover, the fact that the repetition of the criminal acts and of the criminal intention was facilitated by the material circumstances – involving the offender, the close temporal connection and the identity of the legally protected interest affected – was seen as justifying the imposition of a lighter penalty on the offender. This objective perspective gained support all over Europe, with some countries incorporating it in their legislation. However, in order to avoid excessive leniency towards repeat offenders, certain legislatures restricted the application of this concept to specific categories of crimes."

On the basis of the above considerations, the Court notes that the notion of a continuous criminal offence is not only a commonly used legislative and judicial approach to penalising a particular type of conduct, but is also specifically aimed at applying more lenient sentencing rules (see, by way of comparison, Maktouf and Damjanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 70, ECHR 2013 ). It can be said that the concept of a continuous criminal offence confers two benefits on the offender:",

It accepted that, from the standpoint of Czech law, extending the application of the Criminal Code, as worded after 1 June 2004, to acts committed by the applicant prior to that date had not amounted to retroactive application of the criminal law. It also observed that the interpretation of the general concept of a continuation of a criminal offence as defined in Article 89 § 3 of the Criminal Code had been based on the clear and established case-law of the Supreme Court which had been developed prior to the date on which the applicant had first assaulted his wife. In so far as the applicant disputed the effects of that interpretation, which in his view had in fact resulted in retroactive application of the law, the Chamber held that the interpretation adopted by the courts in the present case had not in itself been unreasonable, given that a continuous offence, by definition, extended over a certain period of time and that it was not arbitrary to consider that it had ceased at the time of the last occurrence of the offence. Moreover, the Czech authorities had observed that the applicant ’ s acts had at all times been punishable as criminal offences. In these circumstances the relevant legal provisions, together with the interpretative case-law, had been such as to enable the applicant to foresee the legal consequences of his acts and adapt his conduct accordingly.",

In his opinion, the domestic authorities ought not to have classified his acts as a continuous offence because his assaults had not been driven by the same intent, nor had they been closely connected in time since there had been an interval of several years between the different assaults. He also pointed out that when the proceedings took place before the first-instance court, the prosecution of two individual assaults had already been statute - barred and they could not therefore be the subject of criminal proceedings."

In the applicant ’ s opinion, his acts had not been punishable as criminal offences but simply as regulatory offences. He had thus been convicted of acts which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time they were committed, in breach of Article 7 of the Convention."

The Government noted that both Article 89 § 3 and Article 215a of the Criminal Code had been incorporated into the Czech legal system well before the applicant had ceased his criminal conduct in February 2006. At the relevant time there had also existed a considerable body of case-law in respect of continuous offences and the interpretation of Article 89 § 3 of the Criminal Code which followed the same logic as that applied in the instant case. It was thus clearly established that the conduct should be assessed as a single offence under the law in force at the time it came to an end. Moreover, in the Government ’ s view, the introduction on 1 June 2004 of Article 21 5a of the Criminal Code had rendered the likelihood of the applicant ’ s being held criminally liable even clearer and more foreseeable. Indeed, the new Article 215a of the Criminal Code dealt with unlawful conduct in a more comprehensive manner than Articles 197a and 221. Since the applicant had continued his unlawful acts after 1 June 2004, he could and should have expected to be held criminally liable under Article 215a of the Criminal Code for all his acts including those that had preceded the change in the legislation."

Contrary to what had been suggested by the applicant, the Government asserted that the requirement of a close temporal connection between the assaults constituting the continuous offence had also been satisfied in this case. They conceded that the close temporal connection as defined by domestic judicial practice generally referred to days, weeks or months. However, a maximum limit had never been set and the notion necessarily allowed for flexibility depending on the nature of the offence in question. It followed from the evidence gathered in the case and from the domestic courts ’ reasoning that the three incidents which occurred on 24 June 2000, 17 July 2003 and 8 February 2006 had been singled out as the most violent. The courts had consistently held that the applicant ’ s unlawful conduct had spanned a period of several years and that the individual assaults perpetrated by him had been of varying intensity and recurrent in nature, occurring within weeks of each other. Furthermore, the bill of indictment as well as the domestic courts ’ decisions had clearly stated that the applicant was being tried for actions carried out before and after the entry into force of Article 215a, actions which could not be separated from each other. The requirement of legal certainty had thus been met as a result of the consistent assessment of the case by the prosecution and the courts ( the Government cited, to converse effect, Ecer and Zeyrek v. Turkey, nos. 29295/95 and 29363/95, §§ 33-35, ECHR 2001 ‑ II). It was clear from the conviction itself that the courts were also of the view that the applicant ’ s actions taken as a whole had disclosed the elements of the offence defined by Article 215a of the Criminal Code."

The Government therefore concluded that the requirement of a sufficiently clear and foreseeable legal basis had been satisfied, that the new criminal law had not been applied retroactively and that the applicant had not been given a heavier penalty than under the old law. In this regard, they assumed that, had the concept of a continuous offence as understood by the Czech courts been abandoned and the applicant ’ s actions before and after 1 June 2004 been assessed separately, the applicant ’ s possible sentence would have been either the same or more severe than the one actually imposed. Indeed, in that event the applicant would have been tried for multiple offences punishable by a concurrent sentence which would have been defined on the basis of the provision concerning the most serious offence, that is to say, Article 215a of the Criminal Code. Moreover, the existence of multiple criminal offences and the duration of the conduct in question would have constituted aggravating circumstances."

                "“ (a) Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege",
                "77. The guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 even in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 34, Series A no. 335-B; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 3 2, Series A no. 335 ‑ C; and Kafkaris [ v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04 ], ... § 137[, ECHR 2008 ]).",
                "78. Article 7 of the Convention is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage (concerning the retrospective application of a penalty, see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 36, Series A no. 307 ‑ A; Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, § 35, Series A no. 317 ‑ B; Ecer and Zeyrek v. Turkey, nos. 29295/95 and 29363/95, § 36, ECHR 2001 ‑ II; and Mihai Toma v. Romania, no. 1051/06, §§ 26-31, 24 January 2012). It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege – see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260-A). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy (see Coëme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 145, ECHR 2000-VII; for an example of the application of a penalty by analogy, see Başkaya and Okçuoğlu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 23536/94 and 24408/94, §§ 42 ‑ 43, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV).",
                "79. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision, if need be with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and after taking appropriate legal advice, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable and what penalty he faces on that account (see Cantoni v. France, 15 November 1996, § 29, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V, and Kafkaris, cited above, § 140).",
                "80. The Court must therefore verify that at the time when an accused person performed the act which led to his being prosecuted and convicted there was in force a legal provision which made that act punishable, and that the punishment imposed did not exceed the limits fixed by that provision (see Coëme and Others, cited above, § 145, and Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, § 43, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV).",
                "(b) The concept of a ‘ penalty ’ and its scope",
                "(c) Foreseeability of criminal law",
                "91. When speaking of ‘ law ’ Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statutory law as well as case-law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see Kokkinakis, cited above, §§ 40 ‑ 41; Cantoni, cited above, § 29; Coëme and Others, cited above, § 145; and E.K. v. Turkey, no. 28496/95, § 51, 7 February 2002 ). These qualitative requirements must be satisfied as regards both the definition of an offence and the penalty the offence carries.",
                "92. It is a logical consequence of the principle that laws must be of general application that the wording of statutes is not always precise. One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 40, and Cantoni, cited above, § 31). However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 141).",
                "93. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain ( ibid. ). The progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition in the Convention States (see Kruslin v. France, 24 April 1990, § 29, Series A no. 176 ‑ A). Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 36; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 34; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz [ v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96 and 2 others, § 50 [, ECHR 2001 ‑ II]; K.-H.W. v. Germany [GC], no. 37201/97, § 85, 22 March 2001; Korbely v. Hungary [GC], no. 9174/02, § 71, ECHR 2008; and Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, § 185, ECHR 2010). The lack of an accessible and reasonably foreseeable judicial interpretation can even lead to a finding of a violation of the accused ’ s Article 7 rights (see, concerning the constituent elements of the offence, Pessino v. France, no. 40403/02, §§ 35-36, 10 October 2006, and Dragotoniu and Militaru-Pidhorni v. Romania, nos. 77193/01 and 77196/01, §§ 43-44, 24 May 2007; as regards the penalty, see Alimuçaj v. Albania, no. 20134/05, §§ 154-62, 7 February 2012).

Romania, no. 24916/05, § 59, 24 May 2011). More generally, the Court points out that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. Its role is thus confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Waite and Kennedy v.

Thus, it is not for the Court to express an opinion on whether the acts committed by the applicant before 1 June 2004 comprised the constituent elements of criminal offences defined by the above provisions (see, mutatis mutandis, Lehideux and Isorni v.

In the aforementioned judgments the Court observed that, by definition, such an offence was a type of crime committed over a period of time (see Veeber, cited above, § 35). It further held that, when an accused was charged with a “continuing” offence, the principle of legal certainty required that the acts which went to make up that offence, and which entailed his criminal liability, be clearly set out in the bill of indictment. Furthermore, the decision rendered by the domestic court also had to make it clear that the accused ’ s conviction and sentence resulted from a finding that the elements of a “continuing” offence had been made out by the prosecution (see Ecer and Zeyrek, cited above, § 33)."

The Convention may not act as a bar to this kind of judicial interpretation, provided that the conclusions reached by the domestic courts are reasonably foreseeable within the meaning of the Court ’ s case-law (see Previti v.

As a result, his wife had sustained serious injuries obliging her to seek medical assistance on 26 June 2000, 18 July 2003 and 8 February 2006 (see paragraph 10 above). In its judgment of 21 February 2008, the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts ’ legal classification of the offence as abuse of a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a of the Criminal Code, as in force since 1 June 2004, and applied that provision also to the abuse perpetrated by the applicant against his wife before that date. In that connection, the Supreme Court referred to its ruling ( Tzn 12/93) of 8 December 1993 to the effect that a continuous criminal offence was to be considered as a single act and that its legal classification in criminal law had to be assessed under the law in force at the time of completion of the last occurrence of the offence. Thus Article 215a also applied to the earlier assaults, provided that these would have amounted to criminal conduct under the previous law, and the applicant ’ s conduct prior to the amendment of 1 June 2004 had amounted at least to an offence punishable under Article 197a or Article 221 § 1 of the Criminal Code. After examining the file, the Supreme Court concluded that the applicant ’ s actions disclosed all the constituent elements of the offence of abusing a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a §§ 1 and 2 (b) of the Code. Since the offence in question had been perpetrated at least from 2000 until 8 February 2006, the material conditions for considering the offence as aggravated on the ground of its long duration, in accordance with paragraph 2 (b) of Article 215a, had been fulfilled (see paragraph 13 above)."

Under this provision, a continuation of a criminal offence was defined as consisting of individual acts driven by the same purpose, which constituted the same offence and were linked by virtue of being carried out in an identical or similar manner, occurring close together in time and pursuing the same object. It emerges from the clear and settled case-law of the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 25 - 27 above) and from the views expressed in the legal literature (see paragraph 24 above) that a continuous offence was considered to constitute a single act, whose classification in Czech criminal law had to be assessed under the rules in force at the time of completion of the last occurrence of the offence, provided that the acts committed under any previous law would have been punishable also under the older law."

Moreover, in its judgment of 10 June 2008, the Constitutional Court held that the national courts ’ decisions in the applicant ’ s case had been logical and coherent and had not had any retroactive effect prohibited by the Constitution.

It finds no reason to doubt that the applicant was in a position to foresee, not only as regards the period after the entry into force of this provision on 1 June 2004 but also as regards the period from 2000 until that date, that he might be held criminally liable for a continuous offence as described above, and to regulate his conduct accordingly (see, mutatis mutandis, Streletz, Kessler and Krenz, cited above, § 82, and Achour v.

With reference to those acts, the courts also expressly stated that they would have been punishable under the old law."

There is nothing to indicate that the above-mentioned approach by the domestic courts had the adverse effect of increasing the severity of the applicant ’ s punishment (see, conversely, Veeber, cited above, § 36). On the contrary, had the acts perpetrated by him prior to 1 June 2004 been assessed separately from those he committed after that date, the relevant sentencing rule in Article 35 § 1 of the Criminal Code would have resulted in sentence being passed on the basis of the legal provision concerning the most serious of the offences, namely Article 215a of the Criminal Code. In that event, as pointed out by the Government, he would have received at least the same sentence as the one actually imposed, or even a harsher one, on the ground that the existence of multiple offences was likely to be deemed an aggravating circumstance under Article 34k of the Criminal Code."

Under Article 67 § 1 ( d) of the Criminal Code, the statutory limitation period was three years in respect of offences punishable by a maximum sentence of less than three years. Therefore, even if he had been prosecuted only in respect of the three incidents highlighted by the domestic courts, he could in any event have been tried at least for the assault committed under the old law on 17 July 2003 and the one committed under the new law on 8 February 2006."

In reaching the above conclusions, the Court has examined from the standpoint of Article 7 of the Convention the application in the applicant ’ s case of the continuous offence under Czech law of abuse of a person living under the same roof. By way of comparison it is worth noting in this context that the notion of a continuous criminal offence as defined in Czech law is in line with the European tradition reflected in the national laws of the vast majority of Council of Europe member States (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above) and that, accordingly, the situation as regards the issue of foreseeability raised in the present case appears not to be markedly different from that obtaining in relation to such offences in the national legal systems of other Contracting Parties to the Convention. As can be seen from the domestic authorities ’ description of the applicant ’ s conduct, his acts were directed against a specific victim, namely his wife, and particularly against her legal interests of physical and mental integrity as well as honour. It is also clear that the modus operandi was the same, consisting of attacks committed under the same roof; that there was a temporal connection between the various acts, which spanned several years; that each assault committed during this period of time was driven by the same criminal intent; and that the applicant ’ s conduct was on each occasion in breach of the criminal law. In other words, the offence of which the applicant was convicted shared a number of characteristics common to such offences elsewhere in the Convention community, as did the response of the criminal justice system, in the form of a sentence handed down for one single offence (see paragraphs 33 - 37 above)."

The Grand Chamber endorses the analysis to the effect that the rationale of the sentence and punishment, and the ‘ guilty ’ concept (in the English version) with the corresponding notion of ‘ personne coupable ’ (in the French version), support an interpretation whereby Article 7 requires, for the purposes of punishment, a mental link. As is explained in the Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others judgment ( merits, cited above ), the principle that offences and sanctions must be provided for by law entails that criminal law must clearly define the offences and the sanctions by which they are punished, such as to be accessible and foreseeable in its effects. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. This also means that, in principle, a measure can only be regarded as a penalty within the meaning of Article 7 where an element of personal liability on the part of the offender has been established. There is certainly, as the Italian Court of Cassation noted in the case of Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others ( see paragraph 112 of the Court ’ s judgment in that case, ibid. ), a clear correlation between the degree of foreseeability of a criminal-law provision and the personal liability of the offender. The Grand Chamber thus shares the Chamber ’ s findings in that case to the effect that punishment under Article 7 requires the existence of a mental link through which an element of liability may be detected in the conduct of the person who physically committed the offence ( ibid., § 116)."

It acquitted the defendants on the grounds that they could not be found to have negligently or intentionally committed offences and that they had made an “unavoidable and excusable mistake” in the interpretation of the regional legislation, which was “obscure and poorly worded” and interfered with the national law. The Court of Cassation also took into account the conduct of the administrative authorities, and in particular the following facts: on obtaining the building permits, the defendants had been reassured by the director of the relevant municipal office; the site-protection prohibitions with which the construction project was at odds did not appear in the land-use plan; and the competent national authority had not intervened.

According to a line of Court of Cassation case-law, this type of development was not unlawful where it had been authorised by the competent authorities ( Court of Cassation, 1988, Brunotti, and Court of Cassation, no. 6094, 1991, Ligresti and Others ). Land planning was regulated by a series of administrative acts which, on the basis of the broader land-use plan, led to the adoption of decisions on individual cases. The criminal courts had no power to waive the implementation of the administrative decision authorising individual projects, save where it was deemed non-existent or invalid ( Court of Cassation, Ligresti and Others, cited above). In so far as the unlawful site development encroached on the powers of the public authorities in matters of land planning, the offence was made out where a new developed area was created without any preventive supervision on the part of the municipality ( Court of Cassation, 1980, Peta, and Court of Cassation, Brunotti, cited above ).

According to that line of case-law, the “ procedural ” material offence of unlawful site development should be regarded as a residual hypothesis in relation to “contractual” unlawful site development.",

In this scenario, the development project exclusively stems from a legal procedure rather than a physical activity (building work) ( Court of Cassation, 2009, Quarta ). Where legal acts are combined with building activity, the status of “contractual” development shifts to that of “hybrid” unlawful site development (see Court of Cassation, no. 618, 2012).

Lastly, case-law has included in the concept of unlawful development the scenario of changing the intended use of buildings erected in a zone already covered by an approved site development plan. The change may, for instance, involve splitting up a tourist/hotel complex and selling the units separately as private dwellings. Such a change of intended use must be such as to affect the land-use plan. This mode of development fits into either the material or the contractual category of site development depending on whether the emphasis is placed on the existence of constructions ( material element ) or on the manner in which the development project is implemented, that is to say by a legal act (see, to that effect, Court of Cassation, no. 20569, 2015). Even though this mode of development does not involve unauthorised building activity, case-law considers that it is one of the situations provided for in Article 30 of the Construction Code, given that the separate sale of buildings necessarily entails dividing up the land on which they are built ( Farabegoli, cited above ).",

This meant that confiscation could be ordered even if the perpetrator had been acquitted on the grounds of a lack of any mental element (“ perché il fatto non costituisce reato ”).

Moreover, in the case of the substantive material offence of unlawful site development, the criminal court ’ s role is not merely to ensure that no site development is conducted in the absence or in breach of planning permission, but also to ascertain that the development, whether authorised or not, is compatible with norms of a higher rank in relation to the authorisation decision. If it wishes to order confiscation, a criminal court must ascertain that the material element of the offence of unlawful site development is made out, which means that it must establish the existence of all the constituent elements of the unlawful conduct. Under section 18 of Law no. 47 of 1985, the notion of unlawful conduct is not confined to activities carried on without authorisation, but also includes acts in breach of planning regulations and of regional and national norms ( Court of Cassation, Salvini and Others, cited above ). In this context, the Court of Cassation has clarified the relationship between the administrative decision authorising site development and the power of the criminal court to make a finding of unlawful site development and to order confiscation. The Court of Cassation has explained that where the planning permission does not comply with other planning regulations, the criminal court may find against the perpetrator of the development and order confiscation without the need for any administrative assessment of the permission granted. Given that the criminal court is not empowered to declare the permission null and void, it will remain valid ( Court of Cassation, Salvini and Others, cited above; Court of Cassation, Varvara, cited above; and Court of Cassation, no. 36366, 2015, Faiola ).",

Where the unlawful site development has been carried out in the absence of, or in breach of, planning permission, the administrative authority can prevent confiscation being ordered by the criminal court only if all the following conditions are met: ( a) the site development has subsequently been regularised ( sanato ) by the municipal authority; ( b) the act of regularisation is lawful; and ( c) the subsequent planning permission (or the amendment of the land-use plan) is issued before the criminal conviction becomes final. Thus, once the conviction has become final, the confiscation measure can no longer be revoked, even in the case of subsequent regularisation of the development by the administrative authority (Court of Cassation, no. 21125, 2007, Licciardello; Court of Cassation, no. 37274, 2008, Varvara and Franzese, cited above )."

In such cases the criminal court acts completely autonomously and independently from the administrative authority ( Court of Cassation, nos. 21125 of 2007, 39078 of 2009, 34881 of 2010 and 25883 of 2013).",

                "“6.– The question raised by the Court of Cassation along with that raised by the Tribunale di Teramo is also inadmissible on the grounds that both are based on an interpretative assumption which is mistaken on two counts.",
                "Whilst differing as regards the effects which the Varvara judgment supposedly generates within the national legal order, both referring courts are convinced that in making this judgment the Strasbourg Court laid down a principle of law which was both innovative and binding on the courts required to apply it by adopting a new approach to the interpretation of Article 7 ECHR.",
                "The first misunderstanding attributable to the referring courts relates to the meaning which they have inferred from the judgment of the Strasbourg Court.",
                "Ultimately, the European Court is alleged to have asserted that, once a sanction has been classified under Article 7 ECHR, and thus once a ‘ penalty ’ has been deemed to fall within its scope, it can only be imposed by a criminal court at the same time as a conviction for an offence. As a result, confiscation in accordance with spatial planning provisions – which until now has continued to operate as an administrative penalty under national law, which may be imposed first and foremost by the public administration, albeit buttressed by the guarantees provided by Article 7 ECHR – is claimed to have been incorporated in full into the area of criminal law or, to put it differently, the substantive protection guaranteed by Article 7 is claimed to have been supplemented by a further formal safeguard consisting in the reservation of competence over the application of the measure comprising a ‘ penalty ’ to the criminal courts, thus meaning that they can only be imposed at the same time as a conviction.",
                "This is claimed to result in a corollary: as soon as the administrative offence, which the legislator distinguishes with broad discretion from a criminal offence (see Order no. 159 of 1994; followed by Judgments no. 273 of 2010, no. 364 of 2004 and no. 317 of 1996; and Orders no. 212 of 2004 and no. 177 of 2003), was capable of providing self-standing criteria for classifying the ‘ offence ’ under the ECHR, it would be attracted into the scope of the criminal law of the contracting state. This accordingly supposedly results in a merger between the concept of criminal sanction on national level and that on European level. As a result, the area of criminal law is claimed to have expanded beyond the discretionary evaluations of legislators, even in cases involving sanctions that, whilst minor, would still constitute ‘ penalties ’ for the purposes of Article 7 ECHR on other grounds (Grand Chamber, judgment of 23 November 2006 in Jussila v. Finland ).",
                "In asserting this argument, the referring courts do not appreciate that its compatibility both with the Constitution and with the ECHR itself, as interpreted in the rulings of the Strasbourg Court, would be questionable.",
                "6.1.– ... As is known, since its judgments of 8 June 1976 in Engel [and Others] v. the Netherlands and of 21 February 1984 in Öztürk v. Germany, the Strasbourg Court has developed specific criteria for establishing when a sanction can be classified as a ‘ penalty ’ within the meaning of Article 7 ECHR precisely in order to ensure that the wide-scale processes of decriminalisation which have been launched by the member states since the 1960s do not have the effect of depriving offences of the substantive guarantees assured by Articles 6 and 7 ECHR after decriminalisation (see Öztürk [ cited above ] ).",
                "Thus, the discretion of national legislators to stem the proliferation of the criminal law through the recourse to regimes of sanctions considered to be more appropriate, with reference both to the nature of the sanction imposed and the simplified procedures applicable during the initial administrative stage in which the sanction is imposed, has not been called into question. The aim has rather been to avoid this route from resulting in the dissipation of the bundle of protection which had historically been associated with the development of criminal law, the protection of which ECHR is intended to further.",
                "It is within this twin-track approach – under which on the one hand the state ’ s criminal policy choices are not opposed but where on the other hand the detrimental effects of those policies on individual guarantees are kept in check – that the nature of the ECHR is vividly demonstrated as an instrument charged with looking beyond the aspects related to the formal classification of an offence, without however impinging upon the legislative discretion of the states but rather assessing the substance of the human rights in play and safeguarding their efficacy.",
                "It is in fact a consolidated principle that the ‘ penalty ’ may also be applied by an administrative authority, albeit upon condition that an appeal may be lodged against the decision before a court of law offering the guarantees provided for under Article 6 ECHR, even if it does not necessarily exercise criminal jurisdiction (see most recently the judgment of 4 March 2014 in Grande Stevens and Others v. Italy, with reference to a sanction considered to be serious). It has been added that the ‘ penalty ’ may result from the completion of an administrative procedure even without any formal declaration of guilt by a criminal court (see the judgment of 11 January 2007 in Mamidakis v. Greece ).",
                "6.2.– ... Expressions of this type, which are linguistically open to an interpretation that does not require a finding of responsibility exclusively in the form of a criminal conviction, are entirely consistent in logical terms with the Strasbourg Court ’ s function of perceiving the violation of the human right in its tangible dimension, irrespective of the abstract formula used by the national legislator to classify the conduct.",
                "This Court must conclude that the referring courts were not only not required to infer the principle of law on which the current interlocutory questions of constitutionality are based from the Varvara judgment but should also have read the judgment as having the opposite effect. In fact, this judgment is compatible with the text of the decision and the facts of the case ruled upon, which is more in keeping with the traditional logic underpinning the case-law of the European Court, and in any case respects the constitutional principle of subsidiarity in the area of criminal law, as well as the legislative discretion over the policy on the punishment of offences, as the case may be opting to classify the sanction as administrative in nature (for internal purposes).",
                "Within the perspective of the Strasbourg Court, the guarantees which Article 7 ECHR offers in relation to confiscation in accordance with spatial planning provisions are certainly mandated by the excessive result which such a measure may lead to beyond the restoration of the breach of the law (see the judgment of 20 January 2009 in Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others v. Italy ), which in turn results from the manner in which that institute is configured under Italian law.",
                "However, they do not detract from the possibility that the power to impose administrative sanctions, which is the task of such a measure prior to any involvement by the criminal courts, may indeed be linked to the public interest in the ‘ construction planning of the territory ’ (see Judgment no. 148 of 1994), the furtherance of which is a task for the public administration. It is important to add that this interest is by no means foreign to the ECHR perspective (see the judgment of 8 November 2005 in Saliba v. Malta ).",
                "As things currently stand, unless there are any further developments in the case-law of the European court (following the referral to the Grand Chamber of disputes relating to national confiscations based on spatial planning provisions in applications no. 19029/11, no. 34163/07 and no. 1828/06), the argument proposed by the referring courts as a starting point for their doubts concerning the constitutionality of the contested provisions that the Varvara judgment may be unequivocally interpreted to the effect that confiscation in accordance with spatial planning provisions may only be ordered in parallel with a conviction by the courts for the offence of unlawful parcelling must accordingly be concluded to be mistaken.",
                "7.– ... It is not always immediately clear whether a certain interpretation of the provisions of the ECHR has become sufficiently consolidated at Strasbourg, especially in cases involving rulings intended to resolve cases that turn on highly specific facts, which have moreover been adopted with reference to the impact of the ECHR on legal systems different from that of Italy. In spite of this, there are without doubt signs that are capable of directing the national courts during their examination: the creativity of the principle asserted compared to the traditional approach of European case-law; the potential for points of distinction or even contrast from other rulings of the Strasbourg Court; the existence of dissenting opinions, especially if fuelled by robust arguments; the fact that the decision made originates from an ordinary division and has not been endorsed by the Grand Chamber; the fact that, in the case before it, the European court has not been able to assess the particular characteristics of the national legal system, and has extended to it criteria for assessment devised with reference to other member states which, in terms of those characteristics, by contrast prove to be little suited to Italy.",
                "When all or some of these signs are apparent, as established in a judgment which cannot disregard the specific features of each individual case, there is no reason to require the ordinary courts to use the interpretation chosen by the Strasbourg Court in order to resolve a particular dispute, unless it relates to a ‘ pilot judgment ’ in a strict sense.”",

Without an autonomous concept of penalty, States would be free to impose penalties without classifying them as such, and the individuals concerned would then be deprived of the safeguards under Article 7 § 1. That provision would thus be devoid of any practical effect. It is of crucial importance that the Convention be interpreted and applied in a manner which renders its rights practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory, and this principle thus applies to Article 7 (see Del Río Prada, cited above, § 88)."

On the contrary, it reflects a conflict between the criminal court and the administrative authority in the interpretation of the regional and national planning legislation.

Applying this notion to that particular case, it agreed with the findings of the Italian Court of Cassation that, as the rules that had been breached lacked foreseeability, the accused had committed an unavoidable and excusable error, thus ruling out the mental element that had to be established for the offence to be made out, and their acquittal was justified (ibid., §§ 111- 14). The Court further found as follows:",
                "“ 115. A connected series of ideas should be developed. At domestic level, the classification ‘ administrative ’ ... that is given to the impugned confiscation measure allows the sanction in question to fall outside the constitutional principles governing criminal matters. Article 27/1 of the Constitution provides that ‘ criminal liability is personal ’ and the courts ’ interpretation thereof is that a mental element is always necessary. Moreover, it would be difficult to apply Article 27/3 of the Constitution ( ‘ Punishments .... must be aimed at the rehabilitation of the convicted person ’ ) to a convicted person if he or she cannot be found liable.",

Nevertheless, the rationale of the sentence and punishment, and the ‘ guilty ’ concept (in the English version) and the corresponding notion of ‘ personne coupable ’ (in the French version), support an interpretation whereby Article 7 requires, for the purposes of punishment, an intellectual link ( awareness and intent) disclosing an element of liability in the conduct of the perpetrator of the offence, failing which the penalty will be unjustified. Moreover, it would be inconsistent, on the one hand, to require an accessible and foreseeable legal basis and, on the other, to allow an individual to be found ‘ guilty ’ and to ‘ punish ’ him even though he had not been in a position to know the criminal law owing to an unavoidable error for which the person falling foul of it could in no way be blamed.",

Under Article 7, for the reasons set out above, a legislative framework which does not enable an accused person to know the meaning and scope of the criminal law is defective not only on the grounds of the general conditions of ‘ quality ’ of the ‘ law ’ but also in terms of the specific requirements of the principle of legality in criminal law.”"

As is explained in the Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others judgment ( merits, cited above ), the principle that offences and sanctions must be provided for by law entails that criminal law must clearly define the offences and the sanctions by which they are punished, such as to be accessible and foreseeable in its effects. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. This also means that, in principle, a measure can only be regarded as a penalty within the meaning of Article 7 where an element of personal liability on the part of the offender has been established. There is certainly, as the Italian Court of Cassation noted in the case of Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others ( see paragraph 112 of the Court ’ s judgment in that case, ibid. ), a clear correlation between the degree of foreseeability of a criminal-law provision and the personal liability of the offender. The Grand Chamber thus shares the Chamber ’ s findings in that case to the effect that punishment under Article 7 requires the existence of a mental link through which an element of liability may be detected in the conduct of the person who physically committed the offence ( ibid., § 116)."

Nevertheless, and as the Court indicated in its Varvara judgment ( cited above, § 70), this requirement does not preclude the existence of certain forms of objective liability stemming from presumptions of liability, provided they comply with the Convention. In this connection, the Court would refer to its case-law under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention to the effect that in principle the Contracting States remain free to apply the criminal law to an act where it is not carried out in the normal exercise of one of the rights protected under the Convention ( see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 81, Series A no. 22, p. 34 ) and, accordingly, to define the constituent elements of the resulting offence. In particular, the Contracting States may, under certain conditions, penalise a simple or objective fact as such, irrespective of whether it results from criminal intent or from negligence. Examples of such offences may be found in the laws of the Contracting States. Presumptions of fact or of law operate in every legal system. The Convention does not prohibit such presumptions in principle; it does, however, require the Contracting States to remain within certain limits in this respect as regards criminal law. According to the case-law, these limits will be overstepped where a presumption has the effect of making it impossible for an individual to exonerate himself from the accusations against him, thus depriving him of the benefit of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Salabiaku v. France, 7 October 1988, § § 27 -28, Series A no. 141 -A; Janosevic v. Sweden, no. 34619/97, § 68; ECHR 2002 - VII and Klouvi v. France, no. 30754/03, § 48, 30 June 2011 )."

Otherwise the punishment would be devoid of purpose (see Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others, cited above, § 116). It would be inconsistent on the one hand to require an accessible and foreseeable legal basis and on the other to permit punishment where, as in the present case, the person in question has not been convicted.",

In the present case, the criminal penalty which was imposed on the applicant despite the fact that the criminal offence had been statute-barred and his criminal liability had not been established in a verdict as to his guilt, is incompatible with the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty, which the Court has recently clarified and which is an integral part of the legality principle laid down in Article 7 of the Convention.

The Varvara judgment does not lead to the conclusion that confiscation measures for unlawful site development must necessarily be accompanied by convictions decided by criminal courts within the meaning of domestic law. The Court, for its part, must ensure that the declaration of criminal liability complies with the safeguards provided for in Article 7 and that it stems from proceedings complying with Article 6. In this connection, the Court would emphasise that its judgments all have the same legal value.

Such a finding would mean that no administrative proceedings could be brought in the absence of criminal proceedings and that no finding of an offence can be made by an administrative court in the absence of a formal declaration of guilt by a criminal court.

As to the proportionality aspect, the Government explained that less restrictive measures could not have been envisaged. In their view, it would have been technically very difficult, if not impossible, to limit the confiscation merely to the areas that had been built upon and to have separated those areas from the undeveloped land. In the Government ’ s view, a purely partial confiscation of the land would have frustrated the legitimate aims pursued by the State, namely to ensure the conformity of the plots in question with the planning regulations, environmental protection and the punishment of those responsible for the unlawful land transformation.

France ((dec.), no. 28078/95, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII) or Air Canada v. the United Kingdom (5 May 1995, Series A no. 316 ‑ A), in which the confiscation, ordered after the conviction of the accused, concerned property which was the instrumentum sceleris and was in the possession of third parties. As regards the proceeds of crime ( productum sceleris ), the Court observes that it has examined a case where the confiscation had followed the applicant ’ s conviction (see Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no. 41087/98, §§ 9-18, ECHR 2001-VII) and cases where confiscation had been ordered independently of the existence of any criminal proceedings, because the applicant companies ’ property had been presumed to be of unlawful origin (see Riela and Others v.

According to the District Court, the development and progress of the applicant ’ s company was made up of two phases. The first phase of the development extended from 1992 to 1994 during which time the economic and commercial activity of the company was concentrated in the sphere of fast-income businesses, relying on cash, such as bakeries, retail shops, cake shops, restaurants and travel agencies. The second phase extended from the end of 1994 until the placement of the company in administration. During this period, the goal of the company was to modernise its lines of production and extend its activities within the country and abroad. In the court ’ s view, this was the decisive period which gave rise to great economic and financial problems. The District Court acknowledged that the principal reason for the taking of loans from members of the public were the rapid pace of the company ’ s expansion and development as well as the actual impossibility for the Albanian banks to give loans."

The total number of persons who concluded a loan contract with the company was 68,857 creditors.

In contrast to the accused ’ s claims, the [lower] courts established that the taking of money from members of the public, in the form of so-called loans, was carried out for the sole purpose of acquiring property for the accused himself and other persons. The accused was not capable of securing the amounts in question relying solely on the money taken from members of the public and he knew that he could not obtain profits in a lawful manner in order to repay the loans.",

The increase in interest rates for creditors and the shortening of deadlines for the repayment of loans fell into this same category.",

                "The argument employed by the District Court that the criminal offence constitutes a continuous crime ... is not borne out by the deception that has been carried out. In order for a crime to be continuous, the following elements must be present: each offence must not stand on its own, the acts or the failure to act must have constituted the same criminal offence, and the criminal intent which joins separate acts in a single integral offence must exist.",

The criminal activity took place over a long time and, as argued above, was not the consequence of the same criminal intent. The latter was subject to continuous modification owing to competition from other unlawful loan-taking companies. This took the form of changing interest rates, varying deception techniques to adapt to different people and different circumstances, developing diverse strategies to make the deception credible, either through propaganda in the broadcast media or through efforts to make the criminal activity appear as normal banking activity.",
                "The court adopts the same position with the unifying decision (no. 284) of 15 September 2000 of the Supreme Court Joint Benches to the effect that persons who have committed the offence of deception shall be criminally liable under Article 143 of the CC on as many counts as the number of people deceived.",
                "The Supreme Court considers that the Court of Appeal ’ s reasoning that Article 143 § 2 should be applied as it is more favourable does not have any legal basis. Article 82 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that “the most serious criminal offence shall be considered to be that which attracts the most severe maximum penalty or, where the most severe maximum penalties are equal, the most severe minimum penalty.” On that basis, taking the most severe maximum penalty as the criterion for the most serious offence, it is clear that Article 143 of the Criminal Code, which was in force when the criminal offence was committed and which provides for a penalty of five years ’ imprisonment, is more favourable than the second paragraph, which was added to the provision and provides for a maximum penalty of twenty years ’ imprisonment. The fact that the cumulative sentence imposed may be higher than the penalty provided for in Article 143 § 2 of the Criminal Code cannot provide a basis for finding that Article 143 is less favourable.",
                "For these reasons the Court of Appeal, having aggravated the accused ’ s position, should not have classified the offence under Article 143 § 2 of the CC. The accused ... should be found guilty and sentenced on the basis of Article 143 for the criminal offence of deception on 57,923 counts, equal to the number of injured persons.",

The court, by giving the facts a different determination, may re-characterise the offence, which may be less serious or more so. In the latter case, this does not mean that the accused ’ s position has been aggravated. In accordance with Article 375 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court may give the facts a different determination from that given by the prosecutor, since the court is independent and makes its own assessment of the facts.",
                "In this context, Article 375 does not oblige the court to give the accused time in the defence of his interest, whereas pursuant to Article 372, 373 and 374 the accused is granted additional time to secure his defence against new charges lodged by the prosecutor. The latter provisions make reference to the prosecutor who, prior to the completion of the judicial examination has the right to modify the charges, to lodge a different charge or to charge the accused with a new offence. On these occasions, because the defence rights should be secured, the law provides that the court makes time available to the accused to secure his defence against the new charges. In the case of the application of Article 375 of the CCP, when the court proceeds with a different requalification of the offence, the same binding procedure does not apply as in the case of the filing of new charges by the prosecutor. The court, after an examination of facts, may give the facts a new and different legal determination. The criminal procedural law does not envisage adjournment of hearings or granting of [additional] time to the defence when the re-characterisation of the criminal offence is made by the court by virtue of its final decision.

The conditions for imposing a cumulative sentence are as follows.",

More specifically, the court imposes fifteen years ’ imprisonment for the offence of intentional homicide and five years ’ imprisonment for the offence of illegal possession of firearms.

For example, serious injury caused to several people, irrespective of the fact that it was inflicted recurrently and by way of the same actions against two, three or more people, forms part of a single offence specifically provided for under Article ... and cannot be subject to a cumulative penalty.",

In this case, the most severe cumulative sentence was correctly applied, in that the sentence did not exceed the total sum of the separate sentences imposed (eight years), or the maximum sentence within the type of penalty imposed, i.e. imprisonment.",

It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. The Court ’ s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention ( see Korbely v. Hungary [GC], no. 9174/02, § 72, 19 September 2008 ). The Court notes that the qualification of the applicant ’ s actions as deception does not seem unreasonable or arbitrary and, therefore, remains within the generally acceptable rules of interpretation of criminal statutes."

The Court finds that the case primarily falls to be examined under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention under the head of whether the applicant was heard by a “tribunal established by law”. It reiterates that this expression reflects the principle of the rule of law, which is inherent in the system of protection established by the Convention and its Protocols. “Law”, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, comprises in particular the legislation on the establishment and competence of judicial organs (see, inter alia, Lavents v. Latvia, no. 58442/00, § 114, 28 November 2002). Accordingly, if a tribunal does not have jurisdiction to try a defendant in accordance with the provisions applicable under domestic law, it is not “established by law” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (compare Coëme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, §§ 99 and 107-08, ECHR 2000-VII )."

The Court further reiterates that, in principle, a violation of the said domestic legal provisions on the establishment and competence of judicial organs by a tribunal gives rise to a violation of Article 6 § 1. The Court is therefore competent to examine whether the national law has been complied with in this respect. However, having regard to the general principle according to which it is in the first place for the national courts themselves to interpret the provisions of domestic law, the Court finds that it may not question their interpretation unless there has been a flagrant violation of domestic law (see, mutatis mutandis, Coëme and Others, cited above, § 98 in fine, and Lavents, cited above, § 114). In this respect the Court also reiterates that Article 6 does not grant the defendant a right to choose the jurisdiction of a court. The Court ’ s task is therefore limited to examining whether reasonable grounds existed for the authorities to establish jurisdiction (see, inter alia, G. v. Switzerland, no. 16875/90, Commission decision of 10 October 1990, unreported, and Kübli v. Switzerland, no. 17495/90, Commission decision of 2 December 1992, unreported ).",

The Court notes that the German courts based their jurisdiction on Article 6 no. 1 of the Criminal Code, taken in conjunction with Article 220a of that Code (in their versions then in force). These provisions provided that German criminal law was applicable and that, consequently, German courts had jurisdiction to try persons charged with genocide committed abroad, regardless of the defendant ’ s and the victims ’ nationalities. The domestic courts had therefore established jurisdiction in accordance with the clear wording of the pertinent provisions of the Criminal Code."

In deciding whether the German courts had jurisdiction under the material provisions of domestic law, the Court must further ascertain whether the domestic courts ’ decision that they had jurisdiction over the applicant ’ s case was in compliance with the provisions of public international law applicable in Germany. It notes that the national courts found that the public international law principle of universal jurisdiction, which was codified in Article 6 no. 1 of the Criminal Code, established their jurisdiction while complying with the public international law duty of non-intervention. In their view, their competence under the principle of universal jurisdiction was not excluded by the wording of Article VI of the Genocide Convention, as that Article was to be understood as establishing a duty for the courts named therein to try persons suspected of genocide, while not prohibiting the prosecution of genocide by other national courts."

                "68. In determining whether the domestic courts ’ interpretation of the applicable rules and provisions of public international law on jurisdiction was reasonable, the Court is in particular required to examine their interpretation of Article VI of the Genocide Convention. It observes, as was also noted by the domestic courts (see, in particular, paragraph 20 above), that the Contracting Parties to the Genocide Convention, despite proposals in earlier drafts to that effect, had not agreed to codify the principle of universal jurisdiction over genocide for the domestic courts of all Contracting States in that Article (compare paragraphs 20 and 5 4 above). However, pursuant to Article I of the Genocide Convention, the Contracting Parties were under an erga omnes obligation to prevent and punish genocide, the prohibition of which forms part of the jus cogens. In view of this, the national courts ’ reasoning that the purpose of the Genocide Convention, as expressed notably in that Article, did not exclude jurisdiction for the punishment of genocide by States whose laws establish extraterritoriality in this respect must be considered as reasonable (and indeed convincing). Having thus reached a reasonable and unequivocal interpretation of Article VI of the Genocide Convention in accordance with the aim of that Convention, there was no need, in interpreting the said Convention, to have recourse to the preparatory documents, which play only a subsidiary role in the interpretation of public international law (see Articles 31 § 1 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 )."

It notes, in particular, that the Spanish Audiencia Nacional has interpreted Article VI of the Genocide Convention in exactly the same way as the German courts (see paragraph 5 4 above). Furthermore, Article 9 § 1 of the ICTY Statute confirms the German courts ’ view, providing for concurrent jurisdiction of the ICTY and national courts, without any restriction to domestic courts of particular countries. Indeed, the principle of universal jurisdiction for genocide has been expressly acknowledged by the ICTY (see paragraphs 50 - 51 above) and numerous Convention States authorise the prosecution of genocide in accordance with that principle, or at least where, as in the applicant ’ s case, additional conditions – such as those required under the representation principle – are met ( see paragraphs 5 2 -5 3 above )."

He had in particular participated in the arrest, detention, assault and ill-treatment of male Muslims of three villages in Bosnia at the beginning of May and June 1992. He had killed several inhabitants of these villages. He had in particular shot twenty-two inhabitants of the village of Grabska – women and disabled and elderly people – in June 1992. Subsequently, the applicant, together with the paramilitary group he had led, had chased some forty men from their home village and had ordered them to be ill-treated and six of them to be shot. A seventh injured person had died from being burnt with the corpses of the six people shot. In September 1992 the applicant had killed a prisoner, who was being ill-treated by soldiers in the Doboj prison, with a wooden truncheon in order to demonstrate a new method of ill-treatment and killing."

Furthermore, agreeing with the findings of an expert in public international law, the court found that the German courts were not debarred under public international law from trying the case.

The competent courts ’ reasoning, namely, that Article 6 no. 1 of the Criminal Code taken in conjunction with Article VI of the Genocide Convention entitled them to examine the applicant ’ s case, was not arbitrary. It could properly be reasoned that the Genocide Convention, while not expressly regulating the principle of universal jurisdiction, provided that the Contracting Parties were not obliged to prosecute perpetrators of genocide, but had jurisdiction to do so. In fact, genocide was the classic subject matter to which the principle of universal jurisdiction applied.

It [ i.e., ethnic cleansing ] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the Convention, if it corresponds to or falls within one of the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention. Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area ‘ ethnically homogeneous ’, nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can as such be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is ‘ to destroy, in whole or in part ’ a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as ‘ ethnic cleansing ’ may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, ‘ deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ’, contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent ( dolus specialis ), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region.

In their view, their competence under the principle of universal jurisdiction was not excluded by the wording of Article VI of the Genocide Convention, as that Article was to be understood as establishing a duty for the courts named therein to try persons suspected of genocide, while not prohibiting the prosecution of genocide by other national courts."

However, pursuant to Article I of the Genocide Convention, the Contracting Parties were under an erga omnes obligation to prevent and punish genocide, the prohibition of which forms part of the jus cogens. In view of this, the national courts ’ reasoning that the purpose of the Genocide Convention, as expressed notably in that Article, did not exclude jurisdiction for the punishment of genocide by States whose laws establish extraterritoriality in this respect must be considered as reasonable (and indeed convincing). Having thus reached a reasonable and unequivocal interpretation of Article VI of the Genocide Convention in accordance with the aim of that Convention, there was no need, in interpreting the said Convention, to have recourse to the preparatory documents, which play only a subsidiary role in the interpretation of public international law (see Articles 31 § 1 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 )."

It notes, in particular, that the Spanish Audiencia Nacional has interpreted Article VI of the Genocide Convention in exactly the same way as the German courts (see paragraph 5 4 above). Furthermore, Article 9 § 1 of the ICTY Statute confirms the German courts ’ view, providing for concurrent jurisdiction of the ICTY and national courts, without any restriction to domestic courts of particular countries. Indeed, the principle of universal jurisdiction for genocide has been expressly acknowledged by the ICTY (see paragraphs 50 - 51 above) and numerous Convention States authorise the prosecution of genocide in accordance with that principle, or at least where, as in the applicant ’ s case, additional conditions – such as those required under the representation principle – are met ( see paragraphs 5 2 -5 3 above )."

However, this fact does not as such warrant the conclusion that the principle of equality of arms or the applicant ’ s right to obtain the attendance of witnesses were disregarded, and that, consequently, the proceedings as a whole were unfair. In this respect, the Court observes in particular that the Court of Appeal, giving detailed reasons for the refusal to take further evidence, considered the written statements of at least seven of the said twenty-eight witnesses to prove the same fact (namely the applicant ’ s detention at the time of the offence) before concluding that the testimony of all twenty-eight witnesses would be of little evidential value and irrelevant in deciding the case. The Court observes that the Court of Appeal, when rejecting the applicant ’ s request to call these witnesses, had already heard the testimonies of more than twenty witnesses, including that of two journalists who were not affected by the offences the applicant was charged with (and could therefore, as a rule, be considered as particularly credible). These witnesses, who could be cross-examined by the applicant, had all stated that they had seen the applicant outside prison during the time he claimed to have been detained. In these circumstances, the Court cannot find that the domestic courts acted arbitrarily in deciding that the testimonies of the witnesses named by the applicant to prove his detention at the time of the offence had not been relevant. Therefore, the Court finds no indication that the proceedings against the applicant were as a whole unfair."

He maintained that, having regard to the literal meaning of the term “destroy”, a mere attack on the living conditions or the basis of subsistence of a group, as in the present case, did not constitute destruction of the group itself. The “ ethnic cleansing ” carried out by Bosnian Serbs in the Doboj region had been aimed only at driving all Muslims away from that region by force, that is, at expelling that group, not destroying its very existence.

In fact, according to the internationally accepted doctrine, genocide applied only to cases in which murder, extermination or deportation was carried out with intent to eliminate a narrowly defined group, that is, to destroy it in a biological-physical sense, not merely as a social unit.

In particular, the intent to destroy had to be directed against the “group as such”, which suggested that not only the physical, but also the social existence of the group was protected. Moreover, the definition of genocide laid down in Article 220a § 1 no. 4 (imposition of measures which are intended to prevent births within the group ) and no. 5 (forcible transfer of children of the group into another group ) did not entail the physical destruction of living members of the group in question either."

Relying on the principle of nullum crimen sine lege, the ICTY had argued for the first time that the offence of genocide under public international law was restricted to acts aimed at the physical or biological destruction of a group. However, this narrower interpretation of the scope of the crime of genocide by the ICTY in 2001 – which, in the Government ’ s view, was not convincing – did not call into question the fact that it had been foreseeable for the applicant, when he committed his offences in 1992, that these would be qualified as genocide. In any event, the German courts had not qualified ethnic cleansing in general as genocide, but had found that the applicant, in the circumstances of the case, was guilty of genocide as he had intended to destroy a group as a social unit and not merely to expel it."

It is not confined to prohibiting the retroactive application of criminal law to the disadvantage of an accused. It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that criminal law must not be extensively construed to the detriment of an accused, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. When speaking of “ law ” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, inter alia, S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, §§ 34-35, Series A no. 335 - B; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, §§ 32-33, Series A no. 335 -C; and Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see, inter alia, S.W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 36; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 34; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz, cited above, § 50; and K. ‑ H.

They considered that the “intent to destroy” a group within the meaning of Article 220a of the Criminal Code, as interpreted also in the light of Article II of the Genocide Convention, did not necessitate an intent to destroy that group in a physical or biological sense.

The Court finds that the domestic courts ’ interpretation of “intent to destroy a group” as not necessitating a physical destruction of the group, which has also been adopted by a number of scholars (see paragraphs 36 and 4 7 above), is therefore covered by the wording, read in its context, of the crime of genocide in the Criminal Code and does not appear unreasonable."

In particular, unlike in the case of Maktouf and Damjanović, in the applicant’s case the domestic courts took into account in their assessment of the more lenient criminal law not only the statutory maximum and minimum prison sentence that could have been imposed on the applicant, but also the possibility provided for by the new law to impose a fine and the manner in which a sentence was to be served under both the new and the old law – more specifically, whether the serving of the sentence could be suspended or the imposition of a penalty postponed.

He argued that the conditions for postponing or waiving the imposition of a sentence had been met because, inter alia, he had not committed any other unlawful acts either before or after the incident, had admitted his guilt, had regretted his actions and had done everything he could for the proceedings to end expeditiously. Furthermore, he had not been driving his car on a busy street, was a person who was integrated in society and had been employed prior to the incident.

It also held that Article 336 § 1 of the new Criminal Code was applicable because in the applicant’s case it was necessary to postpone the imposition of the sentence for the act committed by him. Consequently, it concluded that the new legal provisions were the more lenient and decided to dismiss the prosecutor’s office’s request to change the legal classification of the offence. In sentencing the applicant, the court took into account the general sentencing criteria set out in the new criminal law and the general purpose of penalties. In addition, it held that the limits of the penalty provided for by law had to be reduced by a third in accordance with the new criminal procedure rules concerning admission of guilt. Taking into account the circumstances of the case and the applicant’s behaviour, the court held that, as far as the seriousness of his actions was concerned, he had not been driving on a busy road. It further held that, as far as he himself was concerned, he had no previous convictions, had admitted and regretted his actions, had been employed, and was responsible and fully integrated into society. On that basis, the court considered that setting a penalty for the applicant would be sufficient to make him realise the consequences of his behaviour and deter him from repeating it. Consequently, it decided that the immediate imposition of a sentence was unnecessary, but that a period of probation was required. It therefore concluded that the most appropriate manner of dealing with the case was to give the applicant a ten-month prison sentence and postpone its imposition for two years. Lastly, it ordered him to comply with certain conditions during the period of probation, but they did not include a ban on driving a vehicle."

On an unspecified date the prosecutor’s office appealed against the first-instance court’s judgment, arguing that the decision to consider the applicant’s actions less serious and then to give him a ten-month prison sentence and postpone its imposition had been inappropriate, given the seriousness of the offence. The applicant had had a very high alcohol level in his blood and had consented to driving a vehicle occupied by another person who had eventually been injured. He had not justified in any way why he had committed the offence. The fact that he had committed the offence on a less busy road or that the injured person had not lodged a criminal complaint against him was irrelevant and could not diminish the serious nature of the offence. On the contrary, his actions had made the offence even more serious because the consequences could have been even more severe as far as road safety and the person’s life and physical integrity were concerned. Furthermore, the applicant had initially denied having committed the offence and had entered into a heated dispute with individuals travelling in the other car. The fact that he had admitted to having committed the offence in circumstances where the evidence against him was indisputable could not be viewed as mitigating circumstances sufficient to justify postponing the imposition of a sentence. The same could also be said about the absence of previous convictions, as the applicant deserved no particular credit for being in a normal situation specific to most members of society. The fact that he was well integrated in society should have made him foresee the serious consequences that driving a vehicle under the influence might have had. Moreover, the prosecutor’s office reiterated its arguments concerning the need to change the legal classification of the offence. It urged the appellate court to give the applicant a sentence which could be suspended for the duration of a supervision period in accordance with the provisions of the old criminal law. It argued that the old criminal law contained more favourable terms for the applicant than the new criminal law in so far as suspending the serving of his sentence for the duration of a supervision period was concerned, because the old criminal law allowed for his automatic legal rehabilitation if he did not reoffend during that period."

Referring to the general sentencing criteria set out in both the new and old criminal law and applying them to the applicant’s case, the court held that the prosecutor’s office’s arguments were well-founded and that the punishment imposed on the applicant had not been appropriate to ensure his rehabilitation in the sense of respect for the values protected by criminal law, namely general and special prevention. In this connection, the court took into account the particular circumstances in which the applicant had committed the offence, the level of alcohol in his blood at the time of the incident and his conduct thereafter, namely his involvement in a verbal dispute with one of the witnesses and other individuals. As far as his admission of guilt was concerned, the court held that he would be rewarded with a one-third reduction of his penalty, as provided for by the new domestic criminal procedure rules. As a result, the court decided to impose a penalty on the applicant within the specific limits provided for by law for the offence and reduce it accordingly. For the above-mentioned reasons, the court held that the old criminal law was the more lenient in the applicant’s case, given the conditions to be met for suspending the serving of the sentence for the duration of a supervision period."

The court subsequently decided to suspend the serving of both his prison sentence and enforcement of the additional penalties for seven years.

He alleged that, under Article 336 § 1 of the new Criminal Code, the offence committed by him was punishable either by imprisonment or a fine. The domestic courts had also had discretion to postpone or waive the imposition of a sentence. As a result, his driving licence would not have been revoked. In addition, a decision by the court to postpone the imposition of his sentence would have enabled him to recover his driving licence immediately after the proceedings had ended because a ban on him driving his car during the period of probation could no longer have been imposed.

They explained that the more lenient criminal law was not determined in an abstract manner, but rather by following several steps and taking into consideration the circumstances of each case. Generally, a domestic court would first determine if the elements of an offence were made out. Subsequently, it would examine the statutory penalty for the offence. If two criminal laws were in force between the moment an act was committed and the moment the final court judgment was delivered and under one of those laws the penalty for the offence was imprisonment and under the other either the same term of imprisonment or a fine, the judge would consider the latter law more lenient only if he or she decided to sentence the defendant to pay a fine. In other words, the mere existence of a potential alternative penalty would not render a law more favourable. If, however, the two laws in question provided different terms of imprisonment for the same offence, the domestic courts would determine the more lenient criminal law by taking into account the specific prison sentence it intended to impose. Therefore, if the court intended to give a sentence which was closer to the statutory maximum sentence, the more lenient criminal law would be that which provided the shortest statutory maximum sentence. Likewise, if the court intended to give a sentence which was closer to the statutory minimum sentence, the more lenient criminal law would be that which provided the shortest statutory minimum sentence. Lastly, if the offence carried the same penalty under both laws the court, depending on the chosen penalty, would be called upon to examine other elements, such as the requirements for suspending the serving of the sentence."

The applicant seems to be of the view that such an assessment should be made by taking into account the offence committed in general and the successive maximum and minimum penalties set out in the competing laws for it, as well as the manner in which a sentence is to be served. At the same time, the Government appear to take the view that the assessment should be made by taking into account the very specific circumstances in which the particular offence was committed, as determined by the national judge, whether as a result the sentence was viewed to be closer to the maximum or the minimum penalties provided for by the competing laws, and, where relevant, the manner in which a sentence is to be served."

What is crucial is whether, following a concrete assessment of the specific acts, the application of one criminal law rather than the other has put the defendant at a disadvantage as concerns the sentencing (see Maktouf and Damjanovic, cited above, §§ 69-70)."

In particular, unlike in the case of Maktouf and Damjanović, in the applicant’s case the domestic courts took into account in their assessment of the more lenient criminal law not only the statutory maximum and minimum prison sentence that could have been imposed on the applicant, but also the possibility provided for by the new law to impose a fine and the manner in which a sentence was to be served under both the new and the old law – more specifically, whether the serving of the sentence could be suspended or the imposition of a penalty postponed.

It sentenced him to a suspended term of two and a half years ’ imprisonment and placed him on probation for five years. The applicant was also placed under supervision and ordered to undergo treatment for alcohol dependency. The court based its decision on the statements given by the applicant, the victim (his wife) and several witnesses, including the couple ’ s two children – who reported, among other incidents, ten instances of the applicant verbally insulting his wife, four instances of the applicant grabbing his wife by the arms and strangling her, and verbal and/or physical assaults committed by the applicant on his wife at monthly intervals – and on documentary evidence and expert reports.

Lastly, the court considered that, owing to the duration of the conduct in question, the offence committed in the present case presented a relatively high degree of danger which justified a sentence ranging from two to eight years ’ imprisonment under paragraph 2 of Article 215a of the Criminal Code. Taking into consideration the extenuating circumstances (in particular the fact that the applicant had confessed and that he had no previous convictions), it imposed a suspended sentence situated at the lower end of the range."

On this point the Supreme Court noted, referring to its ruling Tzn 12/93 of 8 December 1993, that where there was, as in the case at hand, a “ continuation of the criminal offence ” ( pokračování v trestném činu ), which was considered to constitute a single act, its classification in criminal law had to be assessed under the law in force at the time of completion of the last occurrence of the offence. That law therefore also applied to the earlier acts, provided that these would have amounted to criminal conduct under the previous law. In the instant case the Supreme Court considered that the applicant ’ s conduct prior to the amendment of the Criminal Code on 1 June 2004 had amounted at least to an offence punishable under Article 197a or Article 221 § 1 of the Criminal Code.

Concerning the continuation of the offence, the Supreme Court noted that the abuse itself amounted to ill-treatment characterised by a certain duration. For the offence to be regarded as having continued over a long period of time it had to have lasted for some months. As the applicant had perpetrated the offence in question at least from 2000 until 8 February 2006, that is, over a period of several years, his conduct certainly disclosed the material element of continuation of the offence of abuse under Article 215a § 2 (b) of the Criminal Code."

Two different approaches were developed by scholars and legislatures, based on a subjective and an objective view of the notion of a continuous criminal offence. According to the subjective view, which existed, for instance, in Italy (see, for example, Article 81 of the 1930 Italian Criminal Code), a continuous criminal offence was a group of acts united by a single intention, by one single criminal plan. According to the objective view, developed mainly in Germany (see, for example, Article 110 of the 1813 Bavarian Criminal Code), a continuous criminal offence was based on the repeated intention of the offender to attack the same or similar object or legally protected interest ( Rechtsgut ). Moreover, the fact that the repetition of the criminal acts and of the criminal intention was facilitated by the material circumstances – involving the offender, the close temporal connection and the identity of the legally protected interest affected – was seen as justifying the imposition of a lighter penalty on the offender. This objective perspective gained support all over Europe, with some countries incorporating it in their legislation.

It accepted that, from the standpoint of Czech law, extending the application of the Criminal Code, as worded after 1 June 2004, to acts committed by the applicant prior to that date had not amounted to retroactive application of the criminal law. It also observed that the interpretation of the general concept of a continuation of a criminal offence as defined in Article 89 § 3 of the Criminal Code had been based on the clear and established case-law of the Supreme Court which had been developed prior to the date on which the applicant had first assaulted his wife. In so far as the applicant disputed the effects of that interpretation, which in his view had in fact resulted in retroactive application of the law, the Chamber held that the interpretation adopted by the courts in the present case had not in itself been unreasonable, given that a continuous offence, by definition, extended over a certain period of time and that it was not arbitrary to consider that it had ceased at the time of the last occurrence of the offence. Moreover, the Czech authorities had observed that the applicant ’ s acts had at all times been punishable as criminal offences. In these circumstances the relevant legal provisions, together with the interpretative case-law, had been such as to enable the applicant to foresee the legal consequences of his acts and adapt his conduct accordingly.",

While admitting that the domestic courts ’ interpretation of Article 89 § 3 of the Criminal Code was foreseeable and generally accepted, the applicant asserted that it should not have been applied in his case since the conditions for applying the provision in question had not been met. In his opinion, the domestic authorities ought not to have classified his acts as a continuous offence because his assaults had not been driven by the same intent, nor had they been closely connected in time since there had been an interval of several years between the different assaults. He also pointed out that when the proceedings took place before the first-instance court, the prosecution of two individual assaults had already been statute - barred and they could not therefore be the subject of criminal proceedings."

In the applicant ’ s opinion, his acts had not been punishable as criminal offences but simply as regulatory offences. He had thus been convicted of acts which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time they were committed, in breach of Article 7 of the Convention."

The Government noted that both Article 89 § 3 and Article 215a of the Criminal Code had been incorporated into the Czech legal system well before the applicant had ceased his criminal conduct in February 2006. At the relevant time there had also existed a considerable body of case-law in respect of continuous offences and the interpretation of Article 89 § 3 of the Criminal Code which followed the same logic as that applied in the instant case. It was thus clearly established that the conduct should be assessed as a single offence under the law in force at the time it came to an end. Moreover, in the Government ’ s view, the introduction on 1 June 2004 of Article 21 5a of the Criminal Code had rendered the likelihood of the applicant ’ s being held criminally liable even clearer and more foreseeable. Indeed, the new Article 215a of the Criminal Code dealt with unlawful conduct in a more comprehensive manner than Articles 197a and 221. Since the applicant had continued his unlawful acts after 1 June 2004, he could and should have expected to be held criminally liable under Article 215a of the Criminal Code for all his acts including those that had preceded the change in the legislation."

Contrary to what had been suggested by the applicant, the Government asserted that the requirement of a close temporal connection between the assaults constituting the continuous offence had also been satisfied in this case. They conceded that the close temporal connection as defined by domestic judicial practice generally referred to days, weeks or months. However, a maximum limit had never been set and the notion necessarily allowed for flexibility depending on the nature of the offence in question. It followed from the evidence gathered in the case and from the domestic courts ’ reasoning that the three incidents which occurred on 24 June 2000, 17 July 2003 and 8 February 2006 had been singled out as the most violent. The courts had consistently held that the applicant ’ s unlawful conduct had spanned a period of several years and that the individual assaults perpetrated by him had been of varying intensity and recurrent in nature, occurring within weeks of each other. Furthermore, the bill of indictment as well as the domestic courts ’ decisions had clearly stated that the applicant was being tried for actions carried out before and after the entry into force of Article 215a, actions which could not be separated from each other. The requirement of legal certainty had thus been met as a result of the consistent assessment of the case by the prosecution and the courts ( the Government cited, to converse effect, Ecer and Zeyrek v. Turkey, nos. 29295/95 and 29363/95, §§ 33-35, ECHR 2001 ‑ II). It was clear from the conviction itself that the courts were also of the view that the applicant ’ s actions taken as a whole had disclosed the elements of the offence defined by Article 215a of the Criminal Code."

The Government therefore concluded that the requirement of a sufficiently clear and foreseeable legal basis had been satisfied, that the new criminal law had not been applied retroactively and that the applicant had not been given a heavier penalty than under the old law. In this regard, they assumed that, had the concept of a continuous offence as understood by the Czech courts been abandoned and the applicant ’ s actions before and after 1 June 2004 been assessed separately, the applicant ’ s possible sentence would have been either the same or more severe than the one actually imposed. Indeed, in that event the applicant would have been tried for multiple offences punishable by a concurrent sentence which would have been defined on the basis of the provision concerning the most serious offence, that is to say, Article 215a of the Criminal Code. Moreover, the existence of multiple criminal offences and the duration of the conduct in question would have constituted aggravating circumstances."

                "50. The Court observes that in Del Río Prada v. Spain ([GC], no. 42750/09, ECHR 2013), its most recent Grand Chamber judgment concerning Article 7 of the Convention, it stated the following general principles that are relevant to its determination of the present case:",
                "“ (a) Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege",
                "77. The guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 even in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 34, Series A no. 335-B; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 3 2, Series A no. 335 ‑ C; and Kafkaris [ v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04 ], ... § 137[, ECHR 2008 ]).",
                "78. Article 7 of the Convention is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage (concerning the retrospective application of a penalty, see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 36, Series A no. 307 ‑ A; Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, § 35, Series A no. 317 ‑ B; Ecer and Zeyrek v. Turkey, nos. 29295/95 and 29363/95, § 36, ECHR 2001 ‑ II; and Mihai Toma v. Romania, no. 1051/06, §§ 26-31, 24 January 2012). It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege – see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260-A). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy (see Coëme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 145, ECHR 2000-VII; for an example of the application of a penalty by analogy, see Başkaya and Okçuoğlu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 23536/94 and 24408/94, §§ 42 ‑ 43, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV).",
                "79. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision, if need be with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and after taking appropriate legal advice, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable and what penalty he faces on that account (see Cantoni v. France, 15 November 1996, § 29, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V, and Kafkaris, cited above, § 140).",
                "80. The Court must therefore verify that at the time when an accused person performed the act which led to his being prosecuted and convicted there was in force a legal provision which made that act punishable, and that the punishment imposed did not exceed the limits fixed by that provision (see Coëme and Others, cited above, § 145, and Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, § 43, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV).",
                "(b) The concept of a ‘ penalty ’ and its scope",
                "(c) Foreseeability of criminal law",
                "91. When speaking of ‘ law ’ Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statutory law as well as case-law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see Kokkinakis, cited above, §§ 40 ‑ 41; Cantoni, cited above, § 29; Coëme and Others, cited above, § 145; and E.K. v. Turkey, no. 28496/95, § 51, 7 February 2002 ). These qualitative requirements must be satisfied as regards both the definition of an offence and the penalty the offence carries.",
                "92. It is a logical consequence of the principle that laws must be of general application that the wording of statutes is not always precise. One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 40, and Cantoni, cited above, § 31). However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 141).",
                "93. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain ( ibid. ). The progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition in the Convention States (see Kruslin v. France, 24 April 1990, § 29, Series A no. 176 ‑ A). Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 36; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 34; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz [ v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96 and 2 others, § 50 [, ECHR 2001 ‑ II]; K.-H.W. v. Germany [GC], no. 37201/97, § 85, 22 March 2001; Korbely v. Hungary [GC], no. 9174/02, § 71, ECHR 2008; and Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, § 185, ECHR 2010). The lack of an accessible and reasonably foreseeable judicial interpretation can even lead to a finding of a violation of the accused ’ s Article 7 rights (see, concerning the constituent elements of the offence, Pessino v. France, no. 40403/02, §§ 35-36, 10 October 2006, and Dragotoniu and Militaru-Pidhorni v. Romania, nos. 77193/01 and 77196/01, §§ 43-44, 24 May 2007; as regards the penalty, see Alimuçaj v. Albania, no. 20134/05, §§ 154-62, 7 February 2012). Were that not the case, the object and the purpose of this provision – namely that no one should be subjected to arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment – would be defeated .”"

Romania, no. 24916/05, § 59, 24 May 2011). More generally, the Court points out that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. Its role is thus confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ I; Korbely v. Hungary [GC], no. 9174/02, §§ 72-73, ECHR 2008; and Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, § 197, ECHR 2010 )."

It was indeed for the domestic authorities to assess the findings of facts and the applicant ’ s intent on the basis of the evidence presented before them and to decide, pursuant to the domestic law as interpreted in judicial practice, whether the applicant ’ s conduct ought to be classified as a continuous offence, a continuing offence or as repeated or cumulative offences. Thus, it is not for the Court to express an opinion on whether the acts committed by the applicant before 1 June 2004 comprised the constituent elements of criminal offences defined by the above provisions (see, mutatis mutandis, Lehideux and Isorni v. France, 23 September 1998, § 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VII) or whether the applicant ’ s conduct was to be classified as a continuous offence under domestic law."

Firstly, it must examine whether, at the time they were committed, the applicant ’ s acts, including those carried out before the entry into force of Article 215a of the Criminal Code on 1 June 2004, constituted an offence defined with sufficient foreseeability by domestic law (see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

Secondly, the Court must determine whether the application of this provision by the national courts to encompass those acts that were committed before 1 June 2004 entailed a real possibility of the applicant ’ s being subjected to a heavier penalty in breach of Article 7 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Maktouf and Damjanović [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 70, ECHR 2013 ).",

Turkey, nos. 29295/95 and 29363/95, ECHR 2001-I and Veeber, cited above). In the aforementioned judgments the Court observed that, by definition, such an offence was a type of crime committed over a period of time (see Veeber, cited above, § 35). It further held that, when an accused was charged with a “continuing” offence, the principle of legal certainty required that the acts which went to make up that offence, and which entailed his criminal liability, be clearly set out in the bill of indictment. Furthermore, the decision rendered by the domestic court also had to make it clear that the accused ’ s conviction and sentence resulted from a finding that the elements of a “continuing” offence had been made out by the prosecution (see Ecer and Zeyrek, cited above, § 33)."

The Convention may not act as a bar to this kind of judicial interpretation, provided that the conclusions reached by the domestic courts are reasonably foreseeable within the meaning of the Court ’ s case-law (see Previti v.

Turning to the specific circumstances of the present case, the Court notes from the outset that the applicant was convicted as charged, namely for having, at least between 2000 and 8 February 2006, repeatedly abused his wife both physically and mentally while he was drunk (for further details, see paragraph 10 above). As a result, his wife had sustained serious injuries obliging her to seek medical assistance on 26 June 2000, 18 July 2003 and 8 February 2006 (see paragraph 10 above). In its judgment of 21 February 2008, the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts ’ legal classification of the offence as abuse of a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a of the Criminal Code, as in force since 1 June 2004, and applied that provision also to the abuse perpetrated by the applicant against his wife before that date. In that connection, the Supreme Court referred to its ruling ( Tzn 12/93) of 8 December 1993 to the effect that a continuous criminal offence was to be considered as a single act and that its legal classification in criminal law had to be assessed under the law in force at the time of completion of the last occurrence of the offence. Thus Article 215a also applied to the earlier assaults, provided that these would have amounted to criminal conduct under the previous law, and the applicant ’ s conduct prior to the amendment of 1 June 2004 had amounted at least to an offence punishable under Article 197a or Article 221 § 1 of the Criminal Code. After examining the file, the Supreme Court concluded that the applicant ’ s actions disclosed all the constituent elements of the offence of abusing a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a §§ 1 and 2 (b) of the Code. Since the offence in question had been perpetrated at least from 2000 until 8 February 2006, the material conditions for considering the offence as aggravated on the ground of its long duration, in accordance with paragraph 2 (b) of Article 215a, had been fulfilled (see paragraph 13 above)."

It emerges from the clear and settled case-law of the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 25 - 27 above) and from the views expressed in the legal literature (see paragraph 24 above) that a continuous offence was considered to constitute a single act, whose classification in Czech criminal law had to be assessed under the rules in force at the time of completion of the last occurrence of the offence, provided that the acts committed under any previous law would have been punishable also under the older law."

Moreover, in its judgment of 10 June 2008, the Constitutional Court held that the national courts ’ decisions in the applicant ’ s case had been logical and coherent and had not had any retroactive effect prohibited by the Constitution.

On the contrary, had the acts perpetrated by him prior to 1 June 2004 been assessed separately from those he committed after that date, the relevant sentencing rule in Article 35 § 1 of the Criminal Code would have resulted in sentence being passed on the basis of the legal provision concerning the most serious of the offences, namely Article 215a of the Criminal Code. In that event, as pointed out by the Government, he would have received at least the same sentence as the one actually imposed, or even a harsher one, on the ground that the existence of multiple offences was likely to be deemed an aggravating circumstance under Article 34k of the Criminal Code."

Under Article 67 § 1 ( d) of the Criminal Code, the statutory limitation period was three years in respect of offences punishable by a maximum sentence of less than three years.

By way of comparison it is worth noting in this context that the notion of a continuous criminal offence as defined in Czech law is in line with the European tradition reflected in the national laws of the vast majority of Council of Europe member States (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above) and that, accordingly, the situation as regards the issue of foreseeability raised in the present case appears not to be markedly different from that obtaining in relation to such offences in the national legal systems of other Contracting Parties to the Convention. As can be seen from the domestic authorities ’ description of the applicant ’ s conduct, his acts were directed against a specific victim, namely his wife, and particularly against her legal interests of physical and mental integrity as well as honour. It is also clear that the modus operandi was the same, consisting of attacks committed under the same roof; that there was a temporal connection between the various acts, which spanned several years; that each assault committed during this period of time was driven by the same criminal intent; and that the applicant ’ s conduct was on each occasion in breach of the criminal law. In other words, the offence of which the applicant was convicted shared a number of characteristics common to such offences elsewhere in the Convention community, as did the response of the criminal justice system, in the form of a sentence handed down for one single offence (see paragraphs 33 - 37 above)."

The arguments of the Constitutional Court in its decision of 26 January 2011 and their reiteration by the Government in the present case cannot negate the fact that there was no death penalty after the relevant provisions of the 1960 Criminal Code had been declared unconstitutional and had lost their force. The Court takes notice of the specific context in which the abolition of the death penalty took place in Ukraine (see paragraphs 28-30 above) and accepts that the creation of the gap had been unintentional. Indeed, it would be difficult to argue that the wording of the 1960 Criminal Code, which existed between 29 December 1999 and 29 March 2000, contained a punishment for the type of crime committed by the applicant that the legislator considered proportionate. In the light of the Court ’ s case law under Article 7, the intention of the legislator to humanize the criminal law and to give retrospective effect to more lenient law is an important factor ( Gouarré Patte v. Andorra, cited above, § 35 ). From the cited domestic law and practice, the Court cannot detect any intention of the legislator in particular, and of the State in general, to mitigate the law to the extent claimed by the applicant. At the time when the applicant committed his crime in 1996, it was punishable by the death penalty. The Parliament then replaced that penalty with the life sentence, which it considered proportionate."

                "‘ \"I also wish to congratulate the Ukrainian parliament on the adoption of the laws on political parties and on the ratification of the European Charter for regional or minority languages. These three decisions brought Ukraine significantly closer to the fulfilment of the Assembly Resolution 1194 adopted in June 1999 ’ \", the President added.",
                "‘ \"This progress is of the utmost importance at this stage of the monitoring procedure. In June the Assembly had decided to start the procedure to suspend certain rights of the Ukrainian delegation if no further compliance with the Assembly ’ s requests is accomplished before the end of this month ’ \", Lord Russell-Johnston said.",

                "Resolution 1194 stated that the Ukrainian authorities, including the Parliament - the Verkhovna Rada - were responsible to a great extent for the failure to respect their commitments and obligations as a member of the Council of Europe. Further progress was necessary to bring the Ukrainian legislation into conformity with European standards and to ensure that the Ukrainian authorities observe these principles in their practical work.",

The applicant maintained that in his case the courts should have applied the most favourable wording of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code, which was that which had been in place between 29 December 1999 and 29 March 2000, when the death penalty had already been abolished and life imprisonment had not yet been introduced. Failure to do so, in his opinion, violated Article 7 of the Convention, which reads as follows:",

He further maintained that from when he had allegedly committed the crimes attributed to him in 1996, the relevant provisions of the 1960 Criminal Code had foreseen the following punishments:",

The applicant agreed with the Government ’ s contention that life imprisonment was a lesser sentence than the death penalty, but stated that this did not change the fact that between 29 December 1999 and 29 March 2000 the maximum possible punishment provided for by the Criminal Code had been a custodial sentence of fifteen years and that there had been no alternative. If the applicant had been sentenced during that period of time, the courts would have had no choice but to sentence him to a maximum of fifteen years ’ imprisonment, as no other alternative had been available in the Criminal Code."

They noted that after the decision of the Constitutional Court of 29 December 1999 no new law had been created. They stated that the criminal law could only be changed by the Verkhovna Rada and that the provisions for aggravated murder had not lost their alternative character. They considered that the period after 29 December 1999 had been given to the Verkhovna Rada in order to bring the 1960 Criminal Code into line with the decision of 29 December 1999. They referred to the decision of the Constitutional Court of 26 January 2011 (cited above) in support of their argument. They maintained that the 1960 Criminal Code had only changed and become a new law after the introduction of amendments by the Verkhovna Rada which had come into force on 29 March 2000. The Government concluded that the fact that the domestic courts had sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment had not violated the principle of retroactivity of the more lenient version of the 1960 Criminal Code that pertained from 29 December 1999 to 29 March 2000 as no such version of the Criminal Code had existed.",
                "(a) Summary of the relevant principles"
            ],
            [
                "37. The Court first reiterates that the guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, so as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy ( Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, § 185, ECHR 2010; Maktouf and Damjanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC ], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 66, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). Article 7 § 1 guarantees not only the principle of non-retrospectiveness of more stringent criminal laws but also, implicitly, the principle of retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law; in other words, where there are differences between the criminal law in force at the time of the commission of an offence and subsequent criminal laws enacted before a final judgment is rendered, the courts must apply the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 109, 17 September 2009)."
            ],
            [
                "38. In the above Scoppola (no. 2) case ( § 108 ) the Court also noted:",
                "“In the Court ’ s opinion, it is consistent with the principle of the rule of law, of which Article 7 forms an essential part, to expect a trial court to apply to each punishable act the penalty which the legislator considers proportionate. Inflicting a heavier penalty ... would amount to disregarding any legislative change favourable to the accused which might have come in before the conviction and continuing to impose penalties which the State – and the community it represents – now consider excessive.”"
            ],
            [
                "39. In the recent case of Gouarré Patte v. Andorra the Court extended the guarantees of Article 7 to the possibility of retrospective revision of the final sentence if the domestic law provided for such a possibility. In coming to such conclusion, the Court relied on the choice of the legislator in introducing retrospectiveness of more lenient punishments ( Gouarré Patte v. Andorra, no. 33427/10, §§ 33 to 36, 12 January 2016)."
            ],

                "40. The Court notes also that in the recent inadmissibility decision in the case of Mikulović and Vujisić v. Serbia ( (dec.), nos. 49318/07 and 58216/13, 17 December 2015), it examined whether the process of abolition of the death penalty in then federative two-layer system created a legislative gap when the death penalty had been abolished in the Federal code but the Serbian code had been changed only four months later. In that case, the Court examined the existence of the legislative gap and answered in negative, thus leaving the question open as to whether existence of such gap might necessarily lead to a violation of Article 7.",

                "41. In the applicant ’ s case, he was found guilty of crimes committed in 1996, but was ultimately convicted of those crimes only in 2010 by the final decision of the Supreme Court. During this fourteen year period Ukrainian criminal law was modified on several occasions. The 1960 Criminal Code, inherited from Soviet times, provided for the death penalty as an alternative to imprisonment for the crime of aggravated murder. This was the situation in 1996, when the applicant committed the crimes he was eventually convicted of in the domestic courts. On 29 December 1999 the Constitutional Court declared the death penalty as a punishment unconstitutional and instructed the Verkhovna Rada to bring the Criminal Code of Ukraine into line with this decision. The unconstitutional provisions lost their force. Three months later the amendments adopted by the Verkhovna Rada replaced the abolished death penalty with life imprisonment as the maximum punishment for certain crimes, including aggravated murder. From 2 9 March 2000 and until the entry into force of the new Criminal Code on 1 September 2001 the maximum penalty for aggravated murder was life imprisonment. This punishment is also provided for in the new 2001 Criminal Code in force today."

            [
                "42. The Court notes that there is no dispute between the parties as to the principle of retroactivity of the most lenient wording of a criminal law as such, but rather of interpretation of the version of the Criminal Code which existed between 29 December 1999 and 29 March 2000. The Government suggested that the 1960 Criminal Code had not changed immediately after the decision of the Constitutional Court, but only from when the Verkhovna Rada had complied with that decision and had replaced the death penalty with life imprisonment. The applicant, on the basis of the decision of the Constitutional Court of 29 December 1999 concluded that all provisions which had foreseen the death penalty had lost their force immediately and as the Verkhovna Rada had taken some time to replace the abolished death penalty with life imprisonment, there had been no provision in the 1960 Criminal Code which had provided for a heavier penalty than fifteen years ’ imprisonment."

            [
                "43. The Court reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. Its role is thus confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ I; Korbely v. Hungary [GC], no. 9174/02, §§ 72-73, ECHR 2008; and Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, § 197, ECHR 2010)."
            ],
            [
                "44. From the relevant provisions of the Constitution, it appears that once the Constitutional Court declares a legal provision unconstitutional, such provision loses its validity immediately (see paragraph 19 above). Moreover, it does not appear that any other option, such as for example suspension of the relevant legal provision, exists under the relevant provision of Article 152 of the Constitution. The operative part of the Constitutional Court decision of 29 December 1999 – “[ T ]he provisions ... of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which provide for the death penalty as a form of punishment, are declared to be ... unconstitutional” followed by “[t]he provisions of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which have been declared unconstitutional, shall be null and void from the date of adoption of this Decision by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine” – does not seem to allow any other interpretation either. Contrary to the Government ’ s view, this was also admitted as a matter of fact by the Constitutional Court itself in its decision of 26 January 2011, in which it referred to “non-simultaneous loss of force of the provisions of the Code of 1960 on the death penalty and the entry into force of Law no. 1483 introducing of a new type of punishment”."
            ],
            [
                "45. The arguments of the Constitutional Court in its decision of 26 January 2011 and their reiteration by the Government in the present case cannot negate the fact that there was no death penalty after the relevant provisions of the 1960 Criminal Code had been declared unconstitutional and had lost their force. The Court takes notice of the specific context in which the abolition of the death penalty took place in Ukraine (see paragraphs 28-30 above) and accepts that the creation of the gap had been unintentional. Indeed, it would be difficult to argue that the wording of the 1960 Criminal Code, which existed between 29 December 1999 and 29 March 2000, contained a punishment for the type of crime committed by the applicant that the legislator considered proportionate. In the light of the Court ’ s case law under Article 7, the intention of the legislator to humanize the criminal law and to give retrospective effect to more lenient law is an important factor ( Gouarré Patte v. Andorra, cited above, § 35 ). From the cited domestic law and practice, the Court cannot detect any intention of the legislator in particular, and of the State in general, to mitigate the law to the extent claimed by the applicant. At the time when the applicant committed his crime in 1996, it was punishable by the death penalty. The Parliament then replaced that penalty with the life sentence, which it considered proportionate."
            ],
            [
                "46. Thus the refusal of the domestic courts to consider the 1960 Criminal Code in its wording of 29 December 1999 as the most lenient law enacted before the final verdict and applying instead the wording of the law adopted by the Parliament which came into effect on 29 March 2000, that is long before the applicant ’ s conviction, and which has been in place ever since, did not upset the applicant ’ s rights as guaranteed by Article 7 of the Convention. As the Court has found previously, the sentence of life imprisonment is not a heavier sentence than the death penalty (see, among many other authorities, Hummatov v. Azerbaijan (dec.), nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, 18 May 2006; and Stepanenko and Ososkalo v. Ukraine (dec.), nos. 31430/09 and 29104/11, 14 January 2014). Therefore, the domestic courts, having sentenced the applicant to the life imprisonment, which was an applicable penalty at the time of conviction, and not to the death penalty, which was a relevant penalty at the time he had committed the crime, did apply the more lenient punishment. It follows that there was no violation of Article 7 of the Convention."
