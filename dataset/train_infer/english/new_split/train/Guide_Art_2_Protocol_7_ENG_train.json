                "124. The Court first notes that the applicant was convicted under the CAO, which prescribes penalties for offences that do not fall within the criminal sphere in the domestic law. This may raise a question as to whether or not the offence of which the applicant was convicted was of a minor character within the meaning of Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 7 and the exception contained in that provision should apply. The Court recalls that the Commission has previously found an offence, such as an “offence against the order in court”, for which a maximum penalty of 10,000 Austrian shillings or, if indispensable for maintaining the order, imprisonment for a period not exceeding eight days was prescribed by the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure, to be of a “minor character” (see Putz v. Austria, no. 18892/91, Commission decision of 3 December 1993, DR 76-A, p. 51). In the present case, the applicant was sentenced to three days of detention. However, Article 172 of the CAO, under which this sentence was imposed, prescribed up to 15 days of detention as a maximum penalty. The Court considers that a penalty of 15 days of imprisonment is sufficiently severe not to be regarded as being of a “minor character” within the meaning of Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 7."

                "125. The Court recalls that Contracting States enjoy in principle a wide margin of appreciation in determining how the right secured by Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention is to be exercised. In certain countries, a defendant wishing to appeal may sometimes be required to seek permission to do so. However, any restrictions contained in domestic legislation on that right of review must, by analogy with the right of access to a court embodied in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, pursue a legitimate aim and not infringe the very essence of that right (see Krombach, cited above, § 96; Gurepka, cited above, § 59)."

                "126. The Court is mindful of its finding above that the review procedure prescribed by Article 294 of the CAO does not provide an individual with a clear and accessible right to appeal (see paragraphs 40 -4 2 above). This Article prescribes a power of review by the chairman of a superior court – whether or not upon the individual's request – which, moreover, lacks any clearly defined procedure or time-limits and consistent application in practice. In the Court's opinion, such a review possibility cannot be compatible with Article 2 of Protocol No. 7. It follows that the applicant did not have at his disposal an appeal procedure which would satisfy the requirements of this Article."

On the other hand, if he signed the record and refused a lawyer, he would be immediately taken to a court, where at worst a small fine would be imposed and he would be released.

With others, the police manipulated the ambiguity, threatening both criminal and administrative charges.

                "33. The Government claimed that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies in respect of the decision of 7 April 2003, as required by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. According to Article 286 of the CAO, the court's decision to impose an administrative penalty was final and not subject to appeal except for the cases prescribed by law. Such an exception in respect of cases concerning offences under Article 172 of the CAO was provided by Article 294 of the CAO. This Article prescribed two possibilities to have the court's decision quashed, either by requesting the prosecutor to lodge a protest or by lodging an appeal directly with the chairman of a superior court. Thus, if a party had applied to a prosecutor but the latter refused to lodge a protest, then this party was entitled to appeal to the chairman of a superior court. Moreover, a party was entitled to appeal immediately to the chairman of a superior court without having first applied to a prosecutor. The applicant was informed about this possibility, since the decision of 7 April 2003 stated that “it was subject to review by the Chairman of the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal”. However, he used only the first of these two possibilities and did not apply to the Chairman."

First, he argued that it was not clear from the wording of Article 294 of the CAO to the chairman of which “ superior ” court he should, according to the Government, have applied, since the division of courts into superior and inferior was an inherent element of the Soviet court system and no longer existed in Armenia. Even assuming that the phrase “superior court” implied the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal, neither Article 294 nor any other article of the CAO prescribed a right of the convicted person to lodge an appeal against the court's decision imposing administrative detention. From the wording of Article 294 it might as well be inferred that the chairman of the superior court could review such decisions of his own motion, a procedure which was not uncommon to the Soviet court system. Had this Article afforded a right to appeal as opposed to a power of review, then such an appeal would have lain with the panel of three judges of a court of appeal rather than its chairman, if this procedure was to comply with the general procedural rules applied in Armenia in the context of both criminal and civil proceedings."

Second, the applicant contended that Article 294 prescribed a review of a final decision either by the judge himself upon the prosecutor's protest or, whether or not such a protest was lodged, by the chairman of the superior court. These were two equal avenues of judicial protection and the aggrieved individual had the right to choose one of them and was not obliged to pursue both of them simultaneously or one after another. In any event, he was not obliged to exhaust remedies which were not effective and adequate according to the generally recognised rules of international law. An application to the chairman of the superior court under Article 294 would have not been such a remedy, since many similar applications lodged by other individuals who had been subjected to administrative penalties for participation in the rallies of protest in the period following the presidential election proved to be unsuccessful."

The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring a case against the State before an international judicial body to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system, thus dispensing States from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems. In order to comply with the rule, normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria no. 24760/94, § 85, ECHR 1999-VIII)."

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Akdivar and Others v.

Russia (dec.), no. 33408/03, 6 May 2004 ). Furthermore, remedies the use of which depend on the discretionary powers of public officials cannot be considered as effective remedies within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention ( see Tumilovich v. Russia (dec.), no. 47033/99, 2 June 1999; Gurepka v. Ukraine, no. 61406/00, § 60, 6 September 2005 ). Nor can remedies which have no precise time-limits, thus creating uncertainty and rendering nugatory the six-month rule contained in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention which is closely interrelated with the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies (see Berdzenishvili v. Russia (dec.), no. 31697/03, 29 January 2004; Denisov, cited above )."

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that Article 286 of the CAO explicitly states that the court's (judge's) decision to impose an administrative penalty is “final and not subject to appeal”. Article 294 of the CAO further provides that it “can be quashed or modified by the judge himself upon a protest of the prosecutor and, whether or not such a protest is lodged, by the chairman of the superior court”. The Court considers first of all that, as regards the possibility of applying to a prosecutor with a request to lodge a protest, this is clearly not an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention since it is not directly accessible to a party and depends on the discretionary powers of a prosecutor."

                "41. As regards the review carried out by the chairman of the superior court, the parties disagreed as to whether this review was carried out upon an appeal of an interested party or of the chairman's own motion. The Court notes from the outset that no further details of this procedure are provided by the CAO. It is true that Article 286 allows for exceptions. However, contrary to what the Government claim, nothing suggests that Article 294 can be considered as such exception. Indeed, the wording used in this Article, namely “can be quashed or modified by the chairman”, as opposed to “an appeal can be lodged against”, which is the wording used in Armenia in the context of both criminal and civil procedure, suggests that this Article provides for a power of review rather than a right to appeal. The Court further notes that the application of this procedure in practice also appears to be inconsistent : while the decision of 7 April 2003 states that “it is subject to review by the Chairman”, many other similar court decisions – copies of which were submitted by the applicant – state that they “are final and not subject to appeal” or “can be protested against by the prosecutor”. The Government, in their turn, failed to submit any evidence in support of their interpretation of Article 294. In such circumstances, the Court does not find the Government's interpretation to be convincing and considers that Article 294 of the CAO provided for a power of review by the chairman rather than a right of a party to appeal. Even assuming that a party – just as in the case of applying to a prosecutor – could solicit such a review, nothing suggests that the chairman was obliged to act upon the party's relevant request. Moreover, neither the CAO nor the decision of 7 April 2003 itself prescribed any time-limits for this review."

However, the fact that members of a tribunal are appointed by the executive does not in itself call into question its independence ( ibid., p. 40, § 79). The Court notes that judges were appointed to their posts on the basis of a special proficiency test. Furthermore, safeguards of the independence of judges, such as security of judge's tenure, their irremovability and freedom from outside instructions or pressure, were guaranteed by the Constitution and the implementing legislation.

Despite the fact that the Government did not explicitly dispute this submission, the Court considers that compelling evidence would be required to convince it that a certain official document is a fake. It is true that the record was drawn up in a calligraphic handwriting, which prompts the Court to believe that it was possibly drafted – or at least re-drafted – at some point after the hearing. While this may raise some doubts as to the accuracy of the record, it is nevertheless not sufficient for the Court to conclude that the record is a fake.

The applicant claimed that the court had based its decision on the materials prepared by the police, namely the record of an administrative offence, and ignored all his arguments. The Court recalls, however, that it is not within its province to substitute its own assessment of the facts and the evidence for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for these courts to assess the evidence before them (see, among many other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 247 ‑ B, pp. 34-35, § 34; Bernard v. France, judgment of 23 April 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ II, p. 879, § 37). Furthermore, while Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law. It is therefore not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence may be admissible or, indeed, whether the applicant was guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. In determining whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, regard must also be had to whether the rights of the defence have been respected. It must be examined in particular whether the applicant was given the opportunity of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubts on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 5 4810/00, §§ 94- 96, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... )."

In the present case, the applicant – even if at a very brief hearing – was able to make submissions in defence of his position. On the other hand, none of the arresting police officers was called and examined in court. In this connection, the Court recalls, however, that the right to examine a witness can only be exercised if the accused has expressed his wish to do so (see Cardot v.

The Court recalls that the requirement of “impartiality” enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention has two aspects. Firstly, the tribunal must be subjectively free of personal prejudice or bias. Secondly, it must also be impartial from an objective viewpoint, that is, it must offer sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see Gautrin and Others v. France, judgment of 20 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, pp. 1030-31, § 58; Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 38784/97, § 58, ECHR 2002 ‑ I).

Denmark, judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 21, § 47; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 30, ECHR 2000 ‑ X). In the present case, the applicant alleged that the judge was biased for political reasons. In this respect, the Court considers that – while some of the materials in the case, such as the PACE documents and the Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper, suggest that the period surrounding the presidential election of 2003 was a period of increased political sensitivity – it is, nevertheless, not sufficient to conclude that the judge examining the applicant's particular case was personally biased for political grounds.

Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, pp. 19-20, § 58). The accused's right to a public hearing is not only an additional guarantee that an endeavour will be made to establish the truth but also helps to ensure that he is satisfied that his case is being determined by a tribunal whose independence and impartiality he may verify. The public character of proceedings before judicial bodies protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret without public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts, superior and inferior, can be maintained. By rendering the administration of justice visible, publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 § 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Fejde v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212 ‑ C, pp. 67-68, § 28; Tierce and Others v. San Marino, nos. 24954/94, 24971/94 and 24972/94, § 92, ECHR 2000 ‑ IX)."

                "81. In the present case, the Court notes at the outset that the hearing in question was formally public. Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see, among many other authorities, Sukhorubchenko v. Russia, no. 69315/01, § 43, 10 February 2005). The Court considers that the right to a public hearing would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed courts to hold hearings which were public in form but would not be in reality accessible to the public, including because of the time and location of the hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, Riepan v. Austria, no. 35115/97, § 29-31, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII). The Court notes, however, that it is not evident from the record of the court hearing at what time the applicant's trial was conducted. Nor did the applicant produce any other evidence which could support his allegation that this hearing took place at 23h00. It is therefore objectively impossible to establish the time of the court hearing and whether this precluded the hearing from being public. As regards the place of the hearing, it is true that the Government did not explicitly contest the applicant's allegation that the hearing in question took place in judge M.'s office as opposed to a courtroom (see paragraph 21 above). However, it follows from the record of the court hearing that the judge at a certain moment departed to a deliberation room, which suggests that the hearing was most likely held in a courtroom rather than an office. Furthermore, the fact that no members of the public were present at the hearing does not automatically render it not public. The Court finally notes that the applicant did not submit any arguments other than solely relying on the alleged time and location of the hearing in support of his allegation that it was not public. In such circumstances, the Court considers that there is no sufficient evidence to conclude that the hearing in question was not public."

The Court will therefore examine the relevant complaints under both provisions taken together (see, among many other authorities, F.C.B. v. Italy, judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 208 ‑ B, p. 20, § 29; Poitrimol v. France, judgment of 23 November 1993, Series A no. 277 ‑ A, p. 13, § 29).",

The Court recalls that Article 6 § 3 (b) guarantees the accused “adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence” and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on his behalf may comprise everything which is “necessary” to prepare the main trial. The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the possibility to put all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings (see Can v. Austria, no. 9300/81, Commission's report of 12 July 1984, Series A no. 96, § 53; Connolly v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 27245/95, 26 June 1996; Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 78, 20 January 200 5). Furthermore, the facilities which everyone charged with a criminal offence should enjoy include the opportunity to acquaint himself for the purposes of preparing his defence with the results of investigations carried out throughout the proceedings (see C.G.P. v. the Netherlands, (dec.), no. 29835/96, 15 January 1997; Foucher v. France, judgment of 18 March 1997, Reports 1997-II, §§ 26-38).

In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant's case was examined in an expedited procedure under the CAO: according to Article 277 of the CAO, cases concerning offences of minor hooliganism were to be examined within one day. The Court recalls, however, that the existence and utilisation of expeditious proceedings in criminal matters is not in itself contrary to Article 6 of the Convention as long as they provide the necessary safeguards and guarantees contained therein (see Borisova, cited above ). The Government claimed that it was open to the applicant to seek an adjournment of his case, if he considered the time afforded to him for the preparation of his defence to be insufficient, which he failed to do. The Court notes, however, that the CAO does not prescribe any exceptions to the rule contained in the above Article 277. Nor is the right to seek adjournment explicitly listed among the rights enjoyed by an accused in administrative proceedings (Article 267 of the CAO). The Government also failed to invoke any legal basis for such a right. Furthermore, neither the materials of the applicant's administrative case, nor the Government themselves, suggest that the applicant was made aware of the existence of such a possibility by the police officers or the court. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the Government have failed to demonstrate convincingly that the applicant unequivocally enjoyed, both in law and in practice, the right to have the examination of his case adjourned in order to prepare his defence and that such an adjournment would have possibly been granted, had the applicant made a relevant request (see, a contrario, Murphy, cited above)."

                "86. The Court notes that, according to the Government, the entire pre-trial procedure lasted two hours from 17 h 30 to 19 h 30. The Government claimed that, since the applicant's case was not a complex one, two hours had been sufficient, taking into account that he had refused to have a lawyer, had not availed himself of his right to lodge motions and challenges, and had voluntarily signed the record of an administrative offence. The Court considers, however, that the mere fact that the applicant signed a paper in which he stated that he did not wish to have a lawyer and chose to defend himself in person does not mean that he did not need to be afforded adequate time and facilities to prepare himself effectively for trial. Nor does the fact that the applicant did not lodge any specific motions during the short pre-trial period necessarily imply that no further time was needed for him to be able – in adequate conditions – to properly assess the charge against him and to consider various avenues to defend himself effectively. Finally, the Court agrees that the applicant had the choice of refusing to sign the record of an administrative offence. However, contrary to what the Government claim, nothing in law or in the materials of the applicant's administrative case suggests that the applicant's signing of the record pursued any other purpose than confirming the fact of him having been familiarised with it and made aware of his rights and the charge against him."

The Court notes that the record of an administrative offence, which contained the charge and was the main evidence against the applicant, does not indicate precisely at what time he was presented with this document and how much time he was given to review it. Nor can this be established in respect of the police report and other materials prepared by the police. The parties disagreed as regards the exact length of the pre-trial period but, in any event, it is evident that this period was not longer than a few hours. The Court further notes that during this time the applicant was either in transit to the court or was being kept in the police station without any contact with the outside world. Furthermore, during this short stay at the police station, the applicant was subjected to a number of investigative activities, including questioning and a search. Even if it is accepted that the applicant's case was not a complex one, the Court doubts that the circumstances in which the applicant's trial was conducted – from the moment of his arrest up until his conviction – were such as to enable him to familiarise himself properly with and to assess adequately the charge and evidence against him, and to develop a viable legal strategy for his defence."

The Court reiterates that, although not absolute, the right of everyone charged with a criminal offence to be effectively defended by a lawyer, assigned officially if need be, is one of the fundamental features of a fair trial ( see Krombach v. France, no. 29731/96, § 89, ECHR 2001-II ). Furthermore, Article 6 may also be relevant before a case is sent for trial and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with it (see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, p. 13, § 36; Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 131, ECHR 2005 ‑ ... ). The manner in which Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) are applied during the investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings and the facts of the case. Article 6 will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer already at the initial stages of police interrogation (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ I, pp. 54-55, § 63; Öcalan, cited above, § 131). The Court further recalls that the right of an accused to participate effectively in a criminal trial includes, in general, not only the right to be present, but also the right to receive legal assistance, if necessary ( see Lagerblom v. Sweden, no. 26891/95, 14 January 2003, § 49)."

Italy, judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, p. 14, § 28; Oberschlick v. Austria ( no. 1), judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 23, § 51; and Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, § 86, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... ). The Court considers that the requirements established by these principles were fulfilled in the present case in view of the following."

            [
                "91. The Court notes that all the materials before it indicate that the applicant expressly waived his right to be represented by a lawyer both before and during the court hearing (see paragraphs 14 and 20 above). While the nature of some of the rights safeguarded by the Convention is such as to exclude a waiver of the entitlement to exercise them (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp, cited above, p. 36, § 65), the same cannot be said of certain other rights (see Albert and Le Compte, cited above, p. 19, § 35). It is clear from the text of Article 6 § 3 (c) that an accused has the choice of defending himself either “in person or through legal assistance”. Thus, it will normally not be contrary to the requirements of this Article if an accused is self-represented in accordance with his own will, unless the interests of justice require otherwise. In the present case, there is no evidence that the applicant's choice to be self-represented was the result of any threats or physical violence. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the applicant's allegation that he was “tricked” into refusing a lawyer. Even though the PACE and Human Rights Watch reports referred to in paragraph 79 above contain relevant information, these materials are, nevertheless, not sufficient for the Court to conclude that actions, similar to the ones described in these reports, happened in the applicant's particular case. Finally, noting that the applicant was accused of a minor offence and the maximum possible sentence could not exceed 15 days of detention, the Court does not discern in the present case any interests of justice which would have required a mandatory legal representation."

It is, in any event, for the European Court to give a final ruling on the restriction's compatibility with the Convention and this is to be done by assessing the circumstances of a particular case (see Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001)."

On the other hand, the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that a person cannot be subjected to a sanction – even one at the lower end of the scale of disciplinary penalties – for participation in a demonstration which has not been prohibited, so long as this person does not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin, cited above, p. 23, § 53)."

                "116. The Court notes that, unlike in the Ezelin case, the applicant in the present case was subjected to a much more severe penalty, i.e. three days of deprivation of liberty, for committing the following actions at the demonstration in question, “obstruction of street traffic” and “making a loud noise”, as indicated in the decision of the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan of 7 April 2003. Neither this decision, nor the materials prepared by the police, provide any further details as to the circumstances under which these actions were committed. On the other hand, it is apparent from the police report that the street where the demonstration took place, namely the Mashtots Avenue, was packed with a great number of people (see paragraph 11 above), and the Government did not dispute that the street traffic had been suspended by the traffic police prior to the commencement of the demonstration (see paragraph 8 above). Furthermore, as already indicated above, the authorities did not make any attempts to disperse the participants in the demonstration on account of unlawful obstruction of traffic (see paragraph 101 above). It follows that the “obstruction of street traffic”, which the applicant was found guilty of, amounted to his physical presence at a demonstration held on a street where traffic had already been suspended beforehand by the authorities with the apparent intention of facilitating the conduct of a lawful demonstration. As to the loud noise made by the applicant, there is no suggestion that this noise involved any obscenity or incitement to violence. The Court, however, finds it hard to imagine a huge political demonstration, at which people express their opinion, not generating a certain amount of noise."

                "117. In the light of the above, the Court concludes that the applicant was sanctioned for the mere fact of being present and proactive at the demonstration in question, rather than for committing anything illegal, violent or obscene in the course of it. In this respect, the Court considers that the very essence of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly would be impaired, if the State was not to prohibit a demonstration but was then to impose sanctions, especially such severe ones, on its participants for the mere fact of attending it, without committing anything reprehensible, as happened in the applicant's case. The Court therefore concludes that the interference with the applicant's right to freedom of peaceful assembly was not “necessary in a democratic society”."

This may raise a question as to whether or not the offence of which the applicant was convicted was of a minor character within the meaning of Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 7 and the exception contained in that provision should apply. The Court recalls that the Commission has previously found an offence, such as an “offence against the order in court”, for which a maximum penalty of 10,000 Austrian shillings or, if indispensable for maintaining the order, imprisonment for a period not exceeding eight days was prescribed by the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure, to be of a “minor character” (see Putz v. Austria, no. 18892/91, Commission decision of 3 December 1993, DR 76-A, p. 51). In the present case, the applicant was sentenced to three days of detention. However, Article 172 of the CAO, under which this sentence was imposed, prescribed up to 15 days of detention as a maximum penalty. The Court considers that a penalty of 15 days of imprisonment is sufficiently severe not to be regarded as being of a “minor character” within the meaning of Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 7."

The Court has held that delays by the national courts in examining appeals against decrees on a special prison regime applicable for a limited period time may raise issues under the Convention, in particular, its Article 13. Thus, in Messina v. Italy (no. 2) the Court, while acknowledging that the right to an effective remedy was not infringed merely by a failure to comply with a statutory time-limit, concluded that the systematic failure to comply with the ten-day time-limit imposed on the courts was liable to considerably reduce, and indeed practically nullify, the impact of judicial review of the decrees on a special regime. One of the factors, which drove the Court to that conclusion, was the limited period of validity of each decree imposing the special regime (no. 25498/94, §§ 94 ‑ 96, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; see also Enea v. Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, §§ 73 and 74, ECHR 2009). In other words, a judicial review of a measure, which had by that time expired or almost expired, was considered to serve no longer any purpose."

This was done pursuant to the Code of Administrative Offences providing for the immediate enforcement of a sentence only if it concerned deprivation of liberty (with another unrelated exception – see paragraph 16 above). Had the sanction been different, the first-instance court ’ s decision would have become enforceable only in the absence of an appeal within the legally envisaged time-limits or once upheld by the appellate court. In the present case, however, the appellate review took place after the detention sentence imposed on the applicant by the first-instance court had been served in full.

Subject to paragraph 2, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those which offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no “democratic society”. Moreover, Article 10 of the Convention protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed (see, among many other authorities, Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), 23 May 1991, § 57, Series A no. 204, and Women On Waves and Others v. Portugal, no. 31276/05, §§ 29 and 30, 3 February 2009)."

The provision in question concerns, in particular, offensive behaviour disturbing public order (see paragraph 16 above). In the Court ’ s opinion, damaging the wreath ribbon by the applicant could be regarded as falling under the aforementioned category. The Court is mindful of the quite general legal definition of “petty hooliganism”, the interpretation and practical implementation of which might be open to abuse in certain cases. In the present case, however, the applicant resorted to a provocative gesture likely to disturb or insult some of the many people who witnessed it. Having regard to the applicant ’ s behaviour and to its classification by the domestic courts, the Court accepts that the applicable national legislation met the foreseeability requirement.

As the Court has observed in its case-law, the review by a higher court of a conviction or sentence may concern both points of fact and points of law or be confined solely to points of law. Furthermore, it is considered acceptable that, in certain countries, a defendant wishing to appeal may sometimes be required to seek permission to do so. However, any restrictions contained in domestic legislation on the right to a review mentioned in that provision must, by analogy with the right of access to a court embodied in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, pursue a legitimate aim and not infringe the very essence of that right (see Krombach, cited above, § 96; Gurepka v.

The Court has held that delays by the national courts in examining appeals against decrees on a special prison regime applicable for a limited period time may raise issues under the Convention, in particular, its Article 13. Thus, in Messina v. Italy (no. 2) the Court, while acknowledging that the right to an effective remedy was not infringed merely by a failure to comply with a statutory time-limit, concluded that the systematic failure to comply with the ten-day time-limit imposed on the courts was liable to considerably reduce, and indeed practically nullify, the impact of judicial review of the decrees on a special regime. One of the factors, which drove the Court to that conclusion, was the limited period of validity of each decree imposing the special regime (no. 25498/94, §§ 94 ‑ 96, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; see also Enea v. Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, §§ 73 and 74, ECHR 2009). In other words, a judicial review of a measure, which had by that time expired or almost expired, was considered to serve no longer any purpose."

This was done pursuant to the Code of Administrative Offences providing for the immediate enforcement of a sentence only if it concerned deprivation of liberty (with another unrelated exception – see paragraph 16 above). Had the sanction been different, the first-instance court ’ s decision would have become enforceable only in the absence of an appeal within the legally envisaged time-limits or once upheld by the appellate court. In the present case, however, the appellate review took place after the detention sentence imposed on the applicant by the first-instance court had been served in full.

The Court has consistently stated in its case-law that it is mindful of significant differences among the Contracting States on the question whether a person convicted at first instance has started serving a prison sentence while an appeal is still pending. However, the Court reiterates that the important guarantees of Article 5 of the Convention are not dependent on national legislation ( see B. v. Austria, 2 8 March 1990, § 39, Series A no. 175, and Solmaz, cited above, § 26 ). Thus, even if the domestic law of a member State provides that a sentence only becomes final on completion of all appeals, pre-trial detention comes to an end for the purposes of the Convention with the finding of guilt and the sentence imposed at first instance (see Solmaz, cited above, § 26)."

Croatia (no. 5384/11, §§ 30 ­ 45, 30 October 2012) the applicant, who had been convicted and sentenced to thirty years ’ imprisonment by a first-instance court, complained of the unlawfulness of several months of his detention after the delivery of the judgment at first instance. His deprivation of liberty during that period was still considered “pre-trial detention” under the domestic legislation. The Court examined his complaint from the standpoint of Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention and found no indication of arbitrariness."

Italy, 6 November 1980, § 100, Series A no. 39; Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium, 24 June 1982, § 35, Series A no. 50; and, for more recent case-law, Del Río Prada v.

In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty in issue (see Murray v. the Netherlands, no. 10511/10, § 77, 10 December 2013, with further references)."

Although the penalty imposed was to expire three days later, the second measure was to last for at least twelve days longer, given the fifteen - day time-limit for lodging appeals.

Where the “lawfulness” of detention is in issue, including the question whether “a procedure prescribed by law” has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof (see, among many other authorities, Erkalo v. the Netherlands, 2 September 1998, § 52, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VI, and Baranowski v.

                "58. In assessing whether detention is lawful, the Court must also ascertain whether the domestic law itself is in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied therein. The “quality of the law” implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application to avoid all risk of arbitrariness. The standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is essential that the domestic law define clearly the conditions for detention (see Del Río Prada, cited above, § 125, with further references)."

                "59. Furthermore, arbitrary detention cannot be compatible with Article 5 § 1, as the notion of “arbitrariness” in this context extends beyond the lack of conformity with national law. As a consequence, a deprivation of liberty that is lawful under domestic law can still be arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, § 77, 9 July 2009)."

The Court has not previously formulated a general definition of what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute “arbitrariness” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1. However, key principles that have been developed on a case-by-case basis demonstrate that the notion of arbitrariness in the context of Article 5 varies to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 68, ECHR 2008, and Plesó v. Hungary, no. 41242/08, § 57, 2 October 2012). One general principle established in the Court ’ s case-law is that detention will be “arbitrary” where, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities or where the domestic authorities neglected to attempt to apply the relevant legislation correctly (see Mooren, cited above, § 78 )."
            ],

Furthermore, the requirement that detention must not be arbitrary implies the need for a relationship of proportionality between the ground of detention relied upon and the detention in question (see James, Wells and Lee, cited above, § 195). The scope of the proportionality test to be applied in a given case varies depending on the type of detention involved. In the context of detention pursuant to Article 5 § 1 (a), the Court has generally been satisfied that the decision to impose a sentence of detention and the length of that sentence are matters for the national authorities rather than for this Court (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, § 103, 16 December 1999, and Saadi, cited above, § 71). At the same time, in assessing whether there were indications of arbitrariness in the applicants ’ preventive detention not constituting a part of the sentence but still falling under Article 5 § 1 (a), the Court has found it necessary to identify the purpose of their detention under Article 5 § 1 (a) and has pursued the proportionality test (see James, Wells and Lee, cited above, § 205).",

Furthermore, the applicable legal provisions appear clear and foreseeable in their application. Thus, the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine explicitly states that the sentencing court must decide which preventive measure should be applied to the convicted person until the judgment becomes final (see paragraph 18 above). It also appears from the domestic legislation that the duration of the preventive measure does not depend on the duration of the prison sentence imposed, and can therefore be longer than that sentence."

However, no such considerations were mentioned in, or can be inferred from, the judgment of the Bila Tserkva Court of 12 July 2010.

Administrative formalities connected with release cannot justify a delay of more than a few hours (see Nikolov v. Bulgaria, no. 38884/97, § 82, 30 January 2003).

In this connection, the Government referred to the case - law of the HSC (see paragraph 17 above). For the Government, the procedure established by Article 349 § 3 of the CCP allowed defendants to validly waive their procedural rights. Moreover, it complied with the requirements for a valid waiver set forth in the Court ’ s case-law, in that it required the domestic courts to verify that defendants understood the implications of accepting the use of that abridged procedure and accepted it voluntarily. Moreover, the waiver under Article 349 § 3 was not absolute in that it did not prevent appeals on procedural grounds and did not extend to the legal classification of the admitted facts. In that sense, the scope of the notion of “circumstances” used in the provision in question was precise and foreseeable. Accordingly, the applicant had not been deprived of the right to appeal against his conviction. His appeal had been dismissed apparently because the domestic courts had considered that, despite his apparent wish to challenge the legal classification of the offence, he “ in fact challenged his admittance [sic] of the facts under Article 349 § 3 procedure”.

He found it established from the case materials that the applicants had truly exhibited “manifest and gross contempt” towards the Tbilisi Court of Appeal by committing those acts “inside the court building, namely in its central entrance hall”. In any event, the aim of Article 208 § 6(1) of the CCP was, in the opinion of Judge Z.M., to protect public order not only inside court - houses but also outside them, in adjacent premises. The President of the Court of Appeal had no other choice but to sanction the applicants under Article 208 § 6(1) of the CCP, since what was at stake in the given situation was “not the judge ’ s own interests but the authority of the court and the proper administration of justice”. In reply to the complaint that the President of the Court of Appeal had made her decision entirely on the basis of one-sided submissions, Judge Z.M. stated that all the evidence – the records of the applicants ’ arrest and the explanatory notes – had been drafted and submitted by the bailiffs for consideration by the President in accordance with a procedure envisaged by law.

As to the domestic legal basis for the applicants ’ deprivation of liberty, the Government referred to section 76(3) § 1 (f) of the Courts Act and Article 208 § 6(1) of the CCP, which entitled a competent judicial authority to punish offenders by the imposition of detention (see paragraphs 2 8 and 30 above).

Thus, since the essence of section 76(3) of the Courts Act was to enable bailiffs to protect the administration of justice, it was only natural for the applicants, who were insulting the Tbilisi Court of Appeal in its yard, to assume that bailiffs of that court could have exercised their relevant duties not only within the court - house but also on its protected territory outside."

The Government then assured the Court that that arrest had not exceeded the maximum permissible limit of three hours, as provided for by Article 247 of the CAO (see paragraph 3 6 above). In support, the Government referred to the fact that three hours and twenty-five minutes had passed between the applicants ’ arrest and the placement of one of them in the remand centre of the Ministry of the Interior, the latter event necessarily occurring after the delivery of the decision of 29 June 2006 (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above); within that time more than twenty-five minutes would have been spent on transporting the applicants from the court - house to the place they were subsequently held in custody."

The applicants complained that the overly extensive interpretation given to this provision by the domestic courts and the respondent Government arbitrarily expanded the territorial application of the bailiffs ’ powers of arrest, which did not meet the requirement of foreseeability and was thus unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention."

On the other hand, if the Code of Administrative Offences were to be considered applicable to their situation, then a clear problem would arise under its Article 246, which excluded court bailiffs from the inclusive list of those State agents who were authorised by law to effect administrative arrests (see paragraph 3 5 above)."

In support of that argument, they referred to the relevant findings of the Constitutional Court of Georgia, as well as to the subsequent amendment of that provision on 29 December 2006, which in the applicants ’ opinion constituted a tacit acknowledgment by the Georgian authorities of the defective nature of the initial version of the provision (see paragraphs 30 and 3 1 above).

                "62. The Court reiterates that any deprivation of liberty must, in addition to falling within one of the exceptions set out in sub ‑ paragraphs (a) ‑ (f) of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, § 170, ECHR 2004 ‑ II ), be “lawful”. Where the “lawfulness” of detention is in issue, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 67, 29 January 2008). This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 63, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV, and Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 116, ECHR 2008 ). “Quality of law” in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see, for instance, Nasrulloyev v. Russia, no. 656/06, § 71, 11 October 2007, and Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, § 76, 9 July 2009). The standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention thus requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, § 52, ECHR 2000 ‑ III )."

                "63. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient. Article 5 § 1 of the Convention requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see Bozano v. France, 18 December 1986, § 54, Series A no. 111). It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 § 1. The notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Saadi, cited above, § 67). While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute “arbitrariness” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, detention will be “arbitrary” where, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith on the part of the authorities (see Giorgi Nikolaishvili v. Georgia, no. 37048/04, § 53, 13 January 2009; Bozano, cited above, § 59; and Saadi, cited above, § 69) or where the domestic authorities have neglected to attempt to apply the relevant legislation correctly (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, and Liu v. Russia, no. 42086/05, § 82, 6 December 2007).",

At the outset, the Court notes that it does not need to answer the question of whether there could have been reasons for the Georgian authorities to take measures against the perceived disturbance of the public order or the need to enable the Tbilisi Court of Appeal to continue its work without being disturbed by the noise made by the applicants demonstrating outside the courthouse. What is at stake in the present case is the lawfulness of the applicants ’ deprivation of liberty. The Court further observes that it is not in dispute between the parties that the applicants ’ arrest and being locked up in the duty room of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal by the bailiffs, as well as their subsequent punishment by detention, as imposed by the President of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, represented a continuous situation of deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. It can be assessed as falling into two periods – before and after the applicants were brought before the judge who sanctioned their detention in her decision of 29 June 2006."

                "65. As regards the first period of the applicants ’ deprivation of liberty, the Court is ready to accept that since they were arrested on the basis of a suspicion that they had committed the offences of breach of public order and contempt of court, that period could fall within the exception authorised by 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention ( compare, for instance, with Makhmudov v. Russia, no. 35082/04, § 80 and 81, 26 July 2007, and Schwabe and M.G., cited above, § 70 ). However, exercising its power to refer to the quality of the domestic law for the purposes of ascertaining the “lawfulness” of a questioned period of detention (see paragraph 6 2 above), the Court observes that the circumstances surrounding the applicants ’ arrest and being locked for some three hours in the duty room of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal can hardly be held compatible with the relevant domestic provisions."

Thus, if the Court is to accept the Government ’ s argument that the applicants were taken into custody on the basis of the Code of Administrative Offences, and that their detention at that time fell within the statutory limit of three hours permitted for such administrative arrest (see paragraph 3 6 above), a clear problem would arise with respect to the powers of arrest of court bailiffs as such. The Court notes that bailiffs were not amongst the exhaustive list of those State agents who were empowered to conduct administrative arrests under that Code (see paragraph 3 5 above)."

On the other hand, as could be seen from the verbatim records of the applicants ’ arrest (see paragraph 12 above), their arrest was linked to section 76(3) § 1 of the Courts Act, notably to its sub ‑ paragraph (f), which entitled bailiffs to arrest individuals suspected of committing the offences of breach of public order and contempt of court. However, that domestic provision, which stated that bailiffs could conduct arrests “for the purpose of handing [offenders] to the police”, did not provide for any statutory time -limit during which an arrested individual could be kept in custody pending his or her appearance before a judicial officer. Consequently, it remains largely unexplained on the basis of which domestic legal provision, the court bailiffs took the liberty of locking the applicants up in the duty room of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal for at least three hours. Indeed, the Court notes that it was only subsequent to the applicants ’ arrest on 29 June 2006 that the Georgian legislator finally fixed, on 29 December 2006, a maximum permissible period for the duration of an arrest of an individual suspected of having committed the relevant offences (see paragraph 3 1 above)."

Another matter for the Court ’ s concern is that it cannot be discerned with a sufficient degree of certainty either from section 76(3) § 1 (f) of the Courts Act, which served as the basis for the applicant ’ s arrest, or from Article 208 § 6(1) of the CCP, which became the basis for the subsequent finding of the applicants ’ guilt, whether it was legally possible to arrest individuals outside court - houses. The wording of these provisions limited the territorial scope of both the court bailiffs ’ powers of arrest and the offences of breach of public order and contempt to the interior of court buildings. That being so, the Court has certain doubts that the applicants could have foreseen at the relevant time and to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances that their street picket in front of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal could entail their arrest and detention under the above-mentioned domestic provisions. It reiterates in this respect that national law must be of sufficient quality and, in particular, must be foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risks of arbitrariness (see M. v. Germany, no. 19359/04, § 104, ECHR 2009)."

Germany, also cited above, § 87). However, the President never discussed the major legal issue of whether the bailiffs had had the power to arrest the applicants outside the court building and whether the applicants ’ behaviour out of doors could legitimately attract liability under the relevant domestic provisions. Her findings were based solely on the explanatory notes provided by the court bailiffs and, similarly to those notes, the findings lacked any detailed explanation and were strikingly succinct, and resulted in the endorsement in her decision of the obviously untrue statement that the applicants had committed the acts “inside the court building, in its central entrance” (see paragraphs 12, 15 and 17 above). It is thus evident that the judge was negligent in reviewing both the factual and the legal basis for the applicants ’ detention ( compare with Hakobyan and Others v. Armenia, no. 34320/04, § 123, 10 April 2012), and exercised her authority in manifest opposition to the elementary procedural guarantees against arbitrariness provided for by the Convention ( compare with Menesheva v.

Several minutes later they were arrested and subsequently punished by being placed in detention for breach of public order and contempt of court. Their prosecution, as conceded by the Government, amounted to an interference with the exercise of the freedom of peaceful assembly. It must therefore be determined whether the interference complained of was “prescribed by law”, prompted by one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 11 § 2 of the Convention, and “necessary in a democratic society”."
            ],
            [
                "86. As regards the requirement of “lawfulness”, the Court reiterates that both section 76(3) § 1 (f) of the Courts Act and Article 208 § 6(1) of the CCP, which legal provisions served as the basis for the applicant ’ s arrest and their punishment by detention, expressly and concomitantly stated that actions allegedly constituting a breach of public order and contempt of court could be prevented by court bailiffs and punished by the President of the relevant court if committed inside court - houses (see also paragraph 6 7 above). As regards the definition of the particular offence of contempt of court, the Court further attaches importance to a finding of the Constitutional Court of Georgia, which characterised it as vague (see paragraph 4 7 above). That being so, the Court, similarly to its finding under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, has very serious doubts that the applicants could reasonably have foreseen that their demonstration outside the building of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, in its yard, could ever have attracted liability under the above-mentioned wording of the domestic provisions (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Altuğ Taner Akçam v. Turkey, no. 27520/07, §§ 92 ‑ 95, 25 October 2011, and also Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, §§ 78-80, ECHR 2000 ‑ II). However, having regard to a more conspicuous problem arising with respect to the necessity of the interference, the Court does not deem it appropriate to limit its finding under Article 11 of the Convention to the lawfulness of the interference only ( compare with Dink v. Turkey, nos. 2668/07, 6102/08, 30079/08, 7072/09 and 7124/09, § 116, 14 September 2010, and Hyde Park and Others v. Moldova (nos. 5 and 6), nos. 6991/08 and 15084/08, § 48, 14 September 2010 )."

                "87. The Court can accept the Government ’ s argument that the interference in question pursued a legitimate aim: the prevention of disorder and the protection of the authority of the judiciary. What is at stake as regards the protection of the authority of the judiciary is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public at large (see, mutatis mutandis, among other authorities, Fey v. Austria, 24 February 1993, § 30, Series A no. 255 ‑ A ). The Court considers that its assessment must likewise relate to the question whether such a measure was necessary in a democratic society. Concurring with the Constitutional Court of Georgia (see paragraph 47 above), the Court reiterates in this regard that the right of peaceful assembly is, like the right to freedom of expression, one of the foundations of any democratic society. Consequently, only truly convincing and most compelling reasons can justify an interference with this right (see Djavit An, cited above, § 56, and Ouranio Toxo and Others v. Greece, no. 74989/01, § 36, ECHR 2005 ‑ X (extracts))."

Notably, the Court observes that the demonstration, in which just five persons participated, was dispersed a few minutes after it had started; during that extremely short period of time the applicants were able to voice only a very few slogans. Those facts already call into question the Government ’ s assertion about the level of disruption of public order (compare with Sergey Kuznetsov v. Russia, no. 10877/04, § 44, 23 October 2008). Nor does the content of those slogans amount, in the eyes of the Court, to contempt of court or to an otherwise wrongful act. Thus, the majority of those slogans represented critical value judgments, in which the applicants, resorting to a certain degree of political exaggeration and harsh words, referred to a matter of public concern in Georgia – the independence of the judiciary; the applicants addressed the Tbilisi Court of Appeal without being violent or rejecting democratic principles in their speech. The Court reiterates in this respect that the judiciary, as with all other public institutions, cannot be immune from criticism, however shocking and unacceptable certain views or words may appear (see Sergey Kuznetsov, cited above, § 45, and Skałka v. Poland, no. 43425/98, § 34, 27 May 2003 )."

                "89. The Court considers that the only offensive phrase voiced by one of the applicants during their short picket was the referral to the Minister of the Interior as “Lavrentiy Beria ’ s bastard”. However, the Court cannot understand how that expression could constitute contempt of court, as it was not addressed to a member of the judiciary (contrast with Skałka, cited above, § 36). In any event, in a democratic society, greater tolerance should be shown to those expressing opinions which are critical of important public figures, even if those opinions are expressed, as in the instant case, inarticulately, intemperately or in a provocative manner (see Hyde Park and Others (nos. 5 and 6), cited above § 43, and Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, §§ 52 and 53, ECHR 1999 ‑ VIII )."

                "90. Furthermore, it is a matter of particular concern for the Court that in her decision of 29 June 2006 the President of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, rather than fulfilling her duty to establish convincing grounds justifying the dispersal of the demonstration and the punishment of the applicants by the imposition of detention, mostly paraphrased the general and abstract terms of the qualification of offences of breach of public order and contempt of court under the domestic law. She did not explain, by reference to the particular circumstances of the incident, how exactly the administration of justice was being obstructed and which specific phrases uttered by the applicants were considered to be severe enough to constitute contempt of court; the only matter she relied on in her decision – the statement that the applicants had held their demonstration “inside the court building, in its central entrance” – was untrue and thus unacceptable for the purpose of justification under the second paragraph of Article 11 (see, among other authorities, Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § 70, ECHR 2006 ‑ II). Consequently, restriction on the applicant ’ s right to peaceful assembly cannot be said to have been based on relevant and sufficient reasons (compare with Sergey Kuznetsov, cited above, § § 40 and 45; and The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, §§ 63 and 64, Series A no. 30 )."

Lastly, the Court is struck by the fact that, given the absence of any violent behaviour by the applicants during the authorised picket, they were nevertheless subjected to the most severe penalty applicable to the offences in question, namely thirty days of deprivation of liberty (compare, for instance, Galstyan, cited above, § 116, in which the Court found that the sanction of deprivation of liberty for three days for participating in an authorised and peaceful street demonstration impaired the very essence of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly). The unreasonableness of the drastic penalty in the present case is further magnified when assessed against the above-mentioned absence of sufficient and relevant reasons in the underlying decision of 29 June 2006."

In particular, the fact that the applicant ’ s detention was ordered by the Tsarevo District Court by reference to a Decree rather than an Act of Parliament does not make it unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. Under Bulgarian law, decrees adopted by the Presidium of the National Assembly under Article 35 § 5 and Article 36 of the 1947 Constitution are valid sources of law which have the same force as Acts of Parliament. This has been confirmed many times by the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph 10 above) and is implicit in the fact that the Constitutional Court accepted to hear a legal challenge to the 1963 Decree much as it would accept to hear a challenge to an Act of Parliament ( see paragraph 13 above ). The term “law” in Article 5 § 1 of the Convention must be understood in its substantive sense, not its formal one. The Court has accepted that detention may be based on a sufficiently established custom (see Drozd and Janousek v. France and Spain, 26 June 1992, § 107, Series A no. 240 ) or on case ‑ law (see Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 55, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VII ). It has adopted the same stance to the term “law” as used in Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention (see Kruslin v. France, 24 April 1990, § 29, Series A no. 176 ‑ A, and The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 47, Series A no. 30 ). It follows that the applicant ’ s detention was provided by Bulgarian law and was imposed in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law ( see, mutatis mutandis, Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § § 46 ‑ 49, 15 November 2007 ). There is no indication that it was otherwise incompatible with Article 5 § 1."

The fact that that work was not remunerated did not in itself cause it to fall outside that definition. In its decision in Twenty ‑ one Detained Persons v. Germany ( nos. 3134/67, 3172/67, 3188 ‑ 3206/67, Commission decision of 6 April 1968, Collection 27, pp. 97 ‑ 116), the former Commission declared a complaint in that respect inadmissible, noting, inter alia, that Article 4 does not contain any provision concerning the remuneration of prisoners for their work, and observing that it had consistently rejected applications by prisoners claiming higher remuneration for their work. The Court is mindful that there have been subsequent developments in attitudes to that issue, reflected in particular in the 1987 and 2006 European Prison Rules, which call for the equitable remuneration of the work of prisoners – with the 2006 Rules adding “in all instances” – (see paragraphs 18 and 21 above). Those Rules, and the modification in their wording, reflect an evolving trend. However, the Court does not consider that as matters stood at the time when the applicant was ordered to carry out the work at issue in the present case – approximately two years before the adoption of the 2006 Rules – it could be maintained that there existed an unconditional obligation under Article 4 of the Convention to remunerate the work of all detainees in all circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, Stummer, cited above, § 132 ). The Court additionally notes that the applicant ’ s detention was effected under special rules designed to deal in a speedy way with minor public order offences, and that the period during which the applicant was detained and required to work without remuneration could not by law exceed, and did not in fact exceed, fifteen days (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above).

In particular, the accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the opportunity to put all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings. The facilities available to everyone charged with a criminal offence should include the opportunity to acquaint himself with the material on which the charges are based (see, for instance, Kornev and Karpenko, cited above, § 66 )."

It concerned the theft of a small number of labels which belonged to the applicant ’ s employer. The charges against the applicant were based on the report of a security officer and on the testimony of the applicant ’ s colleagues. The applicant did not deny that she had intended to take the labels out of her place of work."

Moreover, she requested free legal assistance and the domestic court granted it and appointed a lawyer to defend her. However, she was not informed about that decision before the hearing of 6 November 2000 and, thus, could not use the lawyer ’ s assistance to prepare her defence."
