                "35. The applicant took the view that the interference with the exercise of his freedom to manifest his religion did not correspond to any of the aims listed in Article 9 § 2. The Government maintained, for their part, that the impugned measure pursued two legitimate aims: to protect the rights and freedoms of others; and to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. The Court notes that the second paragraph of Article 9 does not refer expressly to the second of those aims. As regards the first of the aims invoked – to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of others – the Government referred to the principle of secularism and the need to promote tolerance in a post-conflict society. The Court has already held that secularism is a belief protected by Article 9 of the Convention (see Lautsi and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 30814/06, § 58, ECHR 2011) and that an aim to uphold secular and democratic values can be linked to the legitimate aim of the “protection of the rights and freedoms of others” within the meaning of Article 9 § 2 (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 99, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI, and Ahmet Arslan and Others v. Turkey, no. 41135/98, § 43, 23 February 2010). There is no reason to decide otherwise in the present case.",

Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 3727/08, § 20, 7 February 2012), attacked the United States Embassy in Sarajevo. One police officer was severely wounded in the attack. In April 2012 Mr Jašarević and two other members of the group were indicted in relation to that event. Mr Jašarević was eventually convicted of terrorism and sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment. The other two defendants were acquitted.

                "Salafi communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, like the one in Gornja Maoča (in which the accused lived at the time of the attack), are often isolated and inaccessible. The choice of remote and isolated locations to establish settlements is often informed by the belief that true believers who live in a non-believer (or secular) country need to resort to hijrah – emigration or withdrawal from the surrounding (non-believers’) world, following the example set by the Prophet Muhammad and his followers, who moved from Mecca to Medina in 622 to establish the first Muslim community.",
                "Despite mutual differences, most of the Bosnian Salafi groups share some common traits that are not inherent in Islamic organisations (or religious sects) only. In practice, they confirm the tendencies of certain traditional religious communities to isolate from other believers and define their holy community through their disciplined opposition to both non-believers and half-hearted believers. This pattern is inherent in fundamentalist movements and sects within almost all religious traditions. Such movements as a rule have similar characteristics despite the differences in theological doctrines, size and social composition, the scope of their influence or their tendency towards violence. Yet these fundamentalist and puritan groups mostly do not encourage or approve violence, whether it is aimed against members of the same group or against the outer world.",

Also, the accused Jašarević and Fojnica were wearing skullcaps, which the Court could correlate with clothing details indicating their religious affiliation. Pursuant to Article 256 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all those present in the courtroom must stand up upon the call from a court officer. The President of the Trial Chamber asked the accused to explain both their refusal to stand up and the reasons why they had entered the courtroom wearing skullcaps. The accused stated that they only respected Allah’s judgment and that they did not want to take part in rituals acknowledging man-made judgment. The Court thereupon warned the accused that standing up was a statutory obligation of the accused and that under Article 242 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, disruptive conduct constituted contempt of court, which the Court would punish by removing them from the courtroom.",

The President therefore asked the accused to respond whether it was their definite decision to act in the same way until the completion of the trial. The accused confirmed that, until the completion of the trial, they had no intention of showing any respect, by standing up, for the Court, which they did not recognise. The Court found that to continue to bring the accused to scheduled hearings would unnecessarily expose the Court to significant expense. Therefore, the Court decided to remove the accused from the trial until its completion, with a warning that they would be notified of any scheduled hearing, and that, prior to it, they could notify the Court if they changed their mind, in which case the Court would allow them to come to the hearing. The accused Fojnica and Ahmetspahić then changed their mind and regularly appeared before the Court, while the accused Jašarević did so only at the following hearing. The Court delivered to the accused the audio-recordings and the transcripts from the hearings they had not attended in order to allow them to agree with their defence attorneys on their defence strategy .”"

In the context of that trial, the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the State Court”) summoned the applicant, who belonged to the same religious community, to appear as a witness on 10 September 2012. He appeared, as summoned, but refused to remove his skullcap, notwithstanding an order from the president of the trial chamber to do so. He was then expelled from the courtroom, convicted of contempt of court and sentenced to a fine of 10,000 convertible marks (BAM) [1] under Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:",
                "“The Court has examined the situation encountered in the courtroom with the utmost care. The Court is aware that the witness belongs to a religious community, organised under special rules in the village of Maoča, of which the accused are also members. In view of that, the Court has acquainted the witness with the provisions of Rule 20 of the House Rules of the Judicial Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the obligations of the parties in the judicial institutions, which ban visitors from entering these buildings in clothing that is not in accordance with the generally accepted dress codes within the professional environment of the judicial institutions. In addition, the Court has pointed out to the witness that, in public institutions, it is not acceptable to display religious affiliation through clothing or religious symbols, and that the Court is obliged to support and promote values that bring people closer, not those that separate them. The Court has particularly emphasised that the rights of the individual are not absolute and must not jeopardise common values.",
                "The witness’s attention has especially been drawn to the fact that people of various religious beliefs, belonging to different religious groups, appear before the court and that it is necessary to have confidence in the court. Thus, the court is not a place where religious beliefs can be expressed in a way that discredits certain common rules and principles in a multicultural society. That is why the law obliges everyone who appears before the Court to respect the Court and its rules.",
                "The Court finds the witness’s refusal to accept the rules of court and to show respect to the Court by accepting its warnings, to be a flagrant breach of order in the courtroom. The Court has found that this behaviour is connected to a number of other identical cases before it, in which the members of the same religious group behaved in the same manner, publicly indicating that they did not recognise this Court. The frequency of such disrespectful behaviour and contempt of court is producing dangerous criminogenic effects and undoubtedly presents a specific threat to society. It is not necessary to particularly substantiate how this behaviour impairs the Court’s reputation and confidence in the Court. A legitimate conclusion may be that it is essentially directed against the State and basic social values. Therefore, a severe and uncompromising reaction on the part of the State, taking all existing repressive measures, is crucial for dealing with such behaviour. Restraint on the part of the State in cases of this or other types of extremism can have serious consequences for the reputation of the judiciary and the stability of society in Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
                "Bearing in mind the frequency, seriousness and gravity of this type of breach of order in the courtroom and its damaging consequences, the Court has decided to punish the witness by imposing the maximum fine of BAM 10,000. Such a severe penalty should be a message to all the parties in the courtroom that contempt of court is unacceptable. The Court must be respected and the level of respect for the Court is the same as for the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina.”"
            ],
            [
                "8. On 11 October 2012 an appeals chamber of the same court reduced the fine to BAM 3,000 and upheld the rest of the first-instance decision. It held that the requirement to remove any and all headgear on the premises of public institutions was one of the basic requirements of life in society. It further held that in a secular State such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, any manifestation of religion in a courtroom was forbidden. The relevant part of that decision reads:",
                "“The Chamber observes that it is obvious and well known that skullcaps, hats and other headgear should be removed when entering any premises, and notably the premises of State and other public institutions, as there is no longer a need to wear them and removing a skullcap or a hat is an expression of respect for this institution and its function. The duty to remove headgear exists not only in this court but also in other courts and institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as in other States. Such rules and duties apply to all persons without exception, regardless of religious, sexual, national or other affiliation.",
                "Indeed, this is a duty of all those who visit the State Court in whatever capacity, as explained in more detail in Rule 20 of the House Rules of the Judicial Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina: ‘Visitors must respect the dress code applicable to judicial institutions. Visitors shall not wear miniskirts, shorts, t-shirts with thin straps, open heel shoes and other garments that do not correspond to the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’.",
                "It would appear from the case file that the judge in charge of this specific case first directed the witness to remove his skullcap in the courtroom, and then gave him an additional ten minutes to think about it as well as about the consequences of rejecting that order. As the witness had nevertheless failed to remove his skullcap, showing thereby wilful disrespect for the authority of the court, the President of the Trial Chamber fined him in accordance with Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",
                "It follows from the aforementioned that the judge in charge did not invent the duty of removing the skullcap when addressing the court, as claimed in the appeal. This is indeed a matter of a generally accepted standard of behaviour in the courtroom which applies not only to this Court but also to other courts; furthermore, it has always been applied. This duty stems from Rule 20 of the House Rules of the Judicial Institutions cited above. Therefore, the allegations made by the lawyer Mulahalilović in the appeal are not only unjustified but totally inappropriate.",
                "The allegation in the appeal that the witness was punished simply because he was a believer who was practising his religion, and that he had thereby been discriminated against, is also unsubstantiated. The duty of removing headgear and behaving decently applies without exception to anyone visiting the court premises. All persons visiting the Court, regardless of their religion, nationality, sex or other status, have the same rights and obligations and are obliged, among other things, to remove their skullcaps, hats and other headgear. This was explained to the witness. Any behaviour to the contrary has always been interpreted and is still interpreted as disrespectful towards the court, and the appellant is aware of that. Bosnia and Herzegovina, as mentioned in the impugned decision, is a secular State in which religion is separate from public life. The Chamber therefore holds that the premises of the Court cannot be a place for the manifestation of any religion.",
                "It clearly follows from the aforementioned that the witness Husmet Hamidović was not deprived of his right to freedom of religion and freedom to manifest religion at his home or any other place dedicated for that purpose, but not in the courtroom. Therefore, the allegations by the lawyer Mulahalilović of a violation of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, and of discrimination on religious grounds, are unsubstantiated.",
                "Having found that the witness’s punishment was justified and that his appeal was ill-founded in that part, the Appeals Chamber then examined the amount of the fine and decided that it was excessive.",
                "As noted in the appeal, BAM 10,000 is the maximum fine for contempt of court. The maximum fine should be imposed in the most serious cases.",
                "Turning to the relevant criteria, the nature and the seriousness of the conduct must certainly be taken into consideration. However, the appellant is wrong in claiming that his means should have also been taken into account, as the fine for contempt of court is not a criminal sanction, but is of a disciplinary nature.",
                "While the witness showed a high level of determination in disrespecting the court (he again failed to remove his skullcap after a pause of ten minutes given to him to reflect) and this fact definitely affected the amount of the fine, the act itself (failure to remove headgear) is not the most serious case of contempt of court which would justify the maximum fine. Since the witness did not use offensive language, there was no need to impose the maximum fine. This is notwithstanding the fact that members of the same religious group have lately shown a pattern of disrespectful behaviour. While it is true that the general prevention is one of the aims of sanctions, including disciplinary ones, disciplinary sanctions are primarily directed at individuals. Everyone should therefore be held responsible and adequately punished for his/her conduct only, and not for that of other members of any group. This follows from Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",
                "In the circumstances of this case, and having regard to the nature and the intensity of contempt of court committed by this witness, the appeals chamber finds that a fine in the amount of BAM 3,000 is appropriate. The appeal by the lawyer Mulahalilović is therefore partially accepted and the impugned decision amended.”"

At the same time, it found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention because of the automatic way in which fines were converted into imprisonment and ordered that Article 47 of the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina be amended. However, it decided not to quash the decision converting the fine into imprisonment in this case, relying on the principle of legal certainty.",
                "The relevant part of the majority decision reads as follows:",
                "“40. The Constitutional Court notes that the present case concerns a specific situation where the universally accepted standard of conduct in a judicial institution intertwines with the right of the appellant to manifest in a courtroom, contrary to that standard, affiliation with his religious community. The appellant claims that the State Court did not have a basis in law for imposing a fine for his failure to comply with a court order, as the Code of Criminal Procedure does not contain a provision prescribing any such measure, for which reason his right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion was violated.",
                "41. Starting from the main objection raised by the appellant, that the limitation in the case at hand was not prescribed by law, the Constitutional Court notes that the European Court ( The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom ( no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 49, Series A no. 30) has held that two requirements flow from the expression ‘prescribed by law’ in Article 9 of the European Convention. ‘Firstly, the law must be adequately accessible: the citizen must be able to have an indication that is adequate in the circumstances of the legal rules applicable to a given case. Secondly, a norm cannot be regarded as a ‘law’ unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able - if need be with appropriate advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail.’ In addition, the wording of many statutes is not absolutely precise. The need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see Kokkinakis, cited above).",
                "42. Accordingly, as concerns the issue of whether the State Court, in adopting the challenged ruling, acted in accordance with the law, the Constitutional Court observes that the provision of Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the judge or the presiding judge may order that a party to the proceedings who disrupts order in a courtroom or disobeys court orders be removed from the courtroom and be fined in an amount of up to BAM 10,000. The Constitutional Court also observes that the cited provision, on which the State Court relied, does not prescribe a list of all types of conduct which may be regarded as disruption of order in a courtroom, but rather each court, in the circumstances of a given case, decides whether some type of conduct may be considered disruptive or not, which falls within the scope of that court’s margin of discretion (see the Constitutional Court decision no. AP 2486/11 of 17 July 2014, § 33). This is a universally accepted standard of conduct of the courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is in accordance with the position of the European Court, referred to in the Kokkinakis judgment, that the interpretation and application of such enactments that are couched in vague terms depend on practice.",
                "43. The Constitutional Court notes that the State Court relied also on Rule 20 of the House Rules, providing that ‘visitors must respect the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’, as an internal act of the State Court and other judicial institutions. The Constitutional Court observes likewise that the mentioned provision does not specify what that dress code is. However, the State Court in the case at hand kept in mind that the universally accepted standard of conduct in a civilised society required that upon entering the premises of a public institution one should remove one’s headgear out of respect for that institution and its function. Likewise, the Constitutional Court is aware that the said House Rules were not published, but that is not a problem since the present case concerns a universally accepted and usual standard of conduct in a judicial institution in a civilised and democratic society that Bosnia and Herzegovina aspires to become. The Constitutional Court also holds that the standard in issue could and should have been known to the appellant. In addition, the Constitutional Court observes that the State Court clearly and unequivocally warned the appellant of that universally accepted standard of conduct, which is indeed mandatory for all visitors of judicial institutions, irrespective of their religion, sex, national origin or other status.",
                "44. Moreover, the State Court clearly warned the appellant of the consequences of such conduct and, although it was not required to do so, accorded him an additional time to reconsider his position. This is clearly in accordance with the stance taken by the European Court in relation to the notion ‘prescribed by law’ ( The Sunday Times, cited above). Indeed, the State Court clearly and unequivocally informed the appellant of the applicable rules in the judicial institutions and of the consequences of disobeying the rules. Moreover, at his own request, the appellant was granted additional time to think about all this. The Constitutional Court especially emphasises the fact that the limitation in question applied only while the appellant was in the courtroom, that is, during his testimony before the State Court. The Constitutional Court holds that the State Court did not thereby place an excessive burden on the appellant, given that it simply requested that the appellant adjust his conduct to the House Rules, which applied to all visitors, and only in the courtroom. Bearing in mind all the aforementioned, the Constitutional Court holds, in the circumstances of this particular case, that the State Court, using the margin of discretion referred to in Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, acted in accordance with the law, and that, contrary to the appellant’s opinion, the interference, which was of a limited nature, was lawful.",
                "45. As to the question whether the interference in the present case had a legitimate aim, the Constitutional Court notes that the State Court simply relied on a universally accepted standard of conduct in a judicial institution, which requires all the visitors of judicial institutions to respect ‘the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’. That court further relied on the inadmissibility of the manifestation in public institutions of religious affiliation and religious symbols which were contrary to the usual standards of conduct, and in so doing it took into account its obligation to support the values that bring people closer and not those that separate them. The Constitutional Court notes that the State Court underlined in that regard that Bosnia and Herzegovina was a secular State where religion was separated from public life and that therefore no one could manifest his/her religion or religious affiliation in a courtroom. Considering the position of the European Court that in democratic societies in which several religions coexist (as is the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina) it may be necessary to place restrictions on the freedom of religion ( Kokkinakis, cited above), in the context of the obligation of an independent judicial institution to support the values that bring people closer, and not those that separate them, the Constitutional Court holds that the restriction in the present case, which was of a temporary nature, aspired to achieve legitimate aims. Finally, the Constitutional Court reiterates that Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is primarily designed to allow the State Court unhindered and effective conduct of proceedings. A judge or the president of a chamber is thereby given the possibility of imposing a fine for any inappropriate behaviour which is directed at disrupting order in a courtroom or at damaging the reputation of the State Court. In the present case, the State Court considered the repeated refusal of the appellant to comply with an order of the court to be damaging to the reputation and the dignity of a judicial institution. Therefore, the Constitutional Court finds that the restriction in issue, which was of a limited nature, was in accordance with the legitimate aim of maintaining the dignity of a judicial institution for the purposes of Article 9 of the European Convention.",
                "46. Finally, as to the question whether the decision was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve one of the legitimate aims under Article 9 of the European Convention, the Constitutional Court reiterates that, according to the settled case-law of the European Court, the Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the existence and extent of the need for interference, but this margin is subject to European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts ( Dahlab, cited above). Furthermore, under the well-established case-law of the European Court, the Court is called upon to establish whether the measures undertaken at the national level were justified in principle – that is, whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify them were ‘relevant and sufficient’ and whether the measures were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ( The Sunday Times, cited above, § 50 [2] ).",
                "47. The Constitutional Court notes that the appellant was fined for contempt of court; that is, for his failure to respect an order of the State Court to remove his skullcap in the courtroom. The Constitutional Court further notes that the first-instance decision imposed a fine in the amount of BAM 10,000, but that the second-instance decision reduced the fine to BAM 3,000. The Appeals Chamber held that the fine set in the first-instance decision was excessive, and taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, it concluded that a fine in the amount of BAM 3,000 was appropriate. The Constitutional Court observes that the State Court acted in this case in accordance with its margin of discretion, accorded by Article 242 of the Code of Criminal Procedure enabling the courts to fine participants in proceedings who refuse to obey court orders, with a view to conducting proceedings efficiently and maintaining the authority and dignity of courts. The Constitutional Court took into account the fact that owing to his failure to pay the fine, the appellant’s fine was converted to a prison sentence pursuant to Article 47 of the Criminal Code. However, the Constitutional Court will examine that factor in the following paragraphs of this decision concerning the right to a fair trial. Therefore, in view of the above and the circumstances of this particular case, the Constitutional Court holds that the impugned restriction did not constitute an excessive burden for the appellant, that the measure undertaken by the State Court pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of Article 9 of the European Convention, and that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the restriction and the legitimate aim pursued.",
                "48. Accordingly, the Constitutional Court concludes that the impugned decision did not breach the appellant’s right to manifest his religion under Article II § 3 (g) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Article 9 of the European Convention.”"

In particular, given that the applicant had appeared as summoned and had stood up while addressing the court, they considered that his conduct had not been disrespectful. They further maintained that, unlike public officials, private citizens, such as the applicant, did not owe a duty of neutrality. Therefore, the applicant’s punishment for refusing to remove a religious symbol in a courtroom constituted, in their opinion, disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of religion.",

                "14. In 2015 the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the HJPC”) made an analysis of the legal framework relating to the wearing of religious symbols in judicial institutions [4]. As stated in that analysis, judges, prosecutors and court officers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are forbidden to wear such symbols in the course of their duties. The HJPC relied on a number of domestic provisions, notably section 13 of the Courts Act 2005 of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina [5] and section 14 of the Courts Act 2012 of the Republika Srpska [6]. While that prohibition does not apply to other persons, such as parties and witnesses, they may be ordered to remove a religious symbol in a courtroom if this is considered justified by the judge in a given case, taking into consideration the right to freedom of religion and equal access to justice, the organisation of the proceedings and the need to maintain the authority of the judiciary. On 21 October 2015 the HJPC sent a circular to all courts and prosecutors in the country reminding them of those rules. The circular, notably as regards the wearing of religious symbols by judicial officials, was condemned by the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the House of Representatives of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, two cantonal assemblies, the Agency for Gender Equality, the Women’s Network (an informal group working on women’s rights) and others. The HJPC at that point requested all courts and prosecutors in the country to inform it whether they had come across any cases of judges, prosecutors or court officers wearing religious symbols in the course of their duties. It would appear from the replies that one judge and approximately ten court officers wore headscarves. On 10 February 2016 the HJPC reasserted its position that judges, prosecutors and court officers were forbidden to wear religious symbols at work. It reminded all court presidents and chief prosecutors of their duty to enforce that rule.",

The wearing of religious symbols by private citizens in courtrooms is not regulated, as such, by the laws of any of the States covered. Consequently, none of them prohibits wearing such symbols on the sole ground that they are religious. Nevertheless, it should be noted that a minority of Contracting States apply a more or less loosely defined dress code to private citizens on court premises, and in four States this means keeping one’s head uncovered while in the courtroom (Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Slovakia). It would appear that this rule has never been applied to religious symbols in Italy, Portugal and Slovakia. As concerns Belgium, a recent study by the Human Rights Centre of Ghent University shows that only around 30% of Belgian judges have ever made use of this provision. Of this minority of judges, around 80% explained that they had only used this provision with regard to non-religious headgear, such as baseball caps [10]."

In his view, that limitation had not been lawful, as no statutory provision expressly prohibited the wearing of the skullcap in the courtroom. The House Rules on which the domestic decisions had relied (see paragraph 19 above) could not introduce into the legal system bans that had not been prescribed in statute.

As regards the first of the aims invoked – to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of others – the Government referred to the principle of secularism and the need to promote tolerance in a post-conflict society. The Court has already held that secularism is a belief protected by Article 9 of the Convention (see Lautsi and Others v.

This freedom is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see, among other authorities, Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 31, Series A no. 260-A; Buscarini and Others v. San Marino [GC], no. 24645/94, § 34, ECHR 1999-I; and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 104).",
                "125. While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies freedom to manifest one’s religion, alone and in private, or in community with others, in public and within the circle of those whose faith one shares. Article 9 lists the various forms which the manifestation of one’s religion or beliefs may take, namely worship, teaching, practice and observance (see, mutatis mutandis, Cha’are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France [GC], no. 27417/95, § 73, ECHR 2000-VII, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 105).",
                "Article 9 does not, however, protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief and does not always guarantee the right to behave in the public sphere in a manner which is dictated by one’s religion or beliefs (see, for example, Arrowsmith v. the United Kingdom, no. 7050/75, Commission’s report of 12 October 1978, DR 19, p. 5; Kalaç v. Turkey, 1 July 1997, § 27, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV; and Leyla Şahin, cited above, §§ 105 and 121).",
                "126. In democratic societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place limitations on freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone’s beliefs are respected (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 33). This follows both from paragraph 2 of Article 9 and from the State’s positive obligations under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined therein (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 106).",
                "127. The Court has frequently emphasised the State’s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and has stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. As indicated previously, it also considers that the State’s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State’s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Manoussakis and Others v. Greece, 26 September 1996, § 47, Reports 1996-IV; Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 78, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI; and Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, § 91, ECHR 2003 ‑ II), and that this duty requires the State to ensure mutual tolerance between opposing groups (see, among other authorities, Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 107). Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see Serif v. Greece, no. 38178/97, § 53, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX; see also Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 107).",
                "128. Pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a ‘democratic society’. Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair treatment of people from minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see, mutatis mutandis, Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, § 63, Series A no. 44, and Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 112, ECHR 1999-III). Pluralism and democracy must also be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise necessarily entailing various concessions on the part of individuals or groups of individuals which are justified in order to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (see, mutatis mutandis, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 45, Reports 1998-I, and Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 99). Where these ‘rights and freedoms of others’ are themselves among those guaranteed by the Convention or the Protocols thereto, it must be accepted that the need to protect them may lead States to restrict other rights or freedoms likewise set forth in the Convention. It is precisely this constant search for a balance between the fundamental rights of each individual which constitutes the foundation of a ‘democratic society’ (see Chassagnou and Others, cited above, § 113; see also Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 108).",
                "129. It is also important to emphasise the fundamentally subsidiary role of the Convention mechanism. The national authorities have direct democratic legitimation and are, as the Court has held on many occasions, in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. In matters of general policy, on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely, the role of the domestic policy-maker should be given special weight (see, for example, Maurice v. France [GC], no. 11810/03, § 117, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX). This is the case, in particular, where questions concerning the relationship between State and religions are at stake (see, mutatis mutandis, Cha’are Shalom Ve Tsedek, cited above, § 84, and Wingrove v. the United Kingdom, 25 November 1996, § 58, Reports 1996-V; see also Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 109). As regards Article 9 of the Convention, the State should thus, in principle, be afforded a wide margin of appreciation in deciding whether and to what extent a limitation of the right to manifest one’s religion or beliefs is ‘necessary’. That being said, in delimiting the extent of the margin of appreciation in a given case, the Court must also have regard to what is at stake therein (see, among other authorities, Manoussakis and Others, cited above, § 44, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 110). It may also, if appropriate, have regard to any consensus and common values emerging from the practices of the States Parties to the Convention (see, for example, Bayatyan v. Armenia [GC], no. 23459/03, § 122, ECHR 2011).",
                "130. In the judgment in Leyla Şahin (cited above), the Court pointed out that this would notably be the case when it came to regulating the wearing of religious symbols in educational institutions, especially in view of the diversity of the approaches taken by national authorities on the issue. Referring to the judgment in Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria (20 September 1994, § 50, Series A no. 295-A) and the decision in Dahlab v. Switzerland ((dec.), no. 42393/98, ECHR 2001-V), it added that it was thus not possible to discern throughout Europe a uniform conception of the significance of religion in society and that the meaning or impact of the public expression of a religious belief would differ according to time and context. It observed that the rules in this sphere would consequently vary from one country to another according to national traditions and the requirements imposed by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others and to maintain public order. It concluded from this that the choice of the extent and form of such rules must inevitably be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it would depend on the specific domestic context (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 109).",

The Court notes that in the present case the applicant had no choice but to appear before the domestic court: in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a witness who fails to appear risks being fined or arrested (see paragraph 15 above). It further observes that the applicant stood up when addressing the court, as required under domestic law (see paragraph 18 above). The presiding judge informed the applicant that he was also required to remove his skullcap, pursuant to the House Rules (see paragraph 19 above). He explained that the wearing of the skullcap was contrary to the dress code applicable to judicial institutions and that no religious symbols or clothing were permitted in court. The applicant was then accorded some additional time for reflection, but he eventually refused to remove his skullcap, claiming that it was his religious duty to wear a skullcap at all times. The presiding judge fined him for contempt of court. The applicant failed to pay, so the fine was converted into thirty days of imprisonment (see paragraph 9 above)."

The national authorities have direct democratic legitimation and are, as the Court has held on many occasions, in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions.

Russia (dec.), no. 47936/99, 8 February 2001, concerning the dismissal of a judge because she had, among other things, proselytised and prayed during court hearings; Dahlab, cited above, concerning the prohibition on a primary-school teacher wearing a headscarf while teaching; Kurtulmuş v.

                "41. It is true that Article 9 of the Convention does not protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief and does not always guarantee the right to behave in the public sphere in a manner which is dictated by one’s religion or beliefs (see S.A.S. v. France, cited above, § 125, and the authorities cited therein; see also, mutatis mutandis, Enver Aydemir v. Turkey, no. 26012/11, §§ 68-84, 7 June 2016, in which the Court held that the applicant’s refusal, because of his idealistic and political views linked to the Koran and Sharia, to perform military service for the secular Republic of Turkey was not such as to entail the applicability of Article 9). Indeed, there may be cases when it is justified to order a witness to remove a religious symbol (see paragraph 22 above). However, the Court would emphasise that the authorities must not neglect the specific features of different religions. Freedom to manifest one’s religion is a fundamental right: not only because a healthy democratic society needs to tolerate and sustain pluralism and diversity, but also because of the importance to an individual who has made religion a central tenet of his or her life of being able to communicate that belief to others (see Eweida and Others, cited above, § 94). The Court sees no reason to doubt that the applicant’s act was inspired by his sincere religious belief that he must wear a skullcap at all times, without any hidden agenda to make a mockery of the trial, incite others to reject secular and democratic values or cause a disturbance (see, in this regard, Eweida and Others, cited above, § 81). Pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a “democratic society”. Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail. The role of the authorities is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see S.A.S. v. France, cited above, § 127-28)."

Examining further, the Court turns to the applicant’s twofold argument that at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had been prevented from practicing her religion, firstly, because of restrictive regime therein, and, secondly, because of the doctors’ unsympathetic views towards her beliefs. The Court notes that, after the applicant was placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she was forcibly administered drugs, physically restrained, and various restrictive treatment regimes were applied to her during the fifty ‑ two days of her stay at that institution (see paragraphs 12 and 14-18 above; on the issue of the consent to treatment, or lack of it in the applicant’s case, also see paragraphs 38 and 51 above; also see point 101 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The Government have not suggested that the applicant could have left the hospital to practise her religion with the circle of people with whom she shared it, even though she had clearly indicated to the psychiatrists that attending the Ojas Meditation Center “brought her peace” (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 57 above; also see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31 and Sinan Işık, cited above, § 38). In fact, the Vilnius Regional Court, which also relied on the CPT standards, had clearly ruled out any possibility for the applicant to leave the hospital for 52 days of her stay therein (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). This view also appears to be corroborated by the CPT, which, having reviewed the situation at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital in general, noted that although only few patients therein were formally considered as involuntary, in reality even “voluntary” patients were not free to leave (see point 100 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). It is also plain from the applicant’s statements in her open letter (see paragraph 22 above) and in those made to the domestic court (see paragraph 43 above), to this Court (see paragraph 109 above), as well as from her medical records and other documents (see paragraphs 15, 17, 37, 42 and 50 above), that in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had to submit and subordinate her wishes to unyielding authority of the psychiatrists who were trying to “correct” the applicant so that she abandoned her “fictitious” religion, and whom she felt constrained to obey, even on pain of receiving a diagnosis which would make her unemployable (on the issue of undue influence and freedom of religion see Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 38 and 45, 51-53, Reports 1998 ‑ I; also see the extracts from the Lithuanian Constitutional Court’s ruling in paragraph 65 above). The applicant therefore has demonstrated that pressure was exerted on her to change her religious beliefs and prevent her from manifesting them (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan, cited above, §§ 36 and 112)."

                "124. Furthermore, and even though the Government argued that the medical treatment which the applicant received at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital was not inappropriate under domestic standards (see paragraphs 51 and 116 above), the Court does not find the Government’s arguments to be decisive. While it is for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used, if necessary by force, to preserve the physical and mental health of patients who are entirely incapable of deciding for themselves, the Court must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, § 82). In this case the psychiatrists who attended to the applicant admitted themselves that the applicant’s life “had not been in danger” for all fifty-two days of her stay at the Vilnius Psychiatric hospital. This view was also confirmed by the court-appointed experts (see paragraph 31 above)."

                "125. The Court lastly turns to the Government’s argument about the need for a public discussion in Lithuania about new religions after the collapse of the Soviet Union (see paragraph 91 above). Be that as it may, it recalls having already had an occasion to examine a case concerning the applicant associations’, who were religious associations or meditation associations belonging to the Osho movement, complaint that the information campaign by the respondent Government had aimed to denigrate the Osho movement’s teachings (see Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany, no. 58911/00, §§ 70 and 71, 6 November 2008). The Court does not fail to observe that in that case it acknowledged that the applicant associations retained their freedom of religion, both as regards their freedom of conscience and the freedom to manifest their beliefs through worship and practice. Even so, given that the terms used to describe the applicant associations’ movement, such as “sects”, “psycho-sects”, “cults” or similar, may have had negative consequences for them, in that case the Court thus proceeded its analysis on the premise that such labelling constituted an interference with the applicant associations’ right to manifest their religion or belief, as guaranteed by Article 9 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 83 and 84). The Court then ultimately accepted, with certain provisos, that the German Government’s public campaign in no way amounted to a prohibition of the applicant associations’ freedom to manifest their religion or belief (ibid., §§ 100 and 101). That being so, the Court finds that the circumstances examined in the instant case, which concerns the applicant who was an individual with a history of mental troubles, and in a particularly vulnerable situation under effective control of the psychiatrists who worked on her with the view that she became critical towards her religion, were therefore more grim than those examined in Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others where the applicants were a group of religious associations or meditation associations, and thus all the more so amounted to an interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 9 of the Convention."

On 14 August 2003 on the internet site of the Ojas Meditation Center the applicant published a five-page open letter to the journalists at Srovės, signing it with her real name and surname. She expressed regret that the broadcast had not been an objective portrayal of her story. She stated that “by using me, you have maybe created an interesting story, but it is very one-sided. Maybe by unraveling ( narpliodamos ) the story through my mother you also wanted to protect me and sought to help me, but in reality your broadcast has caused me to feel much distrust and a lot of pain”. The applicant then mentioned that she had previously been admitted to psychiatric institutions in 1992 and 2002, emphasising that those two periods had been unrelated to meditation. She also wrote that she had only started attending the Ojas Meditation Centre in February 2003 and that her emotional breakdown in May 2003 had had no connection to those visits. For the applicant, the Srovės journalists had therefore given an unfair account of her story, and had shown bias by implying that her mental health issues had been caused by meditating at the Ojas Centre. The applicant also stated that in 2002 she had consulted several psychotherapists ( psichoterapeutai ), who had helped her realise that her psychological problems had roots in her childhood, when she had been controlled by and had lived in fear of emotional and physical violence from her mother. Even at the time of writing there had been resistance and mockery from her family when the applicant had shared her new interests, such as yoga or meditation.

That had led to the psychiatric treatment she had received being mainly directed at how to cure her from practising meditation ( pagydyti nuo meditacijos ) in a hostile environment that had damaged her psychologically and emotionally. In particular, the psychiatrists at the hospital had interrogated her ( buvau kamantinėjama ) about the Ojas Meditation Centre and its practices, forced her to promise not to meditate, alleged that sex orgies had taken place there, that meditation was harmful for her mental health, that she should follow the Catholic religion which is traditional in Lithuania and that meditation was not compatible with her “social status”. During one visit ( vizitacija ), a doctor had called her “the one from the Ojas Centre”, rather than using her name. The applicant also wrote that when she had spoken about meditation at the Ojas Meditation Centre doctor D.Š. had simply made fun of it, had said that that was not meditation, and that the applicant knew nothing about what meditation actually was. The applicant had not been able to resist the psychiatrists at the hospital because refusing to talk to them or disagreeing with their statements about the Ojas Meditation Centre or their instructions to stop meditating had been treated as signs of mental illness. For that reason, the amount of medication at the hospital had not been reduced for a long time, strong drugs had been injected into her, and her release from hospital had been postponed.

On the basis of the forensic expert report and other material, the Vilnius Regional Court firstly observed that the applicant had not actually denied that she might have required medical assistance on 7 May 2003 because of her state of mind. However, the court found that as of 8 May 2003 she had no longer been in need of medical support. That was confirmed by the applicant’s medical file, where doctor D.Š. had noted on 8 May at 8.15 a.m. that “the patient is responding to meaningful contact, is correctly orientated ( pacientė prieinama prasmingam kontaktui, orientuota teisingai )”. Also, at 8.30 a.m. on the same day, doctor A.G., the other psychiatrist treating her at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, had written that “currently the patient is sleepy because of medication ... her mind is clear, she is well orientated when it comes to place and time ... currently the affect is flat ( pacientė š.m. mieguista dėl vaistų poveikio, sąmonė aiški, orientacija vietoje ir laike tiksli... šiuo metu afektas lygus )”. The court also based itself on the applicant’s other medical records. All that meant that the applicant’s state of health had no longer corresponded to that set down in Article 27 of the Law on Mental Health Care to permit her further forced hospitalisation. Despite that, the applicant had been held against her will and treated at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital until 26 June 2003, without the hospital ever asking for a court order.

According to the forensic expert report, the applicant had not been able to understand her actions on 7 May 2003; however, the experts had not reached the same conclusion about the period between 8 May and 26 June 2003. That notwithstanding, the applicant had been forced to stay in hospital for fifty ‑ two days for treatment. The court also emphasised that the patient was always the weaker party in relation to the hospital and its personnel. The hospital’s argument that the applicant had agreed to stay by acquiescence was therefore null and void. The court also relied on doctor D.Š.’s admission during court hearings that the applicant’s life had “not necessarily been in danger” for all of the fifty-two days of treatment and to the same conclusion by the applicant’s treating doctor A.G. In fact, the records signed by doctor A.G. on 8 and 12 May 2007 stating that the applicant was being treated at the hospital had given only one side ( vienašališki ) of the situation as they had not been countersigned by the applicant. In that context, the court also had regard to the applicant’s explanation that because of the side effects of the medication (sleepiness, inability to concentrate) and the possibility of physical restraint (being tied down) in case of disobedience, she had not been able to express her disagreement about being treated at the hospital in writing. The court also considered that the consent given on 7 May 2013 by the applicant’s cousin, E.Š., for the applicant to be put in hospital and treated could also not be considered as an act of agreement expressed by the applicant."

The Court of Appeal relied on the Supreme Court’s practice in case no. 3K-3110/2004 of 11 February 2004 to the effect that it was obligatory to follow the procedure set out in Articles 16 and 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care, both when providing a patient with the necessary help ( būtinoji pagalba ) and when placing that person in hospital without his or her consent. Under that procedure, it had been possible to place the applicant in hospital and treat her without her consent for no longer than forty-eight hours. Without a court order, the forced hospitalisation and forced treatment had to be discontinued. However, there was no information in the case file that such an order had been granted. To make matters worse, the hospital had never even asked the court for such an authorisation. The Court of Appeal thus fully shared the lower court’s view that legal procedures had been outright disregarded, making the applicant’s stay in the hospital unlawful.",

In the particular case of the applicant, the Court of Appeal also referred to her open letter of 14 August 2003 to the Srovės journalists (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above), where she had acknowledged that the television broadcast had been instigated by members of her family, that she had not been shown in the programme in person, and that she had been given a different name.

                "91. From the outset, it should be emphasised that the delegation received no allegations – nor any other indications – of ill-treatment of patients by staff at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital.",
                "92. The restraint of violent psychiatric patients, who represent a danger to themselves or others, may exceptionally be necessary. However, this is a subject of particular concern to the CPT, given the potential for abuse and ill-treatment.",
                "Reference should be made to the report on the CPT’s 2008 visit to Lithuania, in which the Committee set out some of its main standards in this area.",
                "93. The restraint measures used at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital were manual, mechanical and chemical restraint, sometimes applied in combination. The delegation was informed that seclusion was not practised at the Hospital. Mechanical restraint was applied in two rooms (“observation rooms”) located in the intensive care unit, each of which was equipped with special beds for five-point fixation using belts with magnetic locks.",
                "Both mechanical and chemical restraint measures had to be authorised by a doctor and were recorded in the patient’s (computerised) medical file. However, it was not always clear from the records for how long a patient had been restrained. Moreover, there was no central register at the Hospital for recording the use of means of restraint. The delegation was also concerned to learn that there was no continuous, direct and personal supervision of the patient’s condition during fixation. Instead, supervision was carried out by means of regular inspections (every 30 minutes) by a nurse and CCTV surveillance. It also appeared that a patient could on occasion be fixated in full view of another patient.",
                "94. The CPT recalls that every instance of recourse to means of physical (manual), mechanical or chemical restraint should be recorded in a specific register (either paper-based or electronic) established for this purpose as well as in the patient’s file. The entry should include the times at which the measure began and ended, the circumstances of the case, the reasons for resorting to the measure, the means and/or medication used, the name of the doctor who ordered or approved it, the names of the staff who participated in the application of the restraint measure, and an account of any injuries sustained by patients/residents or staff.",
                "It is also essential that whenever a patient is subject to restraint, a qualified health-care staff member is continuously present in order to maintain the therapeutic alliance and provide assistance.",
                "Contact is to be maintained in an appropriate way aiming at de-escalating the situation and discontinuing the measure. Clearly, video surveillance cannot replace such a continuous staff presence. Further, a restrained patient should not be exposed to other patients, unless he/she explicitly expresses a wish to remain in the company of a certain fellow patient.",
                "Means of restraint should only be used for the shortest possible time (usually minutes to a few hours). When the emergency situation resulting in the application of restraint ceases to exist, the patient should be released immediately. Moreover, a debriefing with the patient should take place at the end of the application of any means of restraint. This debriefing will provide an opportunity for the doctor to explain the need for the measure and thus help relieve uncertainty about its rationale. For the patient, such debriefing provides an occasion to explain his/her emotions prior to the restraint, which may improve both the patient’s own and the staff’s understanding of his/her behaviour.",
                "The CPT recommends that steps be taken at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital to ensure that the minimum standards set out above are applied whenever resort is had to means of restraint.",
                "95. The CPT is very concerned to note that psychotropic medication – including haloperidol – was almost routinely administered to patients in the intensive care unit by means of direct intravenous injections (sometimes in very high doses), in order to control episodes of agitation and generally for prolonged periods (of up to ten days). Such a practice presents serious risks for the patients concerned (cardiac arrhythmias, low blood pressure, severe neurological reactions, coma, etc.) and should be used only very exceptionally, failing the use of oral (or, if necessary, intramuscular) medication and provided that there is close and continuous clinical monitoring (including ECG monitoring). The CPT recommends that the Lithuanian authorities review the aforementioned practice, in the light of the above remarks. [The CPT noted that haloperidol injections are not approved for intravenous administration in many countries because of the potentially fatal side effects].",
                "3. Safeguards in the context of involuntary hospitalisation",
                "96. In the reports on the 2004 and 2008 visits, the CPT had made a number of specific recommendations concerning the legal safeguards surrounding involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation of a civil nature. Regrettably, the findings made by the delegation during its visit to Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital suggest that most of those recommendations have remained unimplemented.",
                "97. The legal procedure relating to involuntary hospitalisation of civil psychiatric patients was described in the report on the CPT’s 2004 visit. The information gathered by the delegation during the 2012 visit indicated that this procedure was duly followed at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital. It also transpired that as a rule patients subject to involuntary placement were represented by a lawyer. In this connection, the delegation was told by the Hospital’s management that in most cases the assigned ex officio lawyer came to the Hospital to see and talk to the patient concerned.",
                "98. However, it remained the case that judges usually ordered involuntary hospitalisation without ever having seen the patient concerned. In practice, their role was often limited to simply carrying out a formal check of the documents submitted by the Hospital’s administration.",
                "Further, as far as the delegation could ascertain, judges were not required to (and in practice never did) seek an opinion from a psychiatrist outside the hospital concerned during civil involuntary placement procedures. As the CPT has stressed in the past, the procedure by which involuntary placement in a psychiatric establishment is decided should offer guarantees of independence and impartiality as well as of objective psychiatric expertise.",
                "The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Lithuanian authorities take steps to ensure that in the context of civil involuntary hospitalisation and extensions thereof:",
                "- patients have the effective right to be heard in person by the judge (for this purpose, consideration may be given to the holding of hearings on hospital premises);",
                "- the court always seeks an opinion from a psychiatrist who is not attached to the psychiatric institution admitting the patient concerned.",
                "99. A number of recent court decisions on involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation were consulted by the delegation during the visit to the Hospital. It was struck by the fact that, whereas some of the decisions referred to the patient’s (or his/her representative’s) right to appeal against the decision (within seven days), others explicitly mentioned that they were not subject to appeal. The CPT would like to receive the observations of the Lithuanian authorities on this matter.",
                "100. As already indicated in paragraph 90, at the time of the visit to the Hospital, only seven patients were formally considered as involuntary. However, from interviews with staff and patients, it became apparent that a number of “voluntary” patients were in fact not free to leave the hospital premises on their own and were thus de facto deprived of their liberty. Many of them were being accommodated in locked units and were only allowed to take outdoor walk at fixed times and when accompanied by staff. As the CPT made clear in the report on its 2008 visit, if it is considered that a given patient, who has been voluntarily admitted and who expresses a wish to leave the hospital, still requires inpatient care, then the involuntary civil placement procedure provided by the law should be fully applied.",
                "The CPT recommends that the legal status of patients at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital be reviewed, in the light of the above remarks.",
                "101. Lithuanian legislation still does not provide for a distinction between involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution and treatment without consent. The CPT wishes to stress once again that psychiatric patients should, as a matter of principle, be placed in a position to give their free and informed consent to treatment. The admission of a person to a psychiatric establishment on an involuntary basis should not be construed as authorising treatment without his/her consent. Every competent patient, whether voluntary or involuntary, should be fully informed about the treatment which it is intended to prescribe and given the opportunity to refuse treatment or any other medical intervention. Any derogation from this fundamental principle should be based upon law and only relate to clearly and strictly defined exceptional circumstances.",
                "The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Lithuanian authorities take steps - including of a legislative nature - to distinguish clearly between the procedure for involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution and the procedure for involuntary psychiatric treatment, in the light of the above remarks.”",

In her application to the Court the applicant complained that the doctor at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, doctor D.Š., had disclosed information about her health and private life to the Srovės journalists and her mother. She relied on Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:",
                "“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.",
                "2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”"

                "79. The Government firstly claimed that the applicant had not exhausted the available domestic remedies. In particular, she had not begun court proceedings against the journalists whose television show, Srovės, had been based on the interview with the applicant’s psychiatrist, doctor D.Š. On that point the Government noted that domestic law allowed individuals to bring a claim directly against a producer and/or broadcaster of a television programme, irrespective of who else might have contributed to the dissemination of the information in question (see paragraph 72 above). Accordingly, and notwithstanding the applicant’s belief that the breach of her right to privacy was linked to the actions of the psychiatrist, the impact on her privacy that she had purportedly experienced had been caused by the journalists and the television channel which had broadcast the Srovės programme. The Government also referred to several Supreme Court rulings from 2005 and argued that there was a plentiful amount of Lithuanian case ‑ law showing that journalists could be brought to justice for breaching the right to privacy, proving that such an action was an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention. It was therefore not reasonable to shift all the responsibility for the public dissemination of information which the applicant saw as concerning her private life to the hospital, or, all the more so, to the State, only because the applicant had chosen to bring her claim for responsibility against the hospital during the domestic proceedings. The Government underlined that domestic law aimed at enabling plaintiffs to approach alleged violations of their rights in the most effective way, considering all the relevant factors showing wrongful behaviour. In this case, neither the hospital nor the psychiatrist had been able to control the scope of the information broadcast, in contrast to the actual broadcaster of that information."

                "81. In reply to the Government’s arguments, the applicant submitted that she had had the right to decide whether to request compensation for damage from one or all of the persons who had disclosed information about her health, which fell into the sphere of her private life. Because of the complexity and considerable scope of the court proceedings against Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she had decided to seek compensation for breach of privacy from the hospital alone. The applicant noted that she had learned about the unlawful disclosure of information of a private nature by her psychiatrist, while she was being unlawfully held in the hospital. The fact that the psychiatrist had disclosed confidential information about her to the journalists and her mother had caused the applicant a tremendous shock, emotional suffering and distress. The subsequent dissemination of that information by the journalists had only increased the damage. In such a manner, the major breach of her right to privacy had been caused by the fact that a public hospital had revealed confidential information to the journalists. Lastly, the applicant relied on a Supreme Court ruling and implied that in the case of a breach of privacy a claim may be lodged against the person who disclosed confidential information, rather than the broadcaster who made that information public (she referred to Varapnickaitė-Mažylienė v. Lithuania, no. 20376/05, § 25, 17 January 2012)."

The Court observes at the outset that in her application the applicant complained that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital psychiatrist doctor D.Š. had disclosed information regarding the applicant’s health and her private life to, firstly, the journalists from Srovės, and, secondly, to her mother (see paragraph 78 above). The Court further notes that the applicant voiced the same complaints in the Lithuanian courts, where, among numerous other grievances, she argued that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital had been responsible for the breach of her right to privacy (see paragraphs 24 and 43 above). The applicant has also pleaded to the Court that the disclosure by the public hospital’s psychiatrist of information about the applicant’s health led her to lose faith in the whole health-care system (see paragraph 87 below). In the particular circumstances of this case, the Court is therefore ready to accept the applicant’s argument that she saw the hospital where the psychiatrist doctor D.Š. worked as primarily responsible for the breach of the applicant’s right to privacy and that therefore she was not obliged to bring an action against the Srovės journalists who had made the interview with the psychiatrist public (also see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, §§ 44 and 45, ECHR 2006 ‑ II)."

The applicant noted at the outset that as a person being held at a psychiatric hospital her psychiatric diagnosis had formed a very important and sensitive aspect of her personal life. Her main argument, that the substance of the breach of privacy lay in the fact that the psychiatrist had disclosed such information to journalists and her mother, had not been given proper consideration by the domestic courts. Both the Court of Appeal and the Government had wrongly directed all their attention to the question of whether it had been possible to establish the applicant’s identity from the Srovės broadcast."

The applicant emphasised that even though the psychiatrist, doctor D.Š., had not mentioned her by name when responding to the journalists’ questions in front of camera, it had been obvious from her responses that the information had been provided with a specific person in mind. The psychiatrist had talked about a particular person’s sexuality, about that person’s studies in the United States and her affiliation with a non ‑ traditional religious community (see paragraph 20 above). In fact, in the applicant’s view, when questioned as a witness before the first-instance court, the psychiatrist had conceded that she had talked about the applicant with the journalists (see paragraph 34 above). The Srovės broadcast had also disclosed the applicant’s psychiatric diagnosis – acute psychosis – which they or the applicant’s mother could only have become aware of from the psychiatrist, who was a State actor and could have anticipated that such information would be made more widely public."

The applicant also submitted that the fact that the journalists had known that she was being held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital prior to their arrival had not excused the psychiatrist from her duty to protect confidential information which amounted to a professional secret. When information about a person’s mental health was confirmed in a broadcast by the psychiatrist in charge of treatment, it gained a completely different, higher, value, to information about someone’s health revealed and discussed by a journalist or that person’s mother alone. The psychiatrist had confirmed information about the applicant’s health by her mere presence in the broadcast and by talking about the applicant, even if she had not mentioned her name. Furthermore, given that the psychiatrist had made certain statements about the applicant’s sexuality (see paragraph 20 above), the impression had been created for viewers that she practised an amoral religion which breached the public order. Last but not least, finding out that doctor D.Š. had talked to journalists about the applicant’s health without her consent had caused her a great shock, long-lasting uncertainty and emotional insecurity, as she had not known which other facts that the psychiatrist had forced out of her during their private conversations using psycho-correction methods had been revealed to the journalists. In the applicant’s words, that had sowed a seed of distrust in doctors and psychiatrists."

In response to the Government’s argument that it had been impossible to establish the applicant’s identity from the Srovės broadcast, the applicant stated that, in fact, she found the opposite. The programme had revealed that she had studied in the United States, that her parents lived in Šiauliai, that her father was seriously ill, and that at the time of broadcast she lived in Vilnius and attended the Ojas Meditation Centre there. In addition, the applicant’s mother and sister had appeared in the broadcast. Close friends, acquaintances and relatives knew her mother and sister and so the applicant’s co-workers had been able to easily identify her as the person the psychiatrist had talked about. The applicant also submitted that she had been working at the time at the Ministry of Economy and the opinion had soon spread that she was a mental patient and a member of an amoral sect. All that had caused her great emotional and inner discomfort and had negatively affected her work environment and her psychological well-being. Lastly, she noted that her 14 August 2003 open letter to the Srovės journalists had only been published after the broadcast and that she had only done that in order to react to the programme’s falsehoods and lies. Prior to the broadcast she had not made any information public about her mental state or former ailments."

Lastly, the applicant was dissatisfied that the hospital had disclosed information on her health to her mother, which the applicant considered to constitute a separate breach of her right to privacy. As established by the domestic courts, as of 8 May 2003 the applicant had been conscious, clinical indications for compulsory medical help had been absent and she had been emotionally and mentally capable of taking decisions on her treatment. The applicant submitted that her mother had arrived at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital on 9 May 2003, when the applicant had been conscious enough to take decisions on her own. The applicant had not given any authorisation to the psychiatrists to provide information about her to third parties, including her mother. At that time the applicant’s relationship with her mother was very tense and complex, thus the applicant had not wished for her mother to get involved in her treatment. For the applicant, the fact that her mother had known of her earlier stays in hospital had not constituted grounds for the psychiatrists to provide information on her health and treatment and so they had breached their duty to act with due regard to protect professional secrecy."

The domestic courts had duly examined her claims but had found no “substantial evidence” to hold that it had been possible to recognise her from the Srovės broadcast. In particular, for the Court of Appeal, there was a lack of features making it possible to confirm the applicant’s identity during the broadcast. The Government also argued that the information provided by doctor D.Š. to the journalists had consisted of fairly abstract references to the applicant’s studies for a master’s in the United States, without giving details about those studies. It was fairly widely known in Lithuania at the relevant time that quite a lot of Lithuanian citizens were studying in the United States. According to Government statistics, 493 Lithuanian citizens studied at a higher education institution in the United States in 2001, 628 in 2002 and 647 in 2003. In fact, it had been the applicant’s open letter of 14 August 2003 to the Srovės journalists that had exposed her, by divulging her name, surname, a detailed description of her treatment at psychiatric facilities and her participation in the Osho movement (see paragraphs 21-23 above). By explicitly identifying herself as the character “Violeta” depicted in the Srovės television broadcast, the applicant had herself publicly established a link between that character and herself."

                "91. Should the Court nevertheless find that there had been an interference with the applicant’s right to her privacy, the Government argued that the information discussed in the television programme might be identified as contributing to a debate of general interest. The Government submitted that, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lithuanian society had experienced fundamental institutional, cultural and societal changes. The influx of new religious movements had not been smooth due to impediments related to the relative sensitivity of religious attitudes in a transforming society. In fact, society’s initial attitude to new religious movements had been rather negative. Among other reasons, that had been caused by a lack of information about those movements or by unfavourable coverage in the media. More thorough coverage was therefore necessary to establish a link between society, which was largely uninformed about such things, and new religious movements, the Osho movement being one of them. Taking into account the secrecy of that movement in Lithuania, as well as the controversy surrounding the registration of the Ojas Meditation Centre as a religious community, the Srovės programme had contributed to a debate of great public importance. Furthermore, even if the broadcast could be considered as “exaggeratedly provocative”, that did not rebut its informational function because the local leader of the Osho movement in Lithuania, M.V., and close relatives of the applicant had been interviewed. It was the applicant’s mother who had initiated the broadcast and she could be considered as a reliable source of information on that issue of public concern as the journalists had been keen to speak with relatives who provided their views on the issue openly."

The Government admitted that, if proven, such a disclosure would amount to a separate violation of Article 8 of the Convention. However, the first-instance court had merely established that the applicant’s mother had already been aware of her daughter’s aggravated condition on 7 May 2003, as well as of her being transported to the hospital for further treatment (see paragraph 33 above). The Court of Appeal had referred to the applicant’s previous history of mental disorders, stating that the provision of information about the applicant’s health to her relatives could not be considered as a violation of her privacy. Indeed, the applicant’s mother had known of the applicant’s prior treatment (see paragraph 48 above) and the disorder at issue had been similar in nature to the earlier episodes, especially because some of them had also clearly related to her religious activities (on this last point the Government referred to information in paragraph 6 above)."

Finland, no. 20511/03, § 35, 17 July 2008, and L.L. v. France, no. 7508/02, § 32, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI). The protection of personal data, not least medical data, is of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is crucial not only to respect the sense of privacy of a patient but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, § 95, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I; P. and S. v. Poland, no. 57375/08, § 128, 30 October 2012; and L.H. v. Latvia, no. 52019/07, § 56, 29 April 2014). Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a personal and intimate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and, even, from seeking such assistance, thereby endangering their own health and, in the case of transmissible diseases, that of the community. The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in Article 8 of the Convention (see Z v. Finland, cited above, § 95)."

For her part, the psychiatrist, doctor D.Š., testified at the hearing that when the journalists had come to that hospital, she had been asked by the hospital’s administration to meet them and told that the “talk would be about Mockutė” (see paragraph 34 above), an aspect of the case which the Court finds particularly disturbing. Even though doctor D.Š. denied to the Vilnius Regional Court that she had talked with the Srovės journalists about the applicant’s health, that was overruled by that court, which held that the psychiatrist, without obtaining the applicant’s consent, had revealed information to the journalists about her diagnosis, acute psychosis, the fact that she was being treated at that psychiatric hospital, and that she had studied in the United States (see paragraph 35 above). That conclusion does not appear to have been overruled by the Court of Appeal, which only disagreed about the fact that the excerpts of the psychiatrist’s interview shown during the broadcast had been sufficient to identify the applicant (see paragraph 47 above). The Court further observes that in one of those excerpts the psychiatrist used such statements as “it does not appear that this young woman would participate in orgies” and that “she is not hypersexual” (see paragraph 20 above). In this context it recalls the State’s obligation to protect information about a person’s sexual life and moral integrity (see the case-law in paragraph 94 above). In deciding whether there was interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her privacy, the Court also notes that under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was adopted in 2007, the States’ have a duty to protect persons with disabilities from unlawful attacks on their honour and reputation (see Article 22 of the CRDP, cited in paragraph 73 above). Examining further, the Court observes that the psychiatrist also discussed the applicant as manifesting secretive behaviour, which was a trait of those belonging to sects (see paragraph 20 above). At this juncture the Court is also mindful of the applicant’s argument that she experienced emotional insecurity because she was afraid of which of the additional facts the psychiatrist had forced out of her might have been revealed to the journalists (see paragraph 87 in fine above; also see Surikov, cited above, § 75)."

In fact, Article 52 of the Law on the Health System explicitly forbade health-care specialists from violating the rules of confidentiality of information about a person’s health which they had acquired in the course of their professional activity (see paragraph 60 above). Furthermore, under Articles 2 and 11 of the Law on the Legal Protection of Personal Data, information about a person’s religious beliefs, health or sexual life was attributed particular protection, and it could only be released provided that the person had undisputably agreed to such disclosure (see paragraph 61 above). The duties to protect the confidentiality of all personal data relating to a person with disability, as well as to protect such persons from attacks on their honour or dignity, have been underlined within the framework of the United Nations and by Council of Europe institutions (see Article 22 of the CRPD, cited in paragraph 73 above, point 7.4.c of the Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above, and Article 13 of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2004)10, cited in paragraph 76 above)."

In fact, the Court notes that all the relevant domestic and international law cited above expressly prohibits the disclosure of such information to the point that it even constitutes a criminal offence (see paragraph 62 above). Even if there were exceptions to the rule of non-disclosure, none of those have been argued by the Government, which instead pleaded a legitimate aim of informing society about new religious movements.

The Government, asked explicitly by the Court to identify such a legal basis, did not specify one either (see Radu, cited above, § 29). That being so, and since no legal basis had been cited by the domestic courts, the Court cannot but hold that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital’s release of information about the applicant’s health to her mother, whichever form it might have taken, was likewise not “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention."

While being held at the psychiatric hospital, she had been neither able to leave to go to the Ojas Meditation Centre to meditate nor practise meditation on her own at the psychiatric hospital because she needed privacy and a place (a room) to be by herself. The applicant also underlined that while being held unlawfully at the hospital doctors had used psycho-correction techniques aimed at bringing about a critical and negative attitude to her religion. Such facts had been confirmed by the Court of Appeal and were also apparent from her medical records. The psychiatrists’ negative attitude towards her religion and the Ojas Meditation Centre itself had also been confirmed by doctor D.Š. during the Srovės broadcast. It was therefore illogical and irrational to argue, as the Government had done (see paragraph 114 below), that the psychiatrists had made it possible for her to practise such a religion while at the same time applying psycho-correction methods with respect to it."

In 1996, she had suffered depression, while in 2002 she had had post-traumatic stress disorder, which had caused her to become mentally disorientated (see paragraph 8 above). There were no facts proving that her mental deficiencies of 2003 had been linked to her spiritual activities, except for the unfounded opinion of her mother that the applicant’s mental disorder had related to her religion. In fact, within only two weeks of being released from Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital on 11 July 2003 the applicant had already felt well (see paragraph 23 above). From then on and until January 2016, when she had submitted observations to the Court, the applicant had had no mental health complaints, even though she meditated – practised her religion – daily.

The applicant found it hard to conceive of a situation where psychiatrists could get someone with a mental disorder which manifested itself when thinking about work or family to form a negative attitude towards those two aspects of life. It was also hard to imagine getting someone to form negative beliefs in a similar manner towards traditional religions, such as Christianity or Islam. In this particular case there was not a single medical record specifying why psycho ‑ correction methods had been needed and how exactly the meditative religion practised by the applicant had harmed her mental health."

Therefore, even if Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital personnel had not prohibited the applicant from meditating, she had been encouraged to do that in line with the state of her health. The Government also noted that the applicant’s case was a particular one owing to the persistent link between her mental disorders and her spirituality, which, according to her medical records, had also occurred previously and had been related to other religious groups, not the Osho movement.

In fact, the psychiatrists’ actions and methods applied when treating the applicant had been in line with the existing legislation and legal acts. The Government also drew an analogy with the Court’s case-law under Article 3 of the Convention, where it had held that it was for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used to preserve the physical and mental health of patients (they relied on Herczegfalvy v. Austria, 24 September 1992, § 82, Series A no. 244). Even though the case at issue was of a different nature, the Government suggested that a similar approach could be followed. The priorities of medical science and the professional application of medical methods should prevail over the wishes of an individual to choose his or her own way of behaving, unless abusive conduct by medical personnel was clearly established, which had obviously not been the case here.

The Court has frequently emphasised the State’s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. It also considers that the State’s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State’s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Leyla Şahin v.

Examining further, the Court turns to the applicant’s twofold argument that at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had been prevented from practicing her religion, firstly, because of restrictive regime therein, and, secondly, because of the doctors’ unsympathetic views towards her beliefs. The Court notes that, after the applicant was placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she was forcibly administered drugs, physically restrained, and various restrictive treatment regimes were applied to her during the fifty ‑ two days of her stay at that institution (see paragraphs 12 and 14-18 above; on the issue of the consent to treatment, or lack of it in the applicant’s case, also see paragraphs 38 and 51 above; also see point 101 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The Government have not suggested that the applicant could have left the hospital to practise her religion with the circle of people with whom she shared it, even though she had clearly indicated to the psychiatrists that attending the Ojas Meditation Center “brought her peace” (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 57 above; also see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31 and Sinan Işık, cited above, § 38). In fact, the Vilnius Regional Court, which also relied on the CPT standards, had clearly ruled out any possibility for the applicant to leave the hospital for 52 days of her stay therein (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). This view also appears to be corroborated by the CPT, which, having reviewed the situation at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital in general, noted that although only few patients therein were formally considered as involuntary, in reality even “voluntary” patients were not free to leave (see point 100 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). It is also plain from the applicant’s statements in her open letter (see paragraph 22 above) and in those made to the domestic court (see paragraph 43 above), to this Court (see paragraph 109 above), as well as from her medical records and other documents (see paragraphs 15, 17, 37, 42 and 50 above), that in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had to submit and subordinate her wishes to unyielding authority of the psychiatrists who were trying to “correct” the applicant so that she abandoned her “fictitious” religion, and whom she felt constrained to obey, even on pain of receiving a diagnosis which would make her unemployable (on the issue of undue influence and freedom of religion see Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 38 and 45, 51-53, Reports 1998 ‑ I; also see the extracts from the Lithuanian Constitutional Court’s ruling in paragraph 65 above).

While it is for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used, if necessary by force, to preserve the physical and mental health of patients who are entirely incapable of deciding for themselves, the Court must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, § 82).

Be that as it may, it recalls having already had an occasion to examine a case concerning the applicant associations’, who were religious associations or meditation associations belonging to the Osho movement, complaint that the information campaign by the respondent Government had aimed to denigrate the Osho movement’s teachings (see Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany, no. 58911/00, §§ 70 and 71, 6 November 2008). The Court does not fail to observe that in that case it acknowledged that the applicant associations retained their freedom of religion, both as regards their freedom of conscience and the freedom to manifest their beliefs through worship and practice. Even so, given that the terms used to describe the applicant associations’ movement, such as “sects”, “psycho-sects”, “cults” or similar, may have had negative consequences for them, in that case the Court thus proceeded its analysis on the premise that such labelling constituted an interference with the applicant associations’ right to manifest their religion or belief, as guaranteed by Article 9 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 83 and 84). The Court then ultimately accepted, with certain provisos, that the German Government’s public campaign in no way amounted to a prohibition of the applicant associations’ freedom to manifest their religion or belief (ibid., §§ 100 and 101). That being so, the Court finds that the circumstances examined in the instant case, which concerns the applicant who was an individual with a history of mental troubles, and in a particularly vulnerable situation under effective control of the psychiatrists who worked on her with the view that she became critical towards her religion, were therefore more grim than those examined in Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others where the applicants were a group of religious associations or meditation associations, and thus all the more so amounted to an interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 9 of the Convention."

                "128. In the present case, however, it is sufficient to note that, except for the first day of her involuntary hospitalisation, the applicant was held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital unlawfully (see paragraphs 29-32 and 45 above). Given that the applicant’s psycho-correction treatment lasted longer than 7-8 May 2003 (see paragraph 29 above) and, in fact, continued throughout her stay at that institution, the Court finds that the interference was not “prescribed by law”. In the context of the lawfulness of involuntary psychiatric detention, the Court also notes the CPT report which details numerous drawbacks related to the authorisation for holding a person in a psychiatric hospital, including the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital where the applicant had been held, including the lack of appropriate judicial involvement (see points 96, 98 and 99 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The need for judicial approval for compulsory admission and continued placement at the psychiatric institution has also been underlined by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see point 7.1.b of the Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above; also see the extract from United Nations Special Rapporteur Mr D. Pūras’ report in paragraph 74 above, regarding the practice of deprivation of liberty in closed psychiatric institutions). In this particular case, the Vilnius Regional Court and the Court of Appeal both concluded that domestic legal procedures for the applicant’s forced hospitalisation and treatment had not only been breached, but outright disregarded (see paragraphs 32 and 45 above)."

                "129. The Court also attaches weight to the fact that, under the Lithuanian Constitution and the Constitutional Court’s case-law, freedom of religion becomes a matter of legal regulation only to the extent that an individual expresses his or her thoughts or religion by actions, and that, as long as a person has a religion or faith, it falls within the inviolable sphere of private life and may not be limited in any way (see paragraphs 64 and 65 above). Regarding the situation of the applicant in the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the needs of psychiatric treatment might necessitate discussing various matters, including religion, with a patient, when he or she is being treated by a psychiatrist. That being so, it does not transpire from Lithuanian law that such discussions might also take the form of psychiatrists prying into the patients’ beliefs in order to “correct” them when there is no clear and imminent risk that such beliefs will manifest in actions dangerous to the patient or others (in this context see, mutatis mutandis, Biblical Centre of the Chuvash Republic v. Russia, no. 33203/08, § 57, 12 June 2014). On this last point, the Court refers to its earlier finding that the applicant’s behaviour did not require her hospitalisation after 8 May 2003 (see paragraph 128 in limine above). The Court further reiterates the principle of the States’ limited margin of appreciation to justify interference with the freedom of individual conscience (see paragraph 118 above). Notwithstanding that limited margin of appreciation which is applicable to manifestation of religious beliefs, the Court has also emphasised the primary importance of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the fact that a State cannot dictate what a person believes or take coercive steps to make him change his beliefs (see Ivanova, cited above, § 79 in fine; also see paragraph 119 above). Lastly, the Court has never held in its case-law that the scope of the States’ margin of appreciation could be broader or narrower depending on the nature of the religious beliefs."

After summarising the applicable domestic law and the submissions by the parties, it held as follows :",
                "“ According to the specialists ’ report of 24 December 2008 by the Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University, [the specialists ] read the book ‘ The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter ’ from the Risale-I Nur Collection by Bediüzzaman Said Nursi ...",
                "Having analysed the textual content of the book, its syntax structures, the genre characteristics and the methods of structuring the text and expressions, the panel of specialists came to an unanimous finding that, as a whole, the book ‘ The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter ’ from the Risale-I Nur Collection by Bediüzzaman Said Nursi is ideological, and at the same time religious, literature inciting religious discord and containing propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion. In particular, it incites discord between Muslims and non-believers, which term is understood to include adherents of other religions as well as those who do not belong to any religion. The gist of the book is a breach of religious equality consisting in forming in the reader a negative and aggressive attitude towards non-believers and adherents to other religions, which amounts to inciting hatred and discord against them (see [ specialist report of 24 December 2008]).",
                "According to the specialists ’ report mentioned above, the values inspired in the reader by the text are the exceptional nature of the Islamic faith, which is presented to the reader as the ultimate truth. People are divided into two groups: those who do not follow the Islamic faith are described by the author as ‘ the dissolute ’, ‘ the philosophers ’ and ‘ the idle talkers ’; and those who belong to that religion are described by the author as ‘ the faithful ’ and ‘ the just ’. It follows that believers and non-believers are rated differently on the basis of their adherence to the Islamic religion: the unfaithful are rated negatively, while the faithful to Islam are rated positively. The author uses in his text disparaging words and expressions to belittle the European culture, which is understood, in the light of the religious contents of the book, as religious confessions other than Islam. The author uses military metaphors in the text, which inevitably inclines the reader to see the reality through the prism of the conditions of a military camp, a military ground and potential military actions. The value of such a world - view is stressed by positive epithets. Simultaneously, through the use of verbal means and expressions, the author implicitly (that is covertly rather than openly, by influencing the subconscious) forms in the reader ’ s mind the idea of an enemy, the notion of a potential aggressor. Taken together, it creates in the reader ’ s mind an idea that it is necessary to be ready for a fight. The structure of the book is such that in the subsequent text the idea of the necessity to fight, of being ready for a fight, is, on the one hand, attenuated as it is not expressed directly; on the other hand, having been already stated earlier, it may be reinforced in the readers ’ minds because the text inspires the idea that non-believers commit a crime consisting in the very fact of not believing and which, according to the text under review, does not merit forgiveness. Thereby the author of the book attempts to influence the reader ’ s psyche on a subconscious level and to influence the mechanisms of his faith, that is to form on an irrational basis conscious values and attitudes. It may deprive the reader of the capacity to think critically about changes happening in real life, may undermine his ability to make independent decisions and thereby breach the right to freedom of religion. According to the book, anyone who does not accept Islam, a non-believer, is the most inferior person who is deprived of his rights, is a criminal not deserving forgiveness. The book suggests to the reader corporate norms and a model of society where all people follow the same rules; the actions of all members of such a society are tightly regulated, they are encouraged to comply like obedient soldiers, military officers or civil servants who must unquestioningly carry out orders and commands (see [expert report of 24 December 2008]).",

                "On the one hand, the text is addressed to non-believers who do not have a developed ability to think critically. If the reader does not have a certain ideology of life, the text may influence him ideologically and form in his mind the ideas described above by methods of emotional induction and on the least rational level.",
                "On the other hand, the text is addressed to readers who have a religious world - view other than Islam, as it calls on them to accept the only true God – Allah. The author suggests to the reader that it is normal to change one ’ s world - view and that the author desires it.",
                "The text is also addressed to people who accept the Islamic religious worldview, revere Allah and are ready to carry out his will and his commandments, which follows from a reconstruction of such an addressee ’ s characteristics: readiness to fight for ‘ eternal life ’ and the constant service of Allah and his messengers in such forms as may transpire from respective orders.",
                "The text is also addressed to readers who ‘ delay ’ religious activity ... until an undetermined future point, which may however come at the will of someone who has the right to command and give orders.",
                "The text uses the expression ‘ little man ’, which may be understood as ‘ the most common ’ man who perceives himself as a ‘ little man ’. The author suggests that the essence of such a person, if he is not a follower of Islam, is an ‘ infinitely big crime ’.",
                "In addition, the reader is encouraged to take responsibility for his parents; to save them he must accept the advocated Islamic religious creed. It means that any person who identifies with his parents, who has the slightest feeling of existential guilt for them, may be moved to adopt the view of the world suggested by the author.",
                "To sum up, in the opinion of the panel of specialists, the psychological characteristics of the potential addressees (readers) mentioned above are not essential for understanding the text of the book because the text itself, by its specific structure and its [psychological] methods of holding attention and suggestion, is capable, after a long reading, to transmit the advocated religious ideology to any person who is in search of ideological support for his life, who is inclined to reflection and is in the process of self-development.”"

The court considered that the experts ’ wording gave reason to believe that such interpretations could not be excluded, but that interpretations could in fact differ depending on the reader ’ s individual perceptions. The experts had not cited the statements which, in their opinion, could be subject to different interpretations and had not explained why they had come to that conclusion. The court further found that the comparison of the book with other monotheistic religious texts had been misconceived because it had not asked for a comparative study. If the book contained propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion or their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation, it was irrelevant that other religious texts also contained such statements.

The Constitutional Court held, in particular, that the requirement of foreseeability did not prevent the use of value or common terms the meaning of which was understandable directly from the legal provision in question, from a combination of related legal provisions or through interpretation by the courts. When applying section 1 of the Suppression of Extremism Act, the courts had to take into account that the requisite element of that form of extremism was explicit or implicit disrespect for the constitutional prohibition of incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord and of propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or their attitude to religion. To establish whether there was such disrespect, the courts had to take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, such as the form and content of the activity or information in question, its addressees, purposes, social and political context and whether there was a real threat to public order arising from, among others, calls to, or substantiation or justification of, unlawful infringements of constitutionally protected values. The Constitutional Court found that anti-extremism legislation did not permit restrictions to be imposed on the right to freedom of conscience, religion and speech on the sole ground that the activity or information did not conform to common views, established traditions and beliefs, or moral and religious preferences. Such restrictions would be contrary to the constitutional requirements of necessity, proportionality and fairness.

At the global level, there is not sufficient common ground to provide for a margin of appreciation. At the global level, any attempt to lower the threshold of article 20 of the Covenant would not only shrink the frontiers of free expression, but also limit freedom of religion or belief itself.

While some of the above concepts may overlap, the Special Rapporteur considers the following elements to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred: real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression; intent of the speaker to incite discrimination, hostility or violence; and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred was expressed, given that international law prohibits some forms of speech for their consequences, and not for their content as such, because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another. Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website. Similarly, artistic expression should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context, given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence, discrimination or hostility.",

Moreover, while States are required to prohibit by law any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence under article 20 (2) of the Covenant, there is no requirement to criminalize such expression.

In other cases, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that States should adopt civil laws, with the application of diverse remedies, including procedural remedies (for example, access to justice and ensuring effectiveness of domestic institutions) and substantive remedies (for example, reparations that are adequate, prompt and proportionate to the gravity of the expression, which may include restoring reputation, preventing recurrence and providing financial compensation).",

Moreover, the right to freedom of religion or belief, as enshrined in relevant international legal standards, does not include the right to have a religion or belief that is free from criticism or ridicule. Indeed, the right to freedom of expression includes the right to scrutinize, debate openly, make statements that offend, shock and disturb, and criticize belief systems, opinions and institutions, including religious ones, provided that they do not advocate hatred that incites hostility, discrimination or violence.

At any rate, the concepts of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness on which any democratic society is based mean that the responsibility that is implied in the right to freedom of expression does not, as such, mean that an individual is to be protected from exposure to a religious view simply because it is not his or her own. The purpose of any restriction on freedom of expression must be to protect individuals holding specific beliefs or opinions, rather than to protect belief systems from criticism. The right to freedom of expression implies that it should be allowed to scrutinise, openly debate, and criticise, even harshly and unreasonably, belief systems, opinions, and institutions, as long as this does not amount to advocating hatred against an individual or groups ...",
                "60. In this respect, it is worth recalling that it is often argued that there is an essential a difference between racist insults and insults on the ground of belonging to a given religion: while race is inherited and unchangeable, religion is not, and is instead based on beliefs and values which the believer will tend to hold as the only truth. This difference has prompted some to conclude that a wider scope of criticism is acceptable in respect of a religion than in respect of a race. This argument presupposes that while ideas of superiority of a race are unacceptable, ideas of superiority of a religion are acceptable, as it is possible for the believer of the “inferior” religion to refuse to follow some ideas and even to switch to the “superior” religion.",
                "61.

It is true that the boundaries between insult to religious feelings (and even blasphemy) and hate speech are easily blurred, so that the dividing line, in an insulting speech, between the expression of ideas and the incitement to hatred is often difficult to identify. This problem however should be solved through an appropriate interpretation of the notion of incitement to hatred rather than through the sanctioning of insult to religious feelings.",
                "69. When it comes to statements, certain elements should be taken into consideration in deciding if a given statement constitutes an insult or amounts to hate speech: the context in which it is made; the public to which it is addressed; whether the statement was made by a person in his or her official capacity, in particular if this person carries out particular functions. ..",
                "70. As concerns the context, a factor which is relevant is whether the statement (or work of art) was circulated in a restricted environment or widely accessible to the general public, whether it was made in a closed place accessible with tickets or exposed in a public area. The circumstance that it was, for example, disseminated through the media bears particular importance, in the light of the potential impact of the medium concerned. It is worth noting in this respect that ‘ it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media; the audiovisual media have means of conveying through images meanings which the print media are not able to impart. ’ ...",

While there is no doubt that in a democracy all ideas, even though shocking or disturbing, should in principle be protected (with the exception, as explained above, of those inciting hatred), it is equally true that not all ideas deserve to be circulated.

The only definition of ‘ extremism ’ contained in an international treaty binding on the Russian Federation is to be found in the Shanghai Convention [on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism of 15 June 2001, ratified by Russia on 10 January 2003]. In Article 1.1.1.3) of the Extremism Law, ‘ extremism ’ is defined as ‘ an act aimed at seizing or keeping power through the use of violence or changing violently the constitutional regime of a State, as well as a violent encroachment upon public security, including organization, for the above purposes, of illegal armed formations and participation in them, criminally prosecuted in conformity with the national laws of the Parties ’. The latter clause allows signatory states to prosecute such ‘ extremist ’ actions according to their national laws.",
                "... 30. The Venice Commission notes that the definitions in Article 1 of the Law of the ‘ basic notions ’ of ‘ extremism ’ ( ‘ extremist activity/extremism ’, ‘ extremist organisation ’ and ‘ extremist materials ’ ) do not set down general characteristics of extremism as a concept. Instead, the Law lists a very diverse array of actions that are deemed to constitute ‘ extremist activity ’ or ‘ extremism ’. This should mean that, according to the Law, only activities defined in Article 1.1 are to be considered extremist activities or fall within the scope of extremism and that only organisations defined in Article 1.2 and materials defined in Article 1.3 should be deemed extremist.",
                "31. The Commission however has strong reservations about the inclusion of certain activities under the list of ‘ extremist ’ activities. Indeed, while some of the definitions in Article 1 refer to notions that are relatively well defined in other legislative acts of the Russian Federation, a number of other definitions listed in Article 1 are too broad, lack clarity and may open the way to different interpretations. In addition, while the definition of ‘ extremism ’ provided by the Shanghai Convention, as well as the definitions of ‘ terrorism ’ and ‘ separatism ’, all require violence as an essential element, certain of the activities defined as ‘ extremist ’ in the Extremism Law seem not to require an element of violence (see further comments below) ...",

                "35. Extremist activity under point 3 is defined in a less precise manner than in a previous version of the Law (2002). In the 2002 Law the conduct, in order to fall within the definition, had to be ‘ associated with violence or calls to violence ’. However the current definition ( ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ ) does not require violence as the reference to it has been removed. According to non-governmental reports, this has led in practice to severe antiextremism measures under the Extremism Law and/or the Criminal Code. The Venice Commission recalls that, as stated in its Report devoted to the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of religion, hate speech and incitement may not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR and justify criminal sanctions. The Commission notes that such a conduct is criminalized under Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code and that, under Article 282.2, the use of violence or the threat of its use in committing this crime is an aggravating circumstance.",
                "36. The Venice Commission is of the opinion that in order to qualify ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ as ‘ extremist activity ’, the definition should expressly require the element of violence. This would maintain a more consistent approach throughout the various definitions included in article 1.1, bring this definition in line with the Criminal Code, the Guidelines provided by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and more closely follow the general approach of the concept of ‘ extremism ’ in the Shanghai Convention.",

                "37. At first sight, this provision reiterates the usual non-discriminatory clauses in international treaties and national laws, which prohibit a difference in treatment of persons on the basis of their inherent or inherited qualities, such as race, ethnic origin, religion or language. Nevertheless, under the headings contained therein, all kinds of propaganda activities including preaching such difference in treatment, whether or not they are associated with violence or calls to violence, are deemed ‘ extremism ’.",
                "38. In the view of the Venice Commission, to proclaim as extremist any religious teaching or proselytising activity aimed at proving that a certain worldview is a superior explanation of the universe, may affect the freedom of conscience or religion of many persons and could easily be abused in an effort to suppress a certain church thereby affecting not only the freedom of conscience or religion but also the freedom of association. The ECtHR protects proselytism and the freedom of the members of any religious community or church to ‘ try to convince ’ other people through ‘ teachings ’. The freedom of conscience and religion is of an intimate nature and is therefore subject to fewer possible limitations in comparison to other human rights: only manifestations of this freedom can be limited, but not the teachings themselves.",
                "39. It therefore appears that under the extremist activity in point 4, not only religious extremism involving violence but also the protected expressions of freedom of conscience and religion may lead to the application of preventive and corrective measures. This seems to be confirmed by worrying reports of extensive scrutiny measures of religious literature having led, in recent years, to the qualification of numerous religious texts as ‘ extremist material ’ (see below point (b)).",
                "40. In the Commission ’ s view, the authorities should review the definition under article 1.1 point 4 so as to ensure/provide additional guarantees that peaceful conduct aiming to convince other people to adhere to a specific religion or conception of life, as well as related teachings, in the absence of any direct intent or purpose of inciting enmity or strife19, are not seen as extremist activities and therefore not unduly included in the scope of anti-extremism measures.",

Clarification is required of what is intended here. If violating rights and freedoms ‘ in connection with a personal ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion ’, in the absence of any violent element is an extremist activity, it is clearly a too broad category.",

                "49. Considering the broad and rather imprecise definition of ‘ extremist documents ’ (Article 1.3), the Venice Commission is concerned about the absence of any criteria and any indication in the Law on how documents may be classified as extremist and believes that this has the potential to open the way to arbitrariness and abuse. The Commission is aware from official sources, that the court decision is systematically based on prior expert review of the material under consideration and may be appealed against in court. It nonetheless considers that, in the absence of clear criteria in the Law, too wide a margin of appreciation and subjectivity is left both in terms of the assessment of the material and in relation to the corresponding judicial procedure. According to non-governmental sources, the Federal List of Extremist Materials has in recent years led to the adoption, in the Russian Federation, of disproportionate anti ‑ extremist measures. Information on how this list is composed and amended would be necessary for the Commission to comment fully ...",

It recalls that, in its recent recommendation devoted to the fight against extremism, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed its concern over the challenge of fighting extremism and its most recent forms and encouraged the member States of the Council of Europe to take resolute action in this field, ‘ while ensuring the strictest respect for human rights and the rule of law ’.",
                "74. However, the manner in which this aim is pursued in the Extremism Law is problematic. In the Commission ’ s view, the Extremism Law, on account of its broad and imprecise wording, particularly insofar as the ‘ basic notions ’ defined by the Law - such as the definition of ‘ extremism ’, ‘ extremist actions ’, ‘ extremist organisations ’ or ‘ extremist materials ’ – are concerned, gives too wide discretion in its interpretation and application, thus leading to arbitrariness.",
                "75. In the view of the Venice Commission, the activities defined by the Law as extremist and enabling the authorities to issue preventive and corrective measures do not all contain an element of violence and are not all defined with sufficient precision to allow an individual to regulate his or her conduct or the activities of an organisation so as to avoid the application of such measures. Where definitions are lacking the necessary precision, a law such as the Extremism Law dealing with very sensitive rights and carrying potential dangers to individuals and NGOs can be interpreted in harmful ways ...",
                "77. The Venice Commission recalls that it is of crucial importance that, in a law such as the Extremism Law, which has the capacity of imposing severe restrictions on fundamental freedoms, a consistent and proportionate approach that avoids all arbitrariness be taken. As such, the Extremism Law has the capacity of imposing disproportionate restrictions of fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (in particular Articles 6, 9, 10 and 11) and infringe the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. In the light of the above comments, the Venice Commission recommends that this fundamental shortcoming be addressed in relation to each of the definitions and instruments provided by the Law in order to bring them in line with the European Convention on Human Rights ... ”",

The Government argued that the report by specialists from the Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University had been submitted by the prosecutor, who had been a party to the proceedings in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, and had therefore been admissible as evidence.

Rules in this sphere could vary from one country to another in accordance with national traditions and the requirements imposed by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others and to maintain public order. Accordingly, the choice of the extent and form such regulations took had to be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it depended on the specific domestic context. They referred in this context to Leyla Şahin v. Turkey ( [GC], no. 44774/98, §§ 106-09, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI). The Government interpreted the cases of Cha ’ are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France ( [GC], no. 27417/95, § 84, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII) and Wingrove v. the United Kingdom (25 November 1996, § 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V) to mean that where questions concerning the relationship between State and religions were at stake, on which opinion in a democratic society might differ widely, the role of the national decision-making body had to be given special importance. Given that Said Nursi ’ s books incited religious discord and proclaimed religious superiority and could therefore provoke serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences, the ban on their publication and dissemination had pursued the aims of protecting territorial integrity and public safety in Russia, public order and the rights of others. Moreover, it had been necessary in a democratic society, taking into account the tense ethnic situation in the country and the possible negative impact of those books on non-religious citizens."

They also argued that the present case was similar to the cases of Sürek v. Turkey (no. 3) ([GC], no. 24735/94, 8 July 1999) and Medya FM Reha Radyo ve İletişim Hizmetleri A.Ş v.

The Act did not contain a legal definition of key elements of the term “extremist activity”. In particular, it did not explain what was meant by “discord” or “propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency ” (they relied in that connection on the Opinion by the Venice Commission, see paragraph 56 above). Those terms could have different meanings and the absence of a clear definition in law or in judicial practice could lead to arbitrary interpretations and abuse. In the present case, the texts had been interpreted by linguists and psychologists from the standpoints of those academic disciplines, rather than on the basis of any legal interpretation established by law or judicial practice. Those expert or specialist opinions were the sole basis for the ensuing judicial decisions."

In the applicants ’ opinion, Said Nursi ’ s books did not contain any expressions inciting religious discord, either explicitly or implicitly. The Government had not produced any proof that Said Nursi ’ s books had ever provoked “serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences” (see paragraph 68 above) or ever caused any other threat to public order. Their statement that there was such a risk was purely hypothetical and was not based on any facts. They had not therefore justified the “necessity in a democratic society” of banning the books."

The recognised authorities on Islam, such as a co-president of the Council of Mufti of Russia, had told the courts that Said Nursi was a world - renowned Muslim scholar whose texts formed an integral part of the official teachings of Islam and did not contain any extremist statements.

It argued that under domestic law, a specialists ’ report could not serve as evidence in civil proceedings; only expert reports could do so. Specialists could only give oral or written opinions to the judge in the sphere of their competence (see paragraphs 48 and 50 above). The specialists in the case at hand had not explained how they had reached the finding that the text at issue incited religious discord. They had not cited a single passage from the book that incited hatred or called for violence or indeed for any actions against non-believers or any other persons. The report had not mentioned the use of any scientific methodology (such as focus-group tests or others) to assess the book ’ s impact on readers ’ minds.

The Court reiterates that such interference will infringe the Convention unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10. It must therefore be determined whether it was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and was “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve those aims."

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances.

The Court has frequently emphasised that States have responsibility for ensuring, neutrally and impartially, the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs. Their role is to help maintain public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society, particularly between opposing groups.

Thus, the Court has held that it may be considered necessary in certain democratic societies to sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred based on intolerance (including religious intolerance), provided that any “formalities”, “conditions”, “restrictions” or “penalties” imposed are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Gündüz v. Turkey, no. 35071/97, § 40, ECHR 2003 ‑ XI; Nur Radyo Ve Televizyon Yayıncılığı A.Ş. v. Turkey, no. 6587/03, § 28, 27 November 2007; and Kutlular, cited above, § 47). For example, it has been particularly sensitive towards sweeping statements attacking or casting in a negative light entire ethnic, religious or other groups, finding that such statements were in contradiction with the Convention ’ s underlying values, notably tolerance, social peace and non-discrimination (see Perinçek, cited above, § 206 ), and the authorities cited therein ). It has also stressed that statements expressing deep-seated and irrational hatred towards identified persons may be interpreted as likely to encourage violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Dilipak v. Turkey, no. 29680/05, § 62, 15 September 2015, with further references). Inciting hatred does not therefore necessarily involve an explicit call for an act of violence, or other criminal acts. Attacks on persons committed by insulting, holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population can be sufficient for the authorities to favour combating xenophobic or otherwise discriminatory speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner (see Dmitriyevskiy v. Russia, no. 42168/06, § 99, 3 October 2017, with further references )."

A certain margin of appreciation is generally available to the Contracting States when regulating freedom of expression in relation to matters liable to offend intimate personal convictions within the sphere of religion or to incite religious hatred or intolerance. There is no uniform European conception of the requirements of “ the protection of the rights of others ” in relation to attacks on religious convictions. What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever - growing array of faiths and denominations. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the “ necessity ” of a “ restriction ” intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see Otto ‑ Preminger-Institut, cited above, § 50; Wingrove, cited above, § 58; and Murphy, cited above, § 67 )."

Indeed, such supervision can be considered to be all the more necessary given the rather open-ended notion of respect for the religious beliefs of others and the risks of excessive interference with freedom of expression under the guise of action taken against allegedly offensive material ( see Murphy, cited above, § 68 ). Cases which involve prior restraint call for special scrutiny by the Court (see Wingrove, cited above, § 58 )."

In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Mouvement raëlien suisse v.

Said Nursi wrote his Risale-I Nur Collection in the first half of the 20 th century. It has since been translated into about fifty languages and is available in many countries, both on paper and on the Internet. The above facts are relevant for the assessment of whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” (see Akdaş v. Turkey, no. 41056/04, § 29, 16 February 2010). It is also relevant that the editions of the Russian translation at issue in the present case first became available in Russia in 200 0; it was not until 2007 that the collection was banned ( see Aydın Tatlav v.

It will therefore examine whether the domestic courts adduced relevant and sufficient reasons – relating in particular to the wording of the Russian editions at issue, the context in which they were published and their potential to lead to harmful consequences in Russia – to justify banning the books, which were widely available in many countries and had seemingly never before caused any interreligious tensions."

Moreover, the relevant expert examinations went far beyond resolving merely language or psychology issues. Rather than restricting themselves to defining the meaning of particular words and expressions or explaining their potential psychological impact, they provided in essence a legal qualification of the texts.

Indeed, the District Court summarily rejected all evidence submitted by them, including the opinions of Muslim authorities and Islamic studies scholars who explained the historical context in which the books had been written, their place in the body of Islamic religious literature, in particular the fact that they belonged to moderate rather than radical Islam, their importance for the Russian Muslim community and their general message of tolerance, interreligious cooperation and opposition to violence (see paragraphs 11 - 13, 17 and 23 above). Although the above facts were plainly relevant for the assessment of whether banning the books was justified, the Koptevskiy District Court did not make any meaningful analysis of that material, holding that it should be disregarded because the persons cited by the applicants were not linguists or psychologists and were therefore not competent to establish the meaning of the contested texts. The Court notes that it has previously found a violation of Article 10 of the Convention on account of a breach of equality of arms in freedom ‑ of ‑ expression cases, in particular in situations where the applicants had been hindered in adducing evidence in support of their position (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, § 48, Series A no. 236, and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 95, ECHR 2005-II) or where the domestic courts had dismissed all the arguments in the applicant ’ s defence in a summary manner, thereby stripping him of the procedural protection that he had been entitled to enjoy by virtue of his rights under Article 10 of the Convention (see Dmitriyevskiy, cited above, § 116).
