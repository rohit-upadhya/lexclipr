A failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 § 1 (a) of the Convention ( Timurtaş v.

Before the Delegates, the Government initially stated that they did not have the operations' records to hand, that they were confidential and therefore difficult to obtain. On the final day of evidence, the Delegates recalled their request for these records. The Government was then reminded of the outstanding records by letters of 28 October 1999 and 13 March 2000.

Consequently, the additional delay after these specific requests for the records has not been convincingly explained by the Government's brief reference to clerical errors and communication problems. In addition, the document is rather summary, amounting as it does to a table of one page to describe 30 military operations in the Diyarbakır province between 2 and 31 May 1994. Apart from abbreviated references to the units involved, no details are given as to how many troops were involved, where they were billeted or about the purpose or result of the operations.

While on the first day of the taking of evidence by the Delegates (October 1999) the Government indicated that it had no information, on the following day they confirmed that “the responsible officer who carried out the operation in the area is General Yavuz Ertürk”. The Government added, during the oral hearing before the Court in May 2001, that General Ertürk was the commander of the Bolu regiment and that he had not been called before the Delegates because he had already given evidence to Delegates in another case ( Akdeniz and Others v.

Finally, it was for the Commission, as it is for this Court, to decide whether and to what extent a witness is relevant for its assessment of facts.

In contrast, the Court considers that the motivation of Ahmet Potaş (paragraphs 174-181 above) and his superior, Ali Ergülmez (paragraphs 182-192 above), while giving evidence, was transparently exculpatory. Although Ahmet Potaş professed to remember little of the events in question, the Court finds it difficult to believe that he could recall absolutely nothing of relevance. On the one hand, he confirmed that he was the commander in a local gendarme station (Zeyrek) to which Çağlayan village was attached, that he knew Çağlayan village well, that he got on well with the villagers and that he knew the muhtar of each village personally. On the other hand, he said that he could not remember significant events or matters: whether there had been a PKK problem in Çağlayan, whether Çağlayan had been burnt down by the security forces, whether complaints had been made about its burning, whether complaints had been made directly to him by the muhtar about three villagers having been detained by the security forces or whether he had gone to Çağlayan after it had been burned down.

Consistently, the gendarme witnesses were clear that they exercised no control whatsoever over the activities of the military at the school or elsewhere.

                "(...) where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which an issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (...). In the same vein, Article 5 imposes an obligation on the State to account for the whereabouts of any person taken into detention and who has thus been placed under the control of the authorities (...). Whether the failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee's fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on concrete elements, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (...).",
                "In this respect the period of time which has elapsed since the person was placed in detention, although not decisive in itself, is a relevant factor to be taken into account. It must be accepted that the more time goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may therefore to some extent affect the weight to be attached to other elements of circumstantial evidence before it can be concluded that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. In this respect the Court considers that this situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere irregular detention in violation of Article 5. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life as afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention (...).”"

Turkey (judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, § 108), in which the Court held that there were insufficient persuasive indications that the applicant's son had met his death in detention. Üzeyir Kurt was last seen surrounded by soldiers in his own village, whereas the Orhans were last seen being taken away to an unidentified place of detention by authorities for whom the State is responsible. There were, in addition, few elements identifying Üzeyir Kurt as a person under suspicion by the authorities: in the present case, there is some direct evidence (from Adnan Orhan, see paragraphs 41 and 154 above) that the Orhans were wanted by the authorities. In the general context of the situation in south-east Turkey in 1994, it can by no means be excluded that an unacknowledged detention of such persons would be life-threatening ( Timurtaş v. Turkey, cited above, § 85 and the Çiçek v. Turkey, cited above, § 146). It is to be recalled that the Court has held in earlier judgments that defects undermining the effectiveness of criminal law protection in the south-east during the period relevant also to this case, permitted or fostered a lack of accountability of members of the security forces for their actions ( Cemil Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 22492/93, § 75, ECHR 2000, and Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey, no. 22535/93, § 98, ECHR 2000). This lack of accountability is particularly marked in the present context, the evidence being that the gendarmes knew little of the detail of the military's activities on operation and that they exercised no control over the military and their operational activities."

For the above reasons, and taking into account that no information has come to light concerning the whereabouts of the Orhans for almost 8 years, the Court is satisfied that the Orhans must be presumed dead following an unacknowledged detention by the security forces. Consequently, the responsibility of the respondent State for their death is engaged. Noting that the authorities have not provided any explanation as to what occurred following the Orhans' apprehension, and that they do not rely on any ground of justification in respect of any use of lethal force by their agents, it follows that liability for their death is attributable to the respondent Government ( Timurtas, § 86, and Çiçek, at § 147, both judgments cited above)."

The Court recalls that the obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State's general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, also requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see, mutatis mutandis, the McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment, cited above, § 161, and the Kaya v. Turkey judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, § 105). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v.

The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (for example, the Kaya v. Turkey judgment, cited above, § 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible ( Öğur v. Turkey, cited above, § 88). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eye witness testimony (see, concerning witnesses, for example, Tanrıkulu v. Turkey, cited above, § 109). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard."

It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation.

When the Lice Boarding School query was redirected in May 1995 to the Lice District Gendarme Command, the latter simply responded that there was no reference to the Orhans in the gendarme custody records. The gathering of this information, together with the taking of the briefest of statements of the applicant (8 June 1994, 22 August 1994 and 23 September 1994), of the muhtar and of Hasan Sumer, took over one year.

No statements were taken from the many villagers from Deveboyu or Gümüşsuyu hamlets who directly witnessed the events alleged by the applicant.

Ümit Şenocak, the deputy commander in Kulp District Gendarme Command, signed a letter dated 22 July 1994 confirming that the Orhans had not been detained by his command and promising that the search for the Orhans would continue. He confirmed in his oral evidence that he probably did not complete the investigation to which his letter referred but that it was likely his subordinates did so and that they drafted the letter on his behalf. He did not recall having further investigated. It is not surprising therefore that, when Ümit Şenocak moved on from Kulp in November 1994, Kulp District Gendarme station did not continue the investigation as undertaken in his letter of July 1994. Indeed the next involvement of this gendarme station was the appointment, it appears in 1995, of Ali Ergülmez as Adjudicator who was subsequently transferred elsewhere leaving the entire investigation file in abeyance until 1997 when the newly appointed Adjudicator took up the matter."

This insistence on the protection of the individual against any abuse of power is illustrated by the fact that Article 5 § 1 circumscribes the circumstances in which individuals may be lawfully deprived of their liberty, it being stressed that these circumstances must be given a narrow interpretation having regard to the fact that they constitute exceptions to a most basic guarantee of individual freedom (...)”."

The requirements of Article 5 §§ 3 and 4 with their emphasis on promptitude and judicial control assume particular importance in this context. Prompt judicial intervention may lead to the detection and prevention of life-threatening measures or serious ill-treatment which violate the fundamental guarantees contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (...). What is at stake is both the protection of the physical liberty of individuals as well as their personal security in a context which, in the absence of safeguards, could result in a subversion of the rule of law and place detainees beyond the reach of the most rudimentary forms of legal protection.”"

This fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing since it enables those responsible for the act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of the detainee. In the view of the Court, the absence of data recording such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (above-cited judgments of Timurtaş, § 105, Çakıcı, § 105, and Çiçek, § 165)."

Neither the ombudsperson’s office nor monitoring commissions are vested with the authority to issue legally binding decisions. Their task is to collect information and to highlight general issues concerning human-rights compliance in places of detention (see M.S. v. Russia, § 84, and Ananyev and Others, §§ 105-06, both cited above). Moreover, as the Ombudsman observed in his annual report, public monitoring commissions did not have the mandate to control the conditions obtaining in conveyances in which detainees were transported (see paragraph 75 above)."

The Court has previously found that prosecutors supervising remand prisons play an important role in securing appropriate conditions of detention (see Ananyev and Others, § 104, and Dirdizov, § 76, both cited above). Railways fall under the jurisdiction of transport prosecutors who are tasked with supervising the application of laws and ensuring respect for human rights and freedoms. However, as the Court has observed, infringement reports or orders issued by a prosecutor are primarily matters between the supervising authority and the supervised body and are not geared towards providing preventive or compensatory redress to the aggrieved individual. There is no legal requirement compelling the prosecutor to hear the complainant or ensure his or her effective participation in the ensuing proceedings. The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint (ibid.). Furthermore, it does not appear that prisoners in transit have a way of reaching out to a transport prosecutor to secure his or her expeditious intervention if the conditions of transport fall foul of legal requirements or amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. In case of Mr Rakov, the prosecutor’s reply came almost two months after the events (see paragraph 40 above)."

Lastly, turning to the effectiveness of judicial remedies, the Court observes that, however diligently the proceedings before courts are conducted, they would normally conclude too late to be able to put an end to a situation involving an ongoing violation. Unlike the conditions in a remand prison or penal facility which the prisoner endures for months or years, transfers take a much shorter time, in the range of days or weeks. Nevertheless, the fact that the courts can take cognisance of the merits of the complaint even after the end of a transfer, establish the facts and make redress tailored to the nature of the violation makes the judicial remedy prima facie accessible and capable, at least in theory, of affording appropriate compensatory redress."

                "152. Firstly, the provisions of the Civil Code on tort liability impose special rules on compensation for damage caused by State authorities and officials. They require the claimant to show that the damage was caused through an unlawful action or omission on the part of the specific State authority or official. This requirement establishes an unattainable burden of proof in cases, such as the present one, in which every individual aspect of the conditions complied with domestic regulations, yet their cumulative effect was such as to constitute inhuman treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 141 above). It was therefore materially impossible to hold any individual authority or official responsible for such conditions, let alone to demonstrate any wrongful conduct on their part."

                "153. Secondly, the Court has criticised the Russian courts’ approach as unduly formalistic, based as it is on the requirement of formal unlawfulness of the authorities’ actions. The judicial decisions that the applicants made available in the present case highlight the shortcomings of that formalistic approach (see paragraphs 71 to 74 above). In the case of the applicant Mr Vasilyev, the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic overruled the first ‑ instance court’s finding of formal compatibility with the regulations and carried out a cumulative assessment of the conditions of transport, applying the criteria which the Court had developed in its case-law. That judgment, however, did not withstand a review before the Presidium of the same court, which reverted to the established standard of formal compliance with the applicable regulations. The subsequent decisions in Mr Vasilyev’s cases and many others followed that line of reasoning. It is a matter of particular concern that the Supreme Court described actual bodily injury as a required element of inhuman and degrading treatment and also appeared to suggest that suffering caused by the conditions of transport was conducive to the rehabilitation of offenders (see paragraph 74 above)."

A third element undermining the effectiveness of judicial remedies which is specific to the present case is the accessibility of the regulatory framework establishing normative conditions of transport. The Conveyance Instruction, which is the main document laying down the basic requirements for transport arrangements, has been classified “for service use only” and as such was not accessible to prisoners claiming a breach of their rights. The courts hearing Mr Rakov’s claim did not address that aspect of his submissions on appeal (see paragraphs 59 and 64 above)."

It recommended, as an immediate measure, that the national authorities take steps, in particular, to reduce significantly the maximum number of prisoners per compartment in railway carriages: 3.5 sq. m compartments should never contain more than six persons, and 2 sq. m compartments never more than three persons (Ukraine: Visit 2000, CPT/Inf (2002) 23).

Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000-XI). However, the Government’s declarations by which they sought to settle these cases did not contain any undertaking to address the crucial Convention issue under the Convention which continues to affect hundreds of prisoners in Russia.

Acceptance of the Government’s request to strike the present applications out of the Court’s list would leave the current situation unchanged, without any guarantee that a genuine solution would be found in the near future (compare Gerasimov and Others, cited above, § 138).

The principles governing the evidentiary standards and the distribution of burden of proof in such cases, which emphasise in particular the respondent Government’s role in producing such documentary evidence as is in their possession, are set out in Ananyev and Others (cited above, §§ 121-25)."

That is so because the Court is called upon to adjudicate individual cases on the basis of their specific facts, whereas the CPT and national authorities develop standards of general application that seek to forestall similar violations.

Starting with the case of Khudoyorov (cited above, §§ 117-19), it has found a violation of Article 3 in many cases in which the applicants were transported in extremely cramped conditions. The applicants had at their disposal less than 0.5 square metres of floor space, with some of them having as little as 0.25 square metres (see, among others, Yakovenko v. Ukraine, no. 15825/06, §§ 107-09, 25 October 2007; Vlasov v. Russia, no. 78146/01, §§ 92-99, 12 June 2008; Starokadomskiy v.

Russia (no. 2), no. 14248/05, § 133, 16 December 2010).

Whether such cramped conditions result from an excessive number of detainees being transported together or from the restrictive design of compartments is immaterial for the Court’s analysis, which is focused on the objective conditions of transfer as they were and their effect on the applicants, rather than on their causes. The low height of the ceiling, especially of single-prisoner cubicles, which forces prisoners to stoop, may exacerbate physical suffering and fatigue. Inadequate protection from outside temperatures, when prisoner cells are not sufficiently heated or ventilated, will constitute an aggravating factor (see the case-law cited in paragraph 118 above)."

There is no indication that train compartments had been filled beyond their normative capacity, with the exception of Mr Vasilyev’s compartment on the way to Yekaterinburg, which had accommodated thirteen people. However, formal compliance with domestic regulations is not decisive for the Court’s assessment of an alleged violation of Article 3. What is important is that each journey involved at least one overnight ride, whereas only six sleeping places were available in the large compartments and three in the small ones (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). Prisoners outnumbered the available sleeping places sometimes by a factor of two, and the sixty-centimetre bunks were too narrow to accommodate more than one person under normal conditions. The “bridge” half-bunk did not help in the matter of insufficient sleeping places as it was too short for the average person.

That requirement pursued the legitimate aims of preventing security incidents, inter-prisoner violence and sexual harassment. However, owing to the gender imbalance among the general prison population in which men significantly outnumber women, multi-prisoner cells are routinely allocated to male prisoners, while female prisoners are relegated to cramped metal cubicles for the duration of transfers.

Afflicted with diabetes, she had a corpulent body. Her condition called for a generous allocation of seating space and good access to ventilation, so as to make her conditions of transfer more bearable. However, the authorities in charge of the transfer did not consider her special needs. To make matters worse, they put another woman together with her for the duration of each journey. The Court concedes that in doing so, they were following to the letter the regulations requiring separation of the sexes, and that is what the officials relied on to justify their conduct (see paragraph 35 above). The Court cannot accept it, however, as justification for putting Ms Kostromina in a situation of extreme physical hardship.

One specific feature of the cell design stands out. The cell was assembled from metal sheets that formed a fully enclosed cubicle with air holes in the door (see paragraph 17 above). This design guaranteed complete isolation of the prisoner from the non-secure area of the van. However, it also had the effect of thermally insulating the cell, blocking the flow of heat from the heater located in the central aisle into the cubicle. There was no heating inside the cell and, as the rear panel was attached directly to the outer panel of the van, the cold was transferred from the outside.

The subsequent decisions in Mr Vasilyev’s cases and many others followed that line of reasoning. It is a matter of particular concern that the Supreme Court described actual bodily injury as a required element of inhuman and degrading treatment and also appeared to suggest that suffering caused by the conditions of transport was conducive to the rehabilitation of offenders (see paragraph 74 above)."

A new model of prisoner railway carriage, no. 61-4495, had been developed and launched in 2015. It was equipped with air conditioning, chemical toilets, and enhanced lighting and video-surveillance systems. In 2016, the Ministry of the Interior received a first shipment of twenty-six such railway carriages and put them into operation.

The Conveyance Instruction made no provision for distributing bed linen or hot water, or for securing adequate access to a toilet. Prisoners were not allowed access to the toilet in old-style Soviet prisoner carriages while they were stationary because human waste was discharged directly onto the railway tracks. The replacement of twenty ‑ six carriages in 2016 to which the Government had referred was part of an ongoing renewal of rolling stock, but new carriages had been built to the same obsolete standards as the old ones. As regards prison vans, the domestic standards defining space allocation in single and multi-prisoner cells were likewise exceedingly restrictive, providing no more than 0.3 square metres per person.

A number of provisions of the Conveyance Instruction, such as the excessively high occupancy limits, negatively affected the conditions of prisoners’ transfers and failed to adequately protect their rights in line with international standards.

Of those, 540 applications were lodged in 2018. The above numbers, taken on their own, are indicative of the existence of a recurrent structural problem (see Varga and Others v.

As the Court observed with concern, the violations found were neither prompted by an isolated incident, nor attributable to a particular turn of events in those cases, but stemmed chiefly from an unwavering application of the domestic normative framework (see paragraph 141 above). Given the vastness of the Russian prison network in which prisoners are frequently transported over long distances (see paragraphs 7 and 82 above), the problem has thus affected, and has remained capable of affecting, a large number of individuals throughout Russia (compare Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 185)."

Thus, the Moscow capital region has six penal facilities for a combined population of 22,000,000, while the Komi Republic has twice as many for a population of 900,000. Article 73 of the Code on the Execution of Sentences establishes a general rule on geographical distribution of prisoners, according to which prisoners should be allocated to penal facilities where they had lived or where they had been convicted, save in “exceptional cases” (see Polyakova and Others, cited above, § 94). The spirit and the objective of Article 73 was to preserve prisoners’ social and family ties (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, § 850, 25 July 2013)."

Unless mandated by compelling security considerations, the use of single-prisoner stakan -type cubicles should be avoided. Elements that impede prisoners from standing up, such as bridge bunks in large compartments of prisoner railway carriages, will need to be uninstalled.

The need for such remedies is all the more pressing as large numbers of people affected by violations of a fundamental Convention right have no other choice but to seek relief through time-consuming international litigation before the Court. This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which is prominent in the Convention system (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 211).

However, the reservations which the Court has expressed in relation to judicial proceedings in general also apply to the proceedings under the Code of Administrative Procedure. In particular, it is not certain that the new type of proceedings has equipped the Russian courts with appropriate legal tools allowing them to consider the problem transcending an individual complaint and effectively deal with situations of concurrent violations of prisoners’ rights resulting from the application of an exceedingly restrictive regulatory framework (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 219)."

In particular, monetary compensation should be accessible to any current or former inmate who has suffered inhuman or degrading treatment and has made an application to this effect. A finding that the conditions fell short of the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention will give rise to a strong presumption that they have caused non-pecuniary damage to the aggrieved person, and the level of compensation awarded for non-pecuniary damage must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (ibid., §§ 228-30, and see, in particular, on the award that can be considered acceptable, Domján, cited above, §§ 27-28). In the particular context of the present case, the Court reiterates that domestic courts should be able to appreciate that, even in a situation where every individual aspect of the conditions of transport complied with the domestic regulations, their cumulative effect could have been such as to constitute inhuman or degrading treatment.",

The applicant asserted that on each occasion payment was made by the client to M., who transferred a share of the money to S.’s bank account in the apparent belief that he would pass it on to her.

At the time of the conduct alleged by the applicant there were a number of offences in English law which criminalised the essential aspects of slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour. These included false imprisonment, for which the maximum sentence was life imprisonment; kidnapping, for which the maximum sentence was also life imprisonment; grievous bodily harm, which carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment; assault, battery and causing physical or psychiatric harm, the more serious offences of which carried a maximum sentence of five years’ imprisonment; blackmail, which carried a maximum sentence of fourteen years’ imprisonment; harassment, which carried a maximum sentence of five years’ imprisonment; and a number of employment-related offences, such as those relating to the national minimum wage and working time limits."

A witness provided a statement indicating that the applicant had agreed that her wages should be paid to S. and that she did not complain about this arrangement for over three years. On reviewing the evidence, the police concluded that it was not sufficient to establish that the applicant had been the victim of conduct prohibited by Article 4 of the Convention.

Moreover, the Commission did not consider section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 to be of assistance because it merely reproduced the text of the Convention without explaining it in light of present day conditions. There was therefore a risk that the new statute would not result either in clear deterrence or effective prosecutions, and would not improve the failures in investigation."

Turkey, no. 22535/93, § 115, ECHR 2000-III). In order for a positive obligation to take operational measures to arise in the circumstances of a particular case, it must be demonstrated that the State authorities were aware, or ought to have been aware that an identified individual had been, or was at real and immediate risk of being subjected to such treatment. In the case of an answer in the affirmative, there will be a violation of Article 4 of the Convention where the authorities fail to take appropriate measures within the scope of their powers to remove the individual from that situation or risk (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, §§116 to 117; and Mahmut Kaya, cited above, §§ 115 to 116)."

For an investigation to be effective, it must be independent from those implicated in the events. It must also be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of individuals responsible, an obligation not of result but of means. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in all cases but where the possibility of removing the individual from the harmful situation is available, the investigation must be undertaken as a matter of urgency. The victim or the next-of-kin must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests (see, mutatis mutandis, Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, §§ 70 to 73).",

The Court observes that in Rantsev, in the context of trafficking, it held that in order for an obligation to investigate to have arisen, the circumstances must have given rise to a “credible suspicion” that the applicant had been trafficked. Likewise, it considers that for an obligation to have arisen in the present case, it must be satisfied that the applicant’s complaints to the domestic authorities gave rise to a credible suspicion that she had been held in domestic servitude."

The Court notes that the authorities were first made aware of the applicant’s claim to have been kept in conditions amounting to domestic servitude after she collapsed at the HSBC bank in Kilburn in August 2006. On 21 September 2006 she made an application for asylum, in the course of which she complained, inter alia, that she had been forced to work for the K family without remuneration. Furthermore, in April 2007 the applicant’s solicitor wrote to the police and asked that they investigate her case. She was interviewed by the Human Trafficking Team on 21 June 2007 and gave a detailed statement in which she set out her domestic servitude complaints. The Court does not consider that the applicant’s complaints concerning her treatment by S. and M. were inherently implausible. Indeed, it notes that the circumstances which she described were remarkably similar to the facts of the Siliadin case, the only notable differences being that the applicant was older than the applicant in Siliadin and that it was an agent – and not her “employers” – who she claimed were responsible for the treatment contrary to Article 4 of the Convention. Although the Government have submitted that the applicant’s account was not in fact credible, the Court observes that this was a conclusion reached following further investigation of her complaints. Indeed, the fact that the domestic authorities conducted any investigation into the applicant’s complaints strongly indicates that, at least on their face, they were not inherently implausible. Consequently, the Court considers that the applicant’s complaints did give rise to a credible suspicion that she had been held in conditions of domestic servitude, which in turn placed the domestic authorities under an obligation to investigate those complaints."

It is not in dispute that at the time the applicant alleged that she was subjected to treatment falling within the scope of Article 4 of the Convention, such conduct was not specifically criminalised under domestic law. There were, however, a number of criminal offences which criminalised certain aspects of slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour. In particular, the Government directed the Court’s attention to the offences of trafficking, false imprisonment, kidnapping, grievous bodily harm, assault, battery, blackmail and harassment."

In Siliadin, the Court found that the increasingly high standard being required in the area of the protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspondingly and inevitably required greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fundamental values of democratic societies. ( Siliadin v. France, cited above, § 148). In that case, the Court found that Articles 2250-13 and 225-14 of the French Criminal Code, which concerned exploitation through labour and subjection to working and living conditions incompatible with human dignity, were not sufficiently specific and were too restrictive to protect the applicant’s rights under Article 4 of the Convention."

Bulgaria, no. 39272/98, § 179, ECHR 2003 ‑ XII). Instead of enabling the authorities to investigate and penalise such treatment, the authorities were limited to investigating and penalising criminal offences which often – but do not necessarily – accompany the offences of slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour. Victims of such treatment who were not also victims of one of these related offences were left without any remedy."

Nevertheless, the Government have submitted that the reason no action was taken following investigation of the applicant’s complaints was not the absence of appropriate legislation but rather the absence of evidence to support the facts alleged by her. In short, the domestic authorities simply did not believe the applicant’s account. The Court must therefore consider whether the lack of specific legislation criminalising domestic servitude prevented the domestic authorities from properly investigating the applicant’s complaints, or whether her complaints were properly investigated but no evidence was found to support them. In carrying out this assessment, the Court reiterates that it is not its task to replace the domestic authorities in the assessment of the facts of the case."

                "79. The Court recalls that the investigation into the applicant’s complaints was commenced by the Metropolitan Police Human Trafficking Team, a police unit specialising in the investigation of human trafficking offences. On 26 September 2007 they informed the applicant’s solicitor that there was “no evidence of trafficking for domestic servitude”. Likewise, on 5 September 2008 they noted that there was “no evidence to substantiate the applicant’s allegation that she had been trafficked into the United Kingdom”. She had been well looked after by the K family, although there had been a dispute over money and it may have been that “her cousin kept more than he should have done”. Again, on 18 September 2008 the police stated that “it was decided that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegation of trafficking and thus further investigation was not warranted” and on 25 February 2009 they noted that “there is no evidence that would support exploitation of any kind”. Later, on 27 March 2009, the police recorded that “there is no evidence to show that this female is/was a victim of slavery or forced labour”. Finally, on 12 August 2009 the police wrote to the applicant’s solicitor, indicating that her case did not appear to constitute an offence of trafficking for the purposes of exploitation and that they were “not aware of any specific offence of forced labour or servitude”."
            ],
            [
                "80. While the Court notes the credibility concerns voiced by the domestic authorities, it cannot but be concerned by the investigating officers’ heavy focus on the offence of trafficking for exploitation as set out in section 4 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc.) Act 2004. In particular, it observes that the investigation into the applicant’s complaints was carried out by a specialist trafficking unit and while investigators occasionally referred to slavery, forced labour and domestic servitude it is clear that at all times their focus was on the offence enshrined in section 4 of the 2004 Act. As indicated by the Aire Centre and the Equality and Human Rights Commission in their third party interventions, domestic servitude is a specific offence, distinct from trafficking and exploitation, which involves a complex set of dynamics, involving both overt and more subtle forms of coercion, to force compliance. A thorough investigation into complaints of such conduct therefore requires an understanding of the many subtle ways an individual can fall under the control of another. In the present case, the Court considers that due to the absence of a specific offence of domestic servitude, the domestic authorities were unable to give due weight to these factors. In particular, the Court is concerned by the fact that during the course of the investigation into the applicant’s complaints, no attempt appears to have been made to interview S. despite the gravity of the offence he was alleged to have committed (see, by way of comparison, M. and Others v. Italy and Bulgaria, no. 40020/03, §§ 104 - 107, 31 July 2012). For the Court, the lacuna in domestic law at the time may explain this omission, together with the fact that no apparent weight was attributed to the applicant’s allegations that her passport had been taken from her, that S. had not kept her wages for her as agreed, and that she was explicitly and implicitly threatened with denunciation to the immigration authorities, even though these factors were among those identified by the ILO as indicators of forced labour."

The effect of this Article is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (see Chahal v. United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, pp. 1869-70, § 145). The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint under the Convention (ibid., pp. 1870-71, §§ 150-51). Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \"effective\" in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see among other authorities Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2286, § 95 and Cobzaru v. Romania, no. 48254/99, § 80, 26 July 2007 ) ”."

The Act provided for five forms of compensation: (a) property of the same kind; (b) property of any other kind; (c) shares in State-owned companies; (d) the value of a State-owned property in the privatisation process, and (e) a sum of money corresponding to the value attributed to the property at the time of the decision (section 11). The Act instituted the State Committee for Property Restitution and Compensation ( Komiteti Shteteror per Kthimin dhe Kompensimin e Pronave ), composed of five members elected by Parliament. Its role was to decide on the lawfulness of district committees ’ decisions on restitution and compensation claims (sections 15 and 17).

It further observes that the dispute related to a right which was civil by its very nature, since it was a dispute between the State and the applicants as to the determination of the latter ’ s property rights under the Property Acts. Through the competent Commission ’ s decisions at issue, the State recognised that the applicants were entitled to receive compensation. Notwithstanding the fact that domestic law omitted to specify a time for their becoming final, the Court observes that, after more than twelve years, the merits of such decisions were not challenged before any court and, in law, nothing therefore prevented their immediate enforcement. Consequently, the Court will consider the rights thus generated to be final and enforceable. In addition the rights arising from such decisions and the subsequent enforcement proceedings were closely bound up with each other (the effectiveness of the former ultimately depended on the success of the latter)."

The effect of this Article is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (see Chahal v. United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, pp. 1869-70, § 145). The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint under the Convention (ibid., pp. 1870-71, §§ 150-51). Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \"effective\" in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see among other authorities Aksoy v.

In these circumstances, the Court considers the applicants ’ claim sufficiently established to qualify as an “asset” for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

In its review of domestic case-law, issued on 25 June 2009, the Supreme Court concluded that the requirement for a court to examine a criminal case only in respect of those accused who had been referred to it for examination, set out in Article 255 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 38 above), did not prohibit the court from examining whether the acts of third parties complied with the law, to the extent necessary for determining the criminal responsibility of the accused. However, a judgment could not include any phrases ( nuosprendyje negali būti formuluočių ) which established third parties ’ guilt in respect of criminal acts, except for individuals who had already been convicted or exempted from criminal responsibility.",

The Government emphasised that the judgments adopted against the co-suspects had not had a res judicata effect on the courts examining the case against the applicant, as demonstrated by the fact that investigative measures with regard to the applicant had been “intensively carried out” and that the applicant herself had submitted “numerous” requests to the Vilnius Regional Court regarding access to the case file and inclusion of new evidence – the Government provided the Court with a copy of one request submitted by the applicant on 17 September 2015 to include new evidence in the case file. The Government contended that in those proceedings the applicant could have challenged the facts underlying the judgments adopted against her co-suspects; however, she had not done that.

The Government also submitted that the applicant herself, together with her co-accused, had requested that the Vilnius Regional Court discontinue the proceedings against her as time-barred. However, domestic law allowed courts to continue examining the case after the expiry of the statute of limitations at the request of the accused, and in such situations the court could either adopt a judgment of acquittal or discontinue the proceedings if an acquittal was not possible (see paragraph 42 above). Accordingly, the applicant could have requested that the court continue the examination of her case. The Government argued that by failing to do so she had precluded the courts from “removing any doubts” with regard to the references to her guilt made in the judgments against her co-suspects."

On 14 October 2010 the Kaunas Regional Court, relying on Article 7 of the 1964 Civil Code (see paragraph 43 above), had acknowledged that there had been a breach of the claimant ’ s honour and dignity and awarded him approximately 2,900 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage from the police force. The Government stated that that decision had not been appealed against and had become final.",
                "- In the second case, the claimant had complained that his right to be presumed innocent had been breached by the courts which had refused his application to reopen the criminal proceedings against him; in those criminal proceedings the claimant had been acquitted of some of the charges against him and the case in respect of other charges had been discontinued because the relevant acts had been decriminalised. When refusing to reopen the criminal proceedings, the court had held, inter alia, that those proceedings had been opened “as a result of the claimant ’ s unlawful activities” and that they had been terminated on non-exonerative grounds. Relying on Article 6.272 of the 2001 Civil Code (see paragraph 45 above), the claimant had asked to be awarded compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage. On 23 December 2008 the Supreme Court had dismissed the claim, finding that the impugned court decision had merely restated the facts which had been established in the criminal proceedings against the claimant but had not declared him guilty of any criminal offences and had thus not breached his right to be presumed innocent."

In several cases it found remedies under civil law, offering the possibility of obtaining monetary compensation together with various other procedures for acknowledgment of or putting an end to the infringement of the presumption of innocence, to be effective within the meaning of the Convention (see Babjak and Others v.

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint under the Convention, but the remedy must in any event be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the State.

He added that the inmates concerned had eventually been punished by the administration of the prison for doing so, and the shields had been removed. He submitted that, furthermore, the toilet cubicle had been designed in such a manner that, in order to relieve themselves, detainees had had to step up onto a brick base approximately 40 or 50 cm high, with the result that they had had to look straight into the CCTV camera."

The first applicant confirmed that he had signed a written document to that effect, but argued that it had been a pure formality, as CCTV monitoring was used regardless of whether a detainee had signed such a document, or had refused to do so.

As regards the Government ’ s argument that the CCTV monitoring of the applicants ’ cells had been necessary to ensure their personal safety, the third applicant argued that the cases relied on by them (see paragraphs 74 - 75 below) were irrelevant to his situation, as he had never displayed any suicidal tendencies, and had never had any conflicts with any detainees. Moreover, the situation examined by the Court in the case of Buntov v. Russia (no. 27026/10, 5 June 2012), where the applicant had refused to take walks in the prison courtyard for fear of being attacked by other detainees, showed that CCTV camera monitoring could be useful in places to which all detainees had access, rather than in their cells.

A sufficient number of cameras had to be installed, in such a way as to avoid any blind zones.

They argued that video surveillance made it possible to monitor the conduct of a person under the State ’ s control, and to take necessary measures in case of emergency in order to prevent negative consequences. In that connection, they also relied on Recommendation Rec( 2003)23 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted on 9 October 2003 (see paragraph 56 above), which listed CCTV cameras as an additional security measure."

Whilst detention, like any other measure depriving a person of his or her liberty, entails various limitations of his or her rights and freedoms, that person does not forfeit his or her Convention rights merely because of his or her status as a detainee, including the rights guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention, so that restrictions on those rights must be justified in each case (see Khoroshenko v.

The law must thus be adequately accessible and foreseeable, that is, formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual – if need be with appropriate advice – to regulate his conduct. For domestic law to meet these requirements, it must afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness and accordingly indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see, among many other authorities, M.M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 24029/07, § 193, 13 November 2012 ). The Court must thus also be satisfied that there exist adequate and effective guarantees against abuse. This assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to permit, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law (see Benedik v.

The criterion of foreseeability cannot be interpreted as requiring that all detailed conditions and procedures governing the interference be laid down in the substantive law itself, and the requirements of “lawfulness” can be met if points which cannot be satisfactorily resolved on the basis of substantive law are set out in enactments of lower rank than statutes (ibid., §§ 88-89 and 93-94; Association Ekin v.

In that case, the contested measure had been applied in respect of a detainee held under an individual detention regime, charged with the murder of a well ‑ known politician. It had been based on detailed domestic regulations, which, in particular, had provided an exhaustive list of grounds for the application of such a measure and established an applicable procedure. In accordance with those regulations, the applicant ’ s placement under permanent video surveillance had been ordered by individualised and reasoned decisions of a competent official, corroborated with necessary medical documents attesting to the state of the applicant ’ s mental health and assessing the presence of suicidal tendencies in his behaviour.

The Court reiterates that, in accordance with its established case- law, the effective remedy required by Article 13 of the Convention is one where the domestic authority examining the case has to consider the substance of the Convention complaint. In cases involving Article 8 of the Convention, this means that the authority has to carry out a balancing exercise and examine whether the interference with the applicants ’ rights answered a pressing social need and was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued; that is, whether it amounted to a justifiable limitation of their rights (see Voynov, cited above, § 42). As regards the impugned measure in the present case, the relevant court decisions reveal that the national courts, including those of the highest level – the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court of Russia – generally considered permanent video surveillance to be a necessary element of convicts ’ punishment in the form of imprisonment as well as part of the mechanism which ensured the personal safety of detainees and staff of the relevant institutions, performance by detainees of their duties and obligations and observance of the regime of detention (see paragraphs 28, 43, 48 and 53 above). It is thus clear that the domestic law, as interpreted by the courts, does not presuppose any balancing exercise or enable an individual to obtain a judicial review of the proportionality of his or her placement under permanent video surveillance to the vested interests in securing his or her privacy."

Moldova, no. 35207/03, § 113, 13 September 2005; Greens and M.T. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 60041/08 and 60054/08, §§ 90-92, ECHR 2010 (extracts); and Szabó and Vissy v.

The gendarme captain conducted an on-site inspection, took statements from a total of fourteen witnesses, including inhabitants of nearby villages, gendarmes and fire fighters, and concluded that the applicant ’ s allegations were unfounded (see paragraphs 70-78 above).

In this connection, it points out that the investigating authorities visited the scene of the incident one and a half years after they had received the applicant ’ s criminal complaint (see paragraphs 32 and 35 above). The gendarme officer in charge of the investigation did not attempt to take statements from the inhabitants of the applicant ’ s village. He was content to rely on the testimonies of gendarmes, firemen and persons from neighbouring villages who all seemed to be village guards. Moreover, some of the witnesses denied the content and accuracy of their statements taken by the gendarme captain, alleging that they had been asked to sign some documents without being aware of their content (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above). In this context, the Court recalls that in a similar Turkish case it had already established a practice by the gendarmerie authorities of making witnesses sign blank sheets and filling them in themselves afterwards (see Yöyler, cited above, § 57). On that account, the Court had observed that statements taken from those witnesses had been of a stereotyped nature – giving the impression that they had been prepared by the investigating authorities – and that therefore no weight could be attached to them ( ibid., §§ 57 and 91). Likewise, in the instant case, the Court has serious doubts about the credibility of the investigation carried out by the gendarme captain, given the denial of some of the witnesses that they made such statements. In particular, it considers this practice incompatible with the notion of the investigation required by Article 13 of the Convention."

Turkey, no. 21593/93, § 80, Reports 1998-IV; Yöyler and İpek, both cited above, §§ 93 and 207 respectively).

Accordingly, it must primarily have regard to the general situation prevailing in the region at the time of the alleged events. In this connection it observes that at the relevant time violent confrontations had taken place between the security forces and members of the PKK in the state ‑ of ‑ emergency region of Turkey. This two ‑ fold violence resulting from the acts of the two parties to the conflict forced many people to flee their homes. Moreover, the national authorities had evicted the inhabitants of a number of settlements to ensure the safety of the population in the region ( Doğan and Others v.

However, it considers that such an exercise would not yield sufficient evidence capable of establishing the true circumstances of the case, given that the passage of a substantial period of time, almost eleven years in the instant case, makes it more difficult to find witnesses to give testimony and takes a toll on a witness ’ capacity to recall events in detail and with accuracy (see İpek, cited above, § 116). Accordingly, the Court must reach its decision on the basis of the available evidence submitted by the parties (see Pardo v. France, judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-B, p. 31, § 28, cited in Çaçan v. Turkey, no. 33646/96, § 61, 26 October 2004 ).

However, for the Court, the required evidentiary standard of proof for the purposes of the Convention is that of “beyond reasonable doubt”, and such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences, or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 161)."

In this connection, it is to be pointed out that the statements made by Masum Tosin, Hasan Kaya and Mevlude Uçar do not go beyond hearsay statements in view of their admission that they had left the village six or seven months before the fire in September 1994, and that they had heard about the burning down of the houses on 22 December 1995 from their acquaintances living in neighbouring villages (see paragraph 48 above)."

In this respect, it is noteworthy that the applicant failed to submit any expert opinion as to the nature of such destruction.

That said, the Court reiterates that, notwithstanding the terms of Article 13 read literally, the existence of an actual breach of another provision is not a prerequisite for the application of the Article ( Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, § 52 ). Accordingly, having regard to its findings in the admissibility decision and to its conclusion that the applicant ’ s allegations could not be discarded as being prima facie untenable (see paragraph 101 above), the Court considers that the applicant ’ s complaints raised arguable claims of violations of the Convention for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention ( see, mutatis mutandis, insofar as the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention was at stake, Mennitto v. Italy [GC], no. 33804/96, § 27, ECHR 2000 ‑ X)."

Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court notes that subsequent to the applicant ’ s criminal complaint to the authorities, an investigation was carried out by a gendarme officer, who was appointed as an investigator by the Commission on the Prosecution of Civil Servants attached to the Kocaköy Administrative Council (see paragraph 35 above). The gendarme captain conducted an on-site inspection, took statements from a total of fourteen witnesses, including inhabitants of nearby villages, gendarmes and fire fighters, and concluded that the applicant ’ s allegations were unfounded (see paragraphs 70-78 above). Relying on the findings and conclusion of the gendarme captain, the Administrative Council decided that no proceedings should be brought against the security forces and village guards."

            [
                "119. However, the Court notes that there were serious defects in the investigation conducted by the authorities. In this connection, it points out that the investigating authorities visited the scene of the incident one and a half years after they had received the applicant ’ s criminal complaint (see paragraphs 32 and 35 above). The gendarme officer in charge of the investigation did not attempt to take statements from the inhabitants of the applicant ’ s village. He was content to rely on the testimonies of gendarmes, firemen and persons from neighbouring villages who all seemed to be village guards. Moreover, some of the witnesses denied the content and accuracy of their statements taken by the gendarme captain, alleging that they had been asked to sign some documents without being aware of their content (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above). In this context, the Court recalls that in a similar Turkish case it had already established a practice by the gendarmerie authorities of making witnesses sign blank sheets and filling them in themselves afterwards (see Yöyler, cited above, § 57). On that account, the Court had observed that statements taken from those witnesses had been of a stereotyped nature – giving the impression that they had been prepared by the investigating authorities – and that therefore no weight could be attached to them ( ibid., §§ 57 and 91). Likewise, in the instant case, the Court has serious doubts about the credibility of the investigation carried out by the gendarme captain, given the denial of some of the witnesses that they made such statements. In particular, it considers this practice incompatible with the notion of the investigation required by Article 13 of the Convention."

In any event, the Court has already found in a number of cases that investigations carried out by local administrative councils could not be regarded as independent since they were composed of civil servants, who were hierarchically dependent on the governor, and an executive officer was linked to the security forces under investigation (see Güleç v. Turkey, no. 21593/93, § 80, Reports 1998-IV; Yöyler and İpek, both cited above, §§ 93 and 207 respectively). The appointment of a gendarme officer as the investigator in a case where gendarmes were alleged to have been the perpetrators of the destruction property, and serious doubts about the credibility of his investigation, does not permit the Court to reach a different conclusion in the present case."

But the fact that a search is based on a warrant issued by a judge does not necessarily amount to a sufficient safeguard. It also matters whether that prior judicial scrutiny was properly carried out (see Vinci Construction and GTM Génie Civil et Services, cited above, § 79 ): whether the judge duly examined the existence of a reasonable suspicion justifying the search, drawing up the search warrant in a way to keep its impact within reasonable bounds (see Iliya Stefanov, cited above, §§ 39-41, as well as Ernst and Others v.

Contrary to the applicants ’ arguments, the use of wiretap information does not in itself cast doubt on the existence of a reasonable suspicion. It is true that in Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above, §§ 85-86) the Court found, inter alia, that Bulgarian law, as it stood in 2007, did not contain enough safeguards that the authorities deploying covert surveillance measures, such as wiretaps, would faithfully reproduce the original data in the written record, or lay down proper procedures for preserving the integrity of such data. But, in the wake of that judgment, in 2008 the statute governing covert surveillance was amended in 2008 to bring it into line with the requirements of the Convention (see Lenev v. Bulgaria, no. 41452/07, § 80, 4 December 2012 ). The Court ’ s findings in Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above) are therefore of no relevance for the wiretap in this case, which was put in place in 2014. Moreover, the wiretap information was only part of the material used to justify the need for the searches (contrast, mutatis mutandis, C.G. and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 1365/07, § § 14 and 47-48, 24 April 2008)."

The specificity of the items subject to seizure varies from case to case depending on the nature of the offence being investigated (see Sher and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 5201/11, § 174, ECHR 2015 (extracts) ). In this case, the prosecuting authorities and the police, which had to act quickly after the arrest of the first applicant ’ s alleged accomplice in France (see paragraph 9 above), could not have known in advance what specific items could furnish proof of the forging of identity documents of which the first applicant was a suspect. Although it might have been feasible to frame the warrants in more precise terms, it was sufficient, in the circumstances, that their scope was limited by reference to the nature of the alleged offence, thus circumscribing sufficiently the discretion of the officers who carried out the searches, who only seized items which could be seen as potentially connected with the alleged offence ( see paragraphs 14 and 15 above )."

They requested that any award under this head, except the EUR 1,200 which they had already paid their legal representatives, be made directly payable to their legal representatives ’ firm, Ekimdzhiev and Partners. In support of their claim, the applicants submitted a fee agreement with their legal representatives, which said, inter alia, that the applicants had paid BGN 2,347 (EUR 1,200) up front; a time-sheet, which also said that the applicants had paid BGN 2,347 (EUR 1,200) up front; receipts showing that they had spent BGN 48.20 to post their original application; and a contract for translation services between their legal representatives and a translator."

Bulgaria, no. 5126/05, § 85, 2 October 2012 ). Also, the hourly rate charged by the applicants ’ legal representatives is higher than those charged in recent cases against Bulgaria of similar or greater complexity (see Dimitrov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 77938/11, § 185, 1 July 2014 (EUR 60 per hour); Myumyun v. Bulgaria, no. 67258/13, § 83, 3 November 2015 (EUR 100 per hour); and Ivanova and Cherkezov v. Bulgaria, no. 46577/15, § 86, 21 April 2016 (EUR 80 per hour) ). It is therefore not reasonable as to quantum. Having regard to these points and the material in its possession, the Court awards the applicants EUR 2,000, plus any tax that may be chargeable to them, in respect of their legal costs. Since the fee agreement and the time-sheet specified that the applicants had paid their legal representatives the equivalent of EUR 1,200, that sum is to be paid to the applicants, and the remainder of the award, EUR 800, to their legal representatives ’ firm, Ekimdzhiev and Partners. As regards the claim for other expenses, the applicants did not submit supporting documents other than a contract for translation services and postal receipts for documents sent to the Court.

In these circumstances, the applicant's grandparents had never become owners of the plot of land and the building they had received as compensation in 1953. That estate had thus remained State property until 1992 (acquisition through adverse possession against the State was not possible) and in 1992 the pre-nationalisation owners had acquired it back ex lege, under the general rule of the Restitution Law, its section 1, providing for the return of certain categories of State properties to their former owners."

The open-ended language of section 7 and its judicial interpretation had led to a situation where almost every transaction might at any time be nullified. A number of essential legal principles embedded in Bulgarian law such as the prohibition against retrospective application of the law and the provisions on acquisitive prescription for undisturbed possession in good faith had been misapplied."

When the Restitution Law had been passed, the burden it had placed on the post ‑ nationalisation owners had not been taken into account. Initially, in 1992, the Restitution Law had not provided for any compensation. Although in 1996 it had been amended and provided for full compensation in cash, the Government had never paid such compensation and in 2000 the Parliament had abolished the relevant provisions. The applicants stressed that that constituted a retroactive deprivation of possessions, as they must be deemed to have acquired pecuniary claims to full compensation in cash. After 2000, compensation by bonds had been inadequate and clearly insufficient in view of the time-consuming procedure and the fact that for several years the amount that could be obtained had not exceeded 15 – 2 5 % of the value of the apartment.

In any event, the Court was not competent ratione temporis to analyse events dating from the communist period and assess the justification for the rules on the sale of housing then in force.

The main difference lied in the fact that, unlike the applicants in Pincová and Pinc, the applicants in the Bulgarian cases (or the persons whom they had inherited) had been aware that the apartments they had purchased had been nationalised apartments, taken from others.

Compensation by bonds was a normal practice in a number of countries from Central and Eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, bonds could be traded in accordance with the relevant stock exchange rules and in July 200 5, for example, they were traded at 70 % of their face value. The Government also referred to the fact that in accordance with the relevant law and practice the pre-nationalisation owners were entitled to restitution but could not claim compensation for damage or changes in the property since the nationalisation in the 1940s. It was therefore justified that the post ‑ nationalisation owners, who had to return the apartments they had possessed on the strength of a void title, could not claim compensation for improvements they had made.

It is also true that the terms used by section 7 to define the grounds on which a title to property could be declared null and void were broad. One of those grounds, “breaches of the law”, was interpreted as referring to laws, decrees and various other enactments dating from the communist period and regulating matters as diverse as State housing policy, the functioning of the State administrative apparatus, real estate and civil transactions. Those rules – which the courts had to apply through section 7 – had often changed and had previously been part of a system that had not been governed by the rule of law (see paragraphs 11 1 ‑ 11 5 and 12 1-125 above). The above inevitably engendered uncertainty, as illustrated by the frequency with which the present cases involved reversals by a higher court of lower courts'judgments (see paragraphs 36, 37, 47, 56, 65-67, 77, 78, 89 and 90 above)."

Furthermore, the Bulgarian legislature's approach to compensation for persons who had been deprived of property under section 7 changed several times in contradictory directions. Although in 1996 the law provided for full market value compensation, the Council of Ministers failed to adopt implementing regulations and no such compensation was paid.

The Court cannot disregard the ensuing difficulties and would not adopt a purist approach to legal predictability. A measure of uncertainty was inevitable in respect of legislation aiming at undoing decades -old injustices. While legal uncertainty may not satisfy the Convention requirements of clarity and foreseeability and may contravene the prohibition of arbitrariness, in the assessment whether such a situation obtained in the present case and whether, consequently, there was an unjustified State interference contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, due account must be taken of the special transitional period at the relevant time and the individual circumstances of each case (see application no. 40064/98, Credit Bank and Others v.

Several amendments, albeit often contradictory, concerned the right to compensation for persons in the applicants'position and other provisions sought to ensure that evicted persons did not remain homeless (see paragraphs 128-139 above).

The domestic courts applied a principle of Bulgarian property law, according to which a sale-purchase contract – albeit valid as a source of contractual obligations – does not effectively transfer ownership if the seller was not the owner of the property. It follows from this principle that a bona fide buyer may have to restore the property to its original owner seeking rei vindicatio if it is established that the person with whom the bona fide buyer entered into a transaction was not the owner. In theory, a rei vindicatio claim by the original owner can be brought even after a long chain of transactions, since none of those would generate ownership rights for the successive buyer. Nonetheless, the provisions on acquisitive prescription (five years for a bona fide buyer) curtailed the danger of prolonged legal uncertainty in most circumstances (see paragraphs 5 4 - 58, 11 6 and 12 3 above)."

In the case of Eneva and Dobrev, the fact that a relevant document had not been found in the archives concerning the sale of the apartment by the State to a Ms G. and that that sale was found to have been signed by a replacement for the relevant mayor sufficed to deprive the applicants from the property they had acquired from Ms G. in good faith and in due form forty years before the adoption of the Restitution Law. Furthermore, the compensation the applicants obtained, five years after they had to vacate the apartment, amounted to approximately 50% of the value the property as it stood in 2001 (see paragraphs 5 4 - 59 and 61 above)."

In particular, the wording of section 5 § 2 of the Compensation Law, which spoke of “priority”, could be understood as providing for such a right and the respondent Government have not claimed that at that time there existed established case-law in the opposite sense.

That conclusion was based on analysis of all relevant arguments of the applicants and the provisions of domestic law (see paragraph 10 5 above).
