The protection of personal data is of fundamental importance to a person ’ s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. The domestic law must afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such use of personal data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees of this Article (see S. and Marper, cited above, § 103). Article 8 of the Convention thus provides for the right to a form of informational self-determination, allowing individuals to rely on their right to privacy as regards data which, albeit neutral, are collected, processed and disseminated collectively and in such a form or manner that their Article 8 rights may be engaged."

Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy, EU :C:2008:727 ). It found, first of all, that the activities in question constituted “processing of personal data” within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 95/46. According to the CJEU, activities involving the processing of personal data such as those relating to personal data files which contained solely, and in unaltered form, material that had already been published in the media, also fell within the scope of the Directive (see paragraphs 37 and 49 of the judgment). The object of the derogation in Article 9 of the Directive for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes was to reconcile the protection of privacy with freedom of expression. In order to take account of the importance of the latter in every democratic society, it was necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly. However, in order to achieve a balance between those two fundamental rights, the protection of the fundamental right to privacy required that the derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data had to apply only in so far as were strictly necessary (see paragraphs 54 and 56 of the judgment). Journalistic activities were not limited to media undertakings and could be undertaken for profit-making purposes (see paragraph 61). Furthermore, when interpreting the journalistic purposes derogation, account must be taken of the evolution and proliferation of methods of communication and the dissemination of information. Activities such as those involved in the domestic proceedings, relating to data from documents which were in the public domain under domestic legislation, could be classified as “journalistic activities” if their sole object was the disclosure to the public of information, opinions or ideas, irrespective of the medium which was used to transmit them. Whether or not that was the case, was for the national court to determine (see paragraphs 60-62 of the judgment).",

According to section 2(1) of the Act on the Exercise of Freedom of Expression in Mass Media, the term “the public” in that Act refers to a group of freely determined message recipients. Satamedia Oy ’ s SMS service involves the company processing personal data relating to the taxation of a specific individual on the basis of a request by another individual. It therefore does not concern disclosure of data to the general public, as explained above, but replying to a request by an individual concerning the personal data of another individual.",

As regards the SMS service operated by Satamedia Oy, it is irrelevant that the data were transferred via mobile phones and text messages. Therefore, this is not a case of treating this mode of transmission of data differently from other modes of transmission. The assessment would be the same if the company processed, on the basis of a request by an individual, the personal data of another individual by using some other mode of transmission.”",

It found that the collection of personal data prior to its publication in Veropörssi and its processing in the background file of the first applicant company could not as such be regarded as contrary to the data protection rules, provided, inter alia, that the data had been protected properly. However, considering the manner and the extent to which the personal data in the background file had been published in Veropörssi, the first applicant company had processed personal data concerning natural persons in violation of the Personal Data Act.

At issue in Österreichischer Rundfunk, cited above, was national legislation which required a State control body, the Court of Audit, to collect and communicate, for purposes of publication, data on the income of persons employed by the bodies subject to its control, where that income exceeds a certain threshold. The purpose of the collection and publication of the information was to exert pressure on public bodies to keep salaries within reasonable limits. The CJEU held that, while the mere recording by an employer of data by name relating to the remuneration paid to his employees cannot as such constitute an interference with private life, the communication of that data to third parties, in the present case a public authority, infringes the right of the persons concerned to respect for private life, whatever the subsequent use of the information thus communicated, and constitutes an interference within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. Citing Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 70, ECHR 2000 ‑ II, it also held that to establish the existence of such an interference, it did not matter whether the information communicated was of a sensitive character or whether the persons concerned had been inconvenienced in any way (paragraphs 74-75). Finally, the CJEU held that the interference resulting from the application of the Austrian legislation may be justified under Article 8(2) of the Convention only in so far as the wide disclosure not merely of the amounts of the annual income above a certain threshold of persons employed by the bodies subject to control by the Court of Audit but also of the names of the recipients of that income was both necessary for and appropriate to the aim of keeping salaries within reasonable limits, that being a matter for the national courts to examine (paragraph 90). It emphasised, as regards the proportionality of the interference and the seriousness of the latter, that it was not impossible that the persons affected might suffer harm as a result of the negative effects of the publicity attached to their income from employment (paragraph 89)."

Noting that the directive seeks to ensure not only the free flow of such data between Member States but also the safeguarding of the fundamental rights of individuals and that those objectives may be inconsistent with one another, the CJEU held that the mechanisms allowing those different rights and interests to be balanced are contained, first, in the Directive itself, and, second, result from the adoption, by the Member States, of national provisions implementing that directive and their application by the national authorities (paragraphs 79-82). The provisions of the Directive do not, in themselves, bring about a restriction which conflicts with the general principles of freedom of expression or other freedoms and rights which are applicable within the EU and are enshrined inter alia in Article 10 of the Convention.

Referring to Amann, cited above, and Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, ECHR 2000 ‑ V, it pointed out that the professional nature of the activities to which the data referred did not imply the absence of a right to privacy. The fact that the beneficiaries of aid had been informed that the data might be made public was not sufficient to establish that they had given their consent to its publication. As regards the proportionality of the interference with privacy rights, the CJEU held that it did not appear that the EU institutions had properly balanced the public interest objective in the transparent use of public funds against the rights which natural persons are recognised as having under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. Regard being had to the fact that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary, and that it was possible to envisage measures which would have affected less adversely that fundamental right of natural persons and which would still have contributed effectively to the objectives of the European Union rules in question, the CJEU held that the EU regulations in question exceeded the limits which compliance with the principle of proportionality imposes and struck them down."

Inasmuch as the activity of a search engine is liable to affect significantly fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data, the operator of the search engine must ensure that the activity meets the requirements of the Directive in order that the guarantees laid down by the Directive may have full effect and that effective and complete protection of data subjects, in particular of their right to privacy, may actually be achieved.

The CJEU also held that the processing of personal data may be incompatible with the Directive not only because the data are inaccurate but, in particular, also because “they are inadequate, irrelevant or excessive in relation to the purposes of the processing, that they are not kept up to date, or that they are kept for longer than is necessary unless they are required to be kept for historical, statistical or scientific purposes” (paragraph 92)."

On 1 November every year, when the tax records of the previous year became public, numerous newspapers and other media published personal tax data in paper and electronic formats. This was no different from what the applicant companies had engaged in, apart from the quantity of the published data. The majority of the persons whose data were accessible in this way were not known to the public and were of varying backgrounds and professions. No particular judicial attention had ever been paid to the identity of the persons whose names and amounts of taxable income had been published.

The preparatory work relating to the Act on the Public Disclosure and Confidentiality of Tax Information noted that such publishing had taken place for years and also served certain societal purposes. A thorough discussion had taken place during the preparation of the said Act, assessing the pros and cons of publishing taxation data, and the legislator had finally decided to maintain public access to such data. The Personal Data Act was not intended to restrict publishing activities. The relevant preparatory work stated that the legal status of the data in question was to remain unchanged. The journalistic purposes derogation was to apply to databases that were designed to support publishing so as to prevent even indirect prior restrictions on freedom of expression. Possible violations of privacy were to be examined and dealt with ex post facto.

The balancing criteria applied by the Court functioned best where the privacy of one or two persons was concerned. In such situations the data relating to a particular individual took prominence. When hundreds of thousands of names were published, all in the same manner, the information concerning a specific person “blended in”. The publication of such data could hardly violate anyone ’ s privacy. For such situations, a different type of balancing criteria ought to be applied in order to better take into account the nature of the mass data published, namely a criterion for protecting the privacy of a large population. Moreover, when other media had published taxation data on, for example, 150,000 individuals, it had never been requested that this information be viewed in the light of the Court ’ s balancing criteria. It was only when the applicant companies had published 1.2 million names that such criteria became applicable."

According to the applicant companies, public access to tax data enabled the public to observe the results of tax policies and how differences in income and wealth developed, for example, between different regions, occupations and sexes. It also enabled supervision by the Finnish tax administration as people reported their suspicions of tax evasion directly to the tax administration. In 2015 alone, the tax administration had received 15,000 such reports. The applicant companies thus argued that a balance between the public and publishable tax records, on the one hand, and the protection of privacy, on the other hand, had already been struck by the Finnish legislator. Therefore, no margin of appreciation, or at least a very narrow one, was left to the domestic authorities. There was thus no need for any re-balancing. Contrary to Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, ECHR 1999-I, the taxation information in the present case had been obtained lawfully by the applicant companies from public tax records, in the same manner as any other member of the public. The effect on a person ’ s privacy could not in any significant way be different depending on whether the information had been received from the applicant companies, other media or through a phone-in service operated by the tax administration itself.

The reasoning of the Supreme Administrative Court was in contradiction with this definition, which fact was bound to endanger the very idea of freedom of expression. Given the terms of the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s judgment, one had to ask how much information needed to be published to transgress the limit between publishable and non-publishable information. The quantity and the manner in which taxation information could be lawfully published had, according to the applicant companies, never been defined. The national court had failed to take into account the balancing criteria in the Court ’ s case-law, and had only had regard to the public interest criterion.

Taxation data were publicly available in Finland but had to be accessed and used in conformity with the Personal Data Act and the Act on the Openness of Government Activities.

Other Finnish media published taxation data concerning 50,000 to 100,000 individuals annually, which was considerably less than the applicant companies. The latter published, without any analysis, data on persons with low or medium income who were not public figures and held no important positions in society. Their publishing activities could not therefore be viewed as data journalism aimed at drawing conclusions from such data and drawing attention to issues of public interest for public debate. Such publishing did not contribute to public debate in a manner that outweighed the public interest in protecting the processing of personal data to the described extent; it mainly satisfied readers ’ curiosity. The applicant companies had not been prevented from publishing taxation data as such or participating in any public debate on an issue of general importance."

The present case differed from Fressoz and Roire v. France, cited above, in which the publishing of data concerned a single person having a key role in a public debate on a socially important issue. Contrary to the applicant companies ’ allegations, the present case was not abstract and hypothetical. Private persons had been affected by their activities: between 2000 and 2010 the Data Protection Ombudsman had received a number of complaints requesting his intervention.

However, the existence of a public interest in providing access to, and allowing the collection of, large amounts of taxation data did not necessarily or automatically mean that there was also a public interest in disseminating en masse such raw data in unaltered form without any analytical input. It had been made clear in the preparatory work on the domestic legislation (see paragraph 36 above) that databases established for journalistic purposes were not intended to be made available to persons not engaged in journalistic activities, thus underlining that the journalistic privilege in question related to the processing of data for internal purposes.

According to the Government, a hospital, which at the time was a respondent party in private ‑ law litigation, was authorised to seek independent expert advice from the MADEKKI. Such a hypothesis was not discussed by the Senate of the Supreme Court.

The medical information collected and analysed by the MADEKKI originated from three different medical institutions.

Further, the data form part of the applicant’s criminal record (see Rotaru, cited above, §§ 43-46; and B.B., cited above, § 57). In this regard the Court, like Lord Hope in R (L), emphasises that although data contained in the criminal record are, in one sense, public information, their systematic storing in central records means that they are available for disclosure long after the event when everyone other than the person concerned is likely to have forgotten about it, and all the more so where, as in the present case, the caution has occurred in private. Thus as the conviction or caution itself recedes into the past, it becomes a part of the person’s private life which must be respected (see Rotaru, cited above, §§ 43-44).

In this context she was asked for details of her conviction and caution history and provided them as requested. The Court notes and agrees with the comments of Lords Hope and Neuberger in R (L), to the effect that the fact that disclosure follows upon a request by the data subject or with her consent is no answer to concerns regarding the compatibility of disclosure with Article 8 of the Convention. Individuals have no real choice if an employer in their chosen profession insists, and is entitled to do so, on disclosure: as Lord Hope noted, consent to a request for criminal record data is conditional on the right to respect for private life being respected (see paragraph 106 above).

I accept that it is possible that there could be cases where the information should not be included in the certificate because it is disproportionate to do so; the information might be as to some trifling matter; it may be that the evidence made it so unlikely that the information was correct, that it again would be disproportionate to disclose it.

He considered therefore that a process which could only culminate in measures of a preventative, curative, rehabilitative or welfare-promoting kind would not ordinarily involve the determination of a criminal charge. He accordingly concluded that neither the warning of the claimant nor the decision to warn him involved the determination of a criminal charge against him.

The legislation imposes a relatively low threshold for disclosure in the certificate in order to enable an employer to make a properly informed decision. But it is important that employers understand how low that threshold is and the responsibility that it places in practice upon them. A properly informed decision requires consideration not only of the information disclosed in the certificate but also of any additional information or explanation that the employee may provide. The operation of a blanket policy of insisting on a ‘clean’ certificate leaves no room for taking into account what the employee may have to say. That is a matter of particular concern if it leads to the dismissal of an existing employee or of someone whose employment is transferred to the employer on a reorganisation. On the basis of the limited material available to the court, I confess to some surprise that the claimant was advised in this case that he had no reasonable prospect of success in a claim for unfair dismissal resulting from the application of such a policy ...”",

In respect of each of those convictions the Information Tribunal (the IT) has upheld the view of the Information Commissioner (the IC) that they should be deleted.

It is now accepted that that is not accurate. Under Part V of the 1997 Act ‘stepped down’ convictions are required to be revealed even on ‘standard disclosure certificates’, and thus although ‘stepping down’ prevents disclosure in many circumstances to persons other than the police, it does not prevent disclosure by the police in many others including the circumstances under which disclosure was made of four of the convictions the subject of this appeal.”"

As it recedes into the past, it becomes a part of the person’s private life which must be respected. Moreover, much of the other information that may find its way into an ECRC relates to things that happen behind closed doors. A caution takes place in private, and the police gather and record information from a variety of sources which would not otherwise be made public.

It is common ground that the notification requirements interfere with offenders’ article 8 rights, that this interference is in accordance with the law and that it is directed at the legitimate aims of the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The issue is whether the notification requirements, as embodied in the 2003 Act, and without any right to a review, are proportionate to that aim. That issue requires consideration of three questions. (i) What is the extent of the interference with article 8 rights? (ii) How valuable are the notification requirements in achieving the legitimate aims? and (iii) To what extent would that value be eroded if the notification requirements were made subject to review? The issue is a narrow one. The respondents’ case is that the notification requirements cannot be proportionate in the absence of any right to a review.

If some of those who are subject to lifetime notification requirements no longer pose any significant risk of committing further sexual offences and it is possible for them to demonstrate that this is the case, there is no point in subjecting them to supervision or management or to the interference with their article 8 rights involved in visits to their local police stations in order to provide information about their places of residence and their travel plans. Indeed subjecting them to these requirements can only impose an unnecessary and unproductive burden on the responsible authorities.

Registration systems for sexual offenders are not uncommon in other jurisdictions.

Article 5 provides that appropriate time-limits must be established for the erasure of personal data or for a periodic review of the need for the storage of the data. Procedural measures must be in place to ensure that these time-limits are observed."

The applicant complained about the change in policy regarding retention of caution data, which means that it would now be retained for life, and the impact of this change on her employment prospects. It is clear that for as long as her data are retained and capable of being disclosed, she remains a victim of any potential violation of Article 8 arising from retention or disclosure. As Waller LJ noted in Chief Constable of Humberside, the complaint about retention in reality flows not from the retention itself but from the fact that, if retained, disclosure may follow (see paragraph 94 above). It is clear that if the applicant was able to have her data deleted, then it would no longer be available for disclosure. Alternatively, a remedy which prevented the disclosure of the data might have provided adequate redress.

The ACPO Guidelines specify in their general principles that records are to be retained until a subject reaches one hundred years of age; it appears that no distinction is drawn between offences for the purpose of the length of the retention period (see paragraph 45 above). Although the Guidelines refer to the discretion enjoyed by chief constables in “exceptional circumstances” to authorise deletion of data, the circumstances envisaged are very limited: Appendix 2 indicates that exceptional cases will be rare and gives the example of where it is established beyond reasonable doubt that no offence existed (see paragraph 46 above)."

Given the nature of the guidance on retention to which the Court has referred above (see paragraph 167 above) and the generous approach to the powers of the police to retain data set out therein, this is not surprising. The potential for a successful challenge to the exercise of the chief constable’s discretion to retain data, or indeed to the policy itself, was further diminished by the position of the domestic courts at the time, which tended to consider that Article 8 did not apply to mere retention of data or, if it did, that any interference was minor (see the House of Lords’ judgment regarding retention of DNA data which was challenged in S. and Marper, cited above, summarised at §§ 15-25 of that judgment)."

As regards a challenge to the disclosure of the caution data, the Court observes that in its 2004 judgment in R (X) dealing with disclosure under the 1997 Act of other “information” on an ECRC under the 1997 Act, the Court of Appeal took a robust approach to the exercise of discretion by the chief constable in choosing to disclose information in the context of a criminal record check. Lord Woolf CJ indicated that the chief constable was “under a duty” to disclose any information which might be relevant unless there was some good reason for not making the disclosure (see paragraph 79 above). He further found that the chief constable was not required to invite representations from the subject of the criminal record check before deciding what to include in the certificate (see paragraph 80 above). Specifically on the question of Article 8 considerations, the Court of Appeal expressed the view that it was difficult to see how a chief constable’s decision to disclose could ever be challenged (see paragraph 81 above). The Court observes that the case was decided against the backdrop of a clearly-defined legislative framework (i.e., the 1997 Act, which was in force in England and Wales at the time) which the court took to be in compliance with Article 8 (see paragraph 78 above). However, it considers that the court’s approach to the exercise of discretion is nonetheless indicative of a wide discretion afforded to the police to decide on questions of disclosure and a rejection of any need for the participation of the data subject in the decision to disclose criminal record data. It is also relevant to emphasise that the applicant’s case did not concern disclosure of other information under section 113B(4) but of caution data, the mandatory disclosure of which required by the 1997 Act reveals the view of the legislature that such information will always be relevant. It is significant that the Government have not pointed to any case decided at that time in which an individual had successfully challenged a decision to disclose criminal record data, either concerning convictions and caution data or in respect of section 113B(4) information.

While the case was brought by a number of individuals seeking to have their own data deleted, Waller LJ emphasised that the ramifications of the cases were far wider than the cases themselves, since if the convictions at issue were to be deleted and the police were to treat people consistently, the result would be the deletion of around one million convictions (see paragraph 88 above). It follows that the scope of the appeals went beyond the personal interests of the individuals directly involved in the proceedings so that, in that sense, the decision of the Court of Appeal was of more general application and affected others, such as the applicant, in a similar position."

He was of the opinion that in assessing whether the data retained were excessive or were being retained for longer than necessary, there was “only one answer” since in order to be able to supply accurate records of convictions, a complete record of conviction, spent or otherwise, was required. This was, he said, a “complete answer to the appeal” (see paragraph 92 above). Even if a narrower approach to police purposes were to be adopted, Waller LJ indicated that the retention of the data would remain lawful because if the police said rationally and reasonably that convictions, however old or minor, had a value in the work they did, then that should be the end of the matter (see paragraph 93 above). As to whether the retention of data violated Article 8 of the Convention, Waller LJ doubted whether Article 8 applied but, even if it did, considered that the retention was in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society (see paragraph 96 above).

As regards retention, the Government emphasised that it occurred in accordance with the law in a number of well-established ways, pursuant to common law powers as police officers and their statutory powers of policing and in accordance with the principles set out in the Data Protection Act. It pursued the legitimate aims of public safety, the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Finally, retention was also necessary and proportionate. Retention was primarily a matter of judgment for the individual police force or Government in question in accordance with the margin of appreciation. However, retention was usually necessary and proportionate as it was important for the police to retain records of what had happened. They referred in this respect to the MOPI Guidance 2006 (see paragraphs 36-41 above)."

However, and in any case, they argued that an assessment of the need for disclosure was a matter for the policy judgment of the State in question and fell within the margin of appreciation, regard being had to the objectives of the legislation and the relevance of the information to the employment being sought. An individual dissatisfied with disclosure in her case could challenge it by way of judicial review or pursue a complaint to the Information Commissioner. In the applicant’s case, the disclosure was made in accordance with the law and the applicant does not suggest otherwise. It took place for a legitimate purpose, namely the prevention of disorder and crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Finally it was both necessary and proportionate to the aim pursued. In this regard it was relevant that the applicant herself requested the disclosure; she was applying for a job working with children and vulnerable adults; she recognised the relevance of the incident to her employment; and the disclosure was factually correct."

The Court reiterates that both the storing of information relating to an individual’s private life and the release of such information come within the scope of Article 8 § 1 (see Leander, cited above, § 48; Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, §§ 65 and 69-70, ECHR 2000-II; Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 43, ECHR 2000 ‑ V. See also S. and Marper, cited above, § 67; and Khelili v. Switzerland, no. 16188/07, § 55, 18 October 2011, on the applicability of Article 8 to the storage of data). Even public information can fall within the scope of private life where it is systematically collected and stored in files held by the authorities (see Rotaru, cited above, § 43; P.G. and J.H., cited above, § 57; Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden, no. 62332/00, § 72, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII; and Cemalettin Canlı v. Turkey, no. 22427/04, § 33, 18 November 2008). This is all the more true where the information concerns a person’s distant past ( Rotaru, cited above, § 43; and Cemalettin Canlı, cited above, § 33). The question therefore arises in the present case whether the data relating to the applicant’s caution stored in police records constitute data relating to the applicant’s “private life” and, if so, whether there has been an interference with her right to respect for private life."

The Court notes at the outset that the data in question constitute both “personal data” and “sensitive personal data” within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 (see paragraph 67 above). They also constitute “personal data” and are identified as a special category of data under the Council of Europe’s Data Protection Convention (see paragraphs 122-123 above). Further, the data form part of the applicant’s criminal record (see Rotaru, cited above, §§ 43-46; and B.B., cited above, § 57). In this regard the Court, like Lord Hope in R (L), emphasises that although data contained in the criminal record are, in one sense, public information, their systematic storing in central records means that they are available for disclosure long after the event when everyone other than the person concerned is likely to have forgotten about it, and all the more so where, as in the present case, the caution has occurred in private. Thus as the conviction or caution itself recedes into the past, it becomes a part of the person’s private life which must be respected (see Rotaru, cited above, §§ 43-44). In the present case, the administration of the caution occurred almost twelve years ago."

The Court observes that the posts for which the applicant applied were subject to vetting. In this context she was asked for details of her conviction and caution history and provided them as requested. The Court notes and agrees with the comments of Lords Hope and Neuberger in R (L), to the effect that the fact that disclosure follows upon a request by the data subject or with her consent is no answer to concerns regarding the compatibility of disclosure with Article 8 of the Convention. Individuals have no real choice if an employer in their chosen profession insists, and is entitled to do so, on disclosure: as Lord Hope noted, consent to a request for criminal record data is conditional on the right to respect for private life being respected (see paragraph 106 above). The applicant’s agreement to disclosure does not deprive her of the protection afforded by the Convention (see paragraph 110 above)."

The law must thus be adequately accessible and foreseeable, that is, formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual – if need be with appropriate advice – to regulate his conduct. For domestic law to meet these requirements, it must afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness and accordingly indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, §§ 66-68, Series A no. 82; Rotaru, cited above, §§ 52 and 55; Liberty and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 58243/00, § 59, 1 July 2008; and S. and Marper, cited above, § 95)."

In Malone, cited above, §§ 69-80, it found a violation of Article 8 because the law in England and Wales governing interception of communications for police purposes was “somewhat obscure and open to differing interpretations” and on the evidence before the Court, it could not be said with any reasonable certainty what elements of the powers to intercept were incorporated in legal rules and what elements remained within the discretion of the executive. As a result of the attendant obscurity and uncertainty as to the state of the law the Court concluded that it did not indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities (see also Liberty and Others, cited above, §§ 64-70)."

The Court further draws attention to Principle 5 which sets out the need for a clear legal obligation or authorisation to communicate data to bodies outside the police in most cases, and the exceptional nature of any communication, in the absence of any such obligation or authorisation, intended to prevent serious and imminent danger (see paragraphs 133-135 above). Finally, the Court refers to the terms of Principle 7 of the Recommendation, which sets out a list of considerations to be taken into account when assessing the duration of any storage of data including rehabilitation, spent convictions, the age of the subject and the category of data concerned (see paragraph 138 above)."

In doing so, Lord Phillips noted that no evidence had been placed before the court that demonstrated that it was not possible to identify from among those convicted of serious offences, at any stage in their lives, some at least who posed no significant risk of reoffending.

A significant amount of additional data recorded by police forces is also retained. It is clear from the available guidance that both the recording and, at least, the initial retention of all relevant data are intended to be automatic. It further appears from the policy documents provided that a general presumption in favour of retention applies, and that as regards data held in central records which have not been shown to be inaccurate, retention until the data subject has attained one hundred years of age is standard in all cases. There can therefore be no doubt that the scope and application of the system for retention and disclosure is extensive."

Further, the greater the scope of the recording system, and thus the greater the amount and sensitivity of data held and available for disclosure, the more important the content of the safeguards to be applied at the various crucial stages in the subsequent processing of the data. The Court considers that the obligation on the authorities responsible for retaining and disclosing criminal record data to secure respect for private life is particularly important, given the nature of the data held and the potentially devastating consequences of their disclosure. In R (L), Lord Hope noted that in 2008/2009 almost 275,000 requests were made for ECRCs alone (see paragraph 105 above). This number is significant and demonstrates the wide reach of the legislation requiring disclosure. As Lord Neuberger indicated, even where the criminal record certificate records a conviction or caution for a relatively minor, or questionably relevant, offence, a prospective employer may well feel it safer to reject the applicant (see paragraph 108 above; see also the views expressed in the Divisional Court in R (Pinnington), at paragraph 87 above). The Court agrees with Lord Neuberger that it is realistic to assume that, in the majority of cases, an adverse criminal record certificate will represent something close to a “killer blow” to the hopes of a person who aspires to any post which falls within the scope of disclosure requirements (see paragraph 111 above)."

                "202. The Court reiterates that there is no statutory law in respect of Northern Ireland which governs the collection and storage of data regarding the administration of cautions. Retention of such data is carried out pursuant to the common law powers of the police, in accordance with the general principles set out in the Data Protection Act. In the absence of any statutory provisions, a number of policy documents which apply in Northern Ireland have been identified by the Government (see paragraphs 33-46 above). As noted above, it is clear from the MOPI Guidance and the ACPO Guidelines that the recording and initial retention of caution data are intended in practice to be automatic. While reference is made in the MOPI Guidance to a review of retention after a six-year period, the criteria for review appear to be very restrictive. The Guidance notes that there is a presumption in favour of retention and the review schedule requires police to retain data in the category of “Certain Public Protection Matters” until the data subject is deemed to have reached one hundred years of age, regardless of the type or classification of data or grade of the intelligence concerned (see paragraphs 39-40 above). Any review in such cases seems intended to focus on whether the data are adequate and up to date. Pursuant to the ACPO Guidelines, it appears that data held in central police records are now automatically retained, regardless of the seriousness of the offence in question, until the person is deemed to have reached one hundred years of age. The ACPO Guidelines themselves explain that they are based on a format of restricting access to data, rather than deleting them. While deletion requests can be made under the ACPO Guidelines, they should only be granted in exceptional circumstances (see paragraphs 43-46 above). As noted above the examples given as to what constitute exceptional circumstances do not suggest a possibility of deletion being ordered in any case where the data subject admits having committed an offence and the data are accurate."

As for disclosure of caution data, at the relevant time there was no statutory framework in place in Northern Ireland which governed the communication of such data by the police to prospective employers. The disclosure of the applicant’s caution data took place pursuant to the common law powers of the police, in accordance with the general principles set out in the Data Protection Act. The only policy guidance to which the Government have referred is contained in the ACPO Guidelines and the MOPI Guidance. The MOPI Guidance refers to the comprehensive system for disclosure in the employment vetting context set out in the 1997 Act, which did not apply in Northern Ireland at the time, and to general disclosure for police purposes under common law powers (see paragraph 58-59 above). The Guidance explains that in this context a balancing exercise must be carried out, but specific information regarding the scope of the discretion to disclose and the factors which are relevant to the exercise of such powers in the context of disclosure of criminal record information is not provided. Although the ACPO Guidelines make reference to a stepping down policy to limit access to data after a certain time period has passed, as noted above it appears that stepped down data were still intended to be available for disclosure in the context of requests for criminal record checks (see paragraphs 60 and 89 above)."

                "204. Regarding any possible future disclosure of the applicant’s caution data, the Court observes that there is now a statutory framework in place for disclosure of criminal record information to prospective employers. Pursuant to the legislation now in place, caution data contained in central records, including where applicable information on spent cautions, must be disclosed in the context of a standard or enhanced criminal record check. No distinction is made based on the seriousness or the circumstances of the offence, the time which has elapsed since the offence was committed and whether the caution is spent. In short, there appears to be no scope for the exercise of any discretion in the disclosure exercise. Nor, as a consequence of the mandatory nature of the disclosure, is there any provision for the making of prior representations by the data subject to prevent the data being disclosed either generally or in a specific case. The applicable legislation does not allow for any assessment at any stage in the disclosure process of the relevance of conviction or caution data held in central records to the employment sought, or of the extent to which the data subject may be perceived as continuing to pose a risk such that the disclosure of the data to the employer is justified. In this regard the Court takes note of the offer made by the police in 2006 to add a comment to the applicant’s record to the effect that the incident was domestically related and that in any vetting context she should be approached for an explanation (see paragraph 16 above). It is unclear whether such addition could have any place in the disclosure system envisaged by the 1997 Act given the automatic nature of the disclosure exercise in respect of caution data held in central records. In any event, the apparent preference of many employers for a clean criminal record certificate (see paragraphs 87, 108 and 111 above) would deprive such addition of any real value."

As regards specifically the fact that the retention policy changed after the administration of the applicant’s caution, the Court notes that the applicant consented to the administration of the caution on the basis that it would be deleted from her record after five years. The Government have confirmed that this was the policy of the PSNI at the relevant time (see paragraph 25 above. See also the 1995 ACPO Code of Practice, paragraph 29 above). The police reply to the applicant’s query in March 2003 is consistent with this understanding and confirmed that the caution would remain on her record until 17 November 2005 (see paragraph 10 above). The Court notes that in accepting the caution, the applicant waived her fair trial rights in respect of the offence in issue. It is not for the Court to assess whether she would, with the benefit of hindsight, have been in a better position now had she refused the caution. It must be recalled that the administration of the caution relieved her of the stress and anxiety of a potential criminal trial, which could have resulted in a custodial sentence had she been found guilty. However, the Court expresses concern about the change in policy, which occurred several years after the applicant had accepted the caution and which was to have significant effects on her employment prospects."

Even assuming that Article 139 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure could be a lawful basis for granting the press access to the case file, in the instant case the Court does not see any legitimate aim for the interference with the first applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life. Being in custody at the material time, he was not a fugitive from justice and the showing of his photograph could not have been necessary for enlisting public support to determine his whereabouts. Nor could it be said to have bolstered the public character of judicial proceedings because at the time of the recording and the first airing of the television show the trial had not yet begun.

They had been unable to put them on because the jackets had shrunk after repeated washes.

However, the Court is not convinced by the latter claim because it appears peculiar that it transpired for the first time only at an advanced stage of proceedings.

Within that period the pre-trial investigation lasted for one year and three months and the trial at first instance continued from 31 July 2000 to 2 March 2001. The appeal proceedings had been preceded by a delay resulting from the Town Court ’ s failure to take certain procedural steps which were considered indispensable by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 34 above). Once those defects had been remedied, the appeals were heard in less than two months ’ time.

The show had been recorded before the case had been referred for trial; it had been extensively advertised with the sensationalist line “Slavery in Glazov at the end of the twentieth century” and aired at such times as to precede the adjourned trial hearings and the appeal hearing. Article 139 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure could not be interpreted as justifying an encroachment on the applicants ’ presumption of innocence. Their right to be presumed innocent until found guilty had been further damaged by the statements made by the journalist Ms Temeyeva, the prosecutor Mr Zinterekov, the investigator Mr Kurbatov and the prosecutor Mr Nikitin during the television show. In addition, the prosecution had also granted access to the case file to the journalist Ms M., the author of the article “The Land of Slaves”, which had also been highly prejudicial to the applicants.

The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 2, in its relevant aspect, is aimed at preventing the undermining of a fair criminal trial by prejudicial statements made in close connection with those proceedings.

France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, § 35). It prohibits the premature expression by the tribunal itself of the opinion that the person “charged with a criminal offence” is guilty before he has been so proved according to law (see Minelli v. Switzerland, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62) but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, § 41; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, §§ 41 - 43, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; and Butkevičius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, § 49, ECHR 2002 ‑ II )."

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Böhmer v. Germany, no. 37568/97, § § 54 and 56, 3 October 2002, and Nešťák v. Slovakia, no. 65559/01, § § 88 and 89, 27 February 2007 )."

The participants discussed the applicants ’ case in detail with some input from the show ’ s presenter and the alleged victim of their wrongdoings. Subsequently the show was aired again on two occasions during the trial and once more several days before the appeal hearing."

                "96. As regards the contents of the show, the Court notes that all three prosecution officials described the acts imputed to the applicants as a “crime” which had been committed by them (see their statements in paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 above). Their statements were not limited to describing the status of the pending proceedings or a “state of suspicion” against the applicants but represented as an established fact, without any qualification or reservation, their involvement in the commission of the offences, without even mentioning that they denied it. In addition, the town prosecutor Mr Zinterekov referred to the applicants ’ criminal record, portraying them as hardened criminals, and made a claim that the commission of the “crime” had been the result of their “personal qualities” – “cruelty and meaningless brutality”. In the closing statement he also mentioned that the only choice the trial court would have to make would be that of a sentence of an appropriate length, thus presenting the applicants ’ conviction as the only possible outcome of the judicial proceedings (see paragraph 18 above). The Court considers that those statements by the public officials amounted to a declaration of the applicants ’ guilt and prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority. Given that those officials held high positions in the town and regional prosecuting authorities, they should have exercised particular caution in their choice of words for describing pending criminal proceedings against the applicants. However, having regard to the contents of their statements as outlined above, the Court finds that some of their statements could not but have encouraged the public to believe the applicants guilty before they had been proved guilty according to law. Accordingly, the Court finds that there was a breach of the applicants ’ presumption of innocence. This finding makes it unnecessary to examine separately the applicants ’ grievance that the release of the case file to the journalists was also prejudicial to their presumption of innocence."

Despite the fact that the applicant in that case was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim had been largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been “an important part of the plaintiff ’ s presentation of the case and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings” (see Kovalev v. Russia, no. 78145/01, § 37, 10 May 2007)."

The Court observes that the Russian Code of Civil Procedure provides for the plaintiff ’ s right to appear in person before a civil court hearing his claim (see paragraph 67 above). However, neither the Code of Civil Procedure nor the Penitentiary Code make special provision for the exercise of that right by individuals who are in custody, whether they are in pre-trial detention or are serving a sentence. In the present case the applicants ’ and their representative ’ s requests for leave to appear were denied precisely on the ground that the domestic law did not make provision for convicted persons to be brought from correctional colonies to the place where their civil claim was being heard. The Court reiterates that Article 6 of the Convention does not guarantee the right to personal presence before a civil court but rather a more general right to present one ’ s case effectively before the court and to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side. Article 6 § 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § § 59-60, ECHR 2005 ‑ II )."

The issue of the exercise of procedural rights by detainees in civil proceedings has been examined on several occasions by the Russian Constitutional Court, which has identified several ways in which their rights can be secured (see paragraph 69 above). It has consistently emphasised representation as an appropriate solution in cases where a party cannot appear in person before a civil court. Given the obvious difficulties involved in transporting convicted persons from one location to another, the Court can in principle accept that in cases where the claim is not based on the plaintiff ’ s personal experiences, as in the above-mentioned Kovalev case, representation of the detainee by an advocate would not be in breach of the principle of equality of arms."

After Mrs Khuzhina refused to participate further in the hearing in protest against the judge ’ s decision and walked out of the courtroom, the judge decided to proceed with the case in her absence and also in the absence of the applicants, finding that “there [were] no legal grounds to ensure the attendance of individuals who have committed particularly serious, insolent crimes”.

Even assuming that Article 139 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure could be a lawful basis for granting the press access to the case file, in the instant case the Court does not see any legitimate aim for the interference with the first applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life. Being in custody at the material time, he was not a fugitive from justice and the showing of his photograph could not have been necessary for enlisting public support to determine his whereabouts. Nor could it be said to have bolstered the public character of judicial proceedings because at the time of the recording and the first airing of the television show the trial had not yet begun.

It observed in that connection that the greater the information value for the public, the more the interest of a person in being protected against its publication had to yield, and vice versa.

The Federal Court of Justice found that the same could not be said, however, with regard to the information in the articles about the illness affecting Prince Rainier III, the reigning sovereign of the Principality of Monaco at the time, and the conduct of the members of his family during that illness. In the Federal Court of Justice’s opinion, that subject qualified as an event of contemporary society on which the magazines were entitled to report, and which entitled them to include the photos in question in that report as these supported and illustrated the information being conveyed.",

It is worth mentioning in this connection that the Federal Court of Justice upheld the injunction forbidding publication of two other photos showing the applicants in similar circumstances, precisely on the grounds that they were being published for entertainment purposes alone (see paragraphs 36-37 above). The Court can therefore accept that the photos in question, considered in the light of the accompanying articles, did contribute, at least to some degree, to a debate of general interest.

                "“72. The Court finds it hard to agree with the domestic courts’ interpretation of section 23(1) of the Copyright (Arts Domain) Act, which consists in describing a person as such as a figure of contemporary society ‘ par excellence ’. Since that definition affords the person very limited protection of their private life or the right to control the use of their image, it could conceivably be appropriate for politicians exercising official functions. However, it cannot be justified for a ‘private’ individual, such as the applicant, in whom the interest of the general public and the press is based solely on her membership of a reigning family, whereas she herself does not exercise any official functions.",
                "In any event the Court considers that, in these conditions, the Act has to be interpreted narrowly to ensure that the State complies with its positive obligation under the Convention to protect private life and the right to control the use of one’s image.",
                "73. Lastly, the distinction drawn between figures of contemporary society ‘ par excellence ’ and ‘relatively’ public figures has to be clear and obvious so that, in a State governed by the rule of law, the individual has precise indications as to the behaviour he or she should adopt. Above all, they need to know exactly when and where they are in a protected sphere or, on the contrary, in a sphere in which they must expect interference from others, especially the tabloid press.",
                "74. The Court therefore considers that the criteria on which the domestic courts based their decisions were not sufficient to protect the applicant’s private life effectively. As a figure of contemporary society ‘ par excellence ’ she cannot – in the name of freedom of the press and the public interest – rely on protection of her private life unless she is in a secluded place out of the public eye and, moreover, succeeds in proving it (which can be difficult). Where that is not the case, she has to accept that she might be photographed at almost any time, systematically, and that the photos are then very widely disseminated even if, as was the case here, the photos and accompanying articles relate exclusively to details of her private life.",
                "75. In the Court’s view, the criterion of spatial isolation, although apposite in theory, is in reality too vague and difficult for the person concerned to determine in advance. In the present case, merely classifying the applicant as a figure of contemporary society ‘ par excellence ’ does not suffice to justify such an intrusion into her private life.”"

According to that new concept of protection, section 23(1) of the Copyright Act, which provided for an exception to the rule according to which a photo could not be published without the prior consent of the person concerned, took account of the public’s interest in being informed and of the freedom of the press. Accordingly, when assessing whether or not the impugned publication portrayed an aspect of contemporary society within the meaning of section 23(1)(1) of the Copyright Act, a balancing exercise had to be undertaken between the rights under Articles 1 § 1 and 2 § 1 of the Basic Law and Article 8 of the Convention on the one hand, and those under Article 5 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law and Article 10 of the Convention on the other hand."

It considered that, irrespective of the issue whether the first applicant should be regarded as a figure of contemporary society par excellence, she was in any case a well-known person who particularly attracted public attention. In the court’s view, that fact, combined with the fact that she had not been in a secluded place out of the public eye when the photos had been taken, was nonetheless insufficient to deprive her of protection of her private sphere.

There could be no exception to the obligation to obtain the consent of the person in question unless the report in question concerned an important event of contemporary society. The expression “contemporary society” – and indeed the term “information value” – had to be interpreted in a broad sense and according to whether there was a public interest.

The greater the information value for the general public, the more the right to protection had to yield. Conversely, where the interest in informing the public decreased, the importance of protecting the person concerned carried correspondingly greater weight.

The Federal Constitutional Court observed, firstly, that the court decisions constituted an interference with the first applicant’s right to the protection of her personality rights guaranteed by Articles 1 § 1 and 2 § 1 of the Basic Law. There were limits on the protection afforded to that right and on the freedom of the press, however. The freedom of the press was subject to the restrictions laid down in sections 22 et seq. of the Copyright Act and Article 8 of the Convention, whilst the provisions of the Copyright Act and Article 10 of the Convention limited the right to the protection of personality rights. In the German legal order the Convention had the status of an ordinary federal law. At constitutional-law level, the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention and the Court’s case-law served as guides to interpretation when determining the content and scope of a fundamental right."

The Federal Constitutional Court reiterated the case-law of the Court regarding Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention and its own case-law on the different fundamental rights at stake by referring to the principles established in its leading judgment of 15 December 1999 ( Von Hannover, cited above, § 25). It added that in so far as an image did not itself make any contribution to the formation of public opinion, its information value had to be assessed in the context of the accompanying article. However, if that article was merely a pretext for publishing a photo of a well-known person, no contribution was made to the formation of public opinion and there were therefore no grounds for allowing the interest in publication to prevail over the protection of personality rights."

            [
                "43. The Federal Constitutional Court went on to say that, in order to determine the weight to be attached to the protection of personality rights, regard had to be had not only to the circumstances in which the photo had been taken, for example whether it had been taken surreptitiously or as a result of persistent hounding by photographers, but also to the situation in which the person concerned had been photographed and how he or she was portrayed. The right to protection of personality rights thus carried more weight where the photo showed details of the person’s private life that were not normally the subject of public discussion. The same was true where the person concerned could legitimately expect, having regard to the circumstances, that no photo would be published because he or she was in a private place ( räumliche Privatheit ), such as in a specially protected location. The right to protection of personality rights could also prevail over the interest in publication in cases other than those of spatial isolation, notably where the person concerned was pictured enjoying a moment of relaxation or letting go, freed from the constraints of professional or everyday life."

                "44. The Federal Constitutional Court stated that importance had to be attached in that connection to the allocation of procedural obligations regarding the presentation of the facts and the burden of proof. It had to be ensured that neither the press nor the person being photographed was prevented from adducing proof of circumstances relevant for the balancing of the competing interests. Where the press intended to publish a photo without the consent of the person concerned, it could be required to substantiate the circumstances in which the photo had been taken in order to allow the courts to examine the question whether publication of the photo could be opposed on grounds of the legitimate expectations of the person photographed."

                "45. The Federal Constitutional Court observed that it was the task of the civil courts to apply and interpret the provisions of civil law in the light of the fundamental rights at stake while having regard to the Convention. It added that its own role was limited to examining whether the lower courts had had sufficient regard to the impact of fundamental rights when interpreting and applying the law and when balancing the competing rights. Such was also the scope of the scrutiny of the Constitutional Court regarding the question whether the courts had fulfilled their obligation to incorporate the Court’s relevant case-law into the national legal order ( Teilrechtsordnung ). The fact that the court’s balancing exercise of the various rights in multi-polar disputes – that is, disputes involving the interests of several different persons – and complex ones could also result in a different outcome was not sufficient reason for requiring the Federal Constitutional Court to correct a court decision. However, there would be a violation of the Constitution if the protective scope ( Schutzbereich ) or extent of a fundamental right had been wrongly determined and the balancing exercise were accordingly flawed, or if the requirements under constitutional law or the Convention had not been duly taken into account."

                "46. Applying those principles to the case submitted to it, the Federal Constitutional Court observed that the Federal Court of Justice and the criteria it had established were constitutionally unobjectionable. It considered in particular that nothing, from a constitutional-law perspective, had prevented the Federal Court of Justice from departing from its own established case-law in the field and developing a new concept of protection. The fact that it had not itself called into question, in its leading judgment of 15 December 1999, the former concept of protection established by the Federal Court of Justice merely meant that this had been in conformity with constitutional-law criteria. It did not mean, by extension, that a different concept could not meet those criteria. The Federal Court of Justice had not been prevented, in particular, from dispensing with the legal concept of “figure of contemporary society” and instead balancing the competing interests when examining the question whether a photo was an aspect of contemporary society and could accordingly be published without the consent of the person concerned (unless it interfered with a legitimate interest of the latter)."

Applying the criteria thus established to the photos in question, starting with the second and third ones on which an injunction had been imposed by the courts and then challenged by the publishing company Ehrlich & Sohn (see paragraph 40 above), the Federal Constitutional Court noted that the Federal Court of Justice had had regard to the fact that the second photo showed the applicant in a public place which was neither isolated nor out of public view. It had attached decisive weight, however, to the fact that the article concerned only the applicant’s skiing holiday, that is, a situation falling within the core area of private life and concerning the applicant’s need for peace and quiet, and the consequent lack of public interest other than satisfying public curiosity. Contrary to the submissions of the publishing company, the readers’ interest in the applicant’s fashionable ski suit did not amount to a public interest. Moreover, that aspect had not been mentioned anywhere in the article."

                "48. In the opinion of the Federal Constitutional Court, the same conclusion had to be drawn with regard to the third photo whose publication had been challenged by the first applicant. There had been no public interest, beyond merely satisfying public curiosity, in the information contained in either the article commenting on the first applicant and her husband’s trip to St Moritz to celebrate the latter’s birthday or the photo showing them both in a chairlift. Whilst the article had also mentioned the Rose Ball – an event which, according to the Federal Court of Justice, could possibly be regarded as an aspect of contemporary society – no link had been made between that event and the photo."

                "49. With regard to the first photo, the Federal Constitutional Court found that the Federal Court of Justice had had valid grounds for considering that the reigning Prince of Monaco’s ill-health was a matter of general interest and that the press had accordingly been entitled to report on the manner in which the prince’s children reconciled their obligations of family solidarity with the legitimate needs of their private life, among which was the desire to go on holiday. The conclusion reached by the Federal Court of Justice, according to which the photo that had been published had a sufficiently close link with the event described in the article, was constitutionally unobjectionable."

However, the publishing company had given details about how the photo had been taken and the first applicant had not complained before the lower civil courts or the Federal Court of Justice that those details were insufficient. In particular, she had not alleged that the photo had been taken in conditions that were unfavourable to her."

Pointing out that a complaint of that nature could be raised in constitutional proceedings if it was based on a fundamental right guaranteed by the Basic Law, it observed that the Federal Court of Justice had taken account of the judgments delivered in Von Hannover, cited above, and Karhuvaara and Iltalehti v. Finland (no. 53678/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ X) and had not failed to comply with its obligation to satisfy the criteria established by the Convention. The Federal Constitutional Court had undertaken an analysis of the Court’s relevant case-law and observed that the Court’s decisive criterion when balancing the competing rights was the question whether the report in its entirety (article and photo) contributed to the free formation of public opinion. Furthermore, a distinction had to be drawn between political figures, public figures and ordinary individuals. Whilst the latter enjoyed the greatest protection of the three groups, political figures could expect only a small degree of protection from media reports about themselves."

Italy, no. 50774/99, § 27, ECHR 2005-I), the first applicant was a public figure, which allowed the press – where there was an interest in informing the public – to publish photos, even of the person going about his or her daily business in public. Publication of that sort, which, moreover, attracted the protection of Article 10 of the Convention, could serve to exercise public scrutiny over the private conduct of persons who were influential in the economic, cultural or media sectors. The Federal Constitutional Court pointed out that the Court had previously criticised the approach taken by domestic courts which had applied over-restrictive criteria to the question whether the media were or were not reporting matters of public interest when they reported on circumstances relating to the private life of a person who was not part of political life ( Tønsbergs Blad A.S. and Haukom v. Norway, no. 510/04, § 87, 1 March 2007).

They pointed out that in the present cases the Federal Court of Justice and the Federal Constitutional Court had taken the Court’s case-law into consideration, particularly the Von Hannover judgment.

The Government observed that in respect of the other photos examined in the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court of 26 February 2008 either the Federal Court of Justice had upheld the injunction on their publication or they were the subject of a separate application before the Court.

The Government submitted that up until the Von Hannover judgment the German courts had used the hard and fast concept of “figure of contemporary society par excellence ”, which attracted only limited protection under German law. Following the Von Hannover judgment, the Federal Court of Justice had abandoned that concept and developed a new concept of (graduated) protection according to which it was henceforth necessary to show in respect of every photo why there was an interest in publishing it. Furthermore, under the new approach adopted by the Federal Court of Justice the balancing of competing interests consisted in determining whether the publication contributed to a public debate. The information value of the publication was of particular importance in that respect. In sum, the new case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, endorsed by the Federal Constitutional Court, afforded greater weight to the protection of personality rights, as evidenced by the fact that an injunction was imposed on publication of two of the initial three photos. Besides that, the photo in question and the articles accompanying it could be clearly differentiated from the photos and their commentaries that had been the subject of the Von Hannover judgment."

The Court had in several judgments referred to her as a public figure in order to differentiate her from a private individual (see Gurgenidze v. Georgia, no. 71678/01, § 40, 17 October 2006; Sciacca v. Italy, no. 50774/99, § 27, ECHR 2005-I; and Reklos and Davourlis v. Greece, no. 1234/05, § 38, 15 January 2009). In categorising the applicants as public figures the German courts had merely followed the Court’s case-law. As a member of a reigning dynasty, the first applicant appeared in public at official functions in the Principality. Moreover, she was the Chair of the Princess Grace Foundation, whose activities had been published by the Monegasque authorities in the official yearbook of the Principality."

                "81. The Government argued that the special nature of certain cases, such as the present ones, in which the domestic courts were required to balance the rights and interests of two or more private individuals lay in the fact that the proceedings before the Court were in fact a continuation of the original legal action, with each party to the domestic proceedings potentially able to apply to the Court. It was precisely for that reason that one result alone of the balancing exercise of the competing interests was insufficient, and that there should be a “corridor” of solutions within the confines of which the national courts should be allowed to give decisions in conformity with the Convention. Failing that, the Court would have to take the decision on every case itself, which could hardly be its role. Consequently, it should limit the scope of its scrutiny and intervene only where the domestic courts had not taken account of certain specific circumstances when undertaking the balancing exercise or where the result of that exercise was patently disproportionate (see, for example, Cumpănă and Mazăre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, §§ 111-20, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). The Government argued that where the relationship between State and citizen was concerned, a gain of freedom for the individual concerned involved only a loss of competence for the State, whereas in the relationship between two citizens the fact of attaching more weight to the right of one of the persons concerned restricted the right of the others, which was forbidden under Article 53 of the Convention. The scope of the Court’s scrutiny was accordingly reduced in such cases."

                "82. The Government highlighted the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State in the present case. That margin depended on the nature of the activities in question and the aim pursued by the restrictions. In its recent case-law, the Court had moreover left the State a broad margin of appreciation in cases concerning Article 8 of the Convention (see A. v. Norway, no. 28070/06, § 66, 9 April 2009, and Armonienė v. Lithuania, no. 36919/02, § 38, 25 November 2008). Generally speaking, the margin enjoyed by the States was broader where there was no European consensus. In the Government’s submission, whilst there was admittedly a trend towards harmonisation of the legal systems in Europe, differences nevertheless remained, as evidenced by the failure of the negotiations for the adoption of a regulation of the European Union on conflict-of-law rules regarding non-contractual obligations (Regulation EC No. 864/2007 of 11 July 2007 – Rome II Regulation). The margin of appreciation was also broad where the national authorities had to strike a balance between competing private and public interests or Convention rights (see Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, § 78, ECHR 2007 ‑ V, and Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, § 77, ECHR 2007 ‑ I). Moreover, the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union apparently took the same approach (cases of Schmidberger of 12 June 2003, C-112/00, and Omega of 14 October 2004, C-36/02)."

Since the first applicant had lost her first husband in a tragic accident in 1985, the media had realised that the story of the widow and her three young children would sell well and provided a lucrative market. Although it was illegal under the French Civil Code to take or publish such photos in France, the applicants had nonetheless been pursued by paparazzi who could sell the photos in other markets, particularly in Germany. Whereas the public had never heard of the second applicant before, he had also been pursued by paparazzi since his marriage to the first applicant and the birth of their child. In accordance with decisions of the German civil courts, upheld by the Federal Constitutional Court in 1999, the applicants had been able to oppose publication of such photos only where they were in a secluded location, out of public view. The applicants had constantly been aware of being observed, pursued and hounded and had therefore had high hopes after the adoption of the Von Hannover judgment, in which the Court had called into question the case-law of the domestic courts. They had accordingly brought six test cases regarding photos comparable to those that had been the subject of the Von Hannover judgment. It would appear that the German authorities had not been ready to follow that judgment, however. This was evidenced both by the statements of the Federal Minister of Justice and the German Chancellor at the time, according to which the Court’s judgment was not binding on the German courts because the case ‑ law of the Federal Constitutional Court was of higher ranking than the Convention, and by the opinions expressed by the respective reporting judges in the Caroline von Hannover cases before the Federal Constitutional Court in an interview and in a legal article published in 2004 and 2009 respectively."

The Court of Appeal had clearly stated in the present case that the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court of 1999 took precedence. The Federal Court of Justice and the Federal Constitutional Court, for their part, had circumvented the Von Hannover judgment and continued to rely on the concept of figure of contemporary society ( par excellence ) that had been called into question by the Court, by using the terms “prominent persons” or “high-profile persons”, and referring – de facto – to the spatial-isolation factor by using the expression “moment of relaxation or letting go, freed from the constraints of professional or everyday life”. The applicants continued to be the subject of press articles on their daily and private life and to be hounded by paparazzi, with the German courts doing nothing to put a stop to this. As it was impossible for them to know whether they were protected from harassment by paparazzi, they complained of an intolerable situation of legal insecurity and a considerable risk of litigation and costs resulting from that."

There were only a few sentences informing the reader about his illness; the article was mainly about the private life of the applicants and other members of the prince’s family. The prince’s illness had been merely a pretext for extensive coverage of the applicants’ private life. It was already doubtful whether publication of the photo of Prince Rainier with his daughter Stéphanie could be justified, so publication of the photo complained of in this case was clearly unjustified. Even if there was information value in the prince’s illness, there was no genuine link between the applicants’ skiing holiday and that illness.

It was precisely when a family member was suffering from a long-term illness that the relatives needed special protection during the few days that they could relax. If a relative’s poor health were sufficient grounds upon which to publish photos, the Article 8 guarantees would be undermined and the press could permanently report on the applicants’ private life. Where the photos showed the applicants visiting the prince, the event of contemporary society would be the visit, and where they were elsewhere the event would be their absence.

They thus had a legitimate expectation that their private life would be protected. Moreover, unlike the Court, the German courts had not taken account of the fact that the applicants were being permanently observed and hounded by paparazzi and that the photos had been taken without their knowledge or consent.

The differences that remained were merely in the nuances. The Von Hannover judgment was part of a line of established case-law and had subsequently been confirmed many times. The applicants expressed surprise, moreover, that the Court, as a supreme European court, should have less extensive powers of scrutiny than those exercised by the Federal Constitutional Court, which, in the proceedings in respect of the photo published in the magazine 7 Tage (paragraph 40 above), had overridden the opinion of the eleven professional judges who had examined the case and substituted its own opinion down to the last detail.",

The association submitted that the press, in its role of “public watchdog”, had the task not only of watching over parliaments, governance and other political events, but also of observing public life in general whether in politics, the economy, the arts, the social sphere, sport or any other domain. Like members of other royal families, the first applicant had a function as a role model and was unquestionably a public figure. The third-party association pointed out that, since 2003, the first applicant had been a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, a title bestowed on famous persons such as Nelson Mandela, Claudia Cardinale or Pierre Cardin. The Court had, moreover, described the first applicant as a public figure in judgments delivered after the Von Hannover judgment.

Moreover, as the daughter of the late sovereign prince of a European country, sister of the current sovereign prince and wife of the Head of a former German noble dynasty, the first applicant was undeniably a public figure who attracted attention, at least in Europe. The publishing company submitted, lastly, that following the Von Hannover judgment delivered by the Court in 2004, the German courts had departed from precedent by restricting the possibility of publishing photographs of persons taken outside official events and without the consent of the interested parties and had thus severely curtailed the freedom of information and of the press."

In determining whether there had been an interference, regard had to be had to all the circumstances and a certain level of seriousness was required. It was vital that media reporting upon all matters of public interest was strongly protected. In the Association’s submission, whilst the Court had rightly held, in its Von Hannover judgment, that regard had to be had to the context in which a photo had been taken, it had gone too far in asserting – in error – that publication of any photo fell within the scope of Article 8. The Court had unfortunately confirmed that position in subsequent judgments. The association maintained that the correct approach was first to examine whether the photo that had been published did or did not fall within the private sphere. In that context consideration had to be given to whether the person concerned, having regard to all the circumstances, had a legitimate expectation of privacy. If not, that was the end of the matter as Article 8 of the Convention did not apply. If yes, the domestic courts had to balance competing rights – of equal status – under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention, whilst taking account of all the circumstances of the case. The balancing exercise and the outcome were matters that fell within the margin of appreciation of the States.

They invited the Court to grant a broad margin of appreciation to the Contracting States, submitting that such was the thrust of Article 53 of the Convention. They referred to the Court’s judgment in Chassagnou and Others v. France ([GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 113, ECHR 1999 ‑ III), submitting that the Court had indicated that it would allow the Contracting States a wide margin of appreciation in situations of competing interests. The Contracting States were likewise generally granted a wider margin in respect of positive obligations in relationships between private parties or other areas in which opinions within a democratic society might reasonably differ significantly (see Fretté v. France, no. 36515/97, § 41, ECHR 2002 ‑ I). The Court had, moreover, already allowed the Contracting States a broad margin of appreciation in a case concerning a balancing exercise in respect of rights under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention (see A. v. Norway, cited above, § 66). Its role was precisely to confirm that the Contracting States had put in place a mechanism for the determination of a fair balance and whether particular factors taken into account by the national courts in striking such a balance were consistent with the Convention and its case-law. It should only intervene where the domestic courts had considered irrelevant factors to be significant or where the conclusions reached by the domestic courts were clearly arbitrary or summarily dismissive of the privacy or reputational interests at stake.

Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, among other authorities, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 42, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV; and Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 45, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV)."

Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, regarding in particular protection of the reputation and rights of others, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest. Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas; the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of “public watchdog” (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, §§ 59 and 62, ECHR 1999 ‑ III, and Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 71, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI).",
                "Furthermore, is not for the Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted in a particular case (see Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 31, Series A no. 298, and Stoll v. Switzerland [GC], no. 69698/01, § 146, ECHR 2007 ‑ V)."

This is nonetheless an area in which the protection of the rights and reputation of others takes on particular importance, as the photos may contain very personal or even intimate information about an individual or his or her family (see Von Hannover, cited above, § 59; Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France, no. 71111/01, § 42, 14 June 2007; and Eerikäinen and Others v. Finland, no. 3514/02, § 70, 10 February 2009).",

France (dec.), nos. 66910/01 and 71612/01, 1 July 2003, and Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS ), cited above, § 40), are often taken in a climate of continual harassment which may induce in the person concerned a very strong sense of intrusion into their private life or even of persecution (see Von Hannover, cited above, § 59, and Gurgenidze, cited above, § 59).",

There are different ways of ensuring respect for private life and the nature of the State’s obligation will depend on the particular aspect of private life that is at issue (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, § 24, and Odièvre v. France [GC], no. 42326/98, § 46, ECHR 2003 ‑ III).",

Finland, no. 53678/00, § 38, ECHR 2004-X). In exercising its supervisory function, the Court’s task is not to take the place of the national courts, but rather to review, in the light of the case as a whole, whether the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provisions of the Convention relied on (see Petrenco v. Moldova, no. 20928/05, § 54, 30 March 2010; Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v. Spain, no. 34147/06, § 41, 21 September 2010; and Petrov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 27103/04, 2 November 2010)."

Indeed, as a matter of principle these rights deserve equal respect (see Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS ), cited above, § 41; Timciuc v.

ED. Ciné Revue, cited above, § 68; and Standard Verlags GmbH, cited above, § 46). The definition of what constitutes a subject of general interest will depend on the circumstances of the case. The Court nevertheless considers it useful to point out that it has recognised the existence of such an interest not only where the publication concerned political issues or crimes (see White, cited above, § 29; Egeland and Hanseid v. Norway, no. 34438/04, § 58, 16 April 2009; and Leempoel & S.A. ED.

Austria, no. 5266/03, § 25, 22 February 2007; Colaço Mestre and SIC – Sociedade Independente de Comunicação, S.A. v. Portugal, nos. 11182/03 and 11319/03, § 28, 26 April 2007; and Sapan v. Turkey, no. 44102/04, § 34, 8 June 2010). However, the rumoured marital difficulties of the President of a country or the financial difficulties of a famous singer were not deemed to be matters of general interest (see Standard Verlags GmbH, cited above, § 52, and Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS ), cited above, § 43).",

The role or function of the person concerned and the nature of the activities that are the subject of the report and/or photo constitute another important criterion, related to the preceding one. In that connection a distinction has to be made between private individuals and persons acting in a public context, as political figures or public figures. Accordingly, whilst a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life, the same is not true of public figures (see Minelli v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 14991/02, 14 June 2005, and Petrenco, cited above, § 55). A fundamental distinction needs to be made between reporting facts capable of contributing to a debate in a democratic society, relating to politicians in the exercise of their official functions for example, and reporting details of the private life of an individual who does not exercise such functions (see Von Hannover, cited above, § 63, and Standard Verlags GmbH, cited above, § 47).",
                "While in the former case the press exercises its role of “public watchdog” in a democracy by imparting information and ideas on matters of public interest, that role appears less important in the latter case. Similarly, although in certain special circumstances the public’s right to be informed can even extend to aspects of the private life of public figures, particularly where politicians are concerned, this will not be the case – despite the person concerned being well known to the public – where the published photos and accompanying commentaries relate exclusively to details of the person’s private life and have the sole aim of satisfying public curiosity in that respect (see Von Hannover, cited above, § 65 with the references cited therein, and Standard Verlags GmbH, cited above, § 53; see also point 8 of the Resolution of the Parliamentary Assembly – paragraph 71 above). In the latter case, freedom of expression calls for a narrower interpretation (see Von Hannover, cited above, § 66; Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS ), cited above, § 40; and MGN Limited, cited above, § 143).",

However, the mere fact of having cooperated with the press on previous occasions cannot serve as an argument for depriving the party concerned of all protection against publication of the photo at issue (see Egeland and Hanseid, cited above, § 62).",

It observed in that connection that the greater the information value for the public, the more the interest of a person in being protected against its publication had to yield, and vice versa.

The Federal Court of Justice found that the same could not be said, however, with regard to the information in the articles about the illness affecting Prince Rainier III, the reigning sovereign of the Principality of Monaco at the time, and the conduct of the members of his family during that illness. In the Federal Court of Justice’s opinion, that subject qualified as an event of contemporary society on which the magazines were entitled to report, and which entitled them to include the photos in question in that report as these supported and illustrated the information being conveyed.",

Regarding the characterisation of Prince Rainier’s illness as an event of contemporary society, the Court is of the opinion that, having regard to the reasons advanced by the German courts, that interpretation cannot be considered unreasonable (see, mutatis mutandis, Editions Plon, cited above, §§ 46-57). It is worth mentioning in this connection that the Federal Court of Justice upheld the injunction forbidding publication of two other photos showing the applicants in similar circumstances, precisely on the grounds that they were being published for entertainment purposes alone (see paragraphs 36-37 above). The Court can therefore accept that the photos in question, considered in the light of the accompanying articles, did contribute, at least to some degree, to a debate of general interest. It would reiterate, on this point, that not only does the press have the task of imparting information and ideas on all matters of public interest, the public also has a right to receive them (see paragraph 102 above)."

Should that happen, it will be open to them to bring proceedings in the appropriate national courts. The Court also observes that the Federal Constitutional Court stated in its judgment that where an article was merely a pretext for publishing a photo of a prominent person, no contribution was thereby made to the formation of public opinion and there were therefore no grounds for allowing the interest in publication to prevail over the protection of personality rights."

After evaluating the surveillance file it found that the medical reports contradicted the images and videos showing the applicant walking her dog, driving a car long distances, going shopping, carrying groceries and opening the boot of the car by moving her arms above her head without noticeable restrictions or unusual behaviour. Moreover, it found that there were discrepancies, not only between the results of the surveillance and the medical reports but also between the medical reports which had been drafted before the surveillance. Finally, the examination of the applicant by a neurologist was necessary and admissible because she had previously refused to undergo an assessment of her functional capacities and a neurological examination, which were required in the circumstances. Accordingly, the Federal Court denied the probative value not only of the medical reports attesting to the applicant ’ s complete incapacity to work but also of the reports attesting to her incapacity to work of a lesser degree. Therefore, the insurance company had acted correctly in ordering a reassessment of her ability to work through a critical review of all previous medical reports.

As such, it is considered a public authority within the meaning of Article 1 § 2 ( e ) VwVG ... To the extent that it can deliver binding decisions to insured persons, and thus exercises sovereign powers, it has to respect not only the procedural guarantees of administrative law, but also general constitutional principles, in particular fundamental rights. ...",
                "4.3 The aim of surveillance of an insured person by private detectives is to collect and confirm facts which materialise in the public domain and may be observed by anyone (for example, walking, climbing stairs, driving, carrying loads or performing sports activities). Even when the surveillance is ordered by an authority, it does not give the person undertaking the surveillance the right to interfere with the privacy of the insured person. Unlike a judicially ordered surveillance – for instance, in the context of the Federal Act of 6 October 2000 on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications (BÜPF; SR 780.1) – the protection of the insured person from crime remains intact, since private detectives acting on the strength of an administrative order are not allowed to commit criminal acts. In particular, the person in charge of the surveillance has to keep to the framework set up by Article 179 quater of the Criminal Code. In contrast to a covert investigation pursuant to the Federal Law of 20 June 2003 on the undercover investigation ... it is not the purpose of such surveillance for the investigating person to create links with the person subject to the surveillance so as to penetrate into their environment ...",

It must, however, be examined whether these provisions are sufficiently clear to serve as a legal basis within the meaning of Article 36 § 1 [of the Constitution].",

Part of the literature represents the view that surveillance which is limited to such an extent does not even affect the scope of the fundamental right of privacy ( Ueli Kieser, supra). The core content of Article 13 [of the Constitution] is not affected by the institution of such surveillance. In principle, information obtained from insured persons, their employers and healthcare professionals is sufficient for a reliable assessment of claims for benefits; further investigation by a private detective is indicated only in a vanishingly small percentage of persons registered with accident insurance cases ... Ordering of secret surveillance is thus of an exceptional nature, as it will only take place if the other clarification measures fail to produce a conclusive result. The overall legal basis for the restriction of the fundamental rights of insured persons is thus sufficiently precise ...",

The probative value of the records and reports of private investigators can, however, only be granted in so far as they indicate activities and actions which the insured person has exercised without being influenced by those engaging in the surveillance ... ”",

Surveillance by a private investigator was requested only in a small proportion of cases when other measures of examination had proved inconclusive and the insured person had not fulfilled her or his obligation to provide the requested information.

The law only vaguely defined that surveillance could be carried out when it seemed to be “objectively justified”, but did not specify this concept further.

As to the first condition, surveillance would be permissible virtually any time that a victim of a traffic accident claimed a large amount in damages, which was usually the case. As to the second condition, the applicant pointed out that the findings of the medical reports did not depend on the victim of the accident, but on the medical experts in charge, who had often been commissioned by the insurance company itself."

In particular, the Federal Court repeatedly recognised that Article 43, read in conjunction with Article 28 (2) of the Social Security Act and Article 96 (b) of the Accident Insurance Act formed a sufficient legal basis for the surveillance of an insured person. The said provisions prescribed surveillance as a measure of last resort used when the insured person did not comply with her or his obligation to provide information requested and the insurance company had to process certain data necessary for it to perform the tasks assigned to it in domestic law. The law allowed the collection of data only in public spaces for a limited period of time and made it available only to a restricted number of persons."

Insured persons were protected against the abuse of surveillance measures by a number of domestic law provisions, namely Article 28 of the Civil Code and Article 179 quater of the Criminal Code. In particular, it was forbidden to contact the insured person in order to interfere with her or his life, surveillance could be performed only for a limited period of time, and collected data could be seen only by a small number of people for the fulfilment of the insurer ’ s legal tasks."

It also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring it to be accessible to the person concerned, who must, moreover, be able to foresee its consequences for him. It must also be compatible with the rule of law (see, among many other authorities, Rotaru v.

Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, § 229, 4 December 2015). Foreseeability in that specific context cannot mean that individuals should be able to foresee when the authorities are likely to resort to secret surveillance so that they can adapt their conduct accordingly. However, especially where a power vested in the executive is exercised in secret, the risks of arbitrariness are evident. The domestic law must be sufficiently clear to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances and conditions under which public authorities are empowered to resort to any such measures (see Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 51, Series A no. 116; Uzun, cited above, §§ 61-63; Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev v.

In view of the risk of abuse intrinsic to any system of secret surveillance, such measures must be based on a law that is particularly precise, especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated (see Uzun, cited above, § 61)."

In addition, in the context of secret measures of surveillance by public authorities, because of the lack of public scrutiny and the risk of abuse of power, compatibility with the rule of law requires domestic law to provide adequate protection against arbitrary interference with Article 8 rights. The Court ’ s assessment in this respect depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to permit, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law (see Uzun, cited above, § 63 ).",

Turning to the present case, it is not in dispute that the surveillance measure applied to the applicant was based on Article 43 read in conjunction with Article 28 (2) of the Social Security Act and Article 96 (b) of the Accident Insurance Act (see § § 3 8 and 40 above). These articles, read together, provide that when an insured person does not comply with the obligation to submit the requested information, insurance companies are allowed to take of their own motion the necessary investigative measures and collect necessary information. In particular, they are allowed to process and require to have processed personal data, including sensitive data and personality profiles necessary in order to establish rights to benefits and to calculate, allocate and coordinate them with those from other social insurance funds."

In the Court ’ s view, the said expressions did not seem to either expressly include or even imply the recording of images or videos among the investigative measures that could be deployed by insurance companies. However, it observes that the domestic courts, which are primarily called upon to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among many other authorities, Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, § 59, Reports 1998 ‑ II), concluded that the said provisions covered surveillance in such circumstances (see §§ 35 and 43 above)."

Furthermore, in the absence of any details as regards the maximum duration of the surveillance measures or the possibility of their judicial challenge, insurance companies (acting as public authorities) were granted a wide discretion in deciding which circumstances justified such surveillance and for how long. It can thus not be said that the domestic law had set a strict standard for authorising the surveillance measure at issue (see, a contrario, Uzun, cited above, § 70)."

In the Government ’ s view, this placed in context the need for clarity and precision of the legal basis of the surveillance in question. While the Court can agree that surveillance in the present case must be considered to interfere less with a person ’ s private life than, for instance, telephone tapping, it nonetheless has to adhere to general principles on adequate protection against arbitrary interference with Article 8 rights as summarised above (see § 68 above; see also Uzun, cited above, §§ 66 and 72 )."

In particular, it did not, as required by the Court ’ s case-law, set out sufficient safeguards against abuse.

As a consequence, the Social Insurance Court excluded the surveillance report from the evidence. On appeal, the Federal Court concluded that, under its own jurisprudence, the surveillance had not been unlawful, and so it took the surveillance report into evidence. It followed that the applicant had had the opportunity to challenge the impugned evidence and oppose its use in adversarial proceedings.

The applicant argued that Order no. 70, which had never been published, unduly restricted his right to privacy. He asked the court to issue an injunction ordering the removal of the equipment installed pursuant to Order no. 70, and to ensure that access to mobile-telephone communications was given to authorised persons only. The Ministry of Communications and the St Petersburg and Leningrad Region Department of the FSB were joined as a third party to the proceedings."

The equipment to which he referred had been installed to enable law-enforcement agencies to conduct operational-search activities in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law.

Those documents had included two judicial orders retrospectively authorising the interception of mobile-telephone communications and an addendum to the standard service - provider agreement issued by one of the mobile-network operators. One of the judicial orders in question, issued on 8 October 2002, authorised the interception of several people ’ s mobile-telephone communications during the periods from 1 to 5 April, 19 to 23 June, 30 June to 4 July and 16 to 20 October 2001. The other judicial order, issued on 18 July 2003, authorised the interception of a Mr E. ’ s mobile-telephone communications during the period from 11 April to 11 October 2003. As to the addendum, it informed the subscriber that if his number were used to make terrorist threats, the mobile - network operator might suspend the provision of the telephone service and transfer the collected data to the law-enforcement agencies. In the applicant ’ s opinion, the judicial orders and the addendum proved that the mobile-network operators and law-enforcement agencies were technically capable of intercepting all telephone communications without obtaining prior judicial authorisation, and routinely resorted to unauthorised interception."

Nor had he shown that there was a danger that his right to the privacy of his telephone communications might be unlawfully infringed. To establish the existence of such a danger, the applicant would have had to prove that the respondents had acted unlawfully. However, mobile-network operators were required by law to install equipment enabling law-enforcement agencies to perform operational-search activities and the existence of that equipment did not in itself interfere with the privacy of the applicant ’ s communications. The refusal to admit the judicial orders of 8 October 2002 and 18 July 2003 in evidence had been lawful, as the judicial orders had been issued in respect of third persons and were irrelevant to the applicant ’ s case. The City Court further decided to admit in evidence and examine the addendum to the service - provider agreement, but found that it did not contain any information warranting reconsideration of the District Court ’ s judgment."

It held, in particular, that a judge was to authorise investigative measures involving interference with constitutional rights only if he was persuaded that such measures were lawful, necessary and justified, that is, compatible with all the requirements of the OSAA. The burden of proof was on the requesting State agency to show the necessity of the measures. Supporting materials were to be produced to the judge at his request. Given that some of those materials might contain State secrets, only judges with the necessary level of security clearance could examine authorisation requests. Further, relying on the need to keep the surveillance measures secret, the Constitutional Court held that the principles of a public hearing and adversarial proceedings were not applicable to the authorisation proceedings. The fact that the person concerned was not entitled to participate in the authorisation proceedings, to be informed of the decision taken or to appeal to a higher court did not therefore violate that person ’ s constitutional rights."

The judgment the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU ) of 8 April 2014 in the joined cases of Digital Rights Ireland and Seitinger and Others (C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238) declared invalid the Data Retention Directive 2006/24/EC laying down the obligation on the providers of publicly available electronic communication services or of public communications networks to retain all traffic and location data for periods from six months to two years, in order to ensure that the data were available for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each member State in its national law. The CJEU noted that, even though the Directive did not permit the retention of the content of the communication, the traffic and location data covered by it might allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data had been retained. Accordingly, the obligation to retain those data constituted in itself an interference with the right to respect for private life and communications guaranteed by Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the right to protection of personal data under its Article 8. Furthermore, the access of the competent national authorities to the data constituted a further interference with those fundamental rights. The CJEU further held that the interference was particularly serious. The fact that data were retained and subsequently used without the subscriber or registered user being informed was likely to generate in the minds of the persons concerned the feeling that their private lives were the subject of constant surveillance. The interference satisfied an objective of general interest, namely to contribute to the fight against serious crime and terrorism and thus, ultimately, to public security. However, it failed to satisfy the requirement of proportionality. Firstly, the Directive covered, in a generalised manner, all persons and all means of electronic communication as well as all traffic data without any differentiation, limitation or exception being made in the light of the objective of fighting against serious crime. It therefore entailed an interference with the fundamental rights of practically the entire European population. It applied even to persons for whom there was no evidence capable of suggesting that their conduct might have a link, even an indirect or remote one, with serious crime. Secondly, the Directive did not contain substantive and procedural conditions relating to the access of the competent national authorities to the data and to their subsequent use. By simply referring, in a general manner, to serious crime, as defined by each member State in its national law, the Directive failed to lay down any objective criterion by which to determine which offences might be considered to be sufficiently serious to justify such an extensive interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. Above all, the access by the competent national authorities to the data retained was not made dependent on a prior review carried out by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision sought to limit access to the data and their use to what was strictly necessary for the purpose of attaining the objective pursued. Thirdly, the Directive required that all data be retained for a period of at least six months, without any distinction being made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The CJEU concluded that the Directive entailed a wide-ranging and particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, without such an interference being precisely circumscribed by provisions to ensure that it was actually limited to what was strictly necessary. The CJEU also noted that the Directive did not provide for sufficient safeguards, by means of technical and organisational measures, to ensure effective protection of the data retained against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access and use of those data.",

They argued that the approach to victim status established in the cases of Klass and Others v. Germany ( 6 September 1978, § 34, Series A no. 28) and Malone v. the United Kingdom (2 August 1984, § 64, Series A no. 82) – according to which an individual might, under certain conditions, claim to be the victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret measures or of legislation permitting secret measures, without having to allege that such measures had in fact been applied to him– could not be interpreted so broadly as to encompass every person in the respondent State who feared that the security services might have compiled information about him. An applicant was required to demonstrate that there was a “reasonable likelihood” that the security services had compiled and retained information concerning his private life (they referred to Esbester v. the United Kingdom, no. 18601/91, Commission decision of 2 April 1993, unreported; Redgrave v. the United Kingdom, no. 20271/92, Commission decision of 1 September 1993, unreported; Matthews v. the United Kingdom, no. 28576/95, Commission decision of 16 October 1996, unreported; Halford v. the United Kingdom, 25 June 1997, § 17, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ III; Weber and Saravia v.

                "155. Firstly, there was no “reasonable likelihood”, or indeed any risk whatsoever, that the applicant had been subjected to surveillance measures because he had not been suspected of any criminal offences. The fact that he was the editor-in-chief of a publishing company could not serve as a ground for interception under Russian law. The Government asserted that the applicant ’ s telephone conversations had never been intercepted. The applicant had not produced any proof to the contrary. The documents submitted by him in the domestic proceedings had concerned third persons and had not contained any proof that his telephone had been tapped."

                "156. Secondly, remedies were available at the national level to challenge both the alleged insufficiency of safeguards against abuse in Russian law and any specific surveillance measures applied to an individual. It was possible to request that the Constitutional Court review the constitutionality of the Operational-Search Activities Act of 12 August 1995 (no. 144 ‑ FZ – “the OSAA”). It was also possible to lodge a complaint with the Supreme Court, as had been successfully done by Mr N., who had obtained a finding of unlawfulness in respect of a provision of the Ministry of Communications ’ Order no. 130 (see paragraph 128 above ). As regards Order no. 70, contrary to the applicant ’ s allegations, it had been duly published (see paragraph 181 below) and could therefore be challenged in the courts. A person whose communications had been intercepted unlawfully without prior judicial authorisation could also obtain redress in a civil court. The Government referred to the Supreme Court ’ s judgment of 15 July 2009, which found that the installation of a video camera in the claimant ’ s office and the tapping of his office telephone had been unlawful because those surveillance measures had been carried out without prior judicial authorisation (see also paragraphs 219 - 24 below).

Bulgaria ( no. 62540/00, 28 June 2007) where the Court had refused to apply the “reasonable likelihood” test because of the absence of any safeguards against unlawful interception in Bulgaria. Given that Russian law provided for adequate and sufficient safeguards against abuse in the sphere of interception of communications, including available remedies, in the Government ’ s opinion the applicant could not claim an interference as a result of the mere existence of legislation permitting secret surveillance. In the absence of a “reasonable likelihood” that his telephone communications had been intercepted, he could not claim to be a victim of the alleged violation of Article 8 of the Convention."

In Liberty and Others v. the United Kingdom (no. 58243/00, §§ 56 - 57, 1 July 2008), the Court found that the existence of powers permitting the authorities to intercept communications constituted an interference with the Article 8 rights of the applicants, since they were persons to whom these powers might have been applied. In Kennedy (cited above, § 124) that test had been further elaborated upon to include the assessment of availability of any remedies at the national level and the risk of secret surveillance measures being applied to the applicant. Finally, in Mersch and Others v. Luxemburg (nos. 10439/83 and 5 others, Commission decision of 10 May 1985, Decisions and Reports 43 ) the Commission found that, in those cases where the authorities had no obligation to notify the persons concerned about the surveillance measures to which they had been subjected, the applicants could claim to be “victims” of a violation of the Convention on account of the mere existence of secret - surveillance legislation, even though they could not allege in support of their applications that they had been subjected to an actual measure of surveillance."

The OSAA, taken together with the FSB Act, the Communications Act and the Orders adopted by the Ministry of Communication, such as Order no. 70, permitted the security services to intercept, through technical means, any person ’ s communications without obtaining prior judicial authorisation for interception. In particular, the security services had no obligation to show the interception authorisation to anyone, including the communications service provider. The contested legislation therefore permitted blanket interception of communications."

He also submitted a copy of the decision of 24 May 2010 by the Supreme Commercial Court finding that the Orders by the Ministry of Communications requiring communications providers to install equipment enabling the authorities to perform operational-search activities were not subject to judicial review in commercial courts. The domestic proceedings brought by the applicant had shown that Order no. 70 could not be effectively challenged before the Russian courts. Further, as far as the OSAA was concerned, the Constitutional Court had already examined its constitutionality on a number of occasions and had found that it was compatible with the Constitution. Finally, as regards the possibility of challenging individual surveillance measures, the applicant submitted that the person concerned was not notified of the interception, unless the intercepted material had been used as evidence in criminal proceedings against him. In the absence of notification, the domestic remedies were ineffective (see also paragraph 217 below)."

The Court has consistently held in its case-law that the Convention does not provide for the institution of an actio popularis and that its task is not normally to review the relevant law and practice in abstracto, but to determine whether the manner in which they were applied to, or affected, the applicant gave rise to a violation of the Convention (see, among other authorities, N.C. v. Italy [GC], no. 24952/94, § 56, ECHR 2002 ‑ X; Krone Verlag GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria (no. 4), no. 72331/01, § 26, 9 November 2006; and Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC], no. 47848/08, § 101, ECHR 2014 ). Accordingly, in order to be able to lodge an application in accordance with Article 34, an individual must be able to show that he was “directly affected” by the measure complained of. This is indispensable for putting the protection mechanism of the Convention into motion, although this criterion is not to be applied in a rigid, mechanical and inflexible way throughout the proceedings (see Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu, cited above, § 96 )."

Thus, the Court has permitted general challenges to the relevant legislative regime in the sphere of secret surveillance in recognition of the particular features of secret surveillance measures and the importance of ensuring effective control and supervision of them. In Klass and Others the Court held that an individual might, under certain conditions, claim to be the victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret measures or of legislation permitting secret measures, without having to allege that such measures had in fact been applied to him. The relevant conditions were to be determined in each case according to the Convention right or rights alleged to have been infringed, the secret character of the measures objected to, and the connection between the applicant and those measures (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 34 ). The Court explained the reasons for its approach as follows.",
                "“ 36. The Court points out that where a State institutes secret surveillance the existence of which remains unknown to the persons being controlled, with the effect that the surveillance remains unchallengeable, Article 8 could to a large extent be reduced to a nullity. It is possible in such a situation for an individual to be treated in a manner contrary to Article 8, or even to be deprived of the right granted by that Article, without his being aware of it and therefore without being able to obtain a remedy either at the national level or before the Convention institutions.",
                "The Court finds it unacceptable that the assurance of the enjoyment of a right guaranteed by the Convention could be thus removed by the simple fact that the person concerned is kept unaware of its violation. A right of recourse to the Commission for persons potentially affected by secret surveillance is to be derived from Article 25 [currently Article 34 ], since otherwise Article 8 runs the risk of being nullified.",
                "37. As to the facts of the particular case, the Court observes that the contested legislation institutes a system of surveillance under which all persons in the Federal Republic of Germany can potentially have their mail, post and telecommunications monitored, without their ever knowing this unless there has been either some indiscretion or subsequent notification in the circumstances laid down in the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s judgment ... To that extent, the disputed legislation directly affects all users or potential users of the postal and telecommunication services in the Federal Republic of Germany. Furthermore, as the Delegates rightly pointed out, this menace of surveillance can be claimed in itself to restrict free communication through the postal and telecommunication services, thereby constituting for all users or potential users a direct interference with the right guaranteed by Article 8.",

Having regard to the specific circumstances of the present case, the Court concludes that each of the applicants is entitled to ‘ (claim) to be the victim of a violation ’ of the Convention, even though he is not able to allege in support of his application that he has been subject to a concrete measure of surveillance. The question whether the applicants were actually the victims of any violation of the Convention involves determining whether the contested legislation is in itself compatible with the Convention ’ s provisions."

In several cases the Commission and the Court held that the test in Klass and Others could not be interpreted so broadly as to encompass every person in the respondent State who feared that the security services might have compiled information about him. An applicant could not, however, be reasonably expected to prove that information concerning his private life had been compiled and retained. It was sufficient, in the area of secret measures, that the existence of practices permitting secret surveillance be established and that there was a reasonable likelihood that the security services had compiled and retained information concerning his private life (see Esbester, cited above; Redgrave, cited above; Christie v. the United Kingdom, no. 21482/93, Commission decision of 27 June 1994, Decisions and Reports 78-A; Matthews, cited above; Halford, cited above, § § 47 and 55 ‑ 57; and Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria, no. 65755/01, §§ 49 - 50, 22 May 2008). In all of the above cases, the applicants alleged actual interception of their communications.

In other cases the Court reiterated the Klass and Others approach that the mere existence of laws and practices which permitted and established a system for effecting secret surveillance of communications entailed a threat of surveillance for all those to whom the legislation might be applied. This threat necessarily affected freedom of communication between users of the telecommunications services and thereby amounted in itself to an interference with the exercise of the applicants ’ rights under Article 8, irrespective of any measures actually taken against them ( see Malone, cited above, § 64; Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 78; Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, §§ 58 - 59 and 69; Liberty and Others, cited above, §§ 56 - 57; and Iordachi and Others v.

Finally, in its most recent case on the subject, Kennedy, the Court held that sight should not be lost of the special reasons justifying the Court ’ s departure, in cases concerning secret measures, from its general approach to deny individuals the right to challenge a law in abstracto. The principal reason was to ensure that the secrecy of such measures did not result in the measures being effectively unchallengeable and outside the supervision of the national judicial authorities and the Court. In order to assess, in a particular case, whether an individual can claim an interference as a result of the mere existence of legislation permitting secret surveillance measures, the Court must have regard to the availability of any remedies at the national level and the risk of secret surveillance measures being applied to him. Where there is no possibility of challenging the alleged application of secret surveillance measures at domestic level, widespread suspicion and concern among the general public that secret surveillance powers are being abused cannot be said to be unjustified. In such cases, even where the actual risk of surveillance is low, there is a greater need for scrutiny by this Court (see Kennedy, cited above, § 124).",

The Court considers, against this background, that it is necessary to clarify the conditions under which an applicant can claim to be the victim of a violation of Article 8 without having to prove that secret surveillance measures had in fact been applied to him, so that a uniform and foreseeable approach may be adopted."
            ],
            [
                "171. In the Court ’ s view the Kennedy approach is best tailored to the need to ensure that the secrecy of surveillance measures does not result in the measures being effectively unchallengeable and outside the supervision of the national judicial authorities and of the Court. Accordingly, the Court accepts that an applicant can claim to be the victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret surveillance measures, or legislation permitting secret surveillance measures, if the following conditions are satisfied. Firstly, the Court will take into account the scope of the legislation permitting secret surveillance measures by examining whether the applicant can possibly be affected by it, either because he belongs to a group of persons targeted by the contested legislation or because the legislation directly affects all users of communication services by instituting a system where any person can have his communications intercepted. Secondly, the Court will take into account the availability of remedies at the national level and will adjust the degree of scrutiny depending on the effectiveness of such remedies. As the Court observed in Kennedy, where the domestic system does not afford an effective remedy to the person who suspects that he was subjected to secret surveillance, widespread suspicion and concern among the general public that secret surveillance powers are being abused cannot be said to be unjustified (see Kennedy, cited above, § 124). In such circumstances the threat of surveillance can be claimed in itself to restrict free communication through the postal and telecommunication services, thereby constituting for all users or potential users a direct interference with the right guaranteed by Article 8. There is therefore a greater need for scrutiny by the Court, and an exception to the rule denying individuals the right to challenge a law in abstracto is justified. In such cases the individual does not need to demonstrate the existence of any risk that secret surveillance measures were applied to him. By contrast, if the national system provides for effective remedies, a widespread suspicion of abuse is more difficult to justify. In such cases, the individual may claim to be a victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret measures or of legislation permitting secret measures only if he is able to show that, due to his personal situation, he is potentially at risk of being subjected to such measures."

One of the courts noted that it refused authorisation to carry out an operational-search measure if it did not appear on the list of operational-search measures in the OSAA, if the request for authorisation was not signed by a competent official or was not reasoned, or if the case fell under statutory restrictions on the use of that measure (for example, relating to the person ’ s status or to the nature of the offence). Authorisation was given if all of the above conditions were met. Another court stated that authorisation could also be refused if the request was insufficiently reasoned, that is, if it did not contain sufficient information permitting the judge to ascertain that the measure was lawful and justified. The third court stated that it granted authorisation if requested to do so by the law-enforcement authorities. It never refused a request for authorisation.

One of the courts noted that supporting materials were never attached to requests for authorisation; another court noted that some, but not all, of the requests were accompanied by supporting materials, while the third court stated that all requests were accompanied by supporting materials. In all three courts the judges never requested that the law-enforcement authorities submit additional supporting materials, such as materials confirming the grounds for the interception or proving that the telephone numbers to be tapped belonged to the person concerned. Two courts granted interception authorisations in respect of unidentified persons, one of them specifying that such authorisations only concerned collection of data from technical channels of communication. Such authorisations did not mention a specific person or a telephone number to be tapped, but authorised interception of all telephone communications in the area where a criminal offence had been committed. One court never gave such authorisations. Two courts noted that authorisations always indicated the duration for which the interception was authorised, while one court stated that the duration of interception was not indicated in the authorisations issued by it.

The communications service providers also had an obligation under Order no. 538 to create databases to store information about all subscribers and the services provided to them for three years. The secret services had direct remote access to those databases. The manner in which the system of secret surveillance thus operated gave the security services and the police the technical means to circumvent the authorisation procedure and to intercept any communications without obtaining prior judicial authorisation.

The court took a decision on the basis of a reasoned request by a law-enforcement authority. The burden of proof was on the requesting authority to justify the necessity of the interception measures. To satisfy that burden of proof, the requesting authorities enclosed with their request all relevant supporting materials, except materials containing information about undercover agents or police informers or about the organisation and tactics of operational-search measures. That exception was justified by the necessity to ensure the security and protection of undercover agents and police informers and their family members and was therefore compatible with the Convention."

The Government further referred to the Plenary Supreme Court ’ s Ruling of 27 June 2013, which explained to the lower courts that any restrictions on human rights and freedoms had to be prescribed by law and be necessary in a democratic society, that is, proportionate to a legitimate aim. Courts were instructed to rely on established facts, verify the existence of relevant and sufficient reasons to justify a restriction on an individual ’ s rights and balance the interests of the individual whose rights were being restricted against the interests of other individuals, the State and society as a whole. The OSAA explicitly required the courts to give reasons for the decision to authorise interception. In line with the Constitutional Court ’ s decision of 8 February 2007 (see paragraph 42 above), the interception authorisation was to refer to the specific grounds for suspecting the person in respect of whom operational-search measures were requested of a criminal offence or of activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security. In its decision of 2 October 2003 (see paragraph 41 above), the Constitutional Court also held that judges had an obligation to examine the materials submitted to them carefully and thoroughly."

In exceptional circumstances it was permissible to authorise the interception of communications of unidentified persons. As a rule, in such cases a judge authorised the collection of data from technical channels of communication in order to identify the persons present at a specific location at the time that a criminal offence was committed there. That practice was compatible with the principles established in the Court ’ s case-law, because in such cases the interception authorisation specified a single set of premises (locations) as the premises (locations) in respect of which the authorisation was ordered ( they referred to Kennedy, cited above)."

However, especially where a power vested in the executive is exercised in secret, the risks of arbitrariness are evident. It is therefore essential to have clear, detailed rules on interception of telephone conversations, especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated. The domestic law must be sufficiently clear to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to any such measures ( see Malone, cited above, § 67; Leander v.

Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, among other authorities, Malone, cited above, § 68; Leander, cited above, § 51; Huvig, cited above, § 29; and Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 94)."

However, this margin is subject to European supervision embracing both legislation and decisions applying it. In view of the risk that a system of secret surveillance set up to protect national security may undermine or even destroy democracy under the cloak of defending it, the Court must be satisfied that there are adequate and effective guarantees against abuse. The assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to authorise, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by national law. The Court has to determine whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the “interference” to what is “necessary in a democratic society” (see Klass and Others, cited above, §§ 49 - 50 and 59; Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 106; Kvasnica v.

Review and supervision of secret surveillance measures may come into play at three stages: when the surveillance is first ordered, while it is being carried out, or after it has been terminated. As regards the first two stages, the very nature and logic of secret surveillance dictate that not only the surveillance itself but also the accompanying review should be effected without the individual ’ s knowledge. Consequently, since the individual will necessarily be prevented from seeking an effective remedy of his own accord or from taking a direct part in any review proceedings, it is essential that the procedures established should themselves provide adequate and equivalent guarantees safeguarding his rights. In addition, the values of a democratic society must be followed as faithfully as possible in the supervisory procedures if the bounds of necessity, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2, are not to be exceeded. In a field where abuse is potentially so easy in individual cases and could have such harmful consequences for democratic society as a whole, it is in principle desirable to entrust supervisory control to a judge, judicial control offering the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and a proper procedure (see Klass and Others, cited above, §§ 55 - 56)."

The “ quality of law ” in this sense implies that the domestic law must not only be accessible and foreseeable in its application, it must also ensure that secret surveillance measures are applied only when “necessary in a democratic society”, in particular by providing for adequate and effective safeguards and guarantees against abuse."

Both the OSAA and the CCrP provide that telephone and other communications may be intercepted in connection with an offence of medium severity, a serious offence or an especially serious criminal offence – that is, an offence for which the Criminal Code prescribes a maximum penalty of more than three years ’ imprisonment – which has been already committed, is being committed or being plotted ( see paragraphs 31 - 33 above). The Court considers that the nature of the offences which may give rise to an interception order is sufficiently clear.

By their very nature, threats to national security may vary in character and may be unanticipated or difficult to define in advance (see Kennedy, cited above, § 159). At the same time, the Court has also emphasised that in matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a discretion granted to the executive in the sphere of national security to be expressed in terms of unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Liu v.

Secondly, the conditions under which an authorisation can be renewed are also clearly set out in law. In particular, under both the CCrP and the OSAA a judge may extend interception for a maximum of six months at a time, after a fresh examination of all the relevant materials ( ibid .). However, as regards the third safeguard concerning the circumstances in which the interception must be discontinued, the Court notes that the requirement to discontinue interception when no longer necessary is mentioned in the CCrP only. Regrettably, the OSAA does not contain such a requirement ( ibid .).

Steps must be taken to ensure that only the amount of information needed by the recipient to perform his duties is disclosed, and no more. The official responsible for ensuring that the data are securely stored and inaccessible to those without the necessary security clearance is clearly defined (see paragraphs 51 - 57 above). Domestic law also sets out the conditions and procedures for communicating intercepted data containing information about a criminal offence to the prosecuting authorities. It describes, in particular, the requirements for their secure storage and the conditions for their use as evidence in criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 58 - 64 above ).

The Constitutional Court has also held that the judicial decision authorising interception should contain reasons and refer to specific grounds for suspecting that a criminal offence has been committed, is being committed, or is being plotted or that activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security are being carried out, as well as that the person in respect of whom interception is requested is involved in these criminal or otherwise dangerous activities (see paragraphs 40 - 42 above).

Indeed, the materials submitted by the applicant show that the domestic courts do not always follow the above - mentioned recommendations of the Constitutional Court, all of which were contained in decisions rather than in judgments. Thus, it transpires from the analytical notes issued by District Courts that interception requests are often not accompanied by any supporting materials, that the judges of these District Courts never request the interception agency to submit such materials and that a mere reference to the existence of information about a criminal offence or activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security is considered to be sufficient for the authorisation to be granted. An interception request is rejected only if it is not signed by a competent person, contains no reference to the offence in connection with which interception is to be ordered, or concerns a criminal offence in respect of which interception is not permitted under domestic law ( see paragraph 193 above). Thus, the analytical notes issued by District Courts, taken together with the statistical information for the period from 2009 - 13 provided by the applicant (see paragraph 194 above), indicate that in their everyday practice Russian courts do not verify whether there is a “reasonable suspicion” against the person concerned and do not apply the “ necessity ” and “ proportionality ” test."

By contrast, the OSAA does not contain any requirements either with regard to the content of the request for interception or to the content of the interception authorisation. As a result, courts sometimes grant interception authorisations which do not mention a specific person or telephone number to be tapped, but authorise interception of all telephone communications in the area where a criminal offence has been committed. Some authorisations do not mention the duration for which interception is authorised (see paragraph 193 above).

A judge must be informed of any such case within twenty-four hours from the commencement of the interception. If no judicial authorisation has been issued within forty-eight hours, the interception must be stopped immediately (see paragraph 35 above). The Court has already examined the “urgency” procedure provided for in Bulgarian law and found that it was compatible with the Convention ( see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, § § 16 and 82). However, in contrast to the Bulgarian provision, the Russian “ urgent procedure ” does not provide for sufficient safeguards to ensure that it is used sparingly and only in duly justified cases. Thus, although in the criminal sphere the OSAA limits recourse to the urgency procedure to cases where there exists an immediate danger that a serious or especially serious offence may be committed, it does not contain any such limitations in respect of secret surveillance in connection with events or activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security. Domestic law does not limit the use of the urgency procedure to cases involving an immediate serious danger to national, military, economic or ecological security. It leaves the authorities an unlimited degree of discretion in determining in which situations it is justified to use the non-judicial urgent procedure, thereby creating possibilities for abusive recourse to it ( ibid. ). Furthermore, although Russian law requires that a judge be immediately informed of each instance of urgent interception, his power is limited to authorising the extension of the interception measure beyond forty-eight hours. He has no power to assess whether the use of the urgent procedure was justified or to decide whether the material obtained during the previous forty-eight hours is to be kept or destroyed (see, by contrast, Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, § 16).

Norway, no. 13564/88, Commission decision of 8 June 1990, Decisions and Reports 65; and Kennedy, cited above, §§ 57 and 166). In contrast, a Minister for Internal Affairs – who was not only a political appointee and a member of the executive, but also directly involved in the commissioning of special means of surveillance – was found to be insufficiently independent (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, §§ 85 and 87).

Such supervision is only one part of their broad and diversified functions, which include prosecution and supervision of criminal investigations. In the framework of their prosecuting functions, prosecutors give their approval to all interception requests lodged by investigators in the framework of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 44 above). This blending of functions within one prosecutor ’ s office, with the same office giving approval to requests for interceptions and then supervising their implementation, may also raise doubts as to prosecutors ’ independence (see, by way of contrast, Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, § 215, 10 January 2012, concerning supervision by prosecutors of detention facilities, where it was found that prosecutors complied with the requirement of independence vis-à-vis the penitentiary system ’ s bodies)."

Russian law stipulates that prosecutors are entitled to study relevant documents, including confidential ones. It is, however, important to note that information about the security services ’ undercover agents, and about the tactics, methods and means used by them, is outside the scope of prosecutors ’ supervision (see paragraph 74 above ). The scope of their supervision is therefore limited. Moreover, interceptions performed by the FSB in the sphere of counter - intelligence may be inspected only following an individual complaint (see paragraph 76 above ). As individuals are not notified of interceptions (see paragraph 81 above and paragraph 289 below), it is unlikely that such a complaint will ever be lodged.

The Court is satisfied that prosecutors have certain powers with respect to the breaches detected by them. Thus, they may take measures to stop or remedy the detected breaches of law and to bring those responsible to account (see paragraph 79 above ). However, there is no specific provision requiring destruction of the unlawfully obtained intercept material (see Kennedy, cited above, § 168 )."

In Russia, prosecutors must submit biannual reports detailing the results of the inspections to the Prosecutor General ’ s Office. However, these reports concern all types of operational-search measures, amalgamated together, without interceptions being treated separately from other measures. Moreover, the reports contain only statistical information about the number of inspections of operational-search measures carried out and the number of breaches detected, without specifying the nature of the breaches or the measures taken to remedy them. It is also significant that the reports are confidential documents. They are not published or otherwise accessible to the public (see paragraph 80 above).

However, they did not submit any inspection reports or decisions by prosecutors ordering the taking of measures to stop or remedy a detected breach of law. It follows that the Government did not demonstrate that prosecutors ’ supervision of secret surveillance measures is effective in practice.

The activity or danger against which a particular series of surveillance measures is directed may continue for years, even decades, after the suspension of those measures. Subsequent notification to each individual affected by a suspended measure might well jeopardise the long-term purpose that originally prompted the surveillance. Furthermore, such notification might serve to reveal the working methods and fields of operation of the intelligence services and even possibly to identify their agents. Therefore, the fact that persons concerned by secret surveillance measures are not subsequently notified once surveillance has ceased cannot by itself warrant the conclusion that the interference was not “necessary in a democratic society”, as it is the very absence of knowledge of surveillance which ensures the efficacy of the interference. As soon as notification can be carried out without jeopardising the purpose of the restriction after the termination of the surveillance measure, information should, however, be provided to the persons concerned (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 58, and Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 135). The Court also takes note of the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers regulating the use of personal data in the police sector, which provides that where data concerning an individual have been collected and stored without his knowledge, and unless the data are deleted, he should be informed, where practicable, that information is held about him as soon as the object of the police activities is no longer likely to be prejudiced (§ 2.2, see paragraph 143 above)."

In Klass and Others and Weber and Saravia, the Court examined German legislation which provided for notification of surveillance as soon as that could be done after its termination without jeopardising its purpose. The Court took into account that it was an independent authority, the G10 Commission, which had the power to decide whether an individual being monitored was to be notified of a surveillance measure. The Court found that the provision in question ensured an effective notification mechanism which contributed to keeping the interference with the secrecy of telecommunications within the limits of what was necessary to achieve the legitimate aims pursued (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 58, and Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 136). In Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev and Dumitru Popescu, the Court found that the absence of a requirement to notify the subject of interception at any point was incompatible with the Convention, in that it deprived the interception subject of an opportunity to seek redress for unlawful interferences with his Article 8 rights and rendered the remedies available under the national law theoretical and illusory rather than practical and effective. The national law thus eschewed an important safeguard against the improper use of special means of surveillance (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, §§ 90 - 91, and Dumitru Popescu, cited above, § 77). By contrast, in Kennedy the absence of a requirement to notify the subject of interception at any point in time was compatible with the Convention, because in the United Kingdom any person who suspected that his communications were being or had been intercepted could apply to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, whose jurisdiction did not depend on notification to the interception subject that there had been an interception of his communications (see Kennedy, cited above, § 167)."

It is worth noting in this connection that in order to be entitled to lodge such a request the person must be in possession of the facts of the operational-search measures to which he was subjected. It follows that access to the information is conditional on the person ’ s ability to prove that his communications were intercepted. Furthermore, the interception subject is not entitled to obtain access to documents relating to interception of his communications; he is at best entitled to receive “information” about the collected data. Such information is provided only in very limited circumstances, namely if the person ’ s guilt has not been proved in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, that is, he has not been charged or the charges have been dropped on the ground that the alleged offence was not committed or that one or more elements of a criminal offence were missing. It is also significant that only information that does not contain State secrets may be disclosed to the interception subject and that under Russian law information about the facilities used in operational-search activities, the methods employed, the officials involved and the data collected constitutes a State secret ( see paragraph 52 above ).

Domestic law is silent on the possibility of lodging a cassation appeal. Given that the Government did not submit any examples of domestic practice on examination of cassation appeals, the Court has serious doubts as to the existence of a right to lodge a cassation appeal against a judicial decision authorising interception of communications. At the same time, the interception subject is clearly entitled to lodge a supervisory - review complaint (see paragraph 43 above ). However, in order to lodge a supervisory - review complaint against the judicial decision authorising interception of communications, the person concerned had to be aware that such a decision existed. Although the Constitutional Court has held that it is not necessary to attach a copy of the contested judicial decision to the supervisory - review complaint ( ibid. ), it is difficult to imagine how a person can lodge such a complaint without having at least the minimum information about the decision he is challenging, such as its date and the court which has issued it. In the absence of notification of surveillance measures under Russian law, an individual would hardly ever be able to obtain that information unless it were to be disclosed in the context of criminal proceedings against him or there was some indiscretion which resulted in disclosure."

It cannot be used by a person against whom no criminal proceedings have been brought following the interception of his communications and who does not know whether his communications were intercepted. It is also worth noting that the Government did not submit any judicial decisions examining a complaint under Article 125 of the CCrP concerning the interception of communications.

In the absence of notification or some form of access to official documents relating to the interceptions, such a burden of proof is virtually impossible to satisfy. Indeed, the applicant ’ s judicial complaint was rejected by the domestic courts on the ground that he had failed to prove that his telephone communications had been intercepted (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above).

However, all of those decisions, with one exception, concern searches or seizures of documents or objects, that is, operational-search measures carried out with the knowledge of the person concerned.

In such circumstances the Court finds it unlikely that a complaint by the applicant to the Constitutional Court, raising the same issues that have already been examined by it, would have any prospect of success.

Indeed, the applicant did challenge Order no. 70 in the domestic proceedings. However, both the District and City Courts found that the applicant had no standing to challenge the Order because the equipment installed pursuant to it did not in itself interfere with the privacy of his communications (see paragraphs 10 ‑ 11 and 13 above).

In particular, the circumstances in which public authorities are empowered to resort to secret surveillance measures are not defined with sufficient clarity. Provisions on discontinuation of secret surveillance measures do not provide sufficient guarantees against arbitrary interference. Domestic law permits automatic storage of clearly irrelevant data and is not sufficiently clear as to the circumstances in which the intercept material will be stored and destroyed after the end of a trial. The authorisation procedures are not capable of ensuring that secret surveillance measures are ordered only when “necessary in a democratic society”. The supervision of interceptions, as it is currently organised, does not comply with the requirements of independence, powers and competence which are sufficient to exercise an effective and continuous control, public scrutiny and effectiveness in practice. The effectiveness of the remedies is undermined by the absence of notification at any point of interceptions, or adequate access to documents relating to interceptions."

                "“... [F] ingerprints and DNA profiles reveal only limited personal information. The physical samples potentially contain very much greater and more personal and detailed information. The anxiety is that science may one day enable analysis of samples to go so far as to obtain information in relation to an individual ’ s propensity to commit certain crime and be used for that purpose within the language of the present section [ section 82 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001]. It might also be said that the law might be changed in order to allow the samples to be used for purposes other than those identified by the section. It might also be said that while samples are retained there is even now a risk that they will be used in a way that the law does not allow. So, it is said, the aims could be achieved in a less restrictive manner ... Why cannot the aim be achieved by retention of the profiles without retention of the samples?",
                "The answer to [these] points is as I see it as follows. First the retention of samples permits ( a) the checking of the integrity and future utility of the DNA database system; (b) a reanalysis for the upgrading of DNA profiles where new technology can improve the discriminating power of the DNA matching process; (c) reanalysis and thus an ability to extract other DNA markers and thus offer benefits in terms of speed, sensitivity and cost of searches of the database; (d) further analysis in investigations of alleged miscarriages of justice; and (e) further analysis so as to be able to identify any analytical or process errors. It is these benefits which must be balanced against the risks identified by Liberty. In relation to those risks, the position in any event is first that any change in the law will have to be itself Convention compliant; second any change in practice would have to be Convention compliant; and third unlawfulness must not be assumed. In my view thus the risks identified are not great, and such as they are they are outweighed by the benefits in achieving the aim of prosecuting and preventing crime. ”"

Lord Steyn, giving the lead judgment, noted the legislative history of section 64(1A) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), in particular the way in which it had been introduced by Parliament following public disquiet about the previous law, which had provided that where a person was not prosecuted or was acquitted of offences, the sample had to be destroyed and the information could not be used. In two cases, compelling DNA evidence linking one suspect to a rape and another to a murder had not been able to be used, as at the time the matches were made both defendants had either been acquitted or a decision made not to proceed for the offences for which the profiles had been obtained : as a result it had not been possible to convict either suspect."

            [
                "16. Lord Steyn noted that the value of retained fingerprints and samples taken from suspects was considerable. He gave the example of a case in 1999, in which DNA information from the perpetrator of a crime was matched with that of “I” in a search of the national database. The sample from “ I ” should have been destroyed, but had not been. “ I ” had pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced. If the sample had not been wrongly detained, the offender might have escaped detection."

                "17. Lord Steyn also referred to statistical evidence from which it appeared that almost 6,000 DNA profiles had been linked with crime- scene stain profiles which would have been destroyed under the former provisions. The offences involved included 53 murders, 33 attempted murders, 94 rapes, 38 sexual offences, 63 aggravated burglaries and 56 cases involving the supply of controlled drugs. On the basis of the existing records, the Home Office statistics estimated that there was a 40% chance that a crime- scene sample would be matched immediately with an individual ’ s profile on the national database. This showed that the fingerprints and samples which could now be retained had in the previous three years played a major role in the detection and prosecution of serious crime."

                "19. As to the Convention analysis, Lord Steyn inclined to the view that the mere retention of fingerprints and DNA samples did not constitute an interference with the right to respect for private life but stated that, if he were wrong in that view, he regarded any interference as very modest indeed. Questions of whether, in the future, retained samples could be misused were not relevant in respect of contemporary use of retained samples in connection with the detection and prosecution of crime. If future scientific developments required it, judicial decisions could be made, when the need occurred, to ensure compatibility with the Convention. The provision limiting the permissible use of retained material to “ purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime ...” did not broaden the permitted use unduly, because it was limited by its context."

            [
                "20. If the need to justify the modest interference with private life arose, Lord Steyn agreed with Lord Justice Sedley in the Court of Appeal that the purposes of retention – the prevention of crime and the protection of the right of others to be free from crime – were “provided for by law”, as required by Article 8 of the Convention."

As to the justification for any interference, the applicants had argued that the retention of fingerprints and DNA samples created suspicion in respect of persons who had been acquitted. Counsel for the Home Secretary had contended that the aim of the retention had nothing to do with the past, that is, with the offence of which a person had been acquitted, but was to assist in the investigation of offences in the future. The applicants would only be affected by the retention of the DNA samples if their profiles matched those found at the scene of a future crime. Lord Steyn saw five factors which led to the conclusion that the interference was proportionate to the aim: (i) the fingerprints and samples were kept only for the limited purpose of the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime; (ii) the fingerprints and samples were not of any use without a comparator fingerprint or sample from the crime scene; (iii) the fingerprints would not be made public; (iv) a person was not identifiable from the retained material to the untutored eye; (v) the resultant expansion of the national database by the retention conferred enormous advantages in the fight against serious crime."

In reply to the contention that the same legislative aim could be obtained by less intrusive means, namely by a case-by-case consideration of whether or not to retain fingerprints and samples, Lord Steyn referred to Lord Justice Waller ’ s comments in the Court of Appeal, which read as follows:",
                "“ If justification for retention is in any degree to be by reference to the view of the police on the degree of innocence, then persons who have been acquitted and have their samples retained can justifiably say this stigmatises or discriminates against me – I am part of a pool of acquitted persons presumed to be innocent, but I am treated as though I was not. It is not in fact in any way stigmatising someone who has been acquitted to say simply that samples lawfully obtained are retained as the norm, and it is in the public interest in its fight against crime for the police to have as large a database as possible. ”"

The House of Lords further rejected the applicants ’ complaint that the retention of their fingerprints and samples subjected them to discriminatory treatment in breach of Article 14 of the Convention when compared to the general body of persons who had not had their fingerprints and samples taken by the police in the course of a criminal investigation. Lord Steyn held that, even assuming that the retention of fingerprints and samples fell within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention so as to trigger the application of Article 14, the difference of treatment relied on by the applicants was not one based on “status” for the purposes of Article 14: the difference simply reflected the historical fact, unrelated to any personal characteristic, that the authorities already held the fingerprints and samples of the individuals concerned which had been lawfully taken. The applicants and their suggested comparators could not in any event be said to be in an analogous situation. Even if, contrary to his view, it was necessary to consider the justification for any difference in treatment, Lord Steyn held that such objective justification had been established: firstly, the element of legitimate aim was plainly present, as the increase in the database of fingerprints and samples promoted the public interest by the detection and prosecution of serious crime and by exculpating the innocent; secondly, the requirement of proportionality was satisfied, section 64(1A) of PACE objectively representing a measured and proportionate response to the legislative aim of dealing with serious crime."

Baroness Hale of Richmond disagreed with the majority, considering that the retention of both fingerprint and DNA data constituted an interference by the State in a person ’ s right to respect for his private life and thus required justification under the Convention. In her opinion, this was an aspect of what had been called informational privacy and there could be little, if anything, more private to the individual than the knowledge of his genetic make-up. She further considered that the difference between fingerprint and DNA data became more important when it came to justify their retention as the justifications for each of these might be very different. She agreed with the majority that such justifications had been readily established in the applicants ’ cases.",

It is suggested that exceptional cases are rare by definition and include those where the original arrest or sampling was unlawful or where it is established beyond doubt that no offence existed. Before deciding whether a case is exceptional, the chief police officer is instructed to seek advice from the DNA and Fingerprint Retention Project."

According to a recent report by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, the retention of fingerprints, DNA profiles and biological samples is generally more controversial than the taking of such bioinformation, and the retention of biological samples raises greater ethical concerns than digitised DNA profiles and fingerprints, given the differences in the level of information that could be revealed. The report referred, in particular, to the lack of satisfactory empirical evidence to justify the present practice of retaining indefinitely fingerprints, samples and DNA profiles from all those arrested for a recordable offence, irrespective of whether they were subsequently charged or convicted. The report voiced particular concerns at the policy of permanently retaining the bioinformation of minors, having regard to the requirements of the 198 9 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child."

Familial searching is the process of comparing a DNA profile from a crime scene with profiles stored on the national database, and prioritising them in terms of “ closeness ” to a match. This allows possible genetic relatives of an offender to be identified. Familial searching might thus lead to revealing previously unknown or concealed genetic relationships. The report considered the use of the DNA database in searching for relatives as particularly sensitive."

Ethnic inferring through DNA profiles is possible as the individual “ethnic appearance” is systematically recorded on the database : when taking biological samples, police officers routinely classify suspects into one of seven “ethnic appearance” categories. Ethnicity tests on the database might thus provide inferences for use during a police investigation in order, for example, to help reduce a “ suspect pool ” and to inform police priorities. The report noted that social factors and policing practices lead to a disproportionate number of people from black and ethnic minority groups being stopped, searched and arrested by the police, and hence having their DNA profiles recorded; it therefore voiced concerns that inferring ethnic identity from biological samples might reinforce racist views of propensity to criminality.",

Article 8 protects, in addition, a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, for example, Burghartz, cited above, opinion of the Commission, p. 37, § 47, and Friedl v.

However, in determining whether the personal information retained by the authorities involves any of the private-life aspects mentioned above, the Court will have due regard to the specific context in which the information at issue has been recorded and retained, the nature of the records, the way in which these records are used and processed and the results that may be obtained (see, mutatis mutandis, Friedl, cited above, § § 49-51, and Peck, cited above, § 59 ).",

Indeed, bearing in mind the rapid pace of developments in the field of genetics and information technology, the Court cannot discount the possibility that in the future the private-life interests bound up with genetic information may be adversely affected in novel ways or in a manner which cannot be anticipated with precision today.

The Court notes in this regard that the Government accepted that DNA profiles could be, and indeed had in some cases been, used for familial searching with a view to identifying a possible genetic relationship between individuals. They also accepted the highly sensitive nature of such searching and the need for very strict controls in this respect. In the Court ’ s view, the DNA profiles ’ capacity to provide a means of identifying genetic relationships between individuals (see paragraph 39 above) is in itself sufficient to conclude that their retention interferes with the right to the private life of the individuals concerned. The frequency of familial searches, the safeguards attached thereto and the likelihood of detriment in a particular case are immaterial in this respect (see Amann, cited above, § 69 ). This conclusion is similarly not affected by the fact that, since the information is in coded form, it is intelligible only with the use of computer technology and capable of being interpreted only by a limited number of persons."

The possibility the DNA profiles create for inferences to be drawn as to ethnic origin makes their retention all the more sensitive and susceptible of affecting the right to private life.

The Court noted that a permanent record of a person ’ s voice for further analysis was of direct relevance to identifying that person when considered in conjunction with other personal data.

The Government distinguished the latter by arguing that they constituted neutral, objective and irrefutable material and, unlike photographs, were unintelligible to the untutored eye and without a comparator fingerprint. While true, this consideration cannot alter the fact that fingerprints objectively contain unique information about the individual concerned, allowing his or her identification with precision in a wide range of circumstances.

The Government were given a very wide remit to use samples and DNA profiles notably for “purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime”, “ the investigation of an offence” or “ the conduct of a prosecution”. These purposes were vague and open to abuse as they might, in particular, lead to the collation of detailed personal information outside the immediate context of the investigation of a particular offence. The applicants further submitted that there were insufficient procedural safeguards against misuse or abuse of the information. Records on the Police National Computer ( PNC ) were not only accessible to the police, but also to fifty-six non-police bodies, including government agencies and departments, private groups such as British Telecom and the Association of British Insurers, and even certain employers. Furthermore, the PNC was linked to the Europe-wide “Schengen Information System”. Consequently, their case involved a very substantial and controversial interference with the right to private life, as notably illustrated by ongoing public debate and disagreement about the subject in the United Kingdom. Contrary to the assertion of the Government, the applicants concluded that the issue of the retention of this material was of great individual concern and the State had a narrow margin of appreciation in this field."

In particular, there was no justification at all for the retention of cellular samples following the original generation of the DNA profile; nor had the efficacy of the profiles ’ retention been convincingly demonstrated since the high number of DNA matches relied upon by the Government was not shown to have led to successful prosecutions. Likewise, in most of the specific examples provided by the Government, the successful prosecution had not been contingent on the retention of the records and in certain others the successful outcome could have been achieved through more limited retention in time and scope."

In another case, two suspects arrested for rape were eliminated from the investigation as their DNA profiles did not match the crime - scene stain. In two other cases the retention of DNA profiles of the persons found guilty of certain minor offences (disorder and theft) led to establishing their involvement in other crimes committed later. In one case the retention of a suspect ’ s DNA profile following an alleged immigration offence helped his extradition to the United Kingdom a year later when he was identified by one of his victims as having committed rape and murder. Finally, in four cases DNA profiles retained from four persons suspected but not convicted of certain offences (possession of offensive weapons, violent disorder and assault) matched the crime- scene stains collected from victims of rape up to two years later."

Their retention was neither warranted by any degree of suspicion of the applicants ’ involvement in a crime or propensity to crime nor directed at retaining records in respect of investigated alleged offences in the past. The records were retained because the police had already been lawfully in possession of them, and their retention would assist in the future prevention and detection of crime in general by increasing the size of the database. Retention resulted in no stigma and produced no practical consequence for the applicants unless the records matched a crime- scene profile.

The Court observes that the protection afforded by Article 8 of the Convention would be unacceptably weakened if the use of modern scientific techniques in the criminal- justice system were allowed at any cost and without carefully balancing the potential benefits of the extensive use of such techniques against important private-life interests. In the Court ’ s view, the strong consensus existing among the Contracting States in this respect is of considerable importance and narrows the margin of appreciation left to the respondent State in the assessment of the permissible limits of the interference with private life in this sphere.

Certainly, the statistical and other evidence, which was before the House of Lords and is included in the material supplied by the Government (see paragraph 92 above) appears impressive, indicating that DNA profiles that would have been previously destroyed were linked with crime-scene stains in a high number of cases."

Nor do they demonstrate that the high number of successful matches with crime - scene stains was only made possible through indefinite retention of DNA records of all such persons. At the same time, in the majority of the specific cases quoted by the Government (see paragraph 93 above), the DNA records taken from the suspects produced successful matches only with earlier crime-scene stains retained on the database.

The retention is not time-limited; the material is retained indefinitely whatever the nature or seriousness of the offence of which the person was suspected. Moreover, there exist only limited possibilities for an acquitted individual to have the data removed from the national database or the materials destroyed (see paragraph 35 above); in particular, there is no provision for independent review of the justification for the retention according to defined criteria, including such factors as the seriousness of the offence, previous arrests, the strength of the suspicion against the person and any other special circumstances."

The Court is unable to accept this argument and reiterates that the mere retention and storing of personal data by public authorities, however obtained, are to be regarded as having a direct impact on the private-life interest of an individual concerned, irrespective of whether subsequent use is made of the data (see paragraph 6 7 above)."

Of particular concern in the present context is the risk of stigmatisation, stemming from the fact that persons in the position of the applicants, who have not been convicted of any offence and are entitled to the presumption of innocence, are treated in the same way as convicted persons. In this respect, the Court must bear in mind that the right of every person under the Convention to be presumed innocent includes the general rule that no suspicion regarding an accused ’ s innocence may be voiced after his acquittal (see Rushiti v. Austria, no. 28389/95, § 31, 21 March 2000, with further references ). It is true that the retention of the applicants ’ private data cannot be equated with the voicing of suspicions. Nonetheless, their perception that they are not being treated as innocent is heightened by the fact that their data are retained indefinitely in the same way as the data of convicted persons, while the data of those who have never been suspected of an offence are required to be destroyed."

The Government argue that the power of retention applies to all fingerprints and samples taken from a person in connection with the investigation of an offence and does not depend on innocence or guilt. It is further submitted that the fingerprints and samples have been lawfully taken and that their retention is not related to the fact that they were originally suspected of committing a crime, the sole reason for their retention being to increase the size and, therefore, the use of the database in the identification of offenders in the future. The Court, however, finds this argument difficult to reconcile with the obligation imposed by section 64(3) of PACE to destroy the fingerprints and samples of volunteers at their request, despite the similar value of the material in increasing the size and utility of the database. Weighty reasons would have to be put forward by the Government before the Court could regard as justified such a difference in treatment of the applicants ’ private data compared to that of other unconvicted people."

The Court has already emphasised, drawing on the provisions of Article 40 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989, the special position of minors in the criminal- justice sphere and has noted, in particular, the need for the protection of their privacy at criminal trials (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, §§ 75 and 85, 16 December 1999 ). In the same way, the Court considers that particular attention should be paid to the protection of juveniles from any detriment that may result from the retention by the authorities of their private data following acquittals of a criminal offence. The Court shares the view of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics as to the impact on young persons of the indefinite retention of their DNA material and notes the Council ’ s concerns that the policies applied have led to the over-representation in the database of young persons and ethnic minorities who have not been convicted of any crime (see paragraphs 38-40 above)."

Accordingly, the retention at issue constitutes a disproportionate interference with the applicants ’ right to respect for private life and cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society. This conclusion obviates the need for the Court to consider the applicants ’ criticism regarding the adequacy of certain particular safeguards, such as too broad an access to the personal data concerned and insufficient protection against the misuse or abuse of such data."

For the reasons set out in their submissions under Article 8, there was no reasonable or objective justification for the treatment, nor any legitimate aim or reasonable relationship of proportionality to the purported aim of crime prevention, in particular as regards the samples which played no role in crime detection or prevention.

Otherwise, there would have been no point in hiding the camera among the clothes in the laundry basket. The hole in the laundry basket indicated that the strategy was quite refined.

As to the incident in September 2002, the Court of Appeal found it established that the applicant ’ s stepfather had put a camera in the bathroom and that he had started the recording before she was about to take a shower. Whether a recording had actually been made, however, was unclear. It was apparent, the court continued, that his motive had been to film the applicant covertly for a sexual purpose. Given that motive, it was also regarded as certain that he had not intended the applicant to find out about the filming. Nor, according to the court, had he been indifferent to the risk that she would find out about it. In assessing whether the act legally constituted sexual molestation within the meaning of Chapter 6, Article 7 § 3, of the Penal Code, the Court of Appeal referred to a Supreme Court judgment ( published in Nyatt jurisdiskt arkiv ( NJA ) 1996, p. 418) concerning a man who had covertly filmed his sleeping girlfriend while he masturbated. The man was acquitted of sexual molestation because he had not intended his girlfriend to find out about the filming. Moreover, in the said judgment the Supreme Court held that the isolated act of filming was not a crime in itself, as in Swedish law there was no general prohibition against filming an individual without his or her consent. Following that line of reasoning, and despite finding that the situation the applicant ’ s stepfather intended to film was obviously of a sensitive nature as regards her personal integrity and that the violation was particularly serious on account of the applicant ’ s age and relationship to her stepfather, the Court of Appeal found that he could not be held criminally responsible for the isolated act of filming the applicant without her knowledge.

In conclusion, despite finding his behaviour extremely reprehensible, he was acquitted and the applicant ’ s claim for damages dismissed."

Although the need for a strengthened legal framework in this regard had already been acknowledged in Swedish legislative work in the 1960s, the court noted further that it had so far not led to any concrete results. The court found it highly questionable whether the fact that acts of filming an individual in situations where such filming seriously violated the personal integrity of the person concerned were left wholly unpunished under Swedish law was compatible with the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention. Given that finding, the court continued, it was legitimate to examine whether punishment could be imposed by interpreting otherwise non-applicable domestic provisions in a Convention- compliant manner. In that regard, the court referred to domestic case-law concerning compensation for violations of the Convention. However, the court noted, another requirement under the Convention was that no one should be punished for an act which, at the time when it was committed, did not clearly constitute a criminal offence under the law.

It was satisfied that, although Swedish law contained no provision relating to covert filming, laws were in place which could, at least in theory, cover acts such as the one in this case. It pointed out that the public prosecutor, when indicting the applicant ’ s stepfather, and the District Court, when convicting him on 14 February 2006, considered that the impugned act could be covered by the provision on sexual molestation. Accordingly, although at the relevant time a similar outcome had been seen in Swedish case-law (see NJA 1996, p. 418), it was not until delivery of the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment that it became clear that the act could not legally constitute sexual molestation given the applicant ’ s stepfather ’ s lack of the requisite intent that she find out about the filming. The Chamber also reiterated that the Court of Appeal, in its judgment acquitting him of sexual molestation, had pointed out that his acts might, at least theoretically, have constituted the crime of attempted child pornography under the Penal Code. However, since no charge of that kind had been brought by the prosecution against the applicant ’ s stepfather, the Court of Appeal could not examine whether he could be held responsible for that crime. Lastly, the Chamber noted that civil-law remedies were available to the applicant and that she had chosen, represented by counsel, to join her claim for damages to the criminal proceedings. In those circumstances the Chamber concluded that there were no such significant flaws in Swedish legislation and practice as to amount to a breach of Sweden ’ s positive obligations under Article 8."

Firstly, with regard to the provision on sexual molestation, it was a requirement for a conviction that her stepfather should intend the applicant to know of the filming, the reason being that a person could not be molested unless he or she was aware of it. Accordingly, in the applicant ’ s view, her stepfather had been acquitted of sexual molestation on account of the construction of that provision. It could and should have been construed in such a way that it criminalised the filming, whether or not the applicant became aware of it at the time it was carried out. Accordingly, the applicant found that the construction of the provision on sexual molestation was open to criticism, notably since the act in issue was not covered by other criminal provisions."

                "61. Secondly, referring, inter alia, to the preparatory works to the provision on child pornography and to a legal opinion by Professor Madeleine Leijonhufvud, the applicant contended that her stepfather could not have been convicted of attempted child pornography either, because the basic requirement for that provision was lacking, namely that the picture in question be pornographic. In the present case images of a 14 -year-old girl undressing before taking a shower, in an otherwise everyday situation, could not be regarded as pornographic within the meaning of Chapter 16, Article 10a, of the Penal Code concerning child pornography. In order for the film to be pornographic, her stepfather would have had to manipulate the film, inter alia, by making it appear as if the applicant was posing for him, or otherwise placing the film in a pornographic context. When the case was pending before the national courts it was not possible to speculate as to what her stepfather would have done with the film because it had been destroyed. In the applicant ’ s view, it was therefore completely understandable that the prosecutor had not formulated or amended the indictment to include a child - pornography crime, since such a claim would not have had any prospect of success."

For adults, no such protection existed at all. The applicant found that the failure for years to criminalise the act of covert or illicit filming amounted to a violation of Article 8. She pointed out that the weak protection in this area had been known and discussed since 1966. In her view it was inadequate to “ quantify ” this deficiency as a “ significant ” or “ insufficiently significant” flaw in the law, for the purpose of an examination under Article 8. It sufficed to conclude that the protection for the right to respect for private life was – and still is – insufficient in the Swedish legal system and that the applicant was a victim of that deficiency. The applicant pointed out that the legislative proposal regarding covert filming had been initiated after the applicant ’ s case had been communicated and that the ongoing legislative measures seemed to have progressed quite far, especially after the Grand Chamber had accepted her request for referral of her case, which demonstrated the urgent need for such legislative protection."

She maintained that, despite his acquittal, the courts could have awarded her compensation on the basis of the Tort Liability Act or the Convention alone. She observed that the domestic courts were the masters of the classification of the law and that therefore it had not been necessary for the parties to invoke any legal provisions at all. Furthermore, since it was a matter of a private claim in consequence of an offence and Chapter 22, Article 7, of the Code of Judicial Procedure applied, the courts were under an obligation to determine the claim, even if it was found that the act was not punishable. Accordingly, in the applicant ’ s view her claim should have been determined by the domestic courts of their own motion, even though she had not invoked any specific legal provisions."

The reason for his acquittal was therefore not the lack of a criminal-law provision covering the relevant act but the public prosecutor ’ s inability to prove that he had the necessary intent and hence that the crime had been committed. The Government pointed out in this context that the Convention did not require a guarantee that a prosecution should result in a conviction (see, for example, Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § § 96 and 147, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII)."

The crucial factor in criminal liability under the new wording was that the act must have been committed “in a way that is likely to violate that person ’ s sexual integrity”. Referring to the statements by the 2008 Sexual Offences Commission on the amended provision, the Government pointed out that after 1 April 2005 the provision on sexual molestation also covered situations like the one in issue, in which a person covertly filmed or photographed another person in a sexually intrusive way."

Both sexual molestation and child pornography fell within the domain of public prosecution, in which the principle of objectivity was applied, whereby no prosecution should be brought if the prosecutor deemed that the conditions for a conviction were lacking. In the present case, there was no documentation as to why the applicant ’ s stepfather was not also charged with attempted child pornography. It was therefore not possible for the Government to draw any conclusions concerning the specific grounds on which the prosecutor had decided to include only the offence of sexual molestation in the indictment. There were several possible reasons, though, why no prosecution for an attempted child pornography offence was brought."

An example of this might have been the criterion that the image could be considered “pornographic” in common parlance. That meant that not all depictions of naked children or pictures in which a child ’ s genitals were visible were liable to punishment, even if such images could stimulate some individuals ’ sex drive. What was in the picture and how the child was presented in the picture, inter alia, through the cutting of the picture, were of relevance to this assessment."

            [
                "71. Secondly, the wording of the provision at the relevant time could have contributed to a lack of expectation on the prosecutor ’ s part of securing a conviction for this offence, namely, the requirement that the pubertal development of the child was not complete or, if it was complete, that it was apparent from the image and its circumstances that the child was under 18 years of age."

Thirdly, the fact that the applicant ’ s mother had destroyed the film immediately after the incident in September 2002, and the applicant and her mother did not report the incident to the police until September 2004, thus a long time after the incident had taken place, might have reduced the possibilities for the prosecution to prove that there had been a “pornographic” picture and that the applicant ’ s pubertal development at the time of the event, in September 2002, had not been complete, or that it was apparent from the circumstances that she had been under 18 years of age."

Accordingly, it had not been possible for the Court of Appeal to award damages based on Chapter 2, Article 3, of the Tort Liability Act as no crime within the meaning of the Penal Code had been made out. In the Government ’ s view, however, in the criminal proceedings the applicant, represented by counsel, could have relied on other grounds for her claim for damages against her stepfather than the act cited in the indictment, notably that he had caused her personal injury by acting negligently, under Chapter 2, section 1, of the Tort Liability Act, which would have covered any physical and psychological injury.

The Human Rights Centre of Ghent University considered that the “significant flaw” test applied by the Chamber amounted to a lowering of standards in the Court ’ s jurisprudence on positive obligations. In its view, the Grand Chamber should instead endorse the principles of “priority-to-rights” and “effectiveness”. The former required that Convention rights be principally accorded greater weight than public interests in the proportionality analysis and that the State bear the burden of proving the proportionality of its inactions. The latter required the existence in practice of a means capable of protecting a Convention right. In the context of the positive obligation to investigate, any deficiency in the investigation that undermined the ability to establish the circumstances of the case or the perpetrator ’ s liability fell foul of the standard of effectiveness."

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see, inter alia, Airey v.

There are different ways of ensuring respect for private life and the nature of the State ’ s obligation will depend on the particular aspect of private life that is in issue (see, for example, Von Hannover v.

This event affected the applicant in highly intimate aspects of her private life. On the other hand, it observes that the offence in question did not involve any physical violence, abuse or contact. While noting the domestic courts ’ finding that her stepfather ’ s act was certainly reprehensible, in the Court ’ s view the act in question did not attain the seriousness of the grave acts in the case-law cited above which concerned rape and sexual abuse of children (see paragraph 81 above), considered not only under Article 8 of the Convention but also Article 3."

More specifically, the applicant maintained that the domestic courts had not fulfilled their positive obligations on account of their failure to award her compensation either on the basis of the Tort Liability Act or the Convention.

This had its background in the fact that when acquitting the applicant ’ s stepfather of the charge of sexual molestation (under Chapter 6, Article 7 § 3, of the Penal Code) in its judgment of 16 October 2007, the Court of Appeal affirmed in an obiter dictum that, considering the applicant ’ s age, the act in question could, at least in theory, have constituted attempted child pornography under Chapter 16, Article 10a, of the Penal Code (see the provisions cited in paragraphs 31 - 32 above).

However, whilst acknowledging that no information was available as to whether at the relevant time the public prosecutor had given any consideration to indicting the applicant ’ s stepfather with attempted child pornography, the Government enumerated a number of possible reasons why the prosecutor might have decided not to do so, notably a series of difficulties in adducing sufficient evidence to show that there had been a “pornographic” picture (see paragraphs 69 to 72 above). For instance, they pointed out that the applicant ’ s mother had destroyed the film immediately after the incident in September 2002 and that the applicant and her mother had not reported the incident to the police until September 2004, thus a long time after the incident had taken place."

This was because the basic condition for the offence, namely that the picture in question be “pornographic”, was absent. Images of a 14 -year-old girl undressing before taking a shower in an otherwise everyday situation could not be regarded as pornographic within the meaning of Chapter 16, Article 10a, of the Penal Code concerning child pornography. In order for the film to be pornographic, the applicant ’ s stepfather would have had to manipulate the film, for example by making it appear as if she had been posing for him, or otherwise place the film in a pornographic context. Had a charge been brought for the offence of attempted child pornography in the instant case, it would not have had any prospect of success.

It was not the intention to criminalise every exposure of naked children or all pictures in which a child ’ s genitals may be perceived, even if such pictures may stimulate some people ’ s sexual instincts. In order for the handling of a picture to be illegal, it was a condition that it be pornographic according to common parlance and general values” (see paragraph 33 above)."

It was thus regarded as certain that he did not intend the applicant to find out about the filming. Nor, according to the court, was he indifferent to the risk that she would find out about it. The Court of Appeal then referred to a judgment (NJA 1996, p. 418) in which the Supreme Court had held, among other things, that covert filming was not a crime in itself as in Swedish law there was no general prohibition against filming an individual without his or her consent. Following that line of reasoning, and although finding that the act in question constituted a violation of personal integrity, notably in the light of the applicant ’ s age and relationship to her stepfather, the Court of Appeal found that he could not be held criminally responsible for the isolated act of filming the applicant without her knowledge.

In other words, the victim could not be considered sexually molested unless he or she was aware of the molestation. It will be recalled that the applicant ’ s stepfather was indeed convicted of sexual molestation under the said provision as regards the two counts of indecent behaviour against the applicant ’ s 16-year-old cousin, namely, for having caressed her thigh and for having expressed his desire to have sex with her (see paragraph 14 above)."

Having regard to the all the above-mentioned considerations, the Court is not satisfied that the relevant Swedish law, as it stood in September 2002 when the specific act of the applicant ’ s stepfather covertly attempting to film the applicant naked in their bathroom for a sexual purpose occurred, ensured protection of her right to respect for her private life in a manner that, notwithstanding the respondent State ’ s margin of appreciation, complied with its positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention. The act in question violated the applicant ’ s integrity; it was aggravated by the fact that she was a minor, that the incident took place in her home, where she was supposed to feel safe, and that the offender was her stepfather, a person whom she was entitled and expected to trust.

The Court notes that the scope of a judicial review under that provision was limited to reviewing the manner in which State officials had acted. A judge examining such a complaint was required to establish whether or not the investigating authorities had complied with the applicable legal requirements and whether they had abided by the terms of the judicial authorisation. The review under Article 125 of the CCrP did not touch upon the legal and factual grounds for the underlying judicial authorisation, that is to say, whether there had been relevant and sufficient reasons for granting that judicial authorisation and whether it was compatible with the legal requirements (see Avanesyan, cited above, §§ 31 ‑ 33, in respect of searches, and Zubkov and Others v. Russia, nos. 29431/05 and 2 others, §§ 9 5 -97, 7 November 2017, in respect of surveillance activities). Even if a judge had detected irregularities in the manner in which the search had been performed, this would not have affected the validity of the underlying judicial authorisation.

The applicants submitted their application to the Court on 5 February 2011, which was outside the six-month period as regards the appeal decision of 11 May 2010 on the lawfulness of the court search warrant (see § 51 above) and within the six-month period as regards the final decisions on the complaints under Article 125 of the CCrP (30 August, 23 and 30 September 2010, see §§ 52 – 54 above). The Court notes that the court search warrant of 25 March 2010 had imposed “no limitations” on the investigator ’ s discretion during the performance of the search (see § 50 above). Thus, the manner of the performance of the search of the flat and the seizure of the electronic devices resulted from the search warrant itself and its terms rather than from the authorities ’ unlawful actions, for instance, at variance with the search warrant.

Three applicants (applications nos. 2397/11, 19667/16 and 36833/16) considered that the State officials had unlawfully extended the search to encompass the premises not covered by the search warrants. Two applicants (applications nos. 11264/04 (second search) and 73629/13) complained about the authorities ’ unlawful actions because the searches had been performed under the procedures not requiring a judicial authorisation at all, whether before or after the search. In the above circumstances, the applicants ’ grievances stemmed from the manner in which the authorities had acted, rather than from any supposed defects in the underlying judicial authorisation, where it existed. Given the courts ’ power to declare such actions unlawful or unjustified, the Court accepts that in the above circumstances the applicants ’ attempts to challenge the actions of the investigating authorities under Article 125 of the CCrP were reasonable."

Thus they were not belated. Mr Levchenko (application no. 36833/16) chose to continue the chain of appeals by using the two-tier cassation procedure and lodging an application with the Court within six months of its conclusion. That procedure, although it dealt with the applicant ’ s claim against the State, was governed by the CCrP. As to the latter, the Court established in Kashlan v. Russia ( (dec.), no. 60189/15, 19 April 2016) that the two-tier cassation procedure is not an effective remedy in proceedings under the CCrP. However, at the material time, the Kashlan decision had not yet been adopted and the previous case-law applied, in which the cassation procedure could be considered to be an effective remedy (see Kashlan, § 27; Myalichev v. Russia [Committee], 9237/14, § 13, 8 November 2016; and Rozhkani v. Russia [Committee], 14918/14, § 25, 9 July 2019 ).

Greece, no. 30958/13, § 42, 4 October 2018; see also international legal materials on the protection of lawyer -client relationship, paragraphs 102 - 105 above ). To determine whether the measures were “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court has to ascertain whether effective safeguards against abuse or arbitrariness were available under domestic law and how those safeguards operated in the specific cases under examination. Elements to be taken into consideration in this regard are the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure were effected, whether they were carried out pursuant to an order issued by a judge or a judicial officer or subjected to after-the-fact judicial scrutiny, whether the order was based on reasonable suspicion, and whether its scope was reasonably limited. The Court must also review the manner in which the search was executed, including – where a lawyer ’ s office is concerned – whether it was carried out in the presence of an independent observer or whether other special safeguards were available to ensure that material covered by legal professional privilege was not removed. The Court must lastly take into account the extent of the possible repercussions on the work and the reputation of the persons affected by the search ( see Yuditskaya, cited above, § 27 )."

In the other fourteen applications the applicants were lawyers who were not under criminal investigation. In two applications (application nos. 32324/06 and 26067/08) the searches had been authorised in respect of the applicants ’ relatives, who were suspected of criminal offences.

Ukraine, no. 20602/05, § 130, 7 November 2013 ). At no point did the national courts attempt to weigh the obligation to protect lawyer -client confidentiality against the needs of criminal investigations. For instance, the courts did not examine the possibilities of obtaining the information sought from other sources (for instance, from the clients of the lawyers themselves). Furthermore, there is nothing to demonstrate that the courts had any rules by which to determine when it might be and when it might not be permissible to breach the confidentiality of legally privileged documents (see Sallinen and Others v. Finland, no. 50882/99, § 92, 27 September 2005).

The lack of procedural safeguards at the material time is confirmed by the subsequent legislative amendments of 17 April 2017 (see paragraph 94 above). These, however, did not affect the applicants ’ situations prior to that date. At the material time, there existed no possibility of ensuring the presence of a representative of a Bar association or of having an investigating judge decide whether or not particular documents or objects could be used by the investigation if the applicants objected to it on the grounds of professional confidentiality ( compare with Robathin v. Austria, no. 30457/06, § 48, 3 July 2012 ). The presence of attesting witnesses was not a sufficient safeguard, as they were lay people without legal qualifications, unable to identify privileged material ( see Yuditskaya, cited above, § 30, with further references ). Moreover, as regards the data held on the applicants ’ electronic devices which were seized by the investigators, it does not seem that any sort of sifting procedure was followed during the searches ( ibid. )."

It did not take into account that the search had already taken place and that there was accordingly no need for the kind of secrecy required in ex parte proceedings.

It is for States to determine who is authorised to practise law within their jurisdiction, and under what conditions. Furthermore, it is also for States to establish a system of particular safeguards of professional secrecy in the interests of proper administration of justice, given lawyers ’ role as intermediaries between litigants and the courts (see André and Another v. France, no. 18603/03, §§ 41 -42, 24 July 2008, and Michaud v. France, no. 12323/11, §§ 118-19, ECHR 2012 ). In Russia, irrespective of the area of law, legal advice, as well as representation in court proceedings, may be provided by advocates and by “ other persons ”, with few limitations (see paragraphs 81 - 87 above ). However, professional secrecy is protected only to the extent that advocates are involved, thus leaving exposed the relationships between clients and other kinds of legal advisers (see paragraph 87 above ). The Court concedes that potential clients should be aware of the difference between the status of advocates and that of other legal advisers. Advocates enjoy additional privileges which correspond to the fact that their obligations towards clients are greater than those of other legal advisers (see paragraph 87 above). However, it would be incompatible with the rule of law to leave without any particular safeguards at all the entirety of relations between clients and legal advisers who, with few limitations, practise, professionally and often independently, in most areas of law, including representation of litigants before the courts. Therefore, the Court also considers that the searches of the premises of those applicants who were practising lawyers but not members of the Bar were conducted without sufficient procedural safeguards against arbitrariness."

As he had contacts with a male or female employee of the Soviet embassy and it was not immediately clear that the ‘Perma Tweez’ appliance which he sold was a harmless depilatory instrument, the authorities acted correctly in investigating his identity, his circumstances and the ‘Perma Tweez’ appliance in question and recording the result.”"

In that connection the Federal Court reiterated that, pursuant to section 6(2) of the Federal Liability Act of 14 March 1958, the Swiss Confederation had a duty to pay compensation in cases of serious infringement of personality rights, but considered that in this case that condition had not been met. The Federal Court held that the mere fact that the applicant had been named in the file as a “contact with the Russian embassy” could hardly be considered as an infringement of his personality rights. Moreover, even if part of the case number meant “espionage established”, there was nothing to indicate that the authorities had considered the applicant to be a spy and although the expression “contact with the Russian embassy” could conceivably imply that the applicant had effectively had regular contact with the embassy, his card had to be seen, not in isolation, but in the wider context of the card index as a whole and the other circumstances of the case; in particular, the fact that no other entry had been made on his card suggested that the authorities did not suspect the applicant of having illegal contacts with the embassy. Furthermore, it could not be presumed that the applicant had been subject to surveillance on other occasions or that the recorded information had been disclosed to third parties. Taken as a whole, the applicant’s file thus appeared to be of minor importance and there was nothing to indicate that it had been used for other purposes or unlawfully disclosed."

He argued in that connection that the Government’s claim that the documents were no longer available lacked credibility. It transpired from the report of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry set up to investigate the so-called “card index” affair that lists had been kept relating to the telephone tapping ordered by the Public Prosecutor’s Office and carried out by the Post, Telecommunications and Telegraph Office; furthermore, the Indictment Division of the Federal Court had kept registers recording the authorisations issued by its President; moreover, the Government could not claim that an employee at the former Soviet embassy in Berne was being monitored unless they had documents to support that assertion; lastly, the fact that the recording had not been destroyed “at the end of the proceedings” (section 66(1 ter ) FCPA) showed that there had not been an investigation within the meaning of sections 66 et seq.

In addition, the inquiries by the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry set up to investigate the so-called “card index” affair had shown that the federal police had monitored citizens for decades without a court order. Section 17(3) FCPA could not be relied on as a basis for such practices by the police politique.",

Since the implementation in practice of measures of secret surveillance of communications is not open to scrutiny by the individuals concerned or the public at large, it would be contrary to the rule of law for the legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power.

It is sufficient for it to find that data relating to the private life of an individual were stored by a public authority to conclude that, in the instant case, the creation and storing of the impugned card amounted to an interference, within the meaning of Article 8, with the applicant’s right to respect for his private life.",

As to the Federal Council’s Directives of 16 March 1981 applicable to the Processing of Personal Data in the Federal Administration, these were intended for the civil servants of the administration and were not therefore sufficiently clear and precise to enable citizens to ascertain their rights and obligations.",

Thus, under the Federal Decree of 9 October 1992 on the Consultation of Documents of the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Federal Council’s Order of 20 January 1993 on the Consultation of Documents of the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office, cards were stored in the Federal Archives and all interested persons could do was have their card annotated if they disputed its contents."

None of those provisions, however, expressly mentions the existence of a register kept by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, which raises the question whether there was “a legal basis in Swiss law” for the creation of the card in question and, if so, whether that legal basis was “accessible” (see the Leander judgment cited above, p. 23, § 51).

The director of the special division of the financial and criminal police ( odbor zvláštnych úloh správy kriminálnej a finančnej polície ) lodged a criminal complaint as, on the basis of his own examination of the case file, he had come to the conclusion that the interception contravened sections 36 and 37 (1) of the Police Corps Act 1993 (see Relevant domestic law and practice below). This was so in particular because it had not been based on any specific suspicion against the person being targeted and no specific purpose had been indicated. In his view, the members of the special investigative team had abused their official authority within the meaning of Article 158 of the Criminal Code."

The judge stated that the request for the authorisation had met all formal and substantive requirements. In his view, the police director had no authority to challenge the authorisation. The judge therefore considered it inappropriate to address the substance of the director ’ s objections. He nevertheless remarked, in general, that requests for authorisation were made in writing, but were submitted in person. The officer submitting the request had presented the case orally and the oral presentation was usually more comprehensive than the written request. As requests for authorisation had to be handled with the utmost urgency, judges had had no realistic opportunity to examine the case file or to check that the request for authorisation corresponded to the contents of the case file. Furthermore, the information in the case file was often obtained from unverifiable sources. Judges therefore had to rely on the information in the request for authorisation, which presupposed a certain element of trust. The judge further observed that there had been an enormous increase in the workload concerning tapping and that this was due, inter alia, to an inter ‑ agency agreement which had been reached under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice (see Relevant domestic law and practice below) and had extended the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Regional Court in this area. In his view, questions of jurisdiction should not be regulated by “agreements” but by statute, which was not the case in relation to tapping. The judge stated that telephone tapping had been authorised on three previous occasions in the course of the investigation into the suspected extensive criminal transactions within the industrial group mentioned above. He had thus had sufficient and detailed knowledge about the applicant ’ s case. The judge associated himself completely with the decision taken, although the suspicion against the applicant might later have been dispelled. This was nothing unusual and happened in 10-20% of cases."

Denmark, 22 February 1989, § 28, Series A no. 14). The Court has to determine whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the “ interference ” to what is “ necessary in a democratic society ”.

Generally, only a search for particular files likely to be related to the offence in issue could be authorised. The same applied to searches of electronic data. A practising lawyer was obliged by law to have at his disposal a computer system fulfilling certain standards in order to communicate electronically with the courts. In fact, most lawyers also had all their files in electronic form. Standard software for law offices allowed full-text searches for any name or word and thus made it easy to narrow the search of data.

The principle of secrecy must not be circumvented by seizing documents or by hearing a lawyer’s employees as witnesses. In the present case, he argued that the data contained in the files concerning Mr R. and Mr G., which were covered by the search warrant, had been saved on separate storage devices. However, the search and seizure warrant had been vague and could not be considered to be in accordance with the law, or, in the alternative, the search and seizure of all his law office’s electronic data could not be considered proportionate and had thus not been necessary in a democratic society."

A search of all files – at least on a superficial level – had therefore been necessary. As a result, the measure had served a legitimate aim and the applicant’s rights had been interfered with to the least extent possible. Thus, the measure could not be considered disproportionate.

The Court observes that the recording system in place in Northern Ireland covers not only convictions but includes non-conviction disposals such as cautions, warnings and reprimands. A significant amount of additional data recorded by police forces is also retained. It is clear from the available guidance that both the recording and, at least, the initial retention of all relevant data are intended to be automatic. It further appears from the policy documents provided that a general presumption in favour of retention applies, and that as regards data held in central records which have not been shown to be inaccurate, retention until the data subject has attained one hundred years of age is standard in all cases. There can therefore be no doubt that the scope and application of the system for retention and disclosure is extensive."

However, the indiscriminate and open-ended collection of criminal record data is unlikely to comply with the requirements of Article 8 in the absence of clear and detailed statutory regulations clarifying the safeguards applicable and setting out the rules governing, inter alia, the circumstances in which data can be collected, the duration of their storage, the use to which they can be put and the circumstances in which they may be destroyed."

Retention of such data is carried out pursuant to the common law powers of the police, in accordance with the general principles set out in the Data Protection Act. In the absence of any statutory provisions, a number of policy documents which apply in Northern Ireland have been identified by the Government (see paragraphs 33-46 above). As noted above, it is clear from the MOPI Guidance and the ACPO Guidelines that the recording and initial retention of caution data are intended in practice to be automatic. While reference is made in the MOPI Guidance to a review of retention after a six-year period, the criteria for review appear to be very restrictive. The Guidance notes that there is a presumption in favour of retention and the review schedule requires police to retain data in the category of “Certain Public Protection Matters” until the data subject is deemed to have reached one hundred years of age, regardless of the type or classification of data or grade of the intelligence concerned (see paragraphs 39-40 above). Any review in such cases seems intended to focus on whether the data are adequate and up to date. Pursuant to the ACPO Guidelines, it appears that data held in central police records are now automatically retained, regardless of the seriousness of the offence in question, until the person is deemed to have reached one hundred years of age. The ACPO Guidelines themselves explain that they are based on a format of restricting access to data, rather than deleting them. While deletion requests can be made under the ACPO Guidelines, they should only be granted in exceptional circumstances (see paragraphs 43-46 above). As noted above the examples given as to what constitute exceptional circumstances do not suggest a possibility of deletion being ordered in any case where the data subject admits having committed an offence and the data are accurate."

                "204. Regarding any possible future disclosure of the applicant’s caution data, the Court observes that there is now a statutory framework in place for disclosure of criminal record information to prospective employers. Pursuant to the legislation now in place, caution data contained in central records, including where applicable information on spent cautions, must be disclosed in the context of a standard or enhanced criminal record check. No distinction is made based on the seriousness or the circumstances of the offence, the time which has elapsed since the offence was committed and whether the caution is spent. In short, there appears to be no scope for the exercise of any discretion in the disclosure exercise. Nor, as a consequence of the mandatory nature of the disclosure, is there any provision for the making of prior representations by the data subject to prevent the data being disclosed either generally or in a specific case. The applicable legislation does not allow for any assessment at any stage in the disclosure process of the relevance of conviction or caution data held in central records to the employment sought, or of the extent to which the data subject may be perceived as continuing to pose a risk such that the disclosure of the data to the employer is justified. In this regard the Court takes note of the offer made by the police in 2006 to add a comment to the applicant’s record to the effect that the incident was domestically related and that in any vetting context she should be approached for an explanation (see paragraph 16 above). It is unclear whether such addition could have any place in the disclosure system envisaged by the 1997 Act given the automatic nature of the disclosure exercise in respect of caution data held in central records. In any event, the apparent preference of many employers for a clean criminal record certificate (see paragraphs 87, 108 and 111 above) would deprive such addition of any real value."

I accept that it is possible that there could be cases where the information should not be included in the certificate because it is disproportionate to do so; the information might be as to some trifling matter; it may be that the evidence made it so unlikely that the information was correct, that it again would be disproportionate to disclose it.

He considered therefore that a process which could only culminate in measures of a preventative, curative, rehabilitative or welfare-promoting kind would not ordinarily involve the determination of a criminal charge. He accordingly concluded that neither the warning of the claimant nor the decision to warn him involved the determination of a criminal charge against him.

I am troubled by the fact that the claimant’s new employer in this case apparently operated a blanket policy of insisting on a ‘clean’ certificate, so that the disclosure of the three allegations led inevitably to the claimant’s dismissal on the transfer of his employment to that employer on a reorganisation at work. The legislation imposes a relatively low threshold for disclosure in the certificate in order to enable an employer to make a properly informed decision. But it is important that employers understand how low that threshold is and the responsibility that it places in practice upon them. A properly informed decision requires consideration not only of the information disclosed in the certificate but also of any additional information or explanation that the employee may provide. The operation of a blanket policy of insisting on a ‘clean’ certificate leaves no room for taking into account what the employee may have to say. That is a matter of particular concern if it leads to the dismissal of an existing employee or of someone whose employment is transferred to the employer on a reorganisation. On the basis of the limited material available to the court, I confess to some surprise that the claimant was advised in this case that he had no reasonable prospect of success in a claim for unfair dismissal resulting from the application of such a policy ...”",

It is now accepted that that is not accurate. Under Part V of the 1997 Act ‘stepped down’ convictions are required to be revealed even on ‘standard disclosure certificates’, and thus although ‘stepping down’ prevents disclosure in many circumstances to persons other than the police, it does not prevent disclosure by the police in many others including the circumstances under which disclosure was made of four of the convictions the subject of this appeal.”"

As it recedes into the past, it becomes a part of the person’s private life which must be respected. Moreover, much of the other information that may find its way into an ECRC relates to things that happen behind closed doors. A caution takes place in private, and the police gather and record information from a variety of sources which would not otherwise be made public.

It is common ground that the notification requirements interfere with offenders’ article 8 rights, that this interference is in accordance with the law and that it is directed at the legitimate aims of the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The issue is whether the notification requirements, as embodied in the 2003 Act, and without any right to a review, are proportionate to that aim. That issue requires consideration of three questions. (i) What is the extent of the interference with article 8 rights? (ii) How valuable are the notification requirements in achieving the legitimate aims? and (iii) To what extent would that value be eroded if the notification requirements were made subject to review? The issue is a narrow one. The respondents’ case is that the notification requirements cannot be proportionate in the absence of any right to a review.

If some of those who are subject to lifetime notification requirements no longer pose any significant risk of committing further sexual offences and it is possible for them to demonstrate that this is the case, there is no point in subjecting them to supervision or management or to the interference with their article 8 rights involved in visits to their local police stations in order to provide information about their places of residence and their travel plans. Indeed subjecting them to these requirements can only impose an unnecessary and unproductive burden on the responsible authorities.

Registration systems for sexual offenders are not uncommon in other jurisdictions.

It allows Member States to adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope of certain obligations and rights provided for in the Directive when such a restriction constitutes notably a necessary measure for the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences (Article 13)."

The applicant complained about the change in policy regarding retention of caution data, which means that it would now be retained for life, and the impact of this change on her employment prospects. It is clear that for as long as her data are retained and capable of being disclosed, she remains a victim of any potential violation of Article 8 arising from retention or disclosure. As Waller LJ noted in Chief Constable of Humberside, the complaint about retention in reality flows not from the retention itself but from the fact that, if retained, disclosure may follow (see paragraph 94 above). It is clear that if the applicant was able to have her data deleted, then it would no longer be available for disclosure. Alternatively, a remedy which prevented the disclosure of the data might have provided adequate redress.

The ACPO Guidelines specify in their general principles that records are to be retained until a subject reaches one hundred years of age; it appears that no distinction is drawn between offences for the purpose of the length of the retention period (see paragraph 45 above). Although the Guidelines refer to the discretion enjoyed by chief constables in “exceptional circumstances” to authorise deletion of data, the circumstances envisaged are very limited: Appendix 2 indicates that exceptional cases will be rare and gives the example of where it is established beyond reasonable doubt that no offence existed (see paragraph 46 above)."

Given the nature of the guidance on retention to which the Court has referred above (see paragraph 167 above) and the generous approach to the powers of the police to retain data set out therein, this is not surprising. The potential for a successful challenge to the exercise of the chief constable’s discretion to retain data, or indeed to the policy itself, was further diminished by the position of the domestic courts at the time, which tended to consider that Article 8 did not apply to mere retention of data or, if it did, that any interference was minor (see the House of Lords’ judgment regarding retention of DNA data which was challenged in S. and Marper, cited above, summarised at §§ 15-25 of that judgment)."

As regards a challenge to the disclosure of the caution data, the Court observes that in its 2004 judgment in R (X) dealing with disclosure under the 1997 Act of other “information” on an ECRC under the 1997 Act, the Court of Appeal took a robust approach to the exercise of discretion by the chief constable in choosing to disclose information in the context of a criminal record check. Lord Woolf CJ indicated that the chief constable was “under a duty” to disclose any information which might be relevant unless there was some good reason for not making the disclosure (see paragraph 79 above). He further found that the chief constable was not required to invite representations from the subject of the criminal record check before deciding what to include in the certificate (see paragraph 80 above). Specifically on the question of Article 8 considerations, the Court of Appeal expressed the view that it was difficult to see how a chief constable’s decision to disclose could ever be challenged (see paragraph 81 above). The Court observes that the case was decided against the backdrop of a clearly-defined legislative framework (i.e., the 1997 Act, which was in force in England and Wales at the time) which the court took to be in compliance with Article 8 (see paragraph 78 above). However, it considers that the court’s approach to the exercise of discretion is nonetheless indicative of a wide discretion afforded to the police to decide on questions of disclosure and a rejection of any need for the participation of the data subject in the decision to disclose criminal record data. It is also relevant to emphasise that the applicant’s case did not concern disclosure of other information under section 113B(4) but of caution data, the mandatory disclosure of which required by the 1997 Act reveals the view of the legislature that such information will always be relevant. It is significant that the Government have not pointed to any case decided at that time in which an individual had successfully challenged a decision to disclose criminal record data, either concerning convictions and caution data or in respect of section 113B(4) information.

While the case was brought by a number of individuals seeking to have their own data deleted, Waller LJ emphasised that the ramifications of the cases were far wider than the cases themselves, since if the convictions at issue were to be deleted and the police were to treat people consistently, the result would be the deletion of around one million convictions (see paragraph 88 above). It follows that the scope of the appeals went beyond the personal interests of the individuals directly involved in the proceedings so that, in that sense, the decision of the Court of Appeal was of more general application and affected others, such as the applicant, in a similar position."

He was of the opinion that in assessing whether the data retained were excessive or were being retained for longer than necessary, there was “only one answer” since in order to be able to supply accurate records of convictions, a complete record of conviction, spent or otherwise, was required. This was, he said, a “complete answer to the appeal” (see paragraph 92 above). Even if a narrower approach to police purposes were to be adopted, Waller LJ indicated that the retention of the data would remain lawful because if the police said rationally and reasonably that convictions, however old or minor, had a value in the work they did, then that should be the end of the matter (see paragraph 93 above). As to whether the retention of data violated Article 8 of the Convention, Waller LJ doubted whether Article 8 applied but, even if it did, considered that the retention was in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society (see paragraph 96 above).

Sections 113A(3) and 113B(3) impose a mandatory obligation to disclose data pertaining to cautions held in central records, including cautions which are spent pursuant to legislation covering rehabilitation of offenders, in both CRCs and ECRCs (see paragraphs 49 and 54 above).

For this purpose, individual circumstances had to be considered. While the applicant accepted that the change in policy was intended to secure the protection of children, the automatic nature of the rule was problematic. In the applicant’s case, the caution related to action taken in the heat of the moment in a family situation with very specific circumstances. There was no suggestion that the applicant represented a general threat to children and the continued retention of her data therefore did not, she contended, pursue the legitimate aim of protecting children. It was clear from the correspondence with the police that the only relevant factor was the code applied to her caution (see paragraph 14 above). She further argued that there was no review process to assess the necessity of continued retention of the caution data."

They distinguished the Court’s judgment in S. and Marper on the grounds that the retention of the caution data in the present case did not concern any latent information about an individual of the type that might exist in cellular samples. In their view, retention of criminal record data by the police was an inevitable and commonplace feature of any effective and proper criminal justice system and did not interfere with Article 8 rights in any meaningful way."

As regards retention, the Government emphasised that it occurred in accordance with the law in a number of well-established ways, pursuant to common law powers as police officers and their statutory powers of policing and in accordance with the principles set out in the Data Protection Act. It pursued the legitimate aims of public safety, the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Finally, retention was also necessary and proportionate. Retention was primarily a matter of judgment for the individual police force or Government in question in accordance with the margin of appreciation. However, retention was usually necessary and proportionate as it was important for the police to retain records of what had happened. They referred in this respect to the MOPI Guidance 2006 (see paragraphs 36-41 above)."

However, and in any case, they argued that an assessment of the need for disclosure was a matter for the policy judgment of the State in question and fell within the margin of appreciation, regard being had to the objectives of the legislation and the relevance of the information to the employment being sought. An individual dissatisfied with disclosure in her case could challenge it by way of judicial review or pursue a complaint to the Information Commissioner. In the applicant’s case, the disclosure was made in accordance with the law and the applicant does not suggest otherwise. It took place for a legitimate purpose, namely the prevention of disorder and crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Finally it was both necessary and proportionate to the aim pursued. In this regard it was relevant that the applicant herself requested the disclosure; she was applying for a job working with children and vulnerable adults; she recognised the relevance of the incident to her employment; and the disclosure was factually correct."

The Court reiterates that both the storing of information relating to an individual’s private life and the release of such information come within the scope of Article 8 § 1 (see Leander, cited above, § 48; Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, §§ 65 and 69-70, ECHR 2000-II; Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 43, ECHR 2000 ‑ V. See also S. and Marper, cited above, § 67; and Khelili v. Switzerland, no. 16188/07, § 55, 18 October 2011, on the applicability of Article 8 to the storage of data). Even public information can fall within the scope of private life where it is systematically collected and stored in files held by the authorities (see Rotaru, cited above, § 43; P.G. and J.H., cited above, § 57; Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden, no. 62332/00, § 72, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII; and Cemalettin Canlı v. Turkey, no. 22427/04, § 33, 18 November 2008). This is all the more true where the information concerns a person’s distant past ( Rotaru, cited above, § 43; and Cemalettin Canlı, cited above, § 33). The question therefore arises in the present case whether the data relating to the applicant’s caution stored in police records constitute data relating to the applicant’s “private life” and, if so, whether there has been an interference with her right to respect for private life."

The Court notes at the outset that the data in question constitute both “personal data” and “sensitive personal data” within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 (see paragraph 67 above). They also constitute “personal data” and are identified as a special category of data under the Council of Europe’s Data Protection Convention (see paragraphs 122-123 above). Further, the data form part of the applicant’s criminal record (see Rotaru, cited above, §§ 43-46; and B.B., cited above, § 57). In this regard the Court, like Lord Hope in R (L), emphasises that although data contained in the criminal record are, in one sense, public information, their systematic storing in central records means that they are available for disclosure long after the event when everyone other than the person concerned is likely to have forgotten about it, and all the more so where, as in the present case, the caution has occurred in private. Thus as the conviction or caution itself recedes into the past, it becomes a part of the person’s private life which must be respected (see Rotaru, cited above, §§ 43-44). In the present case, the administration of the caution occurred almost twelve years ago."

The Court observes that the posts for which the applicant applied were subject to vetting. In this context she was asked for details of her conviction and caution history and provided them as requested. The Court notes and agrees with the comments of Lords Hope and Neuberger in R (L), to the effect that the fact that disclosure follows upon a request by the data subject or with her consent is no answer to concerns regarding the compatibility of disclosure with Article 8 of the Convention. Individuals have no real choice if an employer in their chosen profession insists, and is entitled to do so, on disclosure: as Lord Hope noted, consent to a request for criminal record data is conditional on the right to respect for private life being respected (see paragraph 106 above). The applicant’s agreement to disclosure does not deprive her of the protection afforded by the Convention (see paragraph 110 above)."

The law must thus be adequately accessible and foreseeable, that is, formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual – if need be with appropriate advice – to regulate his conduct. For domestic law to meet these requirements, it must afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness and accordingly indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, §§ 66-68, Series A no. 82; Rotaru, cited above, §§ 52 and 55; Liberty and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 58243/00, § 59, 1 July 2008; and S. and Marper, cited above, § 95)."

A significant amount of additional data recorded by police forces is also retained. It is clear from the available guidance that both the recording and, at least, the initial retention of all relevant data are intended to be automatic. It further appears from the policy documents provided that a general presumption in favour of retention applies, and that as regards data held in central records which have not been shown to be inaccurate, retention until the data subject has attained one hundred years of age is standard in all cases. There can therefore be no doubt that the scope and application of the system for retention and disclosure is extensive."

Further, the greater the scope of the recording system, and thus the greater the amount and sensitivity of data held and available for disclosure, the more important the content of the safeguards to be applied at the various crucial stages in the subsequent processing of the data. The Court considers that the obligation on the authorities responsible for retaining and disclosing criminal record data to secure respect for private life is particularly important, given the nature of the data held and the potentially devastating consequences of their disclosure. In R (L), Lord Hope noted that in 2008/2009 almost 275,000 requests were made for ECRCs alone (see paragraph 105 above). This number is significant and demonstrates the wide reach of the legislation requiring disclosure. As Lord Neuberger indicated, even where the criminal record certificate records a conviction or caution for a relatively minor, or questionably relevant, offence, a prospective employer may well feel it safer to reject the applicant (see paragraph 108 above; see also the views expressed in the Divisional Court in R (Pinnington), at paragraph 87 above). The Court agrees with Lord Neuberger that it is realistic to assume that, in the majority of cases, an adverse criminal record certificate will represent something close to a “killer blow” to the hopes of a person who aspires to any post which falls within the scope of disclosure requirements (see paragraph 111 above)."

Retention of such data is carried out pursuant to the common law powers of the police, in accordance with the general principles set out in the Data Protection Act. In the absence of any statutory provisions, a number of policy documents which apply in Northern Ireland have been identified by the Government (see paragraphs 33-46 above). As noted above, it is clear from the MOPI Guidance and the ACPO Guidelines that the recording and initial retention of caution data are intended in practice to be automatic. While reference is made in the MOPI Guidance to a review of retention after a six-year period, the criteria for review appear to be very restrictive. The Guidance notes that there is a presumption in favour of retention and the review schedule requires police to retain data in the category of “Certain Public Protection Matters” until the data subject is deemed to have reached one hundred years of age, regardless of the type or classification of data or grade of the intelligence concerned (see paragraphs 39-40 above). Any review in such cases seems intended to focus on whether the data are adequate and up to date. Pursuant to the ACPO Guidelines, it appears that data held in central police records are now automatically retained, regardless of the seriousness of the offence in question, until the person is deemed to have reached one hundred years of age. The ACPO Guidelines themselves explain that they are based on a format of restricting access to data, rather than deleting them. While deletion requests can be made under the ACPO Guidelines, they should only be granted in exceptional circumstances (see paragraphs 43-46 above). As noted above the examples given as to what constitute exceptional circumstances do not suggest a possibility of deletion being ordered in any case where the data subject admits having committed an offence and the data are accurate."

The disclosure of the applicant’s caution data took place pursuant to the common law powers of the police, in accordance with the general principles set out in the Data Protection Act. The only policy guidance to which the Government have referred is contained in the ACPO Guidelines and the MOPI Guidance. The MOPI Guidance refers to the comprehensive system for disclosure in the employment vetting context set out in the 1997 Act, which did not apply in Northern Ireland at the time, and to general disclosure for police purposes under common law powers (see paragraph 58-59 above). The Guidance explains that in this context a balancing exercise must be carried out, but specific information regarding the scope of the discretion to disclose and the factors which are relevant to the exercise of such powers in the context of disclosure of criminal record information is not provided. Although the ACPO Guidelines make reference to a stepping down policy to limit access to data after a certain time period has passed, as noted above it appears that stepped down data were still intended to be available for disclosure in the context of requests for criminal record checks (see paragraphs 60 and 89 above)."

                "204. Regarding any possible future disclosure of the applicant’s caution data, the Court observes that there is now a statutory framework in place for disclosure of criminal record information to prospective employers. Pursuant to the legislation now in place, caution data contained in central records, including where applicable information on spent cautions, must be disclosed in the context of a standard or enhanced criminal record check. No distinction is made based on the seriousness or the circumstances of the offence, the time which has elapsed since the offence was committed and whether the caution is spent. In short, there appears to be no scope for the exercise of any discretion in the disclosure exercise. Nor, as a consequence of the mandatory nature of the disclosure, is there any provision for the making of prior representations by the data subject to prevent the data being disclosed either generally or in a specific case. The applicable legislation does not allow for any assessment at any stage in the disclosure process of the relevance of conviction or caution data held in central records to the employment sought, or of the extent to which the data subject may be perceived as continuing to pose a risk such that the disclosure of the data to the employer is justified. In this regard the Court takes note of the offer made by the police in 2006 to add a comment to the applicant’s record to the effect that the incident was domestically related and that in any vetting context she should be approached for an explanation (see paragraph 16 above). It is unclear whether such addition could have any place in the disclosure system envisaged by the 1997 Act given the automatic nature of the disclosure exercise in respect of caution data held in central records. In any event, the apparent preference of many employers for a clean criminal record certificate (see paragraphs 87, 108 and 111 above) would deprive such addition of any real value."

As regards specifically the fact that the retention policy changed after the administration of the applicant’s caution, the Court notes that the applicant consented to the administration of the caution on the basis that it would be deleted from her record after five years. The Government have confirmed that this was the policy of the PSNI at the relevant time (see paragraph 25 above. See also the 1995 ACPO Code of Practice, paragraph 29 above). The police reply to the applicant’s query in March 2003 is consistent with this understanding and confirmed that the caution would remain on her record until 17 November 2005 (see paragraph 10 above). The Court notes that in accepting the caution, the applicant waived her fair trial rights in respect of the offence in issue. It is not for the Court to assess whether she would, with the benefit of hindsight, have been in a better position now had she refused the caution. It must be recalled that the administration of the caution relieved her of the stress and anxiety of a potential criminal trial, which could have resulted in a custodial sentence had she been found guilty. However, the Court expresses concern about the change in policy, which occurred several years after the applicant had accepted the caution and which was to have significant effects on her employment prospects."

According to the applicant, the disclosure had caused her serious stress and anxiety. Everyone at her workplace, including her students, had learned details about her private life, and different rumours had begun to circulate. Only two days after the disclosure, she had suffered a miscarriage due to the stress to which she had been subjected. Her husband, who had also been an employee of the Police Academy, had had to resign from his post and accept a less well- paid job."

Thus, all witnesses submitted that they did not have any hostile feelings towards Mrs Bogomolova, the attitude [towards Mrs Bogomolova] of all those questioned [in the court hearing] remained the same: friendly, amicable; they were not aware of any instances of insults, reproaches in respect of the plaintiff. In the subjective view of the witnesses, the booklet in itself had a positive scope. The plaintiff ’ s professional reputation was not affected by the publication of the booklet in any way, since the plaintiff had provided the court with positive references from her workplace, where her pedagogical competences were highly appreciated.",

The court takes into account that on several occasions in 2004 the plaintiff authorised Mr Sh. , a photographer familiar to her, to take photographs of her son. Sh. then forwarded the photographs to painter Mr P., who [in his turn] then placed [one of] the photograph [s] in the booklet. Mrs Bogomolova did not place any restrictions or conditions on the use of those photographs, did not seek to find out what had happened to those photographs. In addition, it follows from witness statements that after publication of the booklet, the plaintiff showed it to persons around her and at her workplace and annotated it in an emotionally skewed way, and thus disseminated false information about herself and her son with reference to the photograph [on the booklet].",

Austria ( 31 January 1995, §§ 50-51, Series A no. 305 ‑ B ), the Government also pointed out that the booklet did not contain any information as to the identity of the applicant ’ s son and no action had been taken to identify the boy from the photograph.

In order for Article 8 to come into play, the attack on personal reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and must have been carried out in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see A. v.

The Court reiterates that both the storing of information relating to an individual’s private life and the release of such information come within the scope of Article 8 § 1 (see Leander, cited above, § 48; Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, §§ 65 and 69-70, ECHR 2000-II; Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 43, ECHR 2000 ‑ V. See also S. and Marper, cited above, § 67; and Khelili v. Switzerland, no. 16188/07, § 55, 18 October 2011, on the applicability of Article 8 to the storage of data). Even public information can fall within the scope of private life where it is systematically collected and stored in files held by the authorities (see Rotaru, cited above, § 43; P.G. and J.H., cited above, § 57; Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden, no. 62332/00, § 72, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII; and Cemalettin Canlı v. Turkey, no. 22427/04, § 33, 18 November 2008). This is all the more true where the information concerns a person’s distant past ( Rotaru, cited above, § 43; and Cemalettin Canlı, cited above, § 33). The question therefore arises in the present case whether the data relating to the applicant’s caution stored in police records constitute data relating to the applicant’s “private life” and, if so, whether there has been an interference with her right to respect for private life."

The Court notes at the outset that the data in question constitute both “personal data” and “sensitive personal data” within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 (see paragraph 67 above). They also constitute “personal data” and are identified as a special category of data under the Council of Europe’s Data Protection Convention (see paragraphs 122-123 above). Further, the data form part of the applicant’s criminal record (see Rotaru, cited above, §§ 43-46; and B.B., cited above, § 57). In this regard the Court, like Lord Hope in R (L), emphasises that although data contained in the criminal record are, in one sense, public information, their systematic storing in central records means that they are available for disclosure long after the event when everyone other than the person concerned is likely to have forgotten about it, and all the more so where, as in the present case, the caution has occurred in private. Thus as the conviction or caution itself recedes into the past, it becomes a part of the person’s private life which must be respected (see Rotaru, cited above, §§ 43-44). In the present case, the administration of the caution occurred almost twelve years ago."

The Court observes that the posts for which the applicant applied were subject to vetting. In this context she was asked for details of her conviction and caution history and provided them as requested. The Court notes and agrees with the comments of Lords Hope and Neuberger in R (L), to the effect that the fact that disclosure follows upon a request by the data subject or with her consent is no answer to concerns regarding the compatibility of disclosure with Article 8 of the Convention. Individuals have no real choice if an employer in their chosen profession insists, and is entitled to do so, on disclosure: as Lord Hope noted, consent to a request for criminal record data is conditional on the right to respect for private life being respected (see paragraph 106 above). The applicant’s agreement to disclosure does not deprive her of the protection afforded by the Convention (see paragraph 110 above)."

The law must thus be adequately accessible and foreseeable, that is, formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual – if need be with appropriate advice – to regulate his conduct.

It further appears from the policy documents provided that a general presumption in favour of retention applies, and that as regards data held in central records which have not been shown to be inaccurate, retention until the data subject has attained one hundred years of age is standard in all cases.

Further, the greater the scope of the recording system, and thus the greater the amount and sensitivity of data held and available for disclosure, the more important the content of the safeguards to be applied at the various crucial stages in the subsequent processing of the data. The Court considers that the obligation on the authorities responsible for retaining and disclosing criminal record data to secure respect for private life is particularly important, given the nature of the data held and the potentially devastating consequences of their disclosure. In R (L), Lord Hope noted that in 2008/2009 almost 275,000 requests were made for ECRCs alone (see paragraph 105 above). This number is significant and demonstrates the wide reach of the legislation requiring disclosure. As Lord Neuberger indicated, even where the criminal record certificate records a conviction or caution for a relatively minor, or questionably relevant, offence, a prospective employer may well feel it safer to reject the applicant (see paragraph 108 above; see also the views expressed in the Divisional Court in R (Pinnington), at paragraph 87 above). The Court agrees with Lord Neuberger that it is realistic to assume that, in the majority of cases, an adverse criminal record certificate will represent something close to a “killer blow” to the hopes of a person who aspires to any post which falls within the scope of disclosure requirements (see paragraph 111 above)."

Retention of such data is carried out pursuant to the common law powers of the police, in accordance with the general principles set out in the Data Protection Act. In the absence of any statutory provisions, a number of policy documents which apply in Northern Ireland have been identified by the Government (see paragraphs 33-46 above). As noted above, it is clear from the MOPI Guidance and the ACPO Guidelines that the recording and initial retention of caution data are intended in practice to be automatic. While reference is made in the MOPI Guidance to a review of retention after a six-year period, the criteria for review appear to be very restrictive. The Guidance notes that there is a presumption in favour of retention and the review schedule requires police to retain data in the category of “Certain Public Protection Matters” until the data subject is deemed to have reached one hundred years of age, regardless of the type or classification of data or grade of the intelligence concerned (see paragraphs 39-40 above). Any review in such cases seems intended to focus on whether the data are adequate and up to date. Pursuant to the ACPO Guidelines, it appears that data held in central police records are now automatically retained, regardless of the seriousness of the offence in question, until the person is deemed to have reached one hundred years of age. The ACPO Guidelines themselves explain that they are based on a format of restricting access to data, rather than deleting them. While deletion requests can be made under the ACPO Guidelines, they should only be granted in exceptional circumstances (see paragraphs 43-46 above). As noted above the examples given as to what constitute exceptional circumstances do not suggest a possibility of deletion being ordered in any case where the data subject admits having committed an offence and the data are accurate."

As for disclosure of caution data, at the relevant time there was no statutory framework in place in Northern Ireland which governed the communication of such data by the police to prospective employers. The disclosure of the applicant’s caution data took place pursuant to the common law powers of the police, in accordance with the general principles set out in the Data Protection Act. The only policy guidance to which the Government have referred is contained in the ACPO Guidelines and the MOPI Guidance. The MOPI Guidance refers to the comprehensive system for disclosure in the employment vetting context set out in the 1997 Act, which did not apply in Northern Ireland at the time, and to general disclosure for police purposes under common law powers (see paragraph 58-59 above). The Guidance explains that in this context a balancing exercise must be carried out, but specific information regarding the scope of the discretion to disclose and the factors which are relevant to the exercise of such powers in the context of disclosure of criminal record information is not provided. Although the ACPO Guidelines make reference to a stepping down policy to limit access to data after a certain time period has passed, as noted above it appears that stepped down data were still intended to be available for disclosure in the context of requests for criminal record checks (see paragraphs 60 and 89 above)."

                "204. Regarding any possible future disclosure of the applicant’s caution data, the Court observes that there is now a statutory framework in place for disclosure of criminal record information to prospective employers. Pursuant to the legislation now in place, caution data contained in central records, including where applicable information on spent cautions, must be disclosed in the context of a standard or enhanced criminal record check. No distinction is made based on the seriousness or the circumstances of the offence, the time which has elapsed since the offence was committed and whether the caution is spent. In short, there appears to be no scope for the exercise of any discretion in the disclosure exercise. Nor, as a consequence of the mandatory nature of the disclosure, is there any provision for the making of prior representations by the data subject to prevent the data being disclosed either generally or in a specific case. The applicable legislation does not allow for any assessment at any stage in the disclosure process of the relevance of conviction or caution data held in central records to the employment sought, or of the extent to which the data subject may be perceived as continuing to pose a risk such that the disclosure of the data to the employer is justified. In this regard the Court takes note of the offer made by the police in 2006 to add a comment to the applicant’s record to the effect that the incident was domestically related and that in any vetting context she should be approached for an explanation (see paragraph 16 above). It is unclear whether such addition could have any place in the disclosure system envisaged by the 1997 Act given the automatic nature of the disclosure exercise in respect of caution data held in central records. In any event, the apparent preference of many employers for a clean criminal record certificate (see paragraphs 87, 108 and 111 above) would deprive such addition of any real value."

As regards specifically the fact that the retention policy changed after the administration of the applicant’s caution, the Court notes that the applicant consented to the administration of the caution on the basis that it would be deleted from her record after five years. The Government have confirmed that this was the policy of the PSNI at the relevant time (see paragraph 25 above. See also the 1995 ACPO Code of Practice, paragraph 29 above). The police reply to the applicant’s query in March 2003 is consistent with this understanding and confirmed that the caution would remain on her record until 17 November 2005 (see paragraph 10 above). The Court notes that in accepting the caution, the applicant waived her fair trial rights in respect of the offence in issue. It is not for the Court to assess whether she would, with the benefit of hindsight, have been in a better position now had she refused the caution. It must be recalled that the administration of the caution relieved her of the stress and anxiety of a potential criminal trial, which could have resulted in a custodial sentence had she been found guilty. However, the Court expresses concern about the change in policy, which occurred several years after the applicant had accepted the caution and which was to have significant effects on her employment prospects."

I accept that it is possible that there could be cases where the information should not be included in the certificate because it is disproportionate to do so; the information might be as to some trifling matter; it may be that the evidence made it so unlikely that the information was correct, that it again would be disproportionate to disclose it.

He considered therefore that a process which could only culminate in measures of a preventative, curative, rehabilitative or welfare-promoting kind would not ordinarily involve the determination of a criminal charge. He accordingly concluded that neither the warning of the claimant nor the decision to warn him involved the determination of a criminal charge against him.

The legislation imposes a relatively low threshold for disclosure in the certificate in order to enable an employer to make a properly informed decision. But it is important that employers understand how low that threshold is and the responsibility that it places in practice upon them. A properly informed decision requires consideration not only of the information disclosed in the certificate but also of any additional information or explanation that the employee may provide. The operation of a blanket policy of insisting on a ‘clean’ certificate leaves no room for taking into account what the employee may have to say. That is a matter of particular concern if it leads to the dismissal of an existing employee or of someone whose employment is transferred to the employer on a reorganisation. On the basis of the limited material available to the court, I confess to some surprise that the claimant was advised in this case that he had no reasonable prospect of success in a claim for unfair dismissal resulting from the application of such a policy ...”",

Furthermore, the deletion of this reprimand leading (as it would have to) to deletion of many others would be likely to prejudice the prevention and detection of crime and the apprehension or prosecution of offenders.

In its judgment in R (L), handed down on 29 October 2009, ten days after the Court of Appeal’s ruling in Chief Constable of Humberside, the Supreme Court considered the Court of Appeal’s ruling in R (X) (see paragraphs 77-81 above) in the context of a case concerning disclosure of police information under the predecessor of section 113B(4) in the context of an ECRC. The appellant had secured a job as a playground assistant and the school required an ECRC to which the appellant consented. The ECRC disclosed that the appellant had been suspected of child neglect and non-cooperation with social services. The appellant had not been charged with, or convicted of, any offence, nor had she received a caution. Her employment was subsequently terminated and she brought judicial review proceedings, arguing that the disclosure of the information had violated her rights under Article 8. At issue was whether the requirement in the 1997 Act that chief officers provide information which “might be relevant” and “ought to be disclosed” when an ECRC was requested, was proportionate."

It is, in one sense, public information because the convictions took place in public. But the systematic storing of this information in central records means that it is available for disclosure under Part V of the 1997 Act long after the event when everyone other than the person concerned is likely to have forgotten about it. As it recedes into the past, it becomes a part of the person’s private life which must be respected. Moreover, much of the other information that may find its way into an ECRC relates to things that happen behind closed doors. A caution takes place in private, and the police gather and record information from a variety of sources which would not otherwise be made public. It may include allegations of criminal behaviour for which there was insufficient evidence to prosecute ... It may even disclose something that could not be described as criminal behaviour at all. The information that was disclosed on the appellant’s ECRC was of that kind.”"

This required consideration of whether there was likely to be an interference with the individual’s private life and, if so, whether the interference could be justified.

On the one hand there is a pressing social need that children and vulnerable adults should be protected against the risk of harm. On the other there is the applicant’s right to respect for her private life. It is of the greatest importance that the balance between these two considerations is struck in the right place ... [T]he use that is being made of the requirement to obtain an ECRC has increased substantially since the scheme was first devised.

The issue is whether the notification requirements, as embodied in the 2003 Act, and without any right to a review, are proportionate to that aim. That issue requires consideration of three questions. (i) What is the extent of the interference with article 8 rights? (ii) How valuable are the notification requirements in achieving the legitimate aims? and (iii) To what extent would that value be eroded if the notification requirements were made subject to review? The issue is a narrow one. The respondents’ case is that the notification requirements cannot be proportionate in the absence of any right to a review.

If some of those who are subject to lifetime notification requirements no longer pose any significant risk of committing further sexual offences and it is possible for them to demonstrate that this is the case, there is no point in subjecting them to supervision or management or to the interference with their article 8 rights involved in visits to their local police stations in order to provide information about their places of residence and their travel plans.

Registration systems for sexual offenders are not uncommon in other jurisdictions.

The applicant complained about the change in policy regarding retention of caution data, which means that it would now be retained for life, and the impact of this change on her employment prospects. It is clear that for as long as her data are retained and capable of being disclosed, she remains a victim of any potential violation of Article 8 arising from retention or disclosure. As Waller LJ noted in Chief Constable of Humberside, the complaint about retention in reality flows not from the retention itself but from the fact that, if retained, disclosure may follow (see paragraph 94 above). It is clear that if the applicant was able to have her data deleted, then it would no longer be available for disclosure. Alternatively, a remedy which prevented the disclosure of the data might have provided adequate redress.

The ACPO Guidelines specify in their general principles that records are to be retained until a subject reaches one hundred years of age; it appears that no distinction is drawn between offences for the purpose of the length of the retention period (see paragraph 45 above). Although the Guidelines refer to the discretion enjoyed by chief constables in “exceptional circumstances” to authorise deletion of data, the circumstances envisaged are very limited: Appendix 2 indicates that exceptional cases will be rare and gives the example of where it is established beyond reasonable doubt that no offence existed (see paragraph 46 above)."

Given the nature of the guidance on retention to which the Court has referred above (see paragraph 167 above) and the generous approach to the powers of the police to retain data set out therein, this is not surprising. The potential for a successful challenge to the exercise of the chief constable’s discretion to retain data, or indeed to the policy itself, was further diminished by the position of the domestic courts at the time, which tended to consider that Article 8 did not apply to mere retention of data or, if it did, that any interference was minor (see the House of Lords’ judgment regarding retention of DNA data which was challenged in S. and Marper, cited above, summarised at §§ 15-25 of that judgment)."

As regards a challenge to the disclosure of the caution data, the Court observes that in its 2004 judgment in R (X) dealing with disclosure under the 1997 Act of other “information” on an ECRC under the 1997 Act, the Court of Appeal took a robust approach to the exercise of discretion by the chief constable in choosing to disclose information in the context of a criminal record check. Lord Woolf CJ indicated that the chief constable was “under a duty” to disclose any information which might be relevant unless there was some good reason for not making the disclosure (see paragraph 79 above). He further found that the chief constable was not required to invite representations from the subject of the criminal record check before deciding what to include in the certificate (see paragraph 80 above). Specifically on the question of Article 8 considerations, the Court of Appeal expressed the view that it was difficult to see how a chief constable’s decision to disclose could ever be challenged (see paragraph 81 above). The Court observes that the case was decided against the backdrop of a clearly-defined legislative framework (i.e., the 1997 Act, which was in force in England and Wales at the time) which the court took to be in compliance with Article 8 (see paragraph 78 above). However, it considers that the court’s approach to the exercise of discretion is nonetheless indicative of a wide discretion afforded to the police to decide on questions of disclosure and a rejection of any need for the participation of the data subject in the decision to disclose criminal record data. It is also relevant to emphasise that the applicant’s case did not concern disclosure of other information under section 113B(4) but of caution data, the mandatory disclosure of which required by the 1997 Act reveals the view of the legislature that such information will always be relevant. It is significant that the Government have not pointed to any case decided at that time in which an individual had successfully challenged a decision to disclose criminal record data, either concerning convictions and caution data or in respect of section 113B(4) information.

                "173. First, as regards retention of criminal record data, in 2009 the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment in the case of Chief Constable of Humberside, which considered whether the Data Protection Act or Article 8 required deletion of old convictions following a decision by the Information Commissioner that it did. While the case was brought by a number of individuals seeking to have their own data deleted, Waller LJ emphasised that the ramifications of the cases were far wider than the cases themselves, since if the convictions at issue were to be deleted and the police were to treat people consistently, the result would be the deletion of around one million convictions (see paragraph 88 above). It follows that the scope of the appeals went beyond the personal interests of the individuals directly involved in the proceedings so that, in that sense, the decision of the Court of Appeal was of more general application and affected others, such as the applicant, in a similar position."

                "174. Waller LJ considered the argument that there was no statutory obligation on the police to retain data under the Police Act, but noted that “on any view” the Act seemed to recognise that the data would be there to be provided (see paragraph 90 above). He was of the opinion that in assessing whether the data retained were excessive or were being retained for longer than necessary, there was “only one answer” since in order to be able to supply accurate records of convictions, a complete record of conviction, spent or otherwise, was required. This was, he said, a “complete answer to the appeal” (see paragraph 92 above). Even if a narrower approach to police purposes were to be adopted, Waller LJ indicated that the retention of the data would remain lawful because if the police said rationally and reasonably that convictions, however old or minor, had a value in the work they did, then that should be the end of the matter (see paragraph 93 above). As to whether the retention of data violated Article 8 of the Convention, Waller LJ doubted whether Article 8 applied but, even if it did, considered that the retention was in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society (see paragraph 96 above). Carnwath LJ also expressed some doubt as to whether Article 8 applied to the recording of a conviction (see paragraph 98 above)."

It is also of relevance that one of the individuals in that case sought to argue that continued retention of data relating to a reprimand was unfair because she had been assured that it would be removed when she reached the age of eighteen. Waller LJ, with whom Hughes LJ agreed, dismissed this argument, indicating that if it was fair to retain data under the new policy then it did not become unfair simply because the individual had been told what the policy was at the time she was reprimanded. He further referred to the fact that the deletion of her reprimand would lead to the deletion of many others and would therefore be likely to prejudice the prevention and detection of crime and the apprehension and prosecution of offenders (see paragraph 95 above)."

Following the Court of Appeal’s findings in Chief Constable of Humberside, and the refusal of leave by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 100 above), it is not clear how any proceedings commenced or complaint lodged by the applicant in order to challenge the retention of her caution data could seek to distinguish that case and thus offer her reasonable prospects of success in obtaining deletion of her data. The Government have not specified how she could have done so, nor have they clarified whether, in their view, in the light of that judgment, the judicial review remedy proposed by them offered to the applicant “reasonable prospects of success” in respect of the continued retention of her data."

Second, as regards the disclosure of the applicant’s data, the position changed significantly with the entry into force in Northern Ireland of the relevant provisions of the Police Act 1997. While the applicant does not allege that her data have been disclosed pursuant to these provisions, as the Court has noted above her complaint clearly encompasses the continuing threat of disclosure arising from the fact that her data have been retained (see paragraph 159 above). Sections 113A(3) and 113B(3) impose a mandatory obligation to disclose data pertaining to cautions held in central records, including cautions which are spent pursuant to legislation covering rehabilitation of offenders, in both CRCs and ECRCs (see paragraphs 49 and 54 above). Unlike the case of other information included in an ECRC pursuant to section 113B(4) (see paragraph 55 above), there is no discretion afforded to chief constables to choose to omit data pertaining to cautions, and any such data retained in central records must accordingly be disclosed."

In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that a challenge to the disclosure of caution data following the entry into force of the 1997 Act in Northern Ireland would necessarily have to proceed by way of a challenge to sections 113A and 113B themselves. Pursuant to the Human Rights Act, it would be open to the applicant to request that the provisions be interpreted in a manner compatible with the Convention or to seek a declaration of incompatibility pursuant to section 4(2) of Act (see paragraphs 72-73 above). The Government did not comment on whether, in their view, the relevant provisions could be interpreted in a compatible manner. In light of the information before it, and in particular given the clear terms of the legislation, the Court is not persuaded that the possibility of proceedings seeking a compliant interpretation under the Human Rights Act offered reasonable prospects of success. Although a declaration of incompatibility could be sought, there is no obligation following the making of such a declaration for the Government to amend the legislation and no entitlement to damages arises. The Court has therefore previously indicated that a declaration of incompatibility cannot be considered an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, §§ 43-44, ECHR 2008; and Kennedy, cited above, § 109) and it sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case."

In the applicant’s case, the caution related to action taken in the heat of the moment in a family situation with very specific circumstances. There was no suggestion that the applicant represented a general threat to children and the continued retention of her data therefore did not, she contended, pursue the legitimate aim of protecting children. It was clear from the correspondence with the police that the only relevant factor was the code applied to her caution (see paragraph 14 above). She further argued that there was no review process to assess the necessity of continued retention of the caution data."

They distinguished the Court’s judgment in S. and Marper on the grounds that the retention of the caution data in the present case did not concern any latent information about an individual of the type that might exist in cellular samples. In their view, retention of criminal record data by the police was an inevitable and commonplace feature of any effective and proper criminal justice system and did not interfere with Article 8 rights in any meaningful way."

It pursued the legitimate aims of public safety, the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Finally, retention was also necessary and proportionate. Retention was primarily a matter of judgment for the individual police force or Government in question in accordance with the margin of appreciation.

An individual dissatisfied with disclosure in her case could challenge it by way of judicial review or pursue a complaint to the Information Commissioner. In the applicant’s case, the disclosure was made in accordance with the law and the applicant does not suggest otherwise. It took place for a legitimate purpose, namely the prevention of disorder and crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Finally it was both necessary and proportionate to the aim pursued. In this regard it was relevant that the applicant herself requested the disclosure; she was applying for a job working with children and vulnerable adults; she recognised the relevance of the incident to her employment; and the disclosure was factually correct."

The Court reiterates that both the storing of information relating to an individual’s private life and the release of such information come within the scope of Article 8 § 1 (see Leander, cited above, § 48; Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, §§ 65 and 69-70, ECHR 2000-II; Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 43, ECHR 2000 ‑ V. See also S. and Marper, cited above, § 67; and Khelili v. Switzerland, no. 16188/07, § 55, 18 October 2011, on the applicability of Article 8 to the storage of data). Even public information can fall within the scope of private life where it is systematically collected and stored in files held by the authorities (see Rotaru, cited above, § 43; P.G. and J.H., cited above, § 57; Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden, no. 62332/00, § 72, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII; and Cemalettin Canlı v. Turkey, no. 22427/04, § 33, 18 November 2008). This is all the more true where the information concerns a person’s distant past ( Rotaru, cited above, § 43; and Cemalettin Canlı, cited above, § 33).

They also constitute “personal data” and are identified as a special category of data under the Council of Europe’s Data Protection Convention (see paragraphs 122-123 above). Further, the data form part of the applicant’s criminal record (see Rotaru, cited above, §§ 43-46; and B.B., cited above, § 57). In this regard the Court, like Lord Hope in R (L), emphasises that although data contained in the criminal record are, in one sense, public information, their systematic storing in central records means that they are available for disclosure long after the event when everyone other than the person concerned is likely to have forgotten about it, and all the more so where, as in the present case, the caution has occurred in private. Thus as the conviction or caution itself recedes into the past, it becomes a part of the person’s private life which must be respected (see Rotaru, cited above, §§ 43-44).

In this context she was asked for details of her conviction and caution history and provided them as requested. The Court notes and agrees with the comments of Lords Hope and Neuberger in R (L), to the effect that the fact that disclosure follows upon a request by the data subject or with her consent is no answer to concerns regarding the compatibility of disclosure with Article 8 of the Convention. Individuals have no real choice if an employer in their chosen profession insists, and is entitled to do so, on disclosure: as Lord Hope noted, consent to a request for criminal record data is conditional on the right to respect for private life being respected (see paragraph 106 above).

The Court considers that the obligation on the authorities responsible for retaining and disclosing criminal record data to secure respect for private life is particularly important, given the nature of the data held and the potentially devastating consequences of their disclosure. In R (L), Lord Hope noted that in 2008/2009 almost 275,000 requests were made for ECRCs alone (see paragraph 105 above). This number is significant and demonstrates the wide reach of the legislation requiring disclosure. As Lord Neuberger indicated, even where the criminal record certificate records a conviction or caution for a relatively minor, or questionably relevant, offence, a prospective employer may well feel it safer to reject the applicant (see paragraph 108 above; see also the views expressed in the Divisional Court in R (Pinnington), at paragraph 87 above). The Court agrees with Lord Neuberger that it is realistic to assume that, in the majority of cases, an adverse criminal record certificate will represent something close to a “killer blow” to the hopes of a person who aspires to any post which falls within the scope of disclosure requirements (see paragraph 111 above)."

In the absence of any statutory provisions, a number of policy documents which apply in Northern Ireland have been identified by the Government (see paragraphs 33-46 above). As noted above, it is clear from the MOPI Guidance and the ACPO Guidelines that the recording and initial retention of caution data are intended in practice to be automatic. While reference is made in the MOPI Guidance to a review of retention after a six-year period, the criteria for review appear to be very restrictive. The Guidance notes that there is a presumption in favour of retention and the review schedule requires police to retain data in the category of “Certain Public Protection Matters” until the data subject is deemed to have reached one hundred years of age, regardless of the type or classification of data or grade of the intelligence concerned (see paragraphs 39-40 above). Any review in such cases seems intended to focus on whether the data are adequate and up to date. Pursuant to the ACPO Guidelines, it appears that data held in central police records are now automatically retained, regardless of the seriousness of the offence in question, until the person is deemed to have reached one hundred years of age. The ACPO Guidelines themselves explain that they are based on a format of restricting access to data, rather than deleting them. While deletion requests can be made under the ACPO Guidelines, they should only be granted in exceptional circumstances (see paragraphs 43-46 above). As noted above the examples given as to what constitute exceptional circumstances do not suggest a possibility of deletion being ordered in any case where the data subject admits having committed an offence and the data are accurate."

The Guidance explains that in this context a balancing exercise must be carried out, but specific information regarding the scope of the discretion to disclose and the factors which are relevant to the exercise of such powers in the context of disclosure of criminal record information is not provided.

Regarding any possible future disclosure of the applicant’s caution data, the Court observes that there is now a statutory framework in place for disclosure of criminal record information to prospective employers. Pursuant to the legislation now in place, caution data contained in central records, including where applicable information on spent cautions, must be disclosed in the context of a standard or enhanced criminal record check. No distinction is made based on the seriousness or the circumstances of the offence, the time which has elapsed since the offence was committed and whether the caution is spent. In short, there appears to be no scope for the exercise of any discretion in the disclosure exercise. Nor, as a consequence of the mandatory nature of the disclosure, is there any provision for the making of prior representations by the data subject to prevent the data being disclosed either generally or in a specific case. The applicable legislation does not allow for any assessment at any stage in the disclosure process of the relevance of conviction or caution data held in central records to the employment sought, or of the extent to which the data subject may be perceived as continuing to pose a risk such that the disclosure of the data to the employer is justified. In this regard the Court takes note of the offer made by the police in 2006 to add a comment to the applicant’s record to the effect that the incident was domestically related and that in any vetting context she should be approached for an explanation (see paragraph 16 above). It is unclear whether such addition could have any place in the disclosure system envisaged by the 1997 Act given the automatic nature of the disclosure exercise in respect of caution data held in central records. In any event, the apparent preference of many employers for a clean criminal record certificate (see paragraphs 87, 108 and 111 above) would deprive such addition of any real value."

As regards specifically the fact that the retention policy changed after the administration of the applicant’s caution, the Court notes that the applicant consented to the administration of the caution on the basis that it would be deleted from her record after five years. The Government have confirmed that this was the policy of the PSNI at the relevant time (see paragraph 25 above. See also the 1995 ACPO Code of Practice, paragraph 29 above). The police reply to the applicant’s query in March 2003 is consistent with this understanding and confirmed that the caution would remain on her record until 17 November 2005 (see paragraph 10 above). The Court notes that in accepting the caution, the applicant waived her fair trial rights in respect of the offence in issue. It is not for the Court to assess whether she would, with the benefit of hindsight, have been in a better position now had she refused the caution. It must be recalled that the administration of the caution relieved her of the stress and anxiety of a potential criminal trial, which could have resulted in a custodial sentence had she been found guilty. However, the Court expresses concern about the change in policy, which occurred several years after the applicant had accepted the caution and which was to have significant effects on her employment prospects."

In the present case, the Court highlights the absence of a clear legislative framework for the collection and storage of data, and the lack of clarity as to the scope, extent and restrictions of the common law powers of the police to retain and disclose caution data. It further refers to the absence of any mechanism for independent review of a decision to retain or disclose data, either under common law police powers or pursuant to Part V of the 1997 Act. Finally, the Court notes the limited filtering arrangements in respect of disclosures made under the provisions of the 1997 Act: as regards mandatory disclosure under section 113A, no distinction is made on the basis of the nature of the offence, the disposal in the case, the time which has elapsed since the offence took place or the relevance of the data to the employment sought."

                "89. The Court notes that the power in question has a legal basis in domestic law, namely Schedule 7 of TACT and the accompanying Code of Practice. In view of the applicant ’ s complaint, the principal question for the Court to address in the present case is whether, at the time the applicant was stopped at East Midlands airport, the safeguards provided by domestic law sufficiently curtailed the powers so as to offer her adequate protection against arbitrary interference with her right to respect for her private life. In making this assessment, it will consider the following factors: the geographic and temporal scope of the powers; the discretion afforded to the authorities in deciding if and when to exercise the powers; any curtailment on the interference occasioned by the exercise of the powers; the possibility of judicially reviewing the exercise of the powers; and any independent oversight of the use of the powers.",

            [
                "90. The Schedule 7 powers can only be exercised by police officers at ports and border controls. The majority of the Supreme Court considered that this restriction distinguished the case from Gillan and Quinton, cited above, since the “stop and search powers” under section 44 of TACT could be exercised throughout the whole of the United Kingdom (see paragraph 27 above). However, Lord Kerr, in his dissenting opinion, considered that the Schedule 7 powers were much broader than the “stop and search” powers, since they were not subject to any express authorisation and they were not temporally or geographically limited. As a consequence, they had the potential to affect the 245 million people who pass through the United Kingdom ’ s ports and borders every year (see paragraphs 33 - 36 above)."
            ],
            [
                "91. Although the Court sees the logic behind the comparison to Gillan and Quinton, the important question is not whether the Schedule 7 powers are wider or narrower than the “stop and search” powers, or how the safeguards which curtail the exercise of both powers measure up, but rather whether the Schedule 7 scheme, assessed as a whole, contains sufficient safeguards to protect the individual against arbitrary interference."

                "92. In this regard, while the Court would accept that in view of their permanent application at all ports and border controls, the Schedule 7 powers are wide in scope, this does not, in itself, run contrary to the principle of legality. The Court has expressly acknowledged both the very real threat that Contracting States currently face on account of international terrorism (see, for example, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, § 79, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V; A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, § 181, ECHR 2009; A. v. the Netherlands, no. 4900/06, § 143, 20 July 2010; Trabelsi v. Belgium, no. 140/10, § 117, ECHR 2014 (extracts); and Othman (Abu Qatada) v. United Kingdom, no. 8139/09, § 183, ECHR 2012). ) and the importance of controlling the international movement of terrorists (see, for example, McVeigh, O ’ Neill and Evans v United Kingdom (1981) 5 EHRR 71, § 192). Ports and border controls will inevitably provide a crucial focal point for detecting and preventing the movement of terrorists and/or foiling terrorist attacks. Indeed, all States operate systems of immigration and customs control at their ports and borders, and while these controls are different in nature to the Schedule 7 powers, it is nevertheless the case that all persons crossing international borders can expect to be subject to a certain level of scrutiny.",

                "93. The Schedule 7 powers may be exercised by examining officers for the purpose of determining whether a person is concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Examining officers therefore enjoy a very broad discretion, since “terrorism” is widely defined (see R. v. Gul, at paragraphs 71 - 72 above ) and the Schedule 7 powers may be exercised whether or not he or she has objective or subjective grounds for suspecting that a person is concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism."

            [
                "94. In Gillan and Quinton the Court criticised the fact that officers could exercise the stop and search powers without having to demonstrate the existence of any reasonable suspicion (see Gillan and Quinton, cited above, § 83 ). Similarly, in Ivashchenko the Court was concerned by the fact that the customs authorities had been able to examine and copy data contained on the applicant ’ s laptop and storage devices without at least “some notion of a reasonable suspicion” that he had committed an offence ( Ivashchenko, cited above, §§ 84-85). A requirement of reasonable suspicion is therefore an important consideration in assessing the lawfulness of a power to stop and question or search a person; however, there is nothing in either case to suggest that the existence of reasonable suspicion is, in itself, necessary to avoid arbitrariness. Rather, this is an assessment for the Court to make having regard to the operation of the scheme as a whole and, for the reasons set out below, it does not consider that the absence of a requirement of reasonable suspicion by itself rendered the exercise of the power in the applicant ’ s case unlawful within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention."

            [
                "95. First of all, the Court has repeatedly held that the national authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in matters relating to national security (see, among many examples, Konstantin Markin v. Russia [GC], no. 30078/06, § 134, ECHR 2012 (extracts)) and there is clear evidence that the Schedule 7 powers have been of real value in protecting national security. According to the Independent Reviewer, they were “instrumental” in “securing evidence which assists in the conviction of terrorists” (see paragraph 48 above). While the majority of examinations which led to convictions were intelligence-led, examinations could be useful even if they did not lead to a conviction. Intelligence gathered during the examinations contributed to a rich picture of the terrorist threat to the United Kingdom and its interests abroad, and could assist in the disruption or deterrence of terrorists ’ plans (see paragraph 48 above). Were “reasonable suspicion” to be required, terrorists could avoid the deterrent threat of Schedule 7 by using people who had not previously attracted the attention of the police (“clean skins”); and the mere fact of a stop could alert a person to the existence of surveillance (see paragraph 49 above)."

            [
                "96. Secondly, it is important to distinguish between the two distinct Schedule 7 powers, being the power to question and search a person; and the power to detain a person. As the power to detain would, under normal circumstances, entail a greater interference with a person ’ s rights, and therefore has greater potential for abuse, it may well have to be accompanied by more stringent safeguards. However, as the applicant in the present case was not formally detained, the Court must limit its examination to the lawfulness of the power to question and search."
            ],
            [
                "97. Thirdly, the Court considers it relevant that the Schedule 7 power – and in particular the power to question and search – is a preliminary power of inquiry expressly provided in order to assist officers stationed at ports and borders to make counter-terrorism inquiries of any person entering or leaving the country. While there was no requirement of “reasonable suspicion”, guidance was nevertheless provided to examining officers which attempted to clarify when the discretion could be exercised. According to the Guidance Notes accompanying the Code of Practice in force at the time of the applicant ’ s examination, the power had to be used proportionately and officers had to take particular care to ensure that the selection of persons for examination was not solely based on their ethnic background or religion. Instead, the decision to exercise Schedule 7 powers had to be based on the threat posed by the various active terrorist groups and be based on a number of considerations, including the following factors: known or suspected sources of terrorism; individuals or groups whose current or past involvement in acts or threats of terrorism is known or suspected, and supporters or sponsors of such activity who are known or suspected; any information on the origins and/or location of terrorist groups; possible current, emerging and future terrorist activity; the means of travel (and documentation) that a group or individuals involved in terrorist activity could use; and emerging local trends or patterns of travel through specific ports or in the wider vicinity that may be linked to terrorist activity (see paragraph 42 above). While not relevant to the Court ’ s assessment of the case at hand, it nevertheless notes that pursuant to the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 and the new Code of Practice, examining officers now have to be accredited by their chief officer as having met a national standard in the use of the powers (see paragraphs 54 ‑ 55 above)."
            ],
            [
                "98. Fourthly, the reports of the Independent Reviewer would suggest that the powers are not, in fact, being abused (see paragraphs 44 - 51 and 56 ‑ 61 above). In 2011, only 0.03% of passengers travelling through ports were examined under Schedule 7. In the following years, the Independent Reviewer noted a significant decline in the total number of examinations. Furthermore, although persons of minority ethnic communities, and especially those of Asian and North African ethnicity, were stopped more often than their percentage in the travelling population would objectively warrant, as noted by the Independent Reviewer, this did not mean that examinations were misdirected. Therefore, although the Independent Reviewer recommended vigilance, he considered that the figures in themselves provided no basis for criticism of the police."

At the time the applicant was examined, Schedule 7 provided that a person detained under that power had to be released not later than the end of a period of nine hours from the beginning of the examination (see paragraph 40 above). The Code of Practice further required that the examining officer keep the length of the examination “to the minimum that is practicable”. At the beginning of the examination, the examining officer had to explain to the person concerned either verbally or in writing that she was being examined under Schedule 7 of TACT and that the officer had the power to detain her should she refuse to co-operate and insist on leaving. A record had to be kept of the examination; at the port, if the examination lasted less than one hour, or centrally, if it lasted longer (see paragraph 42 above). However, despite the fact that persons being examined were compelled to answer the questions asked, neither TACT nor the Code of Practice in force at the relevant time made any provision for a person being examined (who was not detained) to have a solicitor in attendance. Consequently, persons could be subjected to examination for up to nine hours, without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, without being formally detained, and without having access to a lawyer."

                "101. The legislation has since been amended by the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 (see paragraphs 52 - 53 above), which requires examining officers to take a person into detention if they wish to examine him or her for longer than an hour. It further provides that the questioning of an examinee should not commence until after the arrival of a requested solicitor, unless postponing questioning would be likely to prejudice the determination of the relevant matters, and gives the person being examined the right (insofar as practical) to have a named person informed of his or her whereabouts. The 2014 Act also reduced the maximum period of detention from nine hours to six hours and required the periodic review of detention by a review officer."

                "102. Nevertheless, the Court must have regard to the legislation in force at the time the applicant was examined pursuant to the Schedule 7 powers, when the only safeguard capable of curtailing the interference occasioned by the exercise of those powers was the requirement that she be released not later than the end of a period of nine hours from the beginning of the examination.",

                "103. While it is possible to seek judicial review the exercise of the Schedule 7 powers, the applicant argues that the absence of any obligation on the part of the examining officer to show “reasonable suspicion” would make it difficult, if not impossible, to prove that the power was improperly exercised. The Court accepted a similar argument in Gillan and Quinton, finding that the right of an individual to challenge a stop and search by way of judicial review or an action in damages had clear limitations ( Gillan and Quinton, cited above, § 86)."
            ],
            [
                "104. Those limitations would appear to be equally relevant to challenges to the Schedule 7 power by way of judicial review. In R (Elostra) the claimant successfully challenged his detention under Schedule 7 on the basis that the police officers had not waited for his solicitor to arrive at the airport before beginning to question him, as required by the Code of Practice. The judge therefore found that the officer ’ s actions had been unlawful (see paragraph 70 above). However, challenges to the lawfulness of the decision to exercise the Schedule 7 power would appear to have been less successful. In R ( David Miranda), the Court of Appeal accepted that the detention of a journalist ’ s spouse at the request of the security service, which was principally concerned with determining whether the material he carried posed a threat to national security, was nevertheless lawful since before agreeing to the stop the police confirmed that the statutory grounds had been made out. In reaching this conclusion, the court observed that “Parliament had set the bar for the exercise of the Schedule 7 power at quite a low level, the power having been given to provide an opportunity for the ascertainment of a possibility” (see paragraph 65 - 68 above). While in R(CC) the court found that the examining officers had not exercised the power for the purpose of determining whether the individual appeared to be a terrorist or not, the judge remarked that it was “a very rare case” since the powers were “properly given a wide construction” (see paragraph 69 above)."

The Independent Reviewer, a role that has existed since the late 1970s, is an independent person, appointed by the Home Secretary and by the Treasury for a renewable three-year term and tasked with reporting to the Home Secretary and to Parliament on the operation of counter-terrorism law in the United Kingdom. These reports are laid before Parliament, to inform the public and political debate on anti-terrorism law in the United Kingdom. The significance of the role lies in its complete independence from government, coupled with access based on a very high degree of clearance to secret and sensitive national security information and personnel."

Nevertheless, his reviews are invariably ad ‑ hoc and insofar as he is able to review a selection of examination records, he would not be in a position to assess the lawfulness of the purpose for the stop. Moreover, while his reports are scrutinised at the highest level (the Government in fact publishes its formal response to his annual reports), a number of important recommendations have not been implemented, despite having received support from the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Home Affairs Select Committee. In particular, the Independent Reviewer has repeatedly called for the introduction of a suspicion requirement for the exercise of certain Schedule 7 powers, including the power to detain and to download the contents of a phone or laptop; and criticised the fact that answers given under compulsion are not expressly rendered inadmissible in criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 57 ‑ 60 above). Although the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Bill contains a bar on the admissibility in court of answers to questions when an individual is stopped at a port or border under Schedule 7 of TACT (see paragraph 63 above), the Government have not introduced any suspicion threshold for the exercise of the power to detain."

In conclusion, the Court considers that when the applicant was stopped at East Midlands airport in January 2011, the power to examine persons under Schedule 7 of TACT was neither sufficiently circumscribed nor subject to adequate legal safeguards against abuse. While it does not consider the absence of any requirement of “reasonable suspicion” alone to have been fatal to the lawfulness of the regime, when considered together with the fact that the examination could continue for up to nine hours, during which time the person would be compelled to answer questions without any right to have a lawyer present, and the possibility of judicially reviewing the exercise of the power would be limited, the Court finds that the Schedule 7 powers were not “in accordance with the law”.

Unlike the Code of Practice relating to the powers exercised under section 44 of TACT (the provisions under consideration in Gillan and Quinton ), in the present case the relevant Home Office Code of Practice and accompanying Practical Advice (see paragraphs 42 and 43 below ) afforded a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by the Executive. Moreover, port and border control was very different from the power to stop and search, exercisable anywhere in the jurisdiction, and conclusions as to the arbitrariness of the latter did not readily translate to conclusions as to the former. The United Kingdom, as an “island nation”, concentrated controls at its national frontiers and the court was therefore of the view that it was to be accorded a wide margin of appreciation in carrying out these controls."

            [
                "20. Not being constrained by the authority of Gillan and Quinton, the court went on to find that the Schedule 7 powers were sufficiently circumscribed and were therefore “in accordance with the law”. First, it noted that many exercises of Schedule 7 powers were unlikely even to engage Article 8 as the intrusions would fall below the threshold of a minimum level of seriousness. Secondly, it considered that the arguments which served to distinguish Gillan and Quinton likewise served to emphasise the important and particular position of port and border controls and the need for such powers. Thirdly, the Schedule 7 powers were applicable only to a limited category of people: namely, travellers in confined geographical areas. Furthermore, while there was no room for complacency, the statistics collated by the Independent Reviewer (see paragraphs 48 - 49 and 56 - 61 below ) did not suggest arbitrary overuse or misuse in respect of members of ethnic-minority communities. Fourthly, the Schedule 7 powers could only be exercised in respect of that limited category for the purpose of determining whether the person questioned appeared to be a person who was or had been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and these limitations told against the powers being arbitrary. Fifthly, the Schedule 7 powers were principally an aspect of port and border control rather than of a criminal investigation and it was therefore not surprising that there was no requirement of “reasonable suspicion” for the powers to be exercised. Sixthly, the court noted that the underlying purpose of the Schedule 7 powers was to protect the public from terrorism."

                "“The manifest importance of that purpose and the utility of the powers do not, of course and of themselves, entail the conclusion that these powers are not arbitrary and thus compatible with Art. 8. However, the exercise of Schedule 7 powers is subject to cumulative statutory limitations. Their exercise is governed by the Code. Over and above the possibility of legal challenge if misused in an individual case, they are subject to continuing review by the Independent Reviewer. The absence of a requirement of reasonable suspicion is both explicable and justifiable. For the reasons already given, we are not at all persuaded that these powers render the public vulnerable ‘ ...to interference by public officials acting on any personal whim, caprice, malice, predilection or purpose other than for which the power was conferred ’ – Lord Bingham ’ s test for arbitrariness, in Gillan (HL), at [34], set out above. Equally, we are not persuaded that these are unfettered powers, falling foul of the test applied in Gillan (Strasbourg), at [76] – [77], also set out above; for our part, the ‘ level of precision ’ of these powers ( ibid ) falls and falls comfortably on the right side of the line. ”"

Furthermore, it noted that there was an objective justification for the focus on ports, airports and border areas, which, in the United Kingdom, provided a particularly appropriate venue for detecting, deterring and disrupting potential terrorist activity. With regard to the circumstances of the applicant ’ s case, the court found that the interference with her Article 8 rights had been justified. As she had been returning to the United Kingdom after visiting her husband, who was imprisoned in France for terrorism offences, she was not stopped and examined on a random basis. Moreover, the questions asked of her were rationally connected to the statutory purpose and were in no way disproportionate."

As the respondent accepted that there had been an interference with the applicant ’ s rights, and the applicant accepted that the interference was “in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law”, the only issue to be determined was whether the interference was “lawful”, and the conclusions in respect of Article 8 had determined that it was."

However, it found that on the facts of her case, Article 6 was not engaged as her examination under Schedule 7 was not an inquiry preparatory to criminal proceedings but rather an inquiry related to border control with the specific public interest of safeguarding society from the risk of terrorism. Furthermore, the examination was not carried out for the purpose of obtaining admissions or evidence for use in such proceedings, and the fact that the applicant ’ s answers might have yielded information potentially of evidential value did not of itself suffice to engage Article 6. Even if the applicant ’ s rights had been engaged, the court found that there would have been no violation since it was fanciful to suppose that permission would be granted in criminal proceedings for any admissions obtained pursuant to a Schedule 7 examination to be adduced in evidence.",

Furthermore, while there was evidence that the safeguards provided in the case of section 44 were ineffective, none of these applied to the powers under Schedule 7. Having regard to the safeguards which applied in respect of Schedule 7, their Lordships were satisfied that the principle of legality was met. In particular, they had regard to the restriction of the power to those passing in and out of the country; the restriction to the statutory purpose; the restriction to specially trained and accredited police officers; the restrictions on the duration of questioning; the restrictions on the type of search; the requirement to give explanatory notice to those questioned, including a procedure for complaint; the requirement to permit consultation with a solicitor and the notification of a third party; the requirement for records to be kept; the availability of judicial review; and the continuous supervision of the Independent Reviewer."

Lords Neuberger and Dyson agreed that the appeal, insofar as it was based on proportionality, should fail, given that the interference was slight, the independent justification was convincing, the supervision impressive, the safeguards and potential benefits substantial, and no equally effective but less intrusive proposal had been forthcoming."

However, it is important to the effectiveness of these powers that they can be exercised in this way. Furthermore, if the power to stop and question under Schedule 7 infringes the Convention because it is exercisable randomly, the logical conclusion must be either that the valuable power must be abandoned or the power must be exercised in a far more invasive and extensive way, namely by stopping and questioning everyone passing through ports and borders. The former alternative would be unfortunate in terms of deterring and hindering terrorism, whereas the latter alternative would seem to put proportionality and legality in irreconcilable tension.”"

Although Lords Hughes, Hodge, Neuberger and Dyson agreed with the Divisional Court that the comments made in relation to safeguards in the context of Article 8 also applied in respect of Article 5, in their view it did not follow that the power of detention was automatically justified. The level of intrusion occasioned by detention for up to six hours was of a different order to the intrusion occasioned by compulsory question and search, and safeguards which were adequate for one would not necessarily be sufficient for the other. Furthermore, it did not follow that the fair balance between the rights of the individual and the interest of the public would fall in the same place. However, although their Lordships expressed doubts about whether detention for as long as six hours could ever be justified, on the facts of the present case they found that, to the extent that there was any deprivation of liberty, it was clear that it was for no longer than necessary to complete the process and therefore there had been no breach of Article 5."

However, their Lordships considered port questioning and search under Schedule 7 to be separate from a criminal investigation and, since the applicant had been at no time a defendant to a criminal charge, no question of a breach of her right to a fair trial could arise. In reaching this conclusion, they noted that any use in a criminal prosecution of answers obtained under compulsion would breach Article 6 of the Convention; consequently, Schedule 7 material could never be adduced in a subsequent criminal trial (unless the prosecution concerned the failure to comply with the Schedule 7 duty).",

In fact, he considered that comparison with the section 44 powers illustrated the greater ambit of the Schedule 7 powers. In particular, he observed that no authorisation was required for an examining officer to have resort to the Schedule 7 powers; the examining officer did not have to consider the use of those powers expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism; there was no geographical or temporal limitation on the use of those powers, other than that they were to be used at a port of entry into or exit from the United Kingdom; and there was no provision for their automatic lapse, nor was there any question of their renewed authorisation being subject to confirmation. Furthermore, Lord Kerr noted that certain features were common to both sets of powers: the width of the powers was similar (in both instances there was no requirement of either reasonable or even subjective suspicion) and challenges to their use on conventional judicial review grounds faced the same difficulties identified in Gillan and Quinton (namely, if an examining officer was not required to have a reasonable suspicion, how was the proportionality of the exercise of his powers to be reviewed?)."

                "34. In response to the majority ’ s reliance on the fact that Schedule 7 powers could only be used in respect of persons passing through ports of entry or exit, Lord Kerr made two points. First, being subjected to border controls, such as the requirement to provide proof of identity and entitlement to enter, was entirely different from being required to answer questions about one ’ s movements and activities and facing criminal sanction for refusing. Secondly, and more importantly, the fact that people were accustomed to intrusion moving through ports of entry or exit did not bear on the question of whether the circumstances in which the Schedule 7 powers could be exercised were too widely drawn to satisfy the test of “in accordance with the law”. In other words, an unfettered power which might be arbitrarily or capriciously used did not become legal just because people generally did not take exception to its use."

Furthermore, given that there were 245 million passenger movements through United Kingdom ports every year, the fact that the Schedule 7 power was used sparingly could have no bearing on its legality. A power on which there are insufficient legal constraints does not become legal simply because those who may have resort to it exercise self-restraint. It was the potential reach of the power – and not its actual use – which had to be judged. In any case, although the percentage of travellers subjected to the use of the power was small, in absolute terms the number was not inconsequential, since on average five to seven people each day were examined for more than an hour."

Finally, Lord Kerr expressed concern about the potential for arbitrary and discriminatory exercise of the power since there was no clearly obvious means of policing the requirement that persons should not be stopped and questioned just because of their ethnic background or religion. In any case, the Code of Practice contemplated that ethnic origin or religious adherence could be at least one of the reasons for exercising the power, just so long as it was not the sole ground. Lord Kerr considered that the fact that the legislation authorised the use of a coercive power, at least partly, on grounds of race and religion should be starkly confronted since it permitted direct discrimination, which was entirely at odds with the notion of an enlightened, pluralistic society all of whose members were treated equally."

If she was asked questions designed to establish whether she appeared to be a terrorist, the potential of her answers to incriminate her if they were of an inculpatory character was indisputable.

In particular, he noted that the Schedule 7 power was not intended to be exercised randomly but rather to gain information about persons concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. As terrorists were not, at any one moment in time, evenly distributed across the various ethnic groups, if the power was being skilfully used, one would expect its exercise to be ethnically “proportionate” not to the United Kingdom population, nor even to the airport-using population, but rather to the terrorist population that travels through United Kingdom ports.

In this regard, the police had clearly recognised that they could not act as a conduit for the furtherance of the Security Service ’ s purposes, and had had to be persuaded that the conditions for a lawful Schedule 7 stop had been met before they agreed to proceed. Moreover, as Parliament had set the bar for the exercise of the Schedule 7 power at quite a low level, the power having been given to provide an opportunity for the ascertainment of a possibility, the court accepted that the power was exercised for a lawful purpose.

The court ’ s central concern was that disclosure of journalistic material (whether or not it involved the identification of a journalist ’ s source) undermined the confidentiality that was inherent in such material and which was necessary to avoid the chilling effect of disclosure and to protect Article 10 rights. If journalists and their sources could have no expectation of confidentiality, they might decide against providing information on sensitive matters of public interest. Consequently, it was of little or no relevance that the Schedule 7 powers could only be exercised in a confined geographical area or that a person could not be detained for longer than nine hours. Similarly, while the fact that the powers had to be exercised rationally, proportionately and in good faith provided a degree of protection, the only safeguard against the powers not being so exercised was the possibility of judicial review proceedings.

The two Acts also grant substantial intrusive powers to the police and to immigration officers, including stop and search, which depend upon what appears to be a very broad discretion on their part. While the need to bestow wide, even intrusive, powers on the police and other officers in connection with terrorism is understandable, the fact that the powers are so unrestricted and the definition of ‘ terrorism ’ is so wide means that such powers are probably of even more concern than the prosecutorial powers to which the Acts give rise.",

In the year of her examination, more than 68,000 people were stopped pursuant to Schedule 7. The absence of any requirement for objective grounds for suspicion, or even subjective suspicion, meant that an officer could exercise powers based on no more than a hunch, which in turn gave considerable scope for extraneous factors and motives – such as biases and ingrained stereotypes – to influence how an officer selected individuals to stop and question."

More particularly, the applicant contended that the powers under the Schedule 7 regime were more intrusive than the stop and search powers under sections 44-45 of TACT, which the Court had held not to be “in accordance with the law” in Gillan and Quinton. First of all, section 44 required a senior officer to give authorisations if he thought it “expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism”. In contrast, Schedule 7 powers applied at all times at all ports. Secondly, while powers under sections 44 and 45 were directed at the narrow purpose of “searching for articles of a kind that could be used in connection with terrorism”, Schedule 7 powers had a much broader purpose and permitted a far wider investigation into an individual ’ s activities, beliefs and movements. Thirdly, section 45 only permitted an officer to search a person ’ s outer clothing and possessions, and detention was only permitted to the extent necessary to carry out that limited search. In contrast, a Schedule 7 suspicion-less examination could take place at a police station, could permit detailed and intrusive searches, and at the time the applicant was stopped, detention could last for up to nine hours. Fourthly, section 45 contained no power to interrogate, whereas Schedule 7 permitted a lengthy interrogation that a person was required by law to answer. Finally, section 45 permitted an officer to retain items found during the search of a person only if the officer reasonably suspected that the item was intended to be used in connection with terrorism. Schedule 7, on the other hand, permitted any item to be retained for seven days for examination, regardless of whether or not such suspicion existed."

                "79. According to the applicant, there were also important similarities between the section 44 and Schedule 7 powers: they both fell within the same framework of counter-terrorism legislation under TACT; they both involve intrusive measures which might be used without subjective grounds for suspicion; the use of both sets of powers had a significantly disproportionate impact on persons of non-white ethnic origin; and the safeguards relied on by the Government were similar."

However, she argued that they were insufficient to meet the requirement of legality. To begin with, given the large number of people passing through United Kingdom ports every day, the fact that the Schedule 7 powers were restricted to travellers at ports did not significantly reduce their impact. Moreover, Schedule 7 powers could not be equated with immigration powers, to which travellers might reasonably expect to be subjected. They were based at ports because they were “choke points” and not because they had any specific connection to a person ’ s travel."

Furthermore, restriction to the statutory purpose, restriction to specially trained and accredited officers, and restrictions on the type of search and duration of questioning provided negligible safeguards which did not cure the risk of arbitrariness in the exercise of a broadly defined, suspicion-less power. This was especially so given that the Code in force at the time of the applicant ’ s examination did not tell examining officers how to determine whether the exercise of Schedule 7 powers was proportionate, nor did it require them to keep to a minimum all interferences with fundamental rights. Although individuals were entitled to consult a solicitor, this offered no protection against the risk of arbitrary selection in the first place, and in any case officers were permitted to interrogate a person in the absence of a solicitor (as happened in this case)."

In addition, the explanatory notice given to those questioned was generic; examining officers were not required to explain the reasons why a particular individual was selected for examination under Schedule 7. There was also no requirement for officers to record the reason why a particular individual was selected for examination, and since the lawful exercise of the powers was not conditional on any suspicion (reasonable or otherwise) the scope for using judicial review proceedings to challenge a particular Schedule 7 examination was extremely limited. Finally, the Independent Reviewer only carried out a post-hoc review of a small number of Schedule 7 stops, since his capacities did not stretch to a thorough port ‑ by ‑ port monitoring, and the Government was not obliged to give effect to any changes he proposed."

For domestic law to meet these requirements it must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise ( Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 55, ECHR 2000-V; Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 4, ECHR 2000-XI; Maestri v.

In view of the applicant ’ s complaint, the principal question for the Court to address in the present case is whether, at the time the applicant was stopped at East Midlands airport, the safeguards provided by domestic law sufficiently curtailed the powers so as to offer her adequate protection against arbitrary interference with her right to respect for her private life. In making this assessment, it will consider the following factors: the geographic and temporal scope of the powers; the discretion afforded to the authorities in deciding if and when to exercise the powers; any curtailment on the interference occasioned by the exercise of the powers; the possibility of judicially reviewing the exercise of the powers; and any independent oversight of the use of the powers.",

The majority of the Supreme Court considered that this restriction distinguished the case from Gillan and Quinton, cited above, since the “stop and search powers” under section 44 of TACT could be exercised throughout the whole of the United Kingdom (see paragraph 27 above). However, Lord Kerr, in his dissenting opinion, considered that the Schedule 7 powers were much broader than the “stop and search” powers, since they were not subject to any express authorisation and they were not temporally or geographically limited. As a consequence, they had the potential to affect the 245 million people who pass through the United Kingdom ’ s ports and borders every year (see paragraphs 33 - 36 above)."

            [
                "91. Although the Court sees the logic behind the comparison to Gillan and Quinton, the important question is not whether the Schedule 7 powers are wider or narrower than the “stop and search” powers, or how the safeguards which curtail the exercise of both powers measure up, but rather whether the Schedule 7 scheme, assessed as a whole, contains sufficient safeguards to protect the individual against arbitrary interference."

In this regard, while the Court would accept that in view of their permanent application at all ports and border controls, the Schedule 7 powers are wide in scope, this does not, in itself, run contrary to the principle of legality. The Court has expressly acknowledged both the very real threat that Contracting States currently face on account of international terrorism (see, for example, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, § 79, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V; A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, § 181, ECHR 2009; A. v. the Netherlands, no. 4900/06, § 143, 20 July 2010; Trabelsi v.

Ports and border controls will inevitably provide a crucial focal point for detecting and preventing the movement of terrorists and/or foiling terrorist attacks. Indeed, all States operate systems of immigration and customs control at their ports and borders, and while these controls are different in nature to the Schedule 7 powers, it is nevertheless the case that all persons crossing international borders can expect to be subject to a certain level of scrutiny.",

The Schedule 7 powers may be exercised by examining officers for the purpose of determining whether a person is concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Examining officers therefore enjoy a very broad discretion, since “terrorism” is widely defined (see R. v. Gul, at paragraphs 71 - 72 above ) and the Schedule 7 powers may be exercised whether or not he or she has objective or subjective grounds for suspecting that a person is concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism."

In Gillan and Quinton the Court criticised the fact that officers could exercise the stop and search powers without having to demonstrate the existence of any reasonable suspicion (see Gillan and Quinton, cited above, § 83 ). Similarly, in Ivashchenko the Court was concerned by the fact that the customs authorities had been able to examine and copy data contained on the applicant ’ s laptop and storage devices without at least “some notion of a reasonable suspicion” that he had committed an offence ( Ivashchenko, cited above, §§ 84-85). A requirement of reasonable suspicion is therefore an important consideration in assessing the lawfulness of a power to stop and question or search a person; however, there is nothing in either case to suggest that the existence of reasonable suspicion is, in itself, necessary to avoid arbitrariness. Rather, this is an assessment for the Court to make having regard to the operation of the scheme as a whole and, for the reasons set out below, it does not consider that the absence of a requirement of reasonable suspicion by itself rendered the exercise of the power in the applicant ’ s case unlawful within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention."

Russia [GC], no. 30078/06, § 134, ECHR 2012 (extracts)) and there is clear evidence that the Schedule 7 powers have been of real value in protecting national security. According to the Independent Reviewer, they were “instrumental” in “securing evidence which assists in the conviction of terrorists” (see paragraph 48 above). While the majority of examinations which led to convictions were intelligence-led, examinations could be useful even if they did not lead to a conviction. Intelligence gathered during the examinations contributed to a rich picture of the terrorist threat to the United Kingdom and its interests abroad, and could assist in the disruption or deterrence of terrorists ’ plans (see paragraph 48 above). Were “reasonable suspicion” to be required, terrorists could avoid the deterrent threat of Schedule 7 by using people who had not previously attracted the attention of the police (“clean skins”); and the mere fact of a stop could alert a person to the existence of surveillance (see paragraph 49 above)."

                "96. Secondly, it is important to distinguish between the two distinct Schedule 7 powers, being the power to question and search a person; and the power to detain a person. As the power to detain would, under normal circumstances, entail a greater interference with a person ’ s rights, and therefore has greater potential for abuse, it may well have to be accompanied by more stringent safeguards. However, as the applicant in the present case was not formally detained, the Court must limit its examination to the lawfulness of the power to question and search."

            [
                "97. Thirdly, the Court considers it relevant that the Schedule 7 power – and in particular the power to question and search – is a preliminary power of inquiry expressly provided in order to assist officers stationed at ports and borders to make counter-terrorism inquiries of any person entering or leaving the country. While there was no requirement of “reasonable suspicion”, guidance was nevertheless provided to examining officers which attempted to clarify when the discretion could be exercised. According to the Guidance Notes accompanying the Code of Practice in force at the time of the applicant ’ s examination, the power had to be used proportionately and officers had to take particular care to ensure that the selection of persons for examination was not solely based on their ethnic background or religion. Instead, the decision to exercise Schedule 7 powers had to be based on the threat posed by the various active terrorist groups and be based on a number of considerations, including the following factors: known or suspected sources of terrorism; individuals or groups whose current or past involvement in acts or threats of terrorism is known or suspected, and supporters or sponsors of such activity who are known or suspected; any information on the origins and/or location of terrorist groups; possible current, emerging and future terrorist activity; the means of travel (and documentation) that a group or individuals involved in terrorist activity could use; and emerging local trends or patterns of travel through specific ports or in the wider vicinity that may be linked to terrorist activity (see paragraph 42 above). While not relevant to the Court ’ s assessment of the case at hand, it nevertheless notes that pursuant to the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 and the new Code of Practice, examining officers now have to be accredited by their chief officer as having met a national standard in the use of the powers (see paragraphs 54 ‑ 55 above)."

In 2011, only 0.03% of passengers travelling through ports were examined under Schedule 7. In the following years, the Independent Reviewer noted a significant decline in the total number of examinations. Furthermore, although persons of minority ethnic communities, and especially those of Asian and North African ethnicity, were stopped more often than their percentage in the travelling population would objectively warrant, as noted by the Independent Reviewer, this did not mean that examinations were misdirected. Therefore, although the Independent Reviewer recommended vigilance, he considered that the figures in themselves provided no basis for criticism of the police."

The Code of Practice further required that the examining officer keep the length of the examination “to the minimum that is practicable”. At the beginning of the examination, the examining officer had to explain to the person concerned either verbally or in writing that she was being examined under Schedule 7 of TACT and that the officer had the power to detain her should she refuse to co-operate and insist on leaving. A record had to be kept of the examination; at the port, if the examination lasted less than one hour, or centrally, if it lasted longer (see paragraph 42 above). However, despite the fact that persons being examined were compelled to answer the questions asked, neither TACT nor the Code of Practice in force at the relevant time made any provision for a person being examined (who was not detained) to have a solicitor in attendance.

It further provides that the questioning of an examinee should not commence until after the arrival of a requested solicitor, unless postponing questioning would be likely to prejudice the determination of the relevant matters, and gives the person being examined the right (insofar as practical) to have a named person informed of his or her whereabouts.

The judge therefore found that the officer ’ s actions had been unlawful (see paragraph 70 above). However, challenges to the lawfulness of the decision to exercise the Schedule 7 power would appear to have been less successful. In R ( David Miranda), the Court of Appeal accepted that the detention of a journalist ’ s spouse at the request of the security service, which was principally concerned with determining whether the material he carried posed a threat to national security, was nevertheless lawful since before agreeing to the stop the police confirmed that the statutory grounds had been made out. In reaching this conclusion, the court observed that “Parliament had set the bar for the exercise of the Schedule 7 power at quite a low level, the power having been given to provide an opportunity for the ascertainment of a possibility” (see paragraph 65 - 68 above). While in R(CC) the court found that the examining officers had not exercised the power for the purpose of determining whether the individual appeared to be a terrorist or not, the judge remarked that it was “a very rare case” since the powers were “properly given a wide construction” (see paragraph 69 above)."

Although the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Bill contains a bar on the admissibility in court of answers to questions when an individual is stopped at a port or border under Schedule 7 of TACT (see paragraph 63 above), the Government have not introduced any suspicion threshold for the exercise of the power to detain."

A “criminal charge” exists from the moment that an individual is officially notified by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence, or from the point at which his situation has been substantially affected by actions taken by the authorities as a result of a suspicion against him (see Deweer v.

Although she was questioned for the purpose of determining whether she appeared to be concerned or to have been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, this cannot, of itself, engage Article 6 of the Convention. First of all, the Schedule 7 power did not require police officers to have “reasonable suspicion” that she was concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. As such, the mere fact of her selection for examination could not be understood as an indication that she herself was suspected of involvement in any criminal offence. On the contrary, the applicant was explicitly told by police officers that she was not under arrest and that the police did not suspect her of being a terrorist (see paragraph 8 above). Moreover, the questions put to her were general in nature and did not relate to her involvement in any criminal offence (see paragraph 11 above). The Court has already noted that the Schedule 7 power is a preliminary power of inquiry expressly provided in order to assist officers stationed at ports and borders to make counter-terrorism inquiries of any person entering or leaving the country (see paragraph 97 above). While it would not exclude the possibility that it could be exercised in such a way as to engage Article 6 of the Convention, there is no evidence to suggest that it was so exercised in the present case."

The Court also notes that with the passing of time the courts'reasoning did not evolve to reflect the developing situation and to verify whether these grounds remained valid at the advanced stage of the proceedings. Moreover, from 7 September 2001 the decisions extending the applicant's detention no longer indicated any time-limits, thus implying that he would remain in detention until the end of the trial."

It reiterates that where circumstances that could have warranted a person's detention may have existed but were not mentioned in the domestic decisions it is not the Court's task to establish them and to take the place of the national authorities which ruled on the applicant's detention (see Panchenko v.

The first - instance court found that there had been no “intrusion” or breach of the applicant's privacy because of the absence of objections to V.'s entry into the premises and because of the “non-private” purpose of these premises. The prosecutor's office, in addition to that, maintained that the covert operation had been lawful because it had not involved any activity subject to special legal requirements and the police had thus remained within the domain of their own discretion."

The Court observes that the Operational-Search Activities Act is expressly intended to protect individual privacy by requiring judicial authorisation for any operational-search activities that could interfere with it. The Act specifies two types of protected privacy: firstly, privacy of communications by wire or mail services and, secondly, privacy of the home. As regards the latter, the domestic authorities, notably the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow, argued that V.'s entering the “guest house” with the applicant's consent did not constitute an intrusion amounting to interference with the privacy of the applicant's home. As to the question of privacy of communications, it was only addressed as a separate issue in the prosecutor's decision dismissing the applicant's complaint. In his opinion, the applicant's conversation with V. remained outside the scope of protection offered by the Act because it did not involve the use of “wire or mail services”. The same argument was put forward by the Government, who considered that the requirement of judicial authorisation did not extend to the use of the radio ‑ transmitting device and that the covert operation could not therefore be said to have breached domestic law."

The measure was considered to be an investigative step within the domain of the investigating authorities'own discretion."

The Court reiterates that the phrase “in accordance with the law” not only requires compliance with domestic law but also relates to the quality of that law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law. In the context of covert surveillance by public authorities, in this instance the police, domestic law must provide protection against arbitrary interference with an individual's right under Article 8. Moreover, the law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are entitled to resort to such covert measures (see Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, § 26, ECHR 2000-V)."

While the law itself did not define what measures such “experiments ” could involve, the national authorities took the view that there existed no statutory system in Russian law regulating the interception or recording of private communications through a radio ‑ transmitting device. The Government argued that the existing regulations on telephone tapping were not applicable to radio ‑ transmitting devices and could not be extended to them by analogy. On the contrary, they emphasised the difference between the two by indicating that no judicial authorisation for the use of a radio ‑ transmitting device was required, for the reason that this technology fell outside the scope of any existing regulations. Thus, the Government considered that the use of technology not listed in section 8 of the Operational-Search Activities Act for the interception was not subject to the formal requirements imposed by the Act."

                "78. The Court has consistently held that when it comes to the interception of communications for the purpose of a police investigation, “the law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to this secret and potentially dangerous interference with the right to respect for private life and correspondence” (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, § 67, Series A no. 82 ). In particular, in order to comply with the requirement of the “quality of the law”, a law which confers discretion must indicate the scope of that discretion, although the detailed procedures and conditions to be observed do not necessarily have to be incorporated in rules of substantive law. The degree of precision required of the “ law ” in this connection will depend upon the particular subject-matter. Since the implementation in practice of measures of secret surveillance of communications is not open to scrutiny by the individuals concerned or the public at large, it would be contrary to the rule of law for the legal discretion granted to the executive – or to a judge – to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, among other authorities, Huvig v. France, 24 April 1990, § § 29 and 32, Series A no. 176 ‑ B; Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 56, ECHR 2000 ‑ II; and Valenzuela Contreras v.

Given the absence of specific regulations providing safeguards, the Court is not satisfied that, as claimed by the Government, the possibility for the applicant to bring court proceedings seeking to declare the “operative experiment” unlawful and to request the exclusion of its results as unlawfully obtained evidence met the above requirements."

This involves an examination of the “unlawfulness” in question and, where a violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see, among other authorities, Khan, cited above, § 34; P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 76, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX; Heglas v. the Czech Republic, no. 5935/02, §§ 89-92, 1 March 2007; and Allan, cited above, § 42)."

As regards the privilege against self-incrimination or the right to remain silent, the Court reiterates that these are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of a fair procedure. Their aim is to provide an accused person with protection against improper compulsion by the authorities and thus to avoid miscarriages of justice and secure the aims of Article 6 (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, § 45, Reports 1996-I). The right not to incriminate oneself is primarily concerned with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent and presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seeks to prove the case against the accused without resorting to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, §§ 68 ‑ 69, Reports 1996-VI; Allan, cited above, § 44; Jalloh, cited above, §§ 94-117; and O'Halloran and Francis v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 15809/02 and 25624/02, §§ 53-63, ECHR 2007-... ). In examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court must examine the nature and degree of the compulsion, the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures and the use to which any material so obtained is put (see, for example, Heaney and McGuinness v. Ireland, no. 34720/97, §§ 54-55, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and J.B. v. Switzerland, no. 31827/96, ECHR 2001-III)."

The first charge concerning the applicant’s alleged failure to inform the relevant authorities of the possible involvement of the Abkhaz separatist forces in the rebellion was based solely on the applicant’s telephone conversation with E.K. as aired on Rustavi 2 on 25 July 2006 (see paragraph 15 above). As regards the second charge, namely aiding and abetting high treason, it was alleged that the applicant had provided intellectual support to E.K. by giving him instructions, advice, information, and the encouragement necessary to achieve his aims. According to the document containing the charges, the applicant further promised to create a favourable image of E.K. and his plans in public, and called E.K. a hero in one of his public speeches while calling on the government not to forcibly quell the rebellion in another speech. He further advised E.K. on his public speeches and image. The second charge was based on several recordings of telephone conversations between the applicant and E.K. during the period of 23-25 July 2006, the applicant’s speeches and comments broadcast by the media, E.K.’s speeches and other evidence."

According to the investigator, it was necessary to place the applicant in detention owing to the particular seriousness of the charges, and that there were reasons to believe that, if released, the applicant would continue his criminal activities, impede the course of justice as the other persons implicated in the crimes in question were still at large, and abscond."

The court further noted that considering the swift arrest of the applicant, he had not had the opportunity to interfere with the course of the criminal investigation or tamper with the evidence, and his detention was in order to prevent such a risk from materialising.

Therefore, there was no need to refer separately to individual judicial decisions ordering and subsequently extending the applicant’s pre-trial detention. As for the grounds relied on to justify the applicant’s pre-trial detention, the Government submitted the following. First, the risk of reoffending had been demonstrated by the fact that the charge against the applicant consisted of aiding and abetting the military rebellion aimed at overturning the constitutional order and was based on his support for the rebels expressed through telephone conversations – an activity which the applicant could have resumed if released, given that the rebels had still been at large, issuing threats against the government. Second, if released, the applicant could have interfered with the investigation by influencing the witnesses that remained to be questioned. It was in this context that the complexity of the criminal investigation in question justified the applicant’s continued detention. Third, the applicant’s release would have threatened public order owing to the risk of him continuing to influence public opinion in order to gain public support for the rebels. The Government maintained that in sensitive cases such as the applicant’s, involving matters of state security and the territorial integrity of the country, a genuine requirement of public interest existed that outweighed the rule of respect for individual liberty. Furthermore, the domestic courts also relied on other grounds such as the risk of absconding.

A “criminal charge” exists from the moment that an individual is officially notified by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence, or from the point at which his situation has been substantially affected by actions taken by the authorities as a result of a suspicion against him (see, among other authorities, Simeonovi v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 21980/04, § 110, 12 May 2017, with further references therein). The Court notes that no plea of inadmissibility for incompatibility ratione materiae with Article 6 § 2 of the Convention was made by the Government in their observations. However, since this is a matter which goes to the Court’s jurisdiction, the Court must examine it of its own motion (see Mirovni Inštitut v.

It is alleged that they had first manipulated that recording in order to insinuate the existence of a crime and then made it available to the public before formally bringing the charge against the applicant. Such allegedly mala fide conduct, if established or inferred during the Court’s examination on the merits, combined with the close temporal proximity between the timing of the release of the recording, the questioning of the applicant and the bringing of the charge could attract, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the protection of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention (contrast and compare, Zollman v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 62902/00, ECHR 2003-XII, and Blake, cited above, §§ 120-121 and 123) from the moment the allegedly manipulated version of the recording was made available to the public by the Ministry of the Interior."

While it is true that in the absence of any domestic case ‑ law concerning Article 18 § 2 of the Civil Code, the Court is not in a position to conclude that that remedy was indeed available and effective in practice, it still finds the applicant’s failure to complain at domestic level of the alleged violation of the principle of the presumption of innocence unacceptable. By not giving the Government an opportunity to address this complaint at domestic level, the applicant, in the Court’s view, did not meet the requirements of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (see Tuskia and Others v. Georgia, no. 14237/07, § 91, 11 October 2018).

Conversely, the refusal by the Chief Prosecutor’s Office to open a criminal investigation into the applicant’s allegations concerning tampering with evidence explicitly confirmed the existence of a full transcript of the audio recording, using it as an argument to conclude that it must have been the private television channel which had shortened the conversation based on their own operational needs (see paragraphs 41-42 above). The full transcript of the recording that the Chief Prosecutor’s Office referred to, and which was available in the criminal case file, was prepared by the Ministry of the Interior (see paragraph 22 above) and its authenticity and reliability were never put in question. That transcript, in its relevant parts, contained the text of the conversation allegedly spoken during the six-second and twenty-one-second silences in the recording aired on Rustavi 2 (compare paragraphs 15 and 22 above). Therefore, the existence of two versions of the audio recording, even if the full version of that recording was not included in the applicant’s criminal case file, is confirmed by the full transcript of the recording prepared by the Ministry of the Interior, and the reference made to it by the Chief Prosecutor’s Office (compare paragraphs 22 and 42 above).

As regards the Government’s argument before the Court, they submitted that it was within the private television company’s remit to transmit whichever parts of the conversation it deemed relevant (see paragraph 75 above). The Court will address the two arguments in turn. First, the argument regarding the operational needs of the television channel and the limited airtime is not convincing considering that the recording aired in the media lasted one minute and forty-four seconds, the same length as the recording in respect of which the full transcript was available in the criminal case file (compare paragraphs 15 and 22 above). Second, as regards the related but more general argument that the television company could have aired whichever parts of the conversation it considered relevant, that is not consistent with the Government’s position before the Court that only one official version of the recording existed and that it was identical to the one transmitted by the television channel in question (see paragraph 75 above)."

One of the charges was based solely on the manipulated audio recording, as disseminated in the media (see paragraph 26 above). This sequence of closely inter-connected events, considered as a whole, indicates that the applicant’s situation was substantially affected, for the purposes of the applicability of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, by the conduct of the investigating authorities which wrongly created a suspicion in respect of the applicant by tampering with evidence and having it disseminated, in order to subsequently charge him with a crime based on that material (contrast and compare, Blake, cited above, § 123)."

It is true that the voicing of suspicions regarding an accused ’ s innocence is conceivable as long as the conclusion of criminal proceedings has not resulted in a decision on the merits of the accusation ( Sekanina, cited above, § 30). However, in its decision of 26 December 2001, the Novozavodsky Court rejected the applicant ’ s compensation claim with reference to the fact that the criminal proceedings against him had been discontinued on non-exonerating grounds (see paragraph 28 above). This decision was confirmed by the Court of Appeal after the applicant ’ s complaint against the decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings on non-exonerative grounds had finally been rejected (see § 19 above). The Court does not consider it necessary to determine in the present case whether in principle the refusal to award compensation on the basis that the criminal proceedings were terminated on “non-exonerative” grounds in itself violates the presumption of innocence. It notes that in the present case the court decisions terminating the criminal proceedings against the applicant were couched in terms which left no doubt as to their view that the applicant had committed the offence with which he was charged. In particular, the Desniansky Court indicated that the investigation case file contained sufficient evidence to establish that the applicant had forged a notarial document and had wittingly carried out an invalid notarial action, its only reason for discontinuing the proceedings being the impracticality of prosecuting an insignificant offence. This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court rejected the applicant ’ s request for leave to appeal in cassation. In the Court ’ s view, the language employed by the Desniansky Court was in itself sufficient to constitute a breach of the presumption of innocence. The fact that the applicant ’ s compensation claim was rejected on the basis of the findings reached in the criminal proceedings merely exacerbated this situation. Although the Desniansky Court reached its conclusion after a hearing held in the presence of the applicant, the proceedings before it were not criminal in nature and they lacked a number of key elements normally pertaining to a criminal trial. In that respect, it cannot be concluded that the proceedings before that court resulted, or were intended to result in the applicant being “proved guilty according to law”. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the reasons given by the Desniansky Court, as upheld on appeal, combined with the rejection of the applicant ’ s compensation claim on the basis of those same reasons, constituted an infringement of the presumption of innocence."

It is true that the voicing of suspicions regarding an accused ’ s innocence is conceivable as long as the conclusion of criminal proceedings has not resulted in a decision on the merits of the accusation ( Sekanina, cited above, § 30). However, in its decision of 26 December 2001, the Novozavodsky Court rejected the applicant ’ s compensation claim with reference to the fact that the criminal proceedings against him had been discontinued on non-exonerating grounds (see paragraph 28 above). This decision was confirmed by the Court of Appeal after the applicant ’ s complaint against the decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings on non-exonerative grounds had finally been rejected (see § 19 above). The Court does not consider it necessary to determine in the present case whether in principle the refusal to award compensation on the basis that the criminal proceedings were terminated on “non-exonerative” grounds in itself violates the presumption of innocence. It notes that in the present case the court decisions terminating the criminal proceedings against the applicant were couched in terms which left no doubt as to their view that the applicant had committed the offence with which he was charged. In particular, the Desniansky Court indicated that the investigation case file contained sufficient evidence to establish that the applicant had forged a notarial document and had wittingly carried out an invalid notarial action, its only reason for discontinuing the proceedings being the impracticality of prosecuting an insignificant offence. This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court rejected the applicant ’ s request for leave to appeal in cassation. In the Court ’ s view, the language employed by the Desniansky Court was in itself sufficient to constitute a breach of the presumption of innocence. The fact that the applicant ’ s compensation claim was rejected on the basis of the findings reached in the criminal proceedings merely exacerbated this situation. Although the Desniansky Court reached its conclusion after a hearing held in the presence of the applicant, the proceedings before it were not criminal in nature and they lacked a number of key elements normally pertaining to a criminal trial. In that respect, it cannot be concluded that the proceedings before that court resulted, or were intended to result in the applicant being “proved guilty according to law”. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the reasons given by the Desniansky Court, as upheld on appeal, combined with the rejection of the applicant ’ s compensation claim on the basis of those same reasons, constituted an infringement of the presumption of innocence."

The applicant moreover complained that it had not been possible for his lawyer to listen to and read the entirety of the telecommunication ‑ surveillance data, due to the time constraints and its significant volume. The Government were of the opinion that it had not been necessary to allow for the possibility to listen to each and every recording and read each and every text message. The Court is indeed satisfied that, in view of the complexity of the criminal proceedings at issue (see Gregačević v. Croatia, no. 58331/09, § 53, 10 July 2012), it was not necessary to allow for the opportunity that the applicant’s lawyer read through and listen to each and every single item of the telecommunication ‑ surveillance data. Rather, it was, in principle, sufficient to allow an effective opportunity for the applicant’s lawyer to analyse the recordings and text messages in order to identify and then listen or read those which he considered to be of relevance. In this connection, the Court is mindful of the fact that modern investigation means may indeed produce, as in the present case, enormous amounts of data, the integration of which into the criminal proceedings should not cause unnecessary delays to those proceedings. It therefore considers that the applicant’s right to disclosure must not be confused with his right of access to all material already considered as relevant by the authorities, which will generally require for the possibility to comprehend the material in its entirety (see, as an exception, Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, §§ 581-85)."

In so far as the applicant complained that his lawyer had not been, given sufficient opportunity to identify relevant recordings and text messages, the Court observes that the responsible police officer supported the applicant’s lawyer, who was likely not acquainted with the software to analyse the telecommunication-surveillance data. Initially, the police provided the applicant’s lawyer with the data produced in respect of certain search parameters of his choosing (see paragraph 12 above). Subsequently, it provided him with lists containing substantial amounts of information on the retrieved telecommunication data (see paragraph 15 above). In so far as the applicant alleged that the lists had fallen short of what he had requested, he has not substantiated why it would not have been possible to identify relevant data by substantially reducing the amount to actually listen to on the basis of search parameters and the provided lists. In fact, it appears that it was possible to narrow down the search by looking for specific telephone lines, for connections between specific telephones lines, within a certain frame of time, overall allowing for substantial reduction of the data with potential relevance. Moreover, the applicant’s lawyer, who could have been expected to arrange for at least some shift in the emphasis of his work (see Mattick v. Germany (dec.), no. 62116/00, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII, with further references), even if appointments with the police and in prison were, in particular due to limited opening hours (see paragraphs 11 and 19), difficult to arrange, only managed to examine the data on twenty-two occasions within more than one year, apparently never together with the applicant on the prison premises and not after 31 October 2012. At the same time, he neither made use of the possibility to have a judicial employee replace him, as the court had suggested, nor can it be taken from the applicant’s submissions that his two other lawyers engaged substantially in the analysing, listening and reading exercise. It also has to be taken into account that the applicant, who had been the one subjected to the surveillance measures, would have known best what specific telecommunication ‑ surveillance data to look for. The Court therefore cannot see that the authorities provided the defence only with an ineffective opportunity to identify the relevant files."

The court also noted that the applicant’s lawyer had not arranged any appointments to listen to audio files after 31 October 2012 (see paragraph 28 above). It noted that the lawyer had also been able to listen to all the audio files obtained during the investigation, on the premises of the criminal police. Referring to Article 6 § 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention, the court held that there was thus nothing to indicate that the defence did not have adequate time to listen to the audio files. The Federal Court of Justice emphasised in particular, that the applicant’s lawyer had neither been at fault in not using other people’s help in examining the evidence, nor could he be reproached for the fact that the applicant’s two other lawyers had not made use of their entitlement to examine the evidence.

As far as the domestic courts and the Government had criticised the lawyer for not having arranged for appointments to visit in order to examine the telecommunication-surveillance data as of October 2012, it had to be taken into account that the defence had at that time been busy with analysing the 14 million electronic files, which had been provided only in September 2012.

In view of roughly 45,000 covertly recorded telephone conversations, it had been rather probable that private, even intimate conversations without any relation to the events under examination had also been captured. There had been a statutory obligation to not listen to those (parts of the) recorded conversations. During examination of the conversations by the lawyer and/or the applicant this obligation had been enforced by the presence of a supervising police officer, who had also been present in order to support the applicant’s lawyer with questions regarding the analysis of the data.

In this connection, the Court is mindful of the fact that modern investigation means may indeed produce, as in the present case, enormous amounts of data, the integration of which into the criminal proceedings should not cause unnecessary delays to those proceedings. It therefore considers that the applicant’s right to disclosure must not be confused with his right of access to all material already considered as relevant by the authorities, which will generally require for the possibility to comprehend the material in its entirety (see, as an exception, Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, §§ 581-85)."
            ],
            [
                "68. In so far as the applicant complained that his lawyer had not been, given sufficient opportunity to identify relevant recordings and text messages, the Court observes that the responsible police officer supported the applicant’s lawyer, who was likely not acquainted with the software to analyse the telecommunication-surveillance data. Initially, the police provided the applicant’s lawyer with the data produced in respect of certain search parameters of his choosing (see paragraph 12 above). Subsequently, it provided him with lists containing substantial amounts of information on the retrieved telecommunication data (see paragraph 15 above). In so far as the applicant alleged that the lists had fallen short of what he had requested, he has not substantiated why it would not have been possible to identify relevant data by substantially reducing the amount to actually listen to on the basis of search parameters and the provided lists. In fact, it appears that it was possible to narrow down the search by looking for specific telephone lines, for connections between specific telephones lines, within a certain frame of time, overall allowing for substantial reduction of the data with potential relevance. Moreover, the applicant’s lawyer, who could have been expected to arrange for at least some shift in the emphasis of his work (see Mattick v. Germany (dec.), no. 62116/00, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII, with further references), even if appointments with the police and in prison were, in particular due to limited opening hours (see paragraphs 11 and 19), difficult to arrange, only managed to examine the data on twenty-two occasions within more than one year, apparently never together with the applicant on the prison premises and not after 31 October 2012. At the same time, he neither made use of the possibility to have a judicial employee replace him, as the court had suggested, nor can it be taken from the applicant’s submissions that his two other lawyers engaged substantially in the analysing, listening and reading exercise. It also has to be taken into account that the applicant, who had been the one subjected to the surveillance measures, would have known best what specific telecommunication ‑ surveillance data to look for. The Court therefore cannot see that the authorities provided the defence only with an ineffective opportunity to identify the relevant files."

At the same time, it took the view that the member States were not permitted to avoid an obligation on the ground that a decision (or resolution) by the Security Council was substantively inconsistent with the Charter, in particular decisions (resolutions) based on Chapter VII thereof (action with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression)."

It took the view that unless the conflict could be resolved by the rules on the interpretation of treaties, it would be necessary, in order to settle the issue, to look to the hierarchy of international legal norms, according to which obligations under the United Nations Charter prevailed over obligations under any other international agreement (Article 103 of the Charter, taken together with Article 30 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties; see paragraphs 69 and 80 below).

This includes in particular travel on medical, humanitarian or religious grounds ...",

Constitutionally however, the provision is to be interpreted as meaning that an exemption should be granted in all cases where the United Nations sanctions regime so permits. A more far-reaching restriction on the appellant’s freedom of movement could not be regarded as based on the Security Council Resolutions, would not be in the public interest and would be disproportionate in the light of the appellant’s particular situation.",

As a result of the ban on entry into and transit through Switzerland, he is unable to leave Campione. Practically speaking, as the appellant correctly argued, this is tantamount to house arrest and thus represents a serious restriction on his personal liberty. In these circumstances the Swiss authorities are obliged to exhaust all the relaxations of the sanctions regime available under the United Nations Security Council Resolutions.",

In the exercise of that latter power it is necessary for the Community to attach special importance to the fact that, in accordance with Article 24 of the Charter of the United Nations, the adoption by the Security Council of resolutions under Chapter VII of the Charter constitutes the exercise of the primary responsibility with which that international body is invested for the maintenance of peace and security at the global level, a responsibility which, under Chapter VII, includes the power to determine what and who poses a threat to international peace and security and to take the measures necessary to maintain or restore them.",

                "298. It must however be noted that the Charter of the United Nations does not impose the choice of a particular model for the implementation of resolutions adopted by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter, since they are to be given effect in accordance with the procedure applicable in that respect in the domestic legal order of each member of the United Nations. The Charter of the United Nations leaves the members of the United Nations a free choice among the various possible models for transposition of those resolutions into their domestic legal order.",

It follows from all those considerations that it is not a consequence of the principles governing the international legal order under the United Nations that any judicial review of the internal lawfulness of the contested Regulation in the light of fundamental freedoms is excluded by virtue of the fact that that measure is intended to give effect to a resolution of the Security Council adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.",

The two complainants, Belgian nationals, had been placed on the lists appended to that Resolution in January 2003, on the basis of information which had been provided to the Security Council by Belgium, shortly after the commencement of a domestic criminal investigation in September 2002. They had submitted several delisting requests at national, regional and United Nations levels, all to no avail. In 2005, the Brussels Court of First Instance had ordered the Belgian State, inter alia, to initiate urgently a delisting procedure with the United Nations Sanctions Committee, and the State had subsequently done so."

The Committee found a violation of the complainants’ right to freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, because both the dismissal of the criminal investigation and the State Party’s delisting requests showed that the restrictions were not necessary to protect national security or public order."

G answers to that description because he has been designated by the 1267 Committee [the Sanctions Committee]. What he needs if he is to be afforded an effective remedy is a means of subjecting that listing to judicial review. This is something that, under the system that the 1267 Committee currently operates, is denied to him. I would hold that Article 3 § 1 (b) of the AQO [al-Qaeda Order], which has this effect, is ultra vires section 1 of the 1946 Act.

                "171. As regards, more specifically, the question of the relationship between the Convention and Security Council resolutions, the Court found as follows in its Al-Jedda judgment (cited above):",
                "“101. Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations provides that the obligations of the members of the United Nations under the Charter shall prevail in the event of a conflict with obligations under any other international agreement. Before it can consider whether Article 103 had any application in the present case, the Court must determine whether there was a conflict between the United Kingdom’s obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 and its obligations under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. In other words, the key question is whether Resolution 1546 placed the United Kingdom under an obligation to hold the applicant in internment.",
                "102. In its approach to the interpretation of Resolution 1546, the Court has reference to the considerations set out in paragraph 76 above. In addition, the Court must have regard to the purposes for which the United Nations was created. As well as the purpose of maintaining international peace and security, set out in the first sub-paragraph of Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations, the third sub-paragraph provides that the United Nations was established to ‘achieve international cooperation in ... promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms’. Article 24 § 2 of the Charter requires the Security Council, in discharging its duties with respect to its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, to ‘act in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations’. Against this background, the Court considers that, in interpreting its resolutions, there must be a presumption that the Security Council does not intend to impose any obligation on member States to breach fundamental principles of human rights. In the event of any ambiguity in the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution, the Court must therefore choose the interpretation which is most in harmony with the requirements of the Convention and which avoids any conflict of obligations. In the light of the United Nations’ important role in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights, it is to be expected that clear and explicit language would be used were the Security Council to intend States to take particular measures which would conflict with their obligations under international human rights law.”"

However, in the present case it observes that, contrary to the situation in Al-Jedda, where the wording of the resolution in issue did not specifically mention internment without trial, Resolution 1390 (2002) expressly required States to prevent the individuals on the United Nations list from entering or transiting through their territory. As a result, the above-mentioned presumption is rebutted in the present case, having regard to the clear and explicit language, imposing an obligation to take measures capable of breaching human rights, that was used in that Resolution (see also paragraph 7 of Resolution 1267 (1999), paragraph 70 above, in which the Security Council was even more explicit in setting aside any other international obligations that might be incompatible with the Resolution)."

In order to do so, it will particularly take account of the wording of those resolutions and the context in which they were adopted (see Al-Jedda, cited above, § 76, with the reference cited therein to the relevant case-law of the International Court of Justice).

Similarly, it had implemented at domestic level the entry-and-transit ban concerning the applicant, as required by Resolution 1390 (2002) of 16 January 2002 (see paragraph 74 above), on 1 May of that year by the amendment of Article 4a of the Taliban Ordinance. The Court acknowledges that this Resolution, particularly in the light of paragraph 2, was addressed to “all States” and not only the members of the United Nations. However, the Court observes that the United Nations Charter does not impose on States a particular model for the implementation of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council under Chapter VII. Without prejudice to the binding nature of such resolutions, the Charter in principle leaves to United Nations member States a free choice among the various possible models for transposition of those resolutions into their domestic legal order. The Charter thus imposes on States an obligation of result, leaving them to choose the means by which they give effect to the resolutions (see to the same effect, mutatis mutandis, the Kadi judgment of the CJEC, § 298, paragraph 86 above)."

They stated that the purpose of the measure in question had never been to confine the applicant to the territory of Campione d’Italia. Only a ban on entering and transiting through Switzerland had been imposed on him. The fact that the applicant found that his movements were restricted by the impugned measure was attributable only to himself, because he had chosen to live in an Italian enclave surrounded by Swiss territory. Neither the sanctions as decided by the United Nations, nor their implementation by the Swiss authorities, had obliged him to remain a resident of Campione d’Italia. At any time he could thus have requested authorisation to transfer his home to another part of Italy."

In particular, he was not under surveillance by the Swiss authorities, had no specific obligations and could have received as many visits as he wished. He was also able, at all times, to meet his lawyers freely. The Government further pointed out that the border between Campione d’Italia and Switzerland was not patrolled, so the ban on entry into Switzerland could not have been perceived by him as a physical obstacle."

No deprivation of liberty will be compatible with Article 5 § 1 unless it falls within one of those grounds or is provided for by a lawful derogation under Article 15 of the Convention, which allows for a Contracting State “[i]n time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation” to take measures derogating from its obligations under Article 5 “to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation” (see, among other authorities, Al-Jedda, cited above, § 99; A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, §§ 162-63, ECHR 2009; and Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 194)."

In order to determine whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5, the starting-point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question. The difference between deprivation and restriction of liberty is one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance (see Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09, § 57, ECHR 2012; Stanev v.

Indeed, the context in which the measure is taken is an important factor, since situations commonly occur in modern society where the public may be called on to endure restrictions on freedom of movement or liberty in the interests of the common good (see, mutatis mutandis, Austin and Others, cited above, § 59)."

In that case, the application had been lodged by an individual who, being suspected of belonging to a “band of mafiosi”, had been forced to live on an island within an (unfenced) area of 2.5 sq. km, together with other residents in a similar situation and supervisory staff. The Court found that the applicant had been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5 and that he could therefore rely on the guarantees under that provision (see also Giulia Manzoni v.

The restrictions in question did not prevent the applicant from freely living and moving within the territory of his permanent residence, where he had chosen, of his own free will, to live and carry on his activities. The Court considers that, in these circumstances, his case differs radically from the factual situation in Guzzardi (cited above) and that the prohibition imposed upon the applicant does not raise an issue under Article 5 of the Convention."

Review and supervision of secret surveillance measures may come into play at three stages: when the surveillance is first ordered, while it is being carried out, or after it has been terminated. As regards the first two stages, the very nature and logic of secret surveillance dictate that not only the surveillance itself but also the accompanying review should be effected without the individual ’ s knowledge. Consequently, since the individual will necessarily be prevented from seeking an effective remedy of his own accord or from taking a direct part in any review proceedings, it is essential that the procedures established should themselves provide adequate and equivalent guarantees safeguarding his rights. In addition, the values of a democratic society must be followed as faithfully as possible in the supervisory procedures if the bounds of necessity, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2, are not to be exceeded. In a field where abuse is potentially so easy in individual cases and could have such harmful consequences for democratic society as a whole, it is in principle desirable to entrust supervisory control to a judge, judicial control offering the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and a proper procedure (see Klass and Others, cited above, §§ 55 - 56)."

It found that the applicant had not proved that the mobile-network operators had transmitted any protected information to unauthorised persons or permitted the unrestricted or unauthorised interception of communications. The equipment to which he referred had been installed to enable law-enforcement agencies to conduct operational-search activities in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law.

Those documents had included two judicial orders retrospectively authorising the interception of mobile-telephone communications and an addendum to the standard service - provider agreement issued by one of the mobile-network operators. One of the judicial orders in question, issued on 8 October 2002, authorised the interception of several people ’ s mobile-telephone communications during the periods from 1 to 5 April, 19 to 23 June, 30 June to 4 July and 16 to 20 October 2001. The other judicial order, issued on 18 July 2003, authorised the interception of a Mr E. ’ s mobile-telephone communications during the period from 11 April to 11 October 2003. As to the addendum, it informed the subscriber that if his number were used to make terrorist threats, the mobile - network operator might suspend the provision of the telephone service and transfer the collected data to the law-enforcement agencies. In the applicant ’ s opinion, the judicial orders and the addendum proved that the mobile-network operators and law-enforcement agencies were technically capable of intercepting all telephone communications without obtaining prior judicial authorisation, and routinely resorted to unauthorised interception."

Nor had he shown that there was a danger that his right to the privacy of his telephone communications might be unlawfully infringed. To establish the existence of such a danger, the applicant would have had to prove that the respondents had acted unlawfully. However, mobile-network operators were required by law to install equipment enabling law-enforcement agencies to perform operational-search activities and the existence of that equipment did not in itself interfere with the privacy of the applicant ’ s communications. The refusal to admit the judicial orders of 8 October 2002 and 18 July 2003 in evidence had been lawful, as the judicial orders had been issued in respect of third persons and were irrelevant to the applicant ’ s case. The City Court further decided to admit in evidence and examine the addendum to the service - provider agreement, but found that it did not contain any information warranting reconsideration of the District Court ’ s judgment."

                "147. The judgment the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU ) of 8 April 2014 in the joined cases of Digital Rights Ireland and Seitinger and Others (C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238) declared invalid the Data Retention Directive 2006/24/EC laying down the obligation on the providers of publicly available electronic communication services or of public communications networks to retain all traffic and location data for periods from six months to two years, in order to ensure that the data were available for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each member State in its national law. The CJEU noted that, even though the Directive did not permit the retention of the content of the communication, the traffic and location data covered by it might allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data had been retained. Accordingly, the obligation to retain those data constituted in itself an interference with the right to respect for private life and communications guaranteed by Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the right to protection of personal data under its Article 8. Furthermore, the access of the competent national authorities to the data constituted a further interference with those fundamental rights. The CJEU further held that the interference was particularly serious. The fact that data were retained and subsequently used without the subscriber or registered user being informed was likely to generate in the minds of the persons concerned the feeling that their private lives were the subject of constant surveillance. The interference satisfied an objective of general interest, namely to contribute to the fight against serious crime and terrorism and thus, ultimately, to public security. However, it failed to satisfy the requirement of proportionality. Firstly, the Directive covered, in a generalised manner, all persons and all means of electronic communication as well as all traffic data without any differentiation, limitation or exception being made in the light of the objective of fighting against serious crime. It therefore entailed an interference with the fundamental rights of practically the entire European population. It applied even to persons for whom there was no evidence capable of suggesting that their conduct might have a link, even an indirect or remote one, with serious crime. Secondly, the Directive did not contain substantive and procedural conditions relating to the access of the competent national authorities to the data and to their subsequent use. By simply referring, in a general manner, to serious crime, as defined by each member State in its national law, the Directive failed to lay down any objective criterion by which to determine which offences might be considered to be sufficiently serious to justify such an extensive interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. Above all, the access by the competent national authorities to the data retained was not made dependent on a prior review carried out by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision sought to limit access to the data and their use to what was strictly necessary for the purpose of attaining the objective pursued. Thirdly, the Directive required that all data be retained for a period of at least six months, without any distinction being made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The CJEU concluded that the Directive entailed a wide-ranging and particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, without such an interference being precisely circumscribed by provisions to ensure that it was actually limited to what was strictly necessary. The CJEU also noted that the Directive did not provide for sufficient safeguards, by means of technical and organisational measures, to ensure effective protection of the data retained against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access and use of those data.",

Germany ( 6 September 1978, § 34, Series A no. 28) and Malone v. the United Kingdom (2 August 1984, § 64, Series A no. 82) – according to which an individual might, under certain conditions, claim to be the victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret measures or of legislation permitting secret measures, without having to allege that such measures had in fact been applied to him– could not be interpreted so broadly as to encompass every person in the respondent State who feared that the security services might have compiled information about him.

Firstly, there was no “reasonable likelihood”, or indeed any risk whatsoever, that the applicant had been subjected to surveillance measures because he had not been suspected of any criminal offences.

The Government asserted that the applicant ’ s telephone conversations had never been intercepted. The applicant had not produced any proof to the contrary.

It was possible to request that the Constitutional Court review the constitutionality of the Operational-Search Activities Act of 12 August 1995 (no. 144 ‑ FZ – “the OSAA”). It was also possible to lodge a complaint with the Supreme Court, as had been successfully done by Mr N., who had obtained a finding of unlawfulness in respect of a provision of the Ministry of Communications ’ Order no. 130 (see paragraph 128 above ). As regards Order no. 70, contrary to the applicant ’ s allegations, it had been duly published (see paragraph 181 below) and could therefore be challenged in the courts. A person whose communications had been intercepted unlawfully without prior judicial authorisation could also obtain redress in a civil court. The Government referred to the Supreme Court ’ s judgment of 15 July 2009, which found that the installation of a video camera in the claimant ’ s office and the tapping of his office telephone had been unlawful because those surveillance measures had been carried out without prior judicial authorisation (see also paragraphs 219 - 24 below).

Given that Russian law provided for adequate and sufficient safeguards against abuse in the sphere of interception of communications, including available remedies, in the Government ’ s opinion the applicant could not claim an interference as a result of the mere existence of legislation permitting secret surveillance.

In Liberty and Others v. the United Kingdom (no. 58243/00, §§ 56 - 57, 1 July 2008), the Court found that the existence of powers permitting the authorities to intercept communications constituted an interference with the Article 8 rights of the applicants, since they were persons to whom these powers might have been applied. In Kennedy (cited above, § 124) that test had been further elaborated upon to include the assessment of availability of any remedies at the national level and the risk of secret surveillance measures being applied to the applicant. Finally, in Mersch and Others v.

The domestic proceedings brought by the applicant had shown that Order no. 70 could not be effectively challenged before the Russian courts. Further, as far as the OSAA was concerned, the Constitutional Court had already examined its constitutionality on a number of occasions and had found that it was compatible with the Constitution. Finally, as regards the possibility of challenging individual surveillance measures, the applicant submitted that the person concerned was not notified of the interception, unless the intercepted material had been used as evidence in criminal proceedings against him.

To that extent, the disputed legislation directly affects all users or potential users of the postal and telecommunication services in the Federal Republic of Germany. Furthermore, as the Delegates rightly pointed out, this menace of surveillance can be claimed in itself to restrict free communication through the postal and telecommunication services, thereby constituting for all users or potential users a direct interference with the right guaranteed by Article 8.",

In order to assess, in a particular case, whether an individual can claim an interference as a result of the mere existence of legislation permitting secret surveillance measures, the Court must have regard to the availability of any remedies at the national level and the risk of secret surveillance measures being applied to him. Where there is no possibility of challenging the alleged application of secret surveillance measures at domestic level, widespread suspicion and concern among the general public that secret surveillance powers are being abused cannot be said to be unjustified. In such cases, even where the actual risk of surveillance is low, there is a greater need for scrutiny by this Court (see Kennedy, cited above, § 124).",

            [
                "171. In the Court ’ s view the Kennedy approach is best tailored to the need to ensure that the secrecy of surveillance measures does not result in the measures being effectively unchallengeable and outside the supervision of the national judicial authorities and of the Court. Accordingly, the Court accepts that an applicant can claim to be the victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret surveillance measures, or legislation permitting secret surveillance measures, if the following conditions are satisfied. Firstly, the Court will take into account the scope of the legislation permitting secret surveillance measures by examining whether the applicant can possibly be affected by it, either because he belongs to a group of persons targeted by the contested legislation or because the legislation directly affects all users of communication services by instituting a system where any person can have his communications intercepted. Secondly, the Court will take into account the availability of remedies at the national level and will adjust the degree of scrutiny depending on the effectiveness of such remedies. As the Court observed in Kennedy, where the domestic system does not afford an effective remedy to the person who suspects that he was subjected to secret surveillance, widespread suspicion and concern among the general public that secret surveillance powers are being abused cannot be said to be unjustified (see Kennedy, cited above, § 124). In such circumstances the threat of surveillance can be claimed in itself to restrict free communication through the postal and telecommunication services, thereby constituting for all users or potential users a direct interference with the right guaranteed by Article 8. There is therefore a greater need for scrutiny by the Court, and an exception to the rule denying individuals the right to challenge a law in abstracto is justified. In such cases the individual does not need to demonstrate the existence of any risk that secret surveillance measures were applied to him. By contrast, if the national system provides for effective remedies, a widespread suspicion of abuse is more difficult to justify. In such cases, the individual may claim to be a victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret measures or of legislation permitting secret measures only if he is able to show that, due to his personal situation, he is potentially at risk of being subjected to such measures."

The courts summarised their own case-law concerning operational-search measures involving interference with the privacy of communications or privacy of the home for the period from 2010 - 13. One of the courts noted that it refused authorisation to carry out an operational-search measure if it did not appear on the list of operational-search measures in the OSAA, if the request for authorisation was not signed by a competent official or was not reasoned, or if the case fell under statutory restrictions on the use of that measure (for example, relating to the person ’ s status or to the nature of the offence). Authorisation was given if all of the above conditions were met. Another court stated that authorisation could also be refused if the request was insufficiently reasoned, that is, if it did not contain sufficient information permitting the judge to ascertain that the measure was lawful and justified. The third court stated that it granted authorisation if requested to do so by the law-enforcement authorities. It never refused a request for authorisation. All three courts considered that the request was sufficiently reasoned if it referred to the existence of information listed in section 8(2) of the OSAA (see paragraph 31 above). One of the courts noted that supporting materials were never attached to requests for authorisation; another court noted that some, but not all, of the requests were accompanied by supporting materials, while the third court stated that all requests were accompanied by supporting materials. In all three courts the judges never requested that the law-enforcement authorities submit additional supporting materials, such as materials confirming the grounds for the interception or proving that the telephone numbers to be tapped belonged to the person concerned. Two courts granted interception authorisations in respect of unidentified persons, one of them specifying that such authorisations only concerned collection of data from technical channels of communication. Such authorisations did not mention a specific person or a telephone number to be tapped, but authorised interception of all telephone communications in the area where a criminal offence had been committed. One court never gave such authorisations. Two courts noted that authorisations always indicated the duration for which the interception was authorised, while one court stated that the duration of interception was not indicated in the authorisations issued by it.

The applicant drew the Court ’ s attention to the fact that the number of interception authorisations had almost doubled between 2009 and 2013. He also argued that the very high percentage of authorisations granted showed that the judges did not verify the existence of a “reasonable suspicion” against the interception subject and did not exercise careful and rigorous scrutiny.

An obligation to forward an interception authorisation to the communications service provider was mentioned only once in Russian law in connection with the monitoring of communications-related data under the CCrP (see paragraph 48 above ). The equipment the communications service providers had installed pursuant to the Orders issued by the Ministry of Communications, in particular the unpublished addendums to Order no. 70, allowed the law-enforcement authorities direct and unrestricted access to all mobile-telephone communications of all users. The communications service providers also had an obligation under Order no. 538 to create databases to store information about all subscribers and the services provided to them for three years. The secret services had direct remote access to those databases. The manner in which the system of secret surveillance thus operated gave the security services and the police the technical means to circumvent the authorisation procedure and to intercept any communications without obtaining prior judicial authorisation.

The OSAA explicitly required the courts to give reasons for the decision to authorise interception. In line with the Constitutional Court ’ s decision of 8 February 2007 (see paragraph 42 above), the interception authorisation was to refer to the specific grounds for suspecting the person in respect of whom operational-search measures were requested of a criminal offence or of activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security.

In exceptional circumstances it was permissible to authorise the interception of communications of unidentified persons. As a rule, in such cases a judge authorised the collection of data from technical channels of communication in order to identify the persons present at a specific location at the time that a criminal offence was committed there.

The Government submitted a copy of the decision of 4 August 2009 by the Alekseyevskiy District Court of the Belgorod region, ordering that the police provide, within one month, an interception subject with information about the data collected about him in the course of the interception “ to the extent permitted by the requirements of confidentiality and with the exception of data which could enable State secrets to be disclosed ”."

In support of that allegation, they referred to the criminal - conviction judgment of 11 July 2012 by the Zabaykalsk Regional Court. That judgment – a copy of which was not provided to the Court – relied, according to the Government, on a judicial decision authorising the interception of the defendant ’ s telephone communications which had been declassified and submitted to the trial judge at his request.

Foreseeability in the special context of secret measures of surveillance, such as the interception of communications, cannot mean that an individual should be able to foresee when the authorities are likely to intercept his communications so that he can adapt his conduct accordingly. However, especially where a power vested in the executive is exercised in secret, the risks of arbitrariness are evident. It is therefore essential to have clear, detailed rules on interception of telephone conversations, especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated. The domestic law must be sufficiently clear to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to any such measures ( see Malone, cited above, § 67; Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 51, Series A no. 116; Huvig v. France, 24 April 1990, § 29, Series A no. 176 ‑ B; Valenzuela Contreras v.

Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, among other authorities, Malone, cited above, § 68; Leander, cited above, § 51; Huvig, cited above, § 29; and Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 94)."

As to the question whether an interference was “necessary in a democratic society” in pursuit of a legitimate aim, the Court has acknowledged that, when balancing the interest of the respondent State in protecting its national security through secret surveillance measures against the seriousness of the interference with an applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life, the national authorities enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in choosing the means for achieving the legitimate aim of protecting national security. However, this margin is subject to European supervision embracing both legislation and decisions applying it. In view of the risk that a system of secret surveillance set up to protect national security may undermine or even destroy democracy under the cloak of defending it, the Court must be satisfied that there are adequate and effective guarantees against abuse. The assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to authorise, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by national law. The Court has to determine whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the “interference” to what is “necessary in a democratic society” (see Klass and Others, cited above, §§ 49 - 50 and 59; Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 106; Kvasnica v.

Review and supervision of secret surveillance measures may come into play at three stages: when the surveillance is first ordered, while it is being carried out, or after it has been terminated. As regards the first two stages, the very nature and logic of secret surveillance dictate that not only the surveillance itself but also the accompanying review should be effected without the individual ’ s knowledge. Consequently, since the individual will necessarily be prevented from seeking an effective remedy of his own accord or from taking a direct part in any review proceedings, it is essential that the procedures established should themselves provide adequate and equivalent guarantees safeguarding his rights. In addition, the values of a democratic society must be followed as faithfully as possible in the supervisory procedures if the bounds of necessity, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2, are not to be exceeded. In a field where abuse is potentially so easy in individual cases and could have such harmful consequences for democratic society as a whole, it is in principle desirable to entrust supervisory control to a judge, judicial control offering the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and a proper procedure (see Klass and Others, cited above, §§ 55 - 56)."

Regrettably, the OSAA does not contain such a requirement ( ibid .).

Steps must be taken to ensure that only the amount of information needed by the recipient to perform his duties is disclosed, and no more.

It describes, in particular, the requirements for their secure storage and the conditions for their use as evidence in criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 58 - 64 above ).

The Court considers the six-month storage time-limit set out in Russian law for such data reasonable.

It must also ascertain whether the requested interception meets the requirement of “ necessity in a democratic society”, as provided by Article 8 § 2 of the Convention, including whether it is proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued, by verifying, for example, whether it is possible to achieve the aims by less restrictive means (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 51; Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, § § 79 - 80; Iordachi and Others, cited above, § 51; and Kennedy, cited above, §§ 31 - 32)."

The Court considers that the failure to disclose the relevant information to the courts deprives them of the power to assess whether there is a sufficient factual basis to suspect the person in respect of whom operational-search measures are requested of a criminal offence or of activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security (see, mutatis mutandis, Liu, cited above, §§ 59-63). The Court has earlier found that there are techniques that can be employed which both accommodate legitimate security concerns about the nature and sources of intelligence information and yet accord the individual a substantial measure of procedural justice (see, mutatis mutandis, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, § 131, Reports 1996 ‑ V )."

At the same time, the Court notes that the Constitutional Court has explained in its decisions that the burden of proof is on the requesting agency to show that interception is necessary and that the judge examining an interception request should verify the grounds for that measure and grant authorisation only if he is persuaded that interception is lawful, necessary and justified. The Constitutional Court has also held that the judicial decision authorising interception should contain reasons and refer to specific grounds for suspecting that a criminal offence has been committed, is being committed, or is being plotted or that activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security are being carried out, as well as that the person in respect of whom interception is requested is involved in these criminal or otherwise dangerous activities (see paragraphs 40 - 42 above).

Indeed, the materials submitted by the applicant show that the domestic courts do not always follow the above - mentioned recommendations of the Constitutional Court, all of which were contained in decisions rather than in judgments. Thus, it transpires from the analytical notes issued by District Courts that interception requests are often not accompanied by any supporting materials, that the judges of these District Courts never request the interception agency to submit such materials and that a mere reference to the existence of information about a criminal offence or activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security is considered to be sufficient for the authorisation to be granted. An interception request is rejected only if it is not signed by a competent person, contains no reference to the offence in connection with which interception is to be ordered, or concerns a criminal offence in respect of which interception is not permitted under domestic law ( see paragraph 193 above). Thus, the analytical notes issued by District Courts, taken together with the statistical information for the period from 2009 - 13 provided by the applicant (see paragraph 194 above), indicate that in their everyday practice Russian courts do not verify whether there is a “reasonable suspicion” against the person concerned and do not apply the “ necessity ” and “ proportionality ” test."

By contrast, the OSAA does not contain any requirements either with regard to the content of the request for interception or to the content of the interception authorisation. As a result, courts sometimes grant interception authorisations which do not mention a specific person or telephone number to be tapped, but authorise interception of all telephone communications in the area where a criminal offence has been committed. Some authorisations do not mention the duration for which interception is authorised (see paragraph 193 above). The Court considers that such authorisations, which are not clearly prohibited by the OSAA, grant a very wide discretion to the law ‑ enforcement authorities as to which communications to intercept, and for how long."

A judge must be informed of any such case within twenty-four hours from the commencement of the interception. If no judicial authorisation has been issued within forty-eight hours, the interception must be stopped immediately (see paragraph 35 above). The Court has already examined the “urgency” procedure provided for in Bulgarian law and found that it was compatible with the Convention ( see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, § § 16 and 82). However, in contrast to the Bulgarian provision, the Russian “ urgent procedure ” does not provide for sufficient safeguards to ensure that it is used sparingly and only in duly justified cases. Thus, although in the criminal sphere the OSAA limits recourse to the urgency procedure to cases where there exists an immediate danger that a serious or especially serious offence may be committed, it does not contain any such limitations in respect of secret surveillance in connection with events or activities endangering national, military, economic or ecological security. Domestic law does not limit the use of the urgency procedure to cases involving an immediate serious danger to national, military, economic or ecological security. It leaves the authorities an unlimited degree of discretion in determining in which situations it is justified to use the non-judicial urgent procedure, thereby creating possibilities for abusive recourse to it ( ibid. ). Furthermore, although Russian law requires that a judge be immediately informed of each instance of urgent interception, his power is limited to authorising the extension of the interception measure beyond forty-eight hours. He has no power to assess whether the use of the urgent procedure was justified or to decide whether the material obtained during the previous forty-eight hours is to be kept or destroyed (see, by contrast, Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, § 16).

Indeed, pursuant to Orders issued by the Ministry of Communications, in particular the addendums to Order no. 70, communications service providers must install equipment giving the law ‑ enforcement authorities direct access to all mobile-telephone communications of all users (see paragraphs 115 - 22 above). The communications service providers also have an obligation under Order no. 538 to create databases storing information about all subscribers, and the services provided to them, for three years; the secret services have direct remote access to those databases (see paragraphs 132 - 33 above ).

The prohibition on logging or recording interceptions set out in Russian law makes it impossible for the supervising authority to discover interceptions carried out without proper judicial authorisation.

Subsequent notification to each individual affected by a suspended measure might well jeopardise the long-term purpose that originally prompted the surveillance. Furthermore, such notification might serve to reveal the working methods and fields of operation of the intelligence services and even possibly to identify their agents. Therefore, the fact that persons concerned by secret surveillance measures are not subsequently notified once surveillance has ceased cannot by itself warrant the conclusion that the interference was not “necessary in a democratic society”, as it is the very absence of knowledge of surveillance which ensures the efficacy of the interference. As soon as notification can be carried out without jeopardising the purpose of the restriction after the termination of the surveillance measure, information should, however, be provided to the persons concerned (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 58, and Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 135).

The Court found that the provision in question ensured an effective notification mechanism which contributed to keeping the interference with the secrecy of telecommunications within the limits of what was necessary to achieve the legitimate aims pursued (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 58, and Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 136). In Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev and Dumitru Popescu, the Court found that the absence of a requirement to notify the subject of interception at any point was incompatible with the Convention, in that it deprived the interception subject of an opportunity to seek redress for unlawful interferences with his Article 8 rights and rendered the remedies available under the national law theoretical and illusory rather than practical and effective. The national law thus eschewed an important safeguard against the improper use of special means of surveillance (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, §§ 90 - 91, and Dumitru Popescu, cited above, § 77). By contrast, in Kennedy the absence of a requirement to notify the subject of interception at any point in time was compatible with the Convention, because in the United Kingdom any person who suspected that his communications were being or had been intercepted could apply to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, whose jurisdiction did not depend on notification to the interception subject that there had been an interception of his communications (see Kennedy, cited above, § 167)."

                "289. Turning now to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that in Russia persons whose communications have been intercepted are not notified of this fact at any point or under any circumstances. It follows that, unless criminal proceedings have been opened against the interception subject and the intercepted data have been used in evidence, or unless there has been a leak, the person concerned is unlikely ever to find out that his communications have been intercepted."

                "290. The Court takes note of the fact that a person who has somehow learned that his communications have been intercepted may request information about the corresponding data (see paragraph 81 above ). It is worth noting in this connection that in order to be entitled to lodge such a request the person must be in possession of the facts of the operational-search measures to which he was subjected. It follows that access to the information is conditional on the person ’ s ability to prove that his communications were intercepted. Furthermore, the interception subject is not entitled to obtain access to documents relating to interception of his communications; he is at best entitled to receive “information” about the collected data. Such information is provided only in very limited circumstances, namely if the person ’ s guilt has not been proved in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, that is, he has not been charged or the charges have been dropped on the ground that the alleged offence was not committed or that one or more elements of a criminal offence were missing. It is also significant that only information that does not contain State secrets may be disclosed to the interception subject and that under Russian law information about the facilities used in operational-search activities, the methods employed, the officials involved and the data collected constitutes a State secret ( see paragraph 52 above ). In view of the above features of Russian law, the possibility of obtaining information about interceptions appears to be ineffective."

Russian law provides that a person claiming that his rights have been or are being violated by a State official performing operational-search activities may complain to the official ’ s superior, a prosecutor or a court (see paragraph 83 above). The Court reiterates that a hierarchical appeal to a direct supervisor of the authority whose actions are being challenged does not meet the requisite standards of independence needed to constitute sufficient protection against the abuse of authority (see, for similar reasoning, Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, §§ 45-47, ECHR 2000 ‑ V; Dumitru Popescu, cited above, § 72; and Avanesyan, cited above, § 32 ). Prosecutors also lack independence and have a limited scope of review, as demonstrated above (see paragraphs 277 - 85 above). It remains to be ascertained whether a complaint to a court may be regarded as an effective remedy."

There are four judicial procedures which, according to the Government, may be used by a person wishing to complain of the interception of his communications: an appeal, a cassation appeal or a supervisory-review complaint against the judicial decision authorising interception of communications; a judicial - review complaint under Article 125 of the CCrP; a judicial - review complaint under the Judicial Review Act and Chapter 25 of the CCP; and a civil tort claim under Article 1069 of the Civil Code.

                "294. The first of the procedures invoked by the Government is an appeal, cassation appeal or supervisory-review complaint against the judicial decision authorising interception of communications. However, the Constitutional Court stated clearly that the interception subject had no right to appeal against the judicial decision authorising interception of his communications (see paragraph 40 above; see also Avanesyan, cited above, § 30 ). Domestic law is silent on the possibility of lodging a cassation appeal. Given that the Government did not submit any examples of domestic practice on examination of cassation appeals, the Court has serious doubts as to the existence of a right to lodge a cassation appeal against a judicial decision authorising interception of communications. At the same time, the interception subject is clearly entitled to lodge a supervisory - review complaint (see paragraph 43 above ). However, in order to lodge a supervisory - review complaint against the judicial decision authorising interception of communications, the person concerned had to be aware that such a decision existed. Although the Constitutional Court has held that it is not necessary to attach a copy of the contested judicial decision to the supervisory - review complaint ( ibid. ), it is difficult to imagine how a person can lodge such a complaint without having at least the minimum information about the decision he is challenging, such as its date and the court which has issued it. In the absence of notification of surveillance measures under Russian law, an individual would hardly ever be able to obtain that information unless it were to be disclosed in the context of criminal proceedings against him or there was some indiscretion which resulted in disclosure."

Further, a complaint under Article 125 of the CCrP may be lodged only by a participant to criminal proceedings while a pre-trial investigation is pending (see paragraphs 88 - 89 above ). This remedy is therefore available only to persons who have learned of the interception of their communications in the framework of criminal proceedings against them. It cannot be used by a person against whom no criminal proceedings have been brought following the interception of his communications and who does not know whether his communications were intercepted. It is also worth noting that the Government did not submit any judicial decisions examining a complaint under Article 125 of the CCrP concerning the interception of communications. They therefore failed to illustrate the practical effectiveness of the remedy invoked by them with examples from the case-law of the domestic courts (see, for similar reasoning, Rotaru, cited above, § 70, and Ananyev and Others, cited above, §§ 109 - 10)."

As regards the judicial - review complaint under the Judicial Review Act, Chapter 25 of the CCP and the new Code of Administrative Procedure and a civil tort claim under Article 1069 of the Civil Code, the burden of proof is on the claimant to show that the interception has taken place and that his rights were thereby breached (see paragraphs 85, 95 - 96 and 105 above ). In the absence of notification or some form of access to official documents relating to the interceptions, such a burden of proof is virtually impossible to satisfy. Indeed, the applicant ’ s judicial complaint was rejected by the domestic courts on the ground that he had failed to prove that his telephone communications had been intercepted (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). The Court notes that the Government submitted several judicial decisions taken under Chapter 25 of the CCP or Article 1069 of the Civil Code (see paragraphs 220 - 23 above). However, all of those decisions, with one exception, concern searches or seizures of documents or objects, that is, operational-search measures carried out with the knowledge of the person concerned. Only one judicial decision concerns interception of communications. In that case the intercept subject was able to discharge the burden of proof because she had learned of the interception of her communications in the course of criminal proceedings against her."

Further, the Court takes note of the Government ’ s argument that Russian law provides for criminal remedies for abuse of power, unauthorised collection or dissemination of information about a person ’ s private and family life and breach of citizens ’ right to privacy of communications. For the reasons set out in the preceding paragraphs these remedies are also available only to persons who are capable of submitting to the prosecuting authorities at least some factual information about the interception of their communications (see paragraph 24 above)."

                "298. The Court concludes from the above that the remedies referred to by the Government are available only to persons who are in possession of information about the interception of their communications. Their effectiveness is therefore undermined by the absence of a requirement to notify the subject of interception at any point, or an adequate possibility of requesting and obtaining information about interceptions from the authorities. Accordingly, the Court finds that Russian law does not provide for an effective judicial remedy against secret surveillance measures in cases where no criminal proceedings were brought against the interception subject. It is not the Court ’ s task in the present case to decide whether these remedies will be effective in cases where an individual learns about the interception of his communications in the course of criminal proceedings against him (see, however, Avanesyan, cited above, where some of these remedies were found to be ineffective in order to complain of an “inspection” of the applicant ’ s flat)."

Lastly, with respect to the remedies to challenge the alleged insufficiency of safeguards against abuse in Russian law before the Russian courts, the Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that such remedies are effective (see paragraphs 156 and 225 above). As regards the possibility of challenging the OSAA before the Constitutional Court, the Court observes that the Constitutional Court has examined the constitutionality of the OSAA on many occasions and found that it was compatible with the Constitution (see paragraphs 40 - 43, 50, 82 and 85 - 87 above). In such circumstances the Court finds it unlikely that a complaint by the applicant to the Constitutional Court, raising the same issues that have already been examined by it, would have any prospect of success. Nor is the Court convinced that a challenge of Order no. 70 before the Supreme Court or the lower courts would constitute an effective remedy. Indeed, the applicant did challenge Order no. 70 in the domestic proceedings. However, both the District and City Courts found that the applicant had no standing to challenge the Order because the equipment installed pursuant to it did not in itself interfere with the privacy of his communications (see paragraphs 10 ‑ 11 and 13 above). It is also significant that the Supreme Court found that Order no. 70 was technical rather than legal in nature (see paragraph 128 above)."

In view of the above considerations, the Court finds that Russian law does not provide for effective remedies to a person who suspects that he has been subjected to secret surveillance. By depriving the subject of interception of the effective possibility of challenging interceptions retrospectively, Russian law thus eschews an important safeguard against the improper use of secret surveillance measures."

                "302. The Court concludes that Russian legal provisions governing interceptions of communications do not provide for adequate and effective guarantees against arbitrariness and the risk of abuse which is inherent in any system of secret surveillance, and which is particularly high in a system where the secret services and the police have direct access, by technical means, to all mobile-telephone communications. In particular, the circumstances in which public authorities are empowered to resort to secret surveillance measures are not defined with sufficient clarity. Provisions on discontinuation of secret surveillance measures do not provide sufficient guarantees against arbitrary interference. Domestic law permits automatic storage of clearly irrelevant data and is not sufficiently clear as to the circumstances in which the intercept material will be stored and destroyed after the end of a trial. The authorisation procedures are not capable of ensuring that secret surveillance measures are ordered only when “necessary in a democratic society”. The supervision of interceptions, as it is currently organised, does not comply with the requirements of independence, powers and competence which are sufficient to exercise an effective and continuous control, public scrutiny and effectiveness in practice. The effectiveness of the remedies is undermined by the absence of notification at any point of interceptions, or adequate access to documents relating to interceptions."

The examples submitted by the applicant in the domestic proceedings ( see paragraph 12 above) and in the proceedings before the Court ( see paragraph 197 above) indicate the existence of arbitrary and abusive surveillance practices, which appear to be due to the inadequate safeguards provided by law (see, for similar reasoning, Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, § 92; and, by contrast, Klass and Others, cited above, § 59, and Kennedy, cited above, §§ 168 - 69)."
