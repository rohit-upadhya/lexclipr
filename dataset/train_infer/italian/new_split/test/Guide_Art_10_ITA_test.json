The Minister of Justice intervened and requested the applicant to retract the words “unclean person”. The Prosecutor-General reacted immediately: “There is no retraction, there are prosecution authorities. This is already a problem, this is already a crime”. The Minister insisted on the applicant apologising for the words “unclean person”. Thereupon the applicant said: “Alright, I apologise”.

Mr S. stated that it was difficult for him to say whether the applicant ’ s remark had changed the Supreme Judicial Council ’ s opinion of him. The other witness stated that sometimes the discussions in the Council were quite heated but that no one had ever used such words or made such remarks. Three other witnesses called by the prosecution failed to show up and the court struck them out of the evidence, holding that the circumstances of the case had been sufficiently elucidated through the testimony of the witnesses who had been questioned and through the written evidence.

The applicant ’ s words were objectively not rude, vulgar or insulting. He had simply exercised his right to voice what he thought about another person, in purely neutral terms.

It is not disputed ... that the accused ... said in respect of [Mr S.] ‘ For me he is not a clean person ’. The expression has an insulting character, because it dishonours [Mr S.]. It contains a disapproval of his ethical and moral qualities, which is irreconcilable with his being in charge of the budgetary funds of the judiciary. In this fashion the personality of [Mr S.] and his authority in front of the other members of the [Supreme Judicial Council] were disparaged. ‘ Not a clean person ’ has only one interpretation, that the person concerned has a tainted consciousness and lacks morality. Even if this is the [applicant ’ s] personal opinion about the qualities of [Mr S.], the remark was aimed at affecting the honour and the dignity of [Mr S.]. Criticism ..., especially when it comes to the public manifestations of persons who represent state institutions, has to be consistent with the rules of society, ethics and the common rules of decency and morality. These must not be trampled on under the pretence that the personal opinion about another is a matter of perception and [represents the exercise] of the constitutional right to freedom of expression... It is unconstitutional and criminal to criticise in an insulting form, as in the case at hand...",

By uttering words which were humiliating for the victim, [the applicant] completed the offence and the harmful consequences arose. The derogation of the victim ’ s reputation was irreversible.

The right to freedom of expression carries the duty, set out in Article 39 § 2 of the Constitution, not to exercise this right to the detriment of the reputation of another. The present case represents an abuse of this right, because the personal disproval of [Mr S.] which the [applicant] expressed publicly had a humiliating content.

Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly.",
                "(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the remarks held against the applicant and the context in which he made them. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Janowski v. Poland [GC], no. 25716/94, § 30, ECHR 1999 ‑ I, with further references )."
            ],

                "48. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that the victim of the insult was a high ‑ ranking official, the deputy Prosecutor ‑ General, who also dealt with budgetary matters in the judicial system. Therefore, while not limitless, the bounds of acceptable criticism geared toward him were wider than in relation to a private individual. It is true that he did not lay himself open to public scrutiny and needed to enjoy confidence in conditions free of undue perturbation when on duty (see Janowski, cited above, § 33; and, mutatis mutandis, Steur v. the Netherlands, no. 39657/98, §§ 40 and 41, ECHR 2003 ‑ XI ). However, the need to ensure that civil servants enjoy public confidence in such conditions can justify an interference with the freedom of expression only where there is a real threat in this respect. The applicant ’ s remark obviously did not pose such a threat and did not hinder Mr S. in the performance of his official duties (see, mutatis mutandis, Yankov v. Bulgaria, no. 39084/97, § 142, ECHR 2003 ‑ XII). In this connection, it should also be borne in mind that, unlike the situation obtaining in Janowski, where two municipal guards had been insulted in the street, while performing their policing duties, in front of numerous bystanders (see Janowski, cited above, § § 8 and 34 ), the applicant ’ s remark was made in front of a limited audience, at a meeting held behind closed doors. Thus, no press or other form of publicity was involved (see, mutatis mutandis, Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611/96, § 52 in limine, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; Yankov, cited above, §§ 139 and 141; and, as an example to the contrary, Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 79, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI ). The negative impact, if any, of the applicant ’ s words on Mr S. ’ s reputation was therefore quite limited."
            ],
            [
                "49. Moreover, in view of the applicant ’ s previous professional interactions with Mr S. (see paragraph 8 above), his opinion about the latter, expressed at a meeting at which the Supreme Judicial Council was dealing with budgetary issues, could be considered as forming, to a certain extent, part of a debate on a matter of general concern, which calls for enhanced protection under Article 10. It should also be noted that the applicant apparently uttered the remark formed on the basis of material which he offered to produce in corroboration (see paragraph 10 above)."
            ],
            [
                "50. Another factor on which the Court places particular reliance is that the applicant was not subjected to a civil or disciplinary sanction, but instead to a criminal one (see, as examples to the contrary, P. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11456/85, Commission decision of 13 March 1986, Decisions and Reports 46, p. 222; Meister v. Germany, no. 30549/96, Commission decision of 10 April 1997, unreported; Fuentes Bobo, cited above; De Diego Nafría, cited above; Vides Aizsardzības Klubs v. Latvia, no. 57829/00, 27 May 2004; and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, ECHR 2005 ‑ ... ). It is true that the possibility of recurring to criminal proceedings in order to protect a person ’ s reputation or pursue another legitimate aim under paragraph 2 of Article 10 cannot be seen as automatically contravening that provision, as in certain grave cases – for instance in the case of speech inciting to violence – that may prove to be a proportionate response. However, the assessment of the proportionality of an interference with the rights protected thereby will in many cases depend on whether the authorities could have resorted to means other than a criminal penalty, such as civil and disciplinary remedies (see Lehideux and Isorni v. France, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VII, p. 2886, § 51 in fine and p. 2887, § 57; and, mutatis mutandis, Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 115, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI ). The Court further notes that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were instituted on the insistence of Mr S. ’ s superior, the Prosecutor ‑ General, who reacted on the spot, characterising the applicant ’ s remark as a “crime” immediately after it had been uttered, and shortly after that instructing the Sofia City Prosecutor ’ s Office to open a preliminary inquiry against the applicant (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). Mr S. did not participate as a party to them and did not make a claim for non ‑ pecuniary damages against the applicant, as he could have done (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above; and also Fuentes Bobo, cited above, § 48 in fine ). In this connection, the Court notes that later the relevant provisions of the Bulgarian Criminal Code were amended and at present provide that insult is privately prosecutable in all cases without exception (see paragraph 30 above and, mutatis mutandis, Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre, cited above, § 115 in fine )."
            ],
            [
                "51. It should also be observed that the applicant ’ s remark, while liable to be construed as a serious moral reproach, was apparently made in the course of an oral exchange and not in writing, after careful consideration (see Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, § 48, 29 February 2000; and, as an example to the contrary, De Diego Nafría v. Spain, no. 46833/99, § 41, 14 March 2002 ). Against this background, the reaction of the Prosecutor-General – who was Mr S. ’ s hierarchical superior –, the resulting criminal proceedings against the applicant, and his conviction seem as a disproportionate response to the incident in issue. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the dominant position which those in power occupy makes it necessary for them to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified criticisms of their adversaries (see, mutatis mutandis, Castells v. Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, pp. 23 ‑ 24, § 46; and Ceylan v. Turkey [GC], no. 23556/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV ). The applicant ’ s resulting sentence – a fine and a public reprimand –, while being in the lower range of the possible penalties, was still a sentence under criminal law, registered in the applicant ’ s criminal record (see Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v. Austria, no. 39394/98, § 3 2, ECHR 2003 ‑ XI )."

Being in custody at the material time, he was not a fugitive from justice and the showing of his photograph could not have been necessary for enlisting public support to determine his whereabouts. Nor could it be said to have bolstered the public character of judicial proceedings because at the time of the recording and the first airing of the television show the trial had not yet begun. Accordingly, the Court finds that in the circumstances of the present case the release of the first applicant ’ s photograph from the criminal file to the press did not pursue any of the legitimate aims enumerated in paragraph 2 of Article 8."

On that day the applicants were scheduled to be transported to the correctional colony by train. The outside temperature was extremely low. As they were leaving the detention facility, prison officers handed them winter clothing, which they declined to put on. The train escort refused to take them in without warm clothes and the applicants were brought back to the detention facility.

In their original submissions the applicants claimed that it had been “torn and old” (see paragraph 40 above), whereas in their submissions on the merits they alleged that it had been too small because it had shrunk. However, the Court is not convinced by the latter claim because it appears peculiar that it transpired for the first time only at an advanced stage of proceedings. The Government, for their part, did not deny that the clothing had not been new, yet they maintained that it had been washed in compliance with hygiene requirements. In these circumstances, the Court concludes that the applicants were offered winter clothing which was used but clean."

Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 119, ECHR 2000-IV). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 162)."

Within that period the pre-trial investigation lasted for one year and three months and the trial at first instance continued from 31 July 2000 to 2 March 2001. The appeal proceedings had been preceded by a delay resulting from the Town Court ’ s failure to take certain procedural steps which were considered indispensable by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 34 above). Once those defects had been remedied, the appeals were heard in less than two months ’ time. The Court reiterates that the fact that the applicants were held in custody required particular diligence on the part of the courts dealing with the case to administer justice expeditiously (see Panchenko v.

The applicants did not identify further witnesses they wished to have examined or explain why it would have been useful to examine them in the circumstances of the case.

The showing of the front cover of the case file in the opening sequence of the television show demonstrated that it had been made physically available to the journalist. The show had been recorded before the case had been referred for trial; it had been extensively advertised with the sensationalist line “Slavery in Glazov at the end of the twentieth century” and aired at such times as to precede the adjourned trial hearings and the appeal hearing. Article 139 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure could not be interpreted as justifying an encroachment on the applicants ’ presumption of innocence. Their right to be presumed innocent until found guilty had been further damaged by the statements made by the journalist Ms Temeyeva, the prosecutor Mr Zinterekov, the investigator Mr Kurbatov and the prosecutor Mr Nikitin during the television show. In addition, the prosecution had also granted access to the case file to the journalist Ms M., the author of the article “The Land of Slaves”, which had also been highly prejudicial to the applicants.

The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 2, in its relevant aspect, is aimed at preventing the undermining of a fair criminal trial by prejudicial statements made in close connection with those proceedings. The presumption of innocence enshrined in paragraph 2 of Article 6 is one of the elements of the fair criminal trial that is required by paragraph 1 (see Allenet de Ribemont v. France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, § 35). It prohibits the premature expression by the tribunal itself of the opinion that the person “charged with a criminal offence” is guilty before he has been so proved according to law (see Minelli v. Switzerland, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62) but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, § 41; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, §§ 41 - 43, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; and Butkevičius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, § 49, ECHR 2002 ‑ II )."

It has been the Court ’ s consistent approach that the presumption of innocence will be violated if a judicial decision or a statement by a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved guilty according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Böhmer v. Germany, no. 37568/97, § § 54 and 56, 3 October 2002, and Nešťák v. Slovakia, no. 65559/01, § § 88 and 89, 27 February 2007 )."

Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court observes that a few days before the scheduled opening of the trial in the applicants ’ case, a State television channel broadcast a talk show, in which the investigator dealing with the applicants ’ case, the town prosecutor and the head of the particularly serious crimes division in the regional prosecutor ’ s office took part. The participants discussed the applicants ’ case in detail with some input from the show ’ s presenter and the alleged victim of their wrongdoings. Subsequently the show was aired again on two occasions during the trial and once more several days before the appeal hearing."

                "96. As regards the contents of the show, the Court notes that all three prosecution officials described the acts imputed to the applicants as a “crime” which had been committed by them (see their statements in paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 above). Their statements were not limited to describing the status of the pending proceedings or a “state of suspicion” against the applicants but represented as an established fact, without any qualification or reservation, their involvement in the commission of the offences, without even mentioning that they denied it. In addition, the town prosecutor Mr Zinterekov referred to the applicants ’ criminal record, portraying them as hardened criminals, and made a claim that the commission of the “crime” had been the result of their “personal qualities” – “cruelty and meaningless brutality”. In the closing statement he also mentioned that the only choice the trial court would have to make would be that of a sentence of an appropriate length, thus presenting the applicants ’ conviction as the only possible outcome of the judicial proceedings (see paragraph 18 above). The Court considers that those statements by the public officials amounted to a declaration of the applicants ’ guilt and prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority. Given that those officials held high positions in the town and regional prosecuting authorities, they should have exercised particular caution in their choice of words for describing pending criminal proceedings against the applicants. However, having regard to the contents of their statements as outlined above, the Court finds that some of their statements could not but have encouraged the public to believe the applicants guilty before they had been proved guilty according to law. Accordingly, the Court finds that there was a breach of the applicants ’ presumption of innocence. This finding makes it unnecessary to examine separately the applicants ’ grievance that the release of the case file to the journalists was also prejudicial to their presumption of innocence."

It also found a violation of Article 6 in a case where a Russian court refused leave to appear to an imprisoned applicant who had wished to make oral submissions on his claim that he had been ill-treated by the police. Despite the fact that the applicant in that case was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim had been largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been “an important part of the plaintiff ’ s presentation of the case and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings” (see Kovalev v.

In the present case the applicants ’ and their representative ’ s requests for leave to appear were denied precisely on the ground that the domestic law did not make provision for convicted persons to be brought from correctional colonies to the place where their civil claim was being heard. The Court reiterates that Article 6 of the Convention does not guarantee the right to personal presence before a civil court but rather a more general right to present one ’ s case effectively before the court and to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side. Article 6 § 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § § 59-60, ECHR 2005 ‑ II )."

Given the obvious difficulties involved in transporting convicted persons from one location to another, the Court can in principle accept that in cases where the claim is not based on the plaintiff ’ s personal experiences, as in the above-mentioned Kovalev case, representation of the detainee by an advocate would not be in breach of the principle of equality of arms."

Austria, no. 31457/96, § 58 et passim, ECHR 2000 ‑ I ). Even assuming that Article 139 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure could be a lawful basis for granting the press access to the case file, in the instant case the Court does not see any legitimate aim for the interference with the first applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life. Being in custody at the material time, he was not a fugitive from justice and the showing of his photograph could not have been necessary for enlisting public support to determine his whereabouts. Nor could it be said to have bolstered the public character of judicial proceedings because at the time of the recording and the first airing of the television show the trial had not yet begun. Accordingly, the Court finds that in the circumstances of the present case the release of the first applicant ’ s photograph from the criminal file to the press did not pursue any of the legitimate aims enumerated in paragraph 2 of Article 8."

Furthermore, at the time the investigator issued a charging order no civil claim had been brought in criminal proceedings and no one had been recognised as a civil claimant by a reasoned decision, as required by Article 137 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure. It follows that neither of the two grounds was applicable for making a charging order in respect of the third applicant ’ s vehicle. The deficient legal basis for the contested measure was identified by an inquiry carried out by the supervising prosecutor in response to the third applicant ’ s complaints (see paragraph 49 above). The prosecutor found, in particular, that the investigator had acted in breach of Article 175 of the Code, in that he had impounded the vehicle without legal grounds for doing so.

Since its creation in August 2007 and the public swearing in of several hundred new members in October 2007, the Hungarian Guard has organised numerous public rallies throughout the country, including in villages with large Roma populations; despite apparently innocuous articles of association, amongst the group’s chief messages is the defence of ethnic Hungarians against so-called “Gypsy crime”.

Black, 538 U.S. 343 (2003), in the context of cross burning (a traditional threatening activity of the Klu Klux Klan). According to this judgment, the burning of a cross is a “symbol of hate”, regardless of whether the message is a political one or also meant to intimidate. And while cross-burning sometimes carries no intimidating message, at other times the intimidating message is the only message conveyed. The protections afforded by the First Amendment are not absolute, and the government may regulate certain categories of expression, including the ban of a “true threat”. Intimidation, in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word, is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. The fact that cross-burning is a symbolic expression does not resolve the constitutional question. Sometimes the cross-burning is a statement of ideology, a symbol of group solidarity. The Supreme Court required effort to distinguish among these different types of cross-burnings and considered the contextual factors that were necessary to decide whether a particular cross-burning was intended to intimidate.

Under section 11(2) of the Assembly Act, the police were empowered to remove from the venue those who disturbed the assembly. In the course of securing an assembly, a police officer might, upon the well-founded suspicion of an administrative or criminal offence, apprehend the perpetrator; under section 142(2) b) of Act no.

In cases such as the present one, which require the right to freedom of assembly to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression and, allegedly, against the right of others to freedom of assembly, the Court considers that the outcome of its scrutiny should not, in theory, vary according to whether the case has been lodged by a “demonstrator” or a “counter-demonstrator”. Accordingly, the margin of appreciation afforded to the national authorities should in principle be the same in both cases. Where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court’s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts as long as an overall, optimal balance between the competing rights has been achieved (see, mutatis mutandis, Von Hannover v.

The Court would add that a demonstration may annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote. The participants must, however, be able to hold the demonstration without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents; such a fear would be liable to deter associations or other groups supporting common ideas or interests from openly expressing their opinions on highly controversial issues affecting the community.

Experience with past disorders is less relevant where the situation, as in the present case, allows the authorities to take preventive measures, such as police presence keeping the two assemblies apart and offering a sufficient degree of protection, even if there was a history of violence at similar events necessitating police intervention.

Assuming that the banner in question has multiple meanings – that is, it can be regarded both as a historical symbol and as a symbol reminiscent of the Arrow Cross regime – it is only by a careful examination of the context in which the offending expressions appear that one can draw a meaningful distinction between shocking and offensive expression which is protected by Article 10 and that which forfeits its right to tolerance in a democratic society (see Vajnai v. Hungary, no. 33629/06, § 53, ECHR–2008). The Court has already stated in the context of the display of the red star that it shares the Government’s view that the crucial issue in that case was whether or not the applicant’s conduct represented danger for society (see Vajnai (II) v.

The Court emphasises at this juncture that in the interpretation of the meaning of an expression, for the determination of the proportionality of a specific restrictive measure, the location and the timing of the display of a symbol or of other expressions with multiple meanings play an important role."

However, even assuming that some demonstrators may have considered the flag as offensive, shocking, or even “fascist”, for the Court, its mere display was not capable of disturbing public order or hampering the exercise of the demonstrators’ right to assemble as it was neither intimidating, nor capable of inciting to violence by instilling a deep-seated and irrational hatred against identifiable persons (see Sürek v.

It nevertheless considers that such sentiments, however understandable, cannot alone set the limits of freedom of expression.

The Court does not exclude that the display of a contextually ambiguous symbol at the specific site of mass murders may in certain circumstances express identification with the perpetrators of those crimes; it is for this reason that even otherwise protected expression is not equally permissible in all places and all times. In certain countries with a traumatic historical experience comparable to that of Hungary, a ban on demonstrations – to be held on a specific day of remembrance – which are offensive to the memory of the victims of totalitarianism who perished at a given site may be considered to represent a pressing social need. The need to protect the rights to honour of the murdered and the piety rights of their relatives may necessitate an interference with the right to freedom of expression, and it might be legitimate when the particular place and time of the otherwise protected expression unequivocally changes the meaning of a certain display. Similar considerations apply if the expression, because of its timing and place, amounts to the glorification of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide (see Garaudy v. France (dec.), no. 65831/01, ECHR 2003–IX (extracts)). Moreover, where the applicant expresses contempt for the victims of a totalitarian regime as such, this may amount – in application of Article 17 of the Convention – to an abuse of Convention rights (see Witzsch v.

In the present case, the Court observes that the impugned criminal charges were pressed by a company which undisputedly has a right to defend itself against defamatory allegations. In this context the Court accepts that, in addition to the public interest in open debate about business practices, there is a competing interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of companies, for the benefit of shareholders and employees, but also for the wider economic good. The State therefore enjoys a margin of appreciation as to the means it provides under domestic law to enable a company to challenge the truth, and limit the damage, of allegations which risk harming its reputation (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 94, ECHR 2005-II; Kuliś and Różycki v. Poland, no. 27209/03, § 35, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...). However, there is a difference between the commercial reputational interests of a company and the reputation of an individual concerning his or her social status. Whereas the latter might have repercussions on one’s dignity, for the Court interests of commercial reputation are devoid of that moral dimension.

The publication in question constituted a satirical denouncement of the company within the context of governmental economic policies and consumer attitudes (see paragraph 6 above). Taking the above facts into account, the Court finds that the applicant’s primary aim was to raise awareness about the disadvantages of State ownership rather than to denigrate the quality of the products of the company in the minds of the readers. The opinion was expressed with reference to government policies concerning the protection of national values and the role of private enterprise and foreign investment.

The Court observes at the outset that the first article published on 23 January 1997, which was titled “ B. broke up A.'s marriage ”, concerned A.'s marriage and his relationship with B. The article, which covered a whole double page spread, mainly concerned A.'s marriage, including also an interview with his wife. Various details about B.'s private life were also mentioned (see paragraph 8 above) as well as the incident of 4 December 1996 and the subsequent criminal proceedings and convictions of A. and B. The article also included pictures of A. and B. as well as of A.'s wife and children. Linked to this article there was a news clip which was entitled “B. danced samba without A.”. It contained only a few lines but B.'s name, together with her picture, and the fact that she had been convicted for having assaulted A.'s son were mentioned in the clip. Moreover, A. and B.'s pictures and statements concerning them were also published on the cover of the magazine. The fourth article, published on 13 March 1997, which was entitled “B. divorces her husband”, mentioned, alongside pictures of A. and B., her name, age, assignments, family relationships and her relationship with A. The article also described the incident of 4 December 1996, the subsequent criminal proceedings against A. and B., and their convictions.

Citing a convicted person's name in a newspaper had not traditionally been an offence in Finland until 2001 and 2002, when the Supreme Court had come to a different conclusion. However, it did not follow from either the provisions or the preparatory works that publication of a convicted person's name was a criminal offence and it had even been mentioned in the government bill ( HE 184/1999 ) that the general nature of Chapter 27, section 3 ( a ), of the Penal Code might be problematic from the point of view of the legality principle.

As to the requirement that measures be “prescribed by law” and in compliance with Article 7, the Government pointed out that the impugned measures had had a basis in Finnish law, namely in the Constitutional Act and, in particular, in Chapter 27, section 3 ( a ), of the Penal Code. B.'s name constituted information referred to in the latter provision, which had also separately mentioned a picture, and thus the provision had fulfilled the clarity requirement. At the relevant time the provision had been in force for more than 20 years and it had been interpreted by the Supreme Court, prior to the publication of the impugned article, in precedent cases KKO 1980 II 99 and KKO 1980 II 123. The rules on criminal liability could thus be regarded as having been gradually clarified through judicial interpretation in a manner which had been consistent with the essence of the offence. The liability therefore could have reasonably been foreseen."

Offences were not automatically issues of private life, a fact that had been confirmed by the Supreme Court's precedent in the case KKO 2005:136. As B. in the present case had been sentenced to a fine, this sentence had not as such reduced the protection of her privacy. This interpretation was also in line with the Court's case - law (see, for example, Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, § 99, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I, and P4 Radio Hele Norge ASA v. Norway (dec.), no. 76682/01, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI). The Government thus argued that the applicants must have been aware of the regulations concerning the freedom of expression. In any event, they could have sought legal advice before publishing the article.

Even though B. had been sentenced for an offence and the proceedings had been mainly public, it did not mean that the disclosure of B.'s name as such was lawful. Under Finnish law the fact that information was public did not automatically mean that it could be published.

Notwithstanding the incident of 4 December 1996 and B.'s subsequent sentence, the information published by the applicants had been of such a nature that it had been covered by the protection of B.'s private life. The events could have been reported without mentioning B. by name.

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may entail excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 49, Series A no. 30 and mutatis mutandis Kokkinakis v.

Even though there was no precise definition of private life in the preparatory works (see government bill HE 84/1974), they mentioned that the necessity of mentioning a person's name or other description enabling identification was always subject to careful consideration. Had the applicants had doubts about the exact scope of the provision in question they should have either sought advice about its contents or refrained from disclosing B.'s identity. Moreover, the applicants, who were professional journalists, could not claim to be ignorant of the content of the said provision since the Guidelines for Journalists and the practice of the Council for Mass Media, although not binding, provided even more strict rules than the Penal Code provision in question."

According to the Court's well-established case-law, freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individual's self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no “democratic society”. This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article 10 § 2, which must, however, be strictly construed. The need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, for example, Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, § 41, Series A no. 103, and Nilsen and Johnsen v.

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Janowski v.

In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the remarks made by the applicants and the context in which they made them. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were “relevant and sufficient” (see Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), cited above, § 62; Lingens, cited above, § 40; Barfod v.

In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Jersild v.

Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest (see Jersild, cited above, § 31; De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24 February 1997, § 37, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I; and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 58, ECHR 1999-III). Not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them (see, Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), cited above, § 65 ). In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, § 38, Series A no. 313, and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, loc. cit.)."

Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their words and deeds by journalists and the public at large, and they must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see, for example, Lingens v. Austria, cited above, § 42; Incal v. Turkey, 9 June 1998, § 54, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ IV; and Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, § 46, Series A no. 236 )."

The concept of private life covers personal information which individuals can legitimately expect should not be published without their consent and includes elements relating to a person's right to their image. The publication of a photograph thus falls within the scope of private life (see Von Hannover v. Germany, no. 59320/00, § § 50-53 and 59, ECHR 2004 ‑ VI )."

The Court thus found, in one case, that the use of certain terms in relation to an individual's private life was not “justified by considerations of public concern” and that those terms did not “[bear] on a matter of general importance” (see Tammer, cited above, § 68) and went on to hold that there had not been a violation of Article 10. In another case, however, the Court attached particular importance to the fact that the subject in question was a news item of “major public concern” and that the published photographs “did not disclose any details of [the] private life” of the person in question (see Krone Verlag GmbH & Co.

As to the reasoning, the Court notes that Article 6 § 1 obliges courts to give reasons for their decisions, but cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument (see Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands, 19 April 1994, § 61, Series A no. 288). In general, the reasoning in the District Court's and the Appeal Court's judgments in the present case is quite extensive. As far as the reasoning concerns the restrictions on freedom of expression, the courts stated in very detailed manner that the facts mentioned in the article were those to which the protection of private life typically applied, that B.'s position in society was not such that the exception for public figures applied to her, and that neither the incident nor the fact that her identity had been revealed earlier led to any other conclusion. Moreover, the Penal Code provision in question did not require any intent to harm to be shown. Therefore the Court finds that the reasoning is acceptable from the standpoint of the fairness requirements of Article 6."

The Court notes that the applicants had full access to the case file together with a reasoned judgment and were not impaired in the exercise of their appeal rights in the absence of any repercussions on fairness requirements.

The Court observes that the impugned joke included the applicant in a list of female hosts which, in the applicant ’ s view, mixed his gender with his sexual orientation (see paragraph 10 above). The Court reiterates that sexual orientation is a profound part of a person ’ s identity and that gender and sexual orientation are two distinctive and intimate characteristics. It notes, in this regard, cases which have been brought before the Court concerning gender identity revealing the intimate importance that one gives to it (see, among many other authorities, Grant v. the United Kingdom, no. 32570/03, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII; L. v. Lithuania, no. 27527/03, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV; P. v. Portugal (dec.), no. 56027/09, ECHR 2011); Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], no. 37359/09, ECHR 2014; and Y.Y. v. Turkey, no. 14793/08, ECHR 2015 (extracts) ).

In particular, in evaluating a claim under Article 8, the Court should be slow to conclude that mere speech can fall within the scope of the private life protections. Furthermore, where it concludes that Article 8 is nonetheless applicable, the subsequent balancing exercise should take into account not only the individual impact on Article 10 rights, but the wider impact on society of criminalising, or otherwise deterring, speech which is merely subjectively objectionable."

Referring to the case of Vereinigung Bildender Künstler v. Austria ( no. 68354/01, 25 January 2007 ), it submitted that satire is a form of artistic expression and social commentary and, by its inherent features of exaggeration and distortion of reality, naturally aims to provoke and agitate.

The Court reiterates that, although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private and family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private and family life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves. The boundary between the State ’ s positive and negative obligations under this provision does not lend itself to precise definition. The applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Von Hannover v. Germany, no. 59320/00, § 57, ECHR 2004 ‑ VI; and Pfeifer, cited above, § 37)."

Thus, the fact that an individual belongs to the category of public figures cannot in any way, even in the case of persons exercising official functions, authorise the media to violate the professional and ethical principles which must govern their actions, or legitimize intrusions into private life (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2), cited above, § 97, and more recently, Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France [GC], no. 40454/07, § 122, 10 November 2015 )."

Germany, cited above, § 58). Thus, in such cases the Court will need to balance the applicant ’ s right to “respect for his private life” against the public interest in protecting freedom of expression, bearing in mind that no hierarchical relationship exists between the rights guaranteed by the two Articles (see Timciuc v. Romania (dec.), no. 28999/03, § 144, 12 October 2010)."

Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society (see, amongst many authorities, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24, and Reinboth and Others v. Finland, no. 30865/08, § 74, 25 January 2011). This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article 10 § 2 which must, however, be strictly construed. The need for any restrictions must therefore be established convincingly (see, for example, Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 131, ECHR 2015 )."

At the outset, the Court notes that the alleged violation does not stem from a civil judgment on the merits or a judgment of a trial court, but from the refusal of the authorities to prosecute in a criminal case. The main issue in the present case is thus whether the State, in the context of its positive obligations under Article 8, achieved a fair balance between the applicant ’ s right to protection of his reputation, which is an element of his “private life”, and the other parties ’ right to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention (see Von Hannover, cited above, § 58 )."

Accordingly, any interference with an artist ’ s right to such expression must be examined with particular care (see Vereinigung Bildender Künstler v.

The Court further observes that in the judgment of Nikowitz and Verlagsgruppe News ( cited above ) it introduced the criterion of the reasonable reader when approaching issues relating to satirical material ( § § 24-26).

The Court then observes that in the cases in which it was confronted with a satiric form of expression, the artistic creations in question were made against a background of political critique and debate. For instance, in the case of Alves da Silva, it took into account the specific context of carnival festivities in Portugal in which citizens take the opportunity to, through satire and caricature, criticise politicians ( cited above, §§ 28-29 ). In the case of Welsh and Silva Canha, it took into account the content of the article written by the journalists – the misuse of public money  in a satirist newspaper. In this regard, the instant case is distinguishable from previous cases where the right to respect for private life had to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression, as the joke was not made in the context of a debate of public interest and, as such, no matters of public interest were at stake (see, for example, Axel Springer AG v.

As regards the applicants'position, the Court observes that the first three applicants are councillors on the Fgura Local Council and also authors of the article in question which had been written in reply to a previous article published by the Mayor of the Fgura locality (see paragraph 8 above). In this respect the Court recalls that while freedom of expression is important for everybody, it is especially so for elected representatives of the people. They represent the electorate, draw attention to their preoccupations and defend their interests. Accordingly, interferences with their freedom of expression call for the closest scrutiny on the part of the Court (see Castells v. Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, pp. 22-23, §, 42 ). The fourth applicant is the editor of the newspaper in which the article was published. According to the Court of Magistrates, he was aware of the controversy and had believed the comment to be justified; he had also granted the Local Council a right of reply. The Court reiterates that the press fulfils an essential function in a democratic society. Although it must not overstep certain bounds, particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I, § 37; and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 59, ECHR 1999 ‑ III ). This implies acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see Radio France and Others v.

Moreover, the limits of permissible criticism are wider still with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the Government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion (see Sener v. Turkey, no. 26680/95, § 40, 18 July 2000).

The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, p. 235, § 42, and Harlanova v.

The Court observes that the statement in issue consisted of two allegations: the Local Council ( i ) did not consult the public, and (ii) was ignoring public opinion on the matter. The first allegation is capable of various interpretations. It is true that even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for that statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (see De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, § 47, and Jerusalem, cited above § 43, ECHR 2001-II). However, in the present case, the factual basis may be found in the circumstance that the Local Council had rejected a motion presented by the applicants calling for the holding of a public consultation meeting about the HRP. The Court considers that the rejection of the applicants ’ motion provided a sufficient factual basis for the allegation that the Local Council had not consulted the public so as to allow that allegation to be construed as a value judgment. Moreover, political debate does not require unanimous agreement on the interpretation of particular words. Therefore, even assuming that it was not a value judgment, the interpretation given by the applicants is not manifestly unreasonable. The Court finds that the second allegation cannot but be classified as a value judgment, whose factual basis is indistinguishable from that above, notwithstanding the style used by the applicants which may have involved a certain degree of exaggeration. Furthermore, in the Court's view, nothing shows that the value judgments were not made in good faith."

This effect, which works to the detriment of society as a whole, is likewise a factor which goes to the proportionality of, and thus the justification for, the sanctions imposed on the applicants, who, as the Court has held above, were undeniably entitled to bring to the attention of the public the matter at issue (see, mutatis mutandis, Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 114, ECHR 2004-XI). The Government in their arguments relied on the relatively lenient nature of the sanction imposed by the domestic courts. However, the Court finds that the award of damages to the defendant constituted a reprimand for the exercise by the applicants of their right to freedom of expression. Notwithstanding the relatively low amount of damages awarded, the sanction imposed could be considered to have had a chilling effect on the exercise by the applicants of their right to freedom of expression as it was capable of discouraging them from making statements critical of the Local Council's policies in the future."

Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, ECHR 1999 ‑ I ), as it is not a court of appeal from these courts (see, among many other authorities, Cornelis v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 994/03, ECHR 2004 ‑ V (extracts) ). Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see García Ruiz, cited above, ibid. ). In addition, a requirement for defendants in defamation proceedings to prove to a reasonable standard that the allegations made by them were substantially true does not, as such, contravene the Convention (see McVicar v. the United Kingdom, no. 46311/99, § 87, ECHR 2002 ‑ III; and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 93, ECHR 2005 ‑ II )."

Therefore the expression ‘ credit millionaire ’ has a negative connotation and presupposes intolerance and extremely negative public attitudes. These are people who have prospered financially due to credits from financial institutions which they have failed to repay. In this sense, from a moral point of view these persons do not enjoy a good reputation and are perceived as dishonest. The law bans these persons from holding certain official posts.",

The fact that the first version of the article had a smaller circulation than the second, which also contained [Mr M.

In the instant case, it was established that [ the applicant] had not carried out the required comprehensive and thorough journalistic enquiry, as required by the rules of investigative journalism, that is, to receive confirmation from two independent sources.",

He should have therefore, according to best journalistic practice, been considered an unreliable source. This fact obliged [ the applicant] to duly check the information she had received through other, public and reliable, sources and not trust completely what she had heard in Parliament. The information received from [Mr N.] did not in fact constitute another dependable source of information. The latter relied on the publication of the Trud publishing house The Full List of Credit Millionaires, in whose preface [Mr M. D.] had been identified as a debtor through three of his companies – FBK Maxcom, Maxcom Holding and Maxcom OOD. [ The applicant] was therefore under the obligation to check whether [Mr M. D.] indeed owned shares in these companies, because the mere linking of his name to the companies in a publication was not enough to perceive the information as authentic. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the publication in issue gave the names of the companies, not of their shareholders, for which reason the statement in its preface was not confirmed by its contents. However, [ the applicant] did not take the requisite steps to verify the facts alleged by [Mr N.] and the publication ’ s preface. She merely established, after a check in the APIS information system, that [Mr M. D.] was a shareholder in the company Vitaplant [OOD], which also featured on the list of persons with outstanding credits. The company Vitaplant [OOD] was not, however, among the companies connected to [Mr M. D.] ’ s name in the publication ’ s preface, and that should have prompted [ the applicant] to double ‑ check her assumptions. However, [ the applicant] assumed that the link uncovered by her was sufficient to corroborate the statement that [Mr M. D.] was a credit millionaire. She thus failed to comply with her duty of thoroughly verifying the information through reliable, independent sources. [ The applicant] did not check whether the statement in the [publication ’ s] preface that [Mr M. D.] was connected to three debtor companies corresponded to the truth, which was mandatory. The fact that she works at a daily newspaper does not absolve her of the obligation to carry out thorough journalistic enquiries. She had access to information in the register of companies, which is public, in order to check the veracity of the information she had gathered. Not only did [ the applicant] not do that, but in her article she relied on a document with which she had not been duly acquainted – the official list of borrowers compiled by the [Bulgarian National Bank]. The statement in her article that the three companies – Maxcom Holding, Maxcom OOD and FBK Maxcom – were companies of [Mr M. D.] was not supported by due journalistic enquiry. Her source, [Mr N.], relied on the publication of Trud, which in fact means that [ the applicant] ’ s information was solely based on the preface of the list, which was not enough, considering that this information had not been verified either.",
                "The readers ’ right to be informed of so ‑ called ‘ hot news ’ does not absolve the article ’ s author from checking carefully the accuracy of her publication. The fact that [ the applicant] did not take the necessary steps in this direction confirms the court ’ s conclusion that her act was wilful. There must be a balance between the reader ’ s right to information and the rights of the persons affected by journalistic materials. The one responsible for this balance is the author, who must abide by the rules of investigative journalism. It is beyond doubt that the time and means available to a journalist on a daily newspaper for a proper enquiry concerning a current issue are greatly limited, but [ the applicant] was bound to do what was possible to verify the information she had gathered. In the case at hand [ the applicant] had enough time to consult the register of companies, so as to report on the rumours heard in the lobby of the Parliament building and at the same time to present the actual facts. It is precisely [ the applicant] ’ s passivity in respect of this second element which makes her act criminal. The lack of a full enquiry into the facts, performed with due journalistic care, and the applicant ’ s own statement that she did not carry out a full enquiry into Mr M. D. ’ s involvement in the companies mentioned in the article, allow [the court to conclude] that she was not confident that her allegations were true. On the contrary, the fact that [ the applicant] is an experienced journalist, maintains contacts with colleagues of hers from other media, with whom she exchanges information concerning such news, allows [the court to conclude] that she knew that information about outstanding credits of [Mr M. D.] had been published before. She was therefore aware that the two newspapers which had published similar articles had also published refutations, and had apologised to [Mr M. D.] for the untruthfulness of their allegations. [ The applicant] did not do all she was professionally bound to do in respect of the specific enquiry, which points to intent. She allowed herself to rely on sources which she had not checked, but which made her article look persuasive and objective.",

It is beyond doubt that the publication authored by [ the applicant] damaged [Mr M.D.] ’ s reputation and public esteem. He should therefore be compensated for that damage. At the same time it has not been proved beyond doubt that the article has affected [Mr M.

A journalist had the right to impart information received from others acting in their official capacity, which is how it was received in this case.

This fact was further evidenced by the judgment dismissing his tort action against Media Holding AD. The evidence presented merely proved that he was not on the list of “credit millionaires” as a physical person. It was therefore still possible that he could have been one through participation in certain companies, as she had tried to prove. The lower court ’ s findings in respect of, inter alia, Mr M. D. ’ s direct and indirect participation in the companies mentioned were likewise erroneous. The court had also incorrectly held that the applicant had acted recklessly. She personally, and also her colleagues, had made numerous checks through various sources, which had led them to believe, in good faith and in line with the rules of investigative journalism, that Mr M.

There is also no dispute about the [lower court] ’ s finding that the statement that a given person is a ‘ credit millionaire ’ because companies owned by him appear on the [Bulgarian National Bank] ’ s list of debtors with ‘ bad credits ’ is objectively vilifying for him or her. [ The applicant ’ s] defence raises legal arguments, which outline two disputed questions. The first is whether there is defamation where the facts set out in the publication are untrue, but the conclusion made on their basis is true on other grounds. The defence argues that [Mr M. D.] is in fact a ‘ credit millionaire ’, not on account of the companies cited in the publication, but because of [his involvement in ] another company – Vitaplant OOD. The second is whether an individual who owns a share in a company with outstanding credits can be deemed a ‘ credit millionaire ’. The view of [the court] on these questions is as follows:",
                "The expression ‘ credit millionaire ’ is not legally defined. It has entered the journalistic vernacular and is used in everyday speech to describe individuals who have acquired large amounts of money as a result of the use, by them personally or by physical or legal persons connected with them, of unsecured bank credits, which have remained unpaid and have been listed by the [Bulgarian National Bank] as unrecoverable. The expression is pejorative, because it implies that the people in question are supposedly responsible for the crisis in the banking system and the so ‑ called ‘ draining ’ of the banks – generally persons who have become rich in a criminal way. A list of ‘ credit millionaires ’ as an official document emanating from the [Bulgarian National Bank] has never existed. There exists a list of the persons with outstanding credits as of 1997, which has been compiled pursuant to the Information on Non ‑ Performing Credits Act [of 1997]. This Act requires the [reportable] credits to exceed 5,000 German marks – it does not concern only credits with seven or more figures. According to [the Act], the list is published in a special bulletin, which is not covered by bank secrecy and is sent to the Chief Prosecutor ’ s Office, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the tax and customs authorities and the National Assembly. After its receipt at the National Assembly on 21 January 1998 the list was made available to journalists and was published in full or in part as a list of the “credit millionaires”. In fact, the vilifying circumstance is not to own specific companies, but to be a ‘ credit millionaire ’. In the view of the [court], however, such a dissection of the statement in [ the applicant] ’ s publication and the application of paragraph 2 of Article 147 of the [Criminal Code of 1968 ] to one of the resulting parts cannot be made, for the following reasons. Readers are not bound to accept journalistic statements uncritically. An abundance of specifically alleged facts in support of those statements is key to persuading readers that they are truthful. Such facts in the case at hand are the citing of an official document featuring [Mr M. D.] ’ s name (untrue) and the citing of specific companies owned by [Mr M. D.] with specific debts (also untrue). There is no doubt that without these untrue allegations the statement that [Mr M. D.] is a credit millionaire would have been uncorroborated and unconvincing and its refutation would have presented no problem for him. It would be wrong to divide an averment containing a vilifying circumstance into two parts for a second reason: the damage to the reputation and the public esteem of a defamed person is not a constant value. The degree of that damage may vary significantly. In the instant case, where there is a statement that an individual is a ‘ credit millionaire ’ because of his involvement in companies which have received credits, the [court] considers that the greater the amount of the outstanding credits, the more numerous the companies having received them, the more direct the connection of the individual with these debtor companies, and, last but not least, the noisier the public scandal, the more vilifying is the statement. [Mr M. D.] would suffer a lesser degree of defamation if the amount of the outstanding credits was one and not twenty million levs, if the article had cited one unknown company instead of three companies which had become notorious because of their link with criminal investigations, and if [Mr M. D.] had not been indicated as [their] sole owner instead of merely a shareholder [ in them].",
                "Because of the meaning implied in the expression ‘ credit millionaire ’ the [court] considers that in the event of a credit taken by a company, an individual could be deemed as having profited therefrom, in the range of millions of levs, only if [his or her] connection with that company is direct, and not through the intermediary of participation in companies which in turn participate in other companies, and if the shareholding is big enough to allow a substantial amount of the credit to pass on to him. The link may likewise exist through participation in the management [of these companies]. At the time when the credit was received [Mr M. D.] did not participate directly in Vitaplant [OOD]. He was neither a manager of that company, nor a substantial shareholder. The credit itself was not in an amount which would make him a ‘ millionaire ’.",
                "The arguments relating to the existence of a civil judgment dismissing a tort action by Mr M. D. against Media Holding AD are irrelevant, as from the reasons of this judgment it is apparent that the action had not been supported by evidence of the non ‑ pecuniary damage sustained, whereas the civil courts are under no obligation to gather such evidence. This judgment is not binding on the criminal court.",
                "The arguments relating to the lack of mens rea are unfounded. The court considers that the [lower court] has correctly accepted as true [ the applicant] ’ s statements that she had verified the information from two independent sources – the Members of Parliament and [Mr N.], after which she had assured herself of its veracity from the existence of numerous prior publications in different newspapers. In spite of that, the defamation was committed recklessly. [ The applicant] has disregarded her duty to check the information she imparts with the only reliable source – the public register of companies – to which she had access. The opinion of the MPs was unofficial, as established by the testimony of [ the applicant] ’ s colleagues, whereas [Mr N.], not having his own information, referred [the applicant] to the publication of Trud. This leads to the conclusion that [ the applicant] was aware of the possibility that the vilifying information might not be accurate, but disregarded this concern in order to get her story to print as soon as possible.”"

D. ’ s reputation and had erred in holding that he had been defamed because of a simple mistake in the names of the companies through which he had featured on the bad debtors ’ list. The impugned publication had not materially influenced Mr M.D. ’ s standing in society. Its purpose had rather been to inform the public about the candidates for the post of deputy Minister of Finance. The availability of public information on this topic was more important than the fact that Mr M. D. was featured on the list through one rather than another company. The applicant ’ s error in that regard had been induced by the Members of Parliament who had tipped her off. The finding that the applicant ’ s statement had not corresponded to the truth had been erroneous, as the only part which had not been true had been the name of the company owned by Mr M. D., not the fact that he was a “credit millionaire”."

The Sofia City Court ’ s ruling that the applicant was bound to check her information in the register of companies was excessive. No such obligation existed and, moreover, such a verification would have been unfeasible, in view of the amount of time it would have consumed. The domestic courts had erred in not calling the Members of Parliament to whom the applicant had spoken. Their names had become apparent from the testimony of Ms N., the other journalist present in the National Assembly lobby on 3 August 2001. These MPs, one of whom was a business associate of Mr M. D., had in fact tricked the applicant into providing inaccurate information, with the aim of procuring a judgment saying that Mr M. D. was not a “credit millionaire” and thus concealing his involvement in Vitaplant OOD. The Sofia City Court had gathered evidence on Mr M. D. ’ s participation in Vitaplant OOD and had made findings in that respect. Mr M.

                "(a) The necessary ‑ in ‑ a ‑ democratic ‑ society test requires the Court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(b) The Court ’ s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic courts but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they have taken in accordance with their margin of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully or in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the comments held against the applicants and the context in which they made them.",
                "(c) In particular, the Court must determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the interference were relevant and sufficient and whether the measure taken was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities, basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts, applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10.",
                "(d) In assessing the proportionality of an interference, the Court has to make a distinction between statements of fact and value judgments in that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The classification of a statement as one of fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts."

The case therefore concerns in particular the freedom of the press. The Court has emphasised on numerous occasions the essential role played by the press in a democratic society. It has pointed out that, although the press must not overstep certain bounds, in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others, its duty is to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest, and that not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas, the public also has a right to receive them. The national authorities ’ margin of appreciation is thus circumscribed by the interest of a democratic society in enabling the press to play its vital role of “public watchdog” (see, as a recent authority, Radio France and Others v.

These “duties and responsibilities” are liable to assume significance when, as in the present case, there is a question of attacking the reputation of named individuals and undermining the “rights of others”. By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see, mutatis mutandis, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v.

D. ’ s candidacy for deputy Minister of Finance. It was couched in terms which suggested that the information provided by the applicant was directly based on the official list drawn up by the Bulgarian National Bank, not on other publications, such as that of Trud (see paragraph 14 above). It cannot therefore be said that the applicant was reporting what others had said and had simply omitted to distance herself from it ( see, mutatis mutandis, Radio France and Others, cited above, § 38; Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, § § 63 and 64, ECHR 2001 ‑ III; and Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, § 77). Having adopted the offending allegations as her own, she was liable for their truthfulness."

In view of the nature of that averment, that task was not unreasonable or impossible (see, by contrast, Thorgeir Thorgeirson, cited above, p. 28, § 65 in fine ).

D. featured on the Bulgarian National Bank ’ s list through the company Vitaplant OOD, not through the companies Maxcom Holding, FBK Maxcom and Maxcom OOD, cited in the article (see paragraphs 14, 25, 29 and 30 above). The Sofia City Court held that this did not render her statement non ‑ defamatory, because it was one thing to allege that an individual was a “credit millionaire” because of his indirect involvement in one company and quite another to say that he fully owned three companies which appeared on the bad debtors ’ list.

The Court must further examine whether the research done by the applicant before the publication of the untrue statement of fact was in good faith and complied with the ordinary journalistic obligation to verify a factual allegation. The Court ’ s case ‑ law is clear on the point that the more serious the allegation is, the more solid the factual basis should be (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, § 78 in fine ). The applicant ’ s allegation appears quite serious (see, mutatis mutandis, Thoma, cited above, § 57 ) and therefore required substantial justification, especially seeing that it was made in a popular and high ‑ circulation national daily newspaper (see paragraphs 5 and 18 above). The Court notes on this point that the domestic courts unequivocally found that the applicant had not sufficiently verified her information prior to its publication. These courts established that in her desire to get the news out quickly she had failed to consult trustworthy sources, preferring to rely on sources which could not, according to best journalistic practice, be deemed dependable (see paragraphs 26 and 30 above). The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion."

The Court notes on this point that the preface of Trud ’ s publication clearly did not amount to an official report. The applicant was accordingly not entitled to rely on it unconditionally, ( see, by contrast, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, §§ 66, 68, 71 and 72; and Colombani and Others, § 65, both cited above ). Nor could she unreservedly rely on the informal statements made by two Members of Parliament in the National Assembly lobby. That conclusion does not change even if the situation is examined as it presented itself to the applicant at the material time rather than with the benefit of hindsight ( see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § § 66 in fine and 72 ). The domestic courts, which specifically dealt with this point, found that, even if the “ time and means available to a journalist in a daily newspaper for a proper enquiry concerning a current issue [we] re greatly limited ”, the applicant had still not adequately verified the facts from reliable sources and had thus failed to comply with the customary rules of investigative journalism, publishing facts which she knew or ought to have known were dubious (see paragraphs 26 and 30 above).

It is also true that two days later the newspaper published Mr M. D. ’ s response (see paragraph 19 above). However, this response, while indicative of the newspaper ’ s willingness to rectify the situation, did not fully wipe out the damage inflicted on Mr M. D. ’ s reputation. In any event, these developments, which took place only after the newspaper and the applicant had been made aware of the defamatory nature of the allegations, do not show that the applicant was concerned with verifying their truth or reliability to a high standard before writing her article (see McVicar, cited above, § 86 )."

As to the need to perform a balancing exercise between the right to reputation and freedom of expression, the Court points out that the claimant in the defamation proceedings, Moscow City Council, is the executive body of the city of Moscow, a constituent entity of the Russian Federation. The Court reiterates that limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to a public authority than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of a body vested with executive powers must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion (see, mutatis mutandis, Şener v. Turkey, no. 26680/95, § 40, 18 July 2000, and Lombardo and Others, cited above, § 54 ). As the executive authority of a federal constituent entity, Moscow City Council should be expected to display a high degree of tolerance to criticism. Nevertheless, not only did the domestic courts fail to consider the position of the claimant as a public authority in the context of the defamation proceedings against the newspaper ’ s editorial board, they expressly rejected the defendant ’ s argument that Moscow City Council had not even been named in the impugned statements (see paragraph 12 above). The Court points out in this connection that for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the party suing in defamation is a requisite element (see, mutatis mutandis, Dyundin v. Russia, no. 37406/03, § 44, 14 October 2008, and Kunitsyna, cited above, § 42). The District Court ’ s reasoning, endorsed by the City Court, appears to be based on the tacit assumption that interests relating to the protection of reputation prevail over freedom of expression in all circumstances (see Novaya Gazeta and Milashina, cited above, § 69). By failing to weigh the two competing interests against each other, the domestic courts failed to perform the requisite balancing exercise (see Skudayeva, cited above, § 38)."

Statements contained in court decisions, decisions by investigating bodies, and other official documents amenable to appeal cannot be considered untruthful. Statements alleging that a person has broken the law, committed a dishonest act, behaved unethically or broken the rules of business etiquette tarnish that person ’ s honour, dignity and business reputation (section 7). Resolution no. 3 requires courts hearing defamation claims to distinguish between statements of fact, which can be checked for truthfulness, and value judgments, opinions and convictions, which are not actionable under Article 152 of the Civil Code since they are an expression of a defendant ’ s subjective opinion and views and cannot be checked for truthfulness (section 9).",

Under domestic law, the status of a third party to the proceedings that has not lodged independent claims regarding the object of a dispute is granted, where “the judgment may affect the third party ’ s rights and obligations vis ‑ à-vis the claimant or defendant” (see paragraph 17 above). By admitting the applicant to the defamation proceedings as a third party, the domestic courts tacitly accepted that his rights may have been affected by their outcome.

By giving an interview to Ms G., the applicant sought to “impart information and ideas” to a wider audience thus exercising his right to freedom of expression. He has claimed before the Court that the domestic courts ’ judgments ordering a retraction of his statements disseminated in the newspaper restricted the opportunities for sharing and spreading his published opinion regarding the restoration works (see paragraph 27 above). In the circumstances of the case, in particular the applicant ’ s position in the domestic proceedings, the Court is satisfied that the applicant has made out a prima facie case of interference with his freedom of expression (contrast Tavares de Almeida Fernandes and Almeida Fernandes v.

Turning to the Government ’ s objection that the applicant had not suffered a significant disadvantage, the Court notes that it has considered the rule contained in Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention to consist of three criteria. Firstly, has the applicant suffered a “significant disadvantage”? Secondly, does respect for human rights compel the Court to examine the case? Thirdly, has the case been duly considered by a domestic tribunal (see Smith v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 54357/15, § 44, 28 March 2017)?"

                "40. The first question of whether the applicant has suffered any “significant disadvantage” represents the main element. Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant ’ s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In other words, the absence of any “significant disadvantage” can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant. However, the applicant ’ s subjective perception cannot alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, with further references, C.P. v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ) no. 300/11, § 42, 6 September 2016). A violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest (see Korolev v.

Romania, no. 27329/06, § 56, 24 June 2014). In cases concerning freedom of expression the application of the admissibility criterion contained in Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention should take due account of the importance of this freedom and be subject to careful scrutiny by the Court. This scrutiny should encompass, among other things, such elements as contribution to a debate of general interest and whether a case involves the press or other news media (see, with further references, Sylka v.

As for the legitimate aim sought, the Government have referred to “the protection of the reputation and rights of Moscow City Council” (see paragraph 24 above). The Court points out in this connection that the issue of whether a legal entity could enjoy the right to reputation (including the scope of such right) is debatable (for details see Frisk and Jensen v. Denmark, no. 19657/12, §§ 42-50, 5 December 2017). Be that as it may, in the instant case, it is prepared to assume that this aim can be relied on. At the same time the Court considers it appropriate to emphasise that there is a difference between the reputational interests of a legal entity and the reputation of an individual as a member of society. Whereas the latter may have repercussions on one ’ s dignity, the former are devoid of that moral dimension (see, mutatis mutandis, Uj v. Hungary, no. 23954/10, § 22, 19 July 2011). This difference is even more salient when it is a public authority that invokes its right to reputation. In view of that, a mere institutional interest of the Moscow City Council in protecting its “reputation” does not necessarily attract the same level of guarantees as that accorded to “the protection of the reputation ... of others” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kharlamov v.

Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, § 166, 8 November 2016). The Court has already noted in paragraph 42 above that the matter on which the applicant commented was clearly of interest to the general public. Accordingly, and taking into account that the applicant ’ s statements appeared in the newspaper ’ s article, the Court considers that the following standards established in its case-law − which an interference with the exercise of press freedom must meet in order to satisfy the necessity requirement of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention − are pertinent in the present case."

Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 132, ECHR 2015), Article 10 of the Convention affords journalists protection, subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism (see Pentikäinen v. Finland [GC], no. 11882/10, § 90, ECHR 2015). The same considerations would apply to an NGO assuming a social watchdog function (see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság, cited above, § 159). A high level of protection of freedom of expression, with the authorities therefore having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation, is normally accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest (see Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 49, 29 March 2016). Politicians and civil servants acting in an official capacity are subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ III, and Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 80, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). A careful distinction needs to be drawn between facts and value judgments. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 98, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI, and Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 126, ECHR 2015). When examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of “protecting the reputation ... of others”, domestic authorities must strike a fair balance when protecting two conflicting values that are guaranteed by the Convention, namely, on the one hand, the right to freedom of expression protected by Article 10 and, on the other, the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8 (see, among many other authorities, Medžlis Islamske Zajednice Brčko and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], no. 17224/11, § 77, 27 June 2017). When analysing an interference with the right to freedom of expression, the Court must, inter alia, determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that these authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 196, ECHR 2015 (extracts))."

As to the need to perform a balancing exercise between the right to reputation and freedom of expression, the Court points out that the claimant in the defamation proceedings, Moscow City Council, is the executive body of the city of Moscow, a constituent entity of the Russian Federation. The Court reiterates that limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to a public authority than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of a body vested with executive powers must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion (see, mutatis mutandis, Şener v. Turkey, no. 26680/95, § 40, 18 July 2000, and Lombardo and Others, cited above, § 54 ). As the executive authority of a federal constituent entity, Moscow City Council should be expected to display a high degree of tolerance to criticism. Nevertheless, not only did the domestic courts fail to consider the position of the claimant as a public authority in the context of the defamation proceedings against the newspaper ’ s editorial board, they expressly rejected the defendant ’ s argument that Moscow City Council had not even been named in the impugned statements (see paragraph 12 above). The Court points out in this connection that for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the party suing in defamation is a requisite element (see, mutatis mutandis, Dyundin v. Russia, no. 37406/03, § 44, 14 October 2008, and Kunitsyna, cited above, § 42). The District Court ’ s reasoning, endorsed by the City Court, appears to be based on the tacit assumption that interests relating to the protection of reputation prevail over freedom of expression in all circumstances (see Novaya Gazeta and Milashina, cited above, § 69). By failing to weigh the two competing interests against each other, the domestic courts failed to perform the requisite balancing exercise (see Skudayeva, cited above, § 38)."

The Court is mindful of the fundamentally subsidiary role of the Convention system (see Dubská and Krejzová v. the Czech Republic [GC], nos. 28859/11 and 28473/12, § 175, ECHR 2016). Indeed, if the balancing exercise had been carried out by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court ’ s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for theirs (see Perinçek, cited above, § 198). However, in the absence of such a balancing exercise at national level, it is not incumbent on the Court to perform a full proportionality analysis. Faced with the domestic courts ’ failure to provide relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the interference in question, the Court finds that they cannot be said to have “applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 of the Convention” or to have “based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts” (see, with further references, Terentyev, cited above, § 24).

Another factor on which the Court places particular reliance is that the applicant was not subjected to a civil or disciplinary sanction, but instead to a criminal one (see, as examples to the contrary, P. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11456/85, Commission decision of 13 March 1986, Decisions and Reports 46, p. 222; Meister v. Germany, no. 30549/96, Commission decision of 10 April 1997, unreported; Fuentes Bobo, cited above; De Diego Nafría, cited above; Vides Aizsardzības Klubs v. Latvia, no. 57829/00, 27 May 2004; and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, ECHR 2005 ‑ ... ). It is true that the possibility of recurring to criminal proceedings in order to protect a person ’ s reputation or pursue another legitimate aim under paragraph 2 of Article 10 cannot be seen as automatically contravening that provision, as in certain grave cases – for instance in the case of speech inciting to violence – that may prove to be a proportionate response. However, the assessment of the proportionality of an interference with the rights protected thereby will in many cases depend on whether the authorities could have resorted to means other than a criminal penalty, such as civil and disciplinary remedies (see Lehideux and Isorni v. France, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VII, p. 2886, § 51 in fine and p. 2887, § 57; and, mutatis mutandis, Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v.

Mr S. did not participate as a party to them and did not make a claim for non ‑ pecuniary damages against the applicant, as he could have done (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above; and also Fuentes Bobo, cited above, § 48 in fine ). In this connection, the Court notes that later the relevant provisions of the Bulgarian Criminal Code were amended and at present provide that insult is privately prosecutable in all cases without exception (see paragraph 30 above and, mutatis mutandis, Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre, cited above, § 115 in fine )."

In this fashion the personality of [Mr S.] and his authority in front of the other members of the [Supreme Judicial Council] were disparaged. ‘ Not a clean person ’ has only one interpretation, that the person concerned has a tainted consciousness and lacks morality. Even if this is the [applicant ’ s] personal opinion about the qualities of [Mr S.], the remark was aimed at affecting the honour and the dignity of [Mr S.]. Criticism ..., especially when it comes to the public manifestations of persons who represent state institutions, has to be consistent with the rules of society, ethics and the common rules of decency and morality.

                "47. On this point, the Court starts by reiterating the relevant principles which emerge from its judgments:",
                "(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly.",
                "(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the remarks held against the applicant and the context in which he made them. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Janowski v. Poland [GC], no. 25716/94, § 30, ECHR 1999 ‑ I, with further references )."
            ],
            [
                "48. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that the victim of the insult was a high ‑ ranking official, the deputy Prosecutor ‑ General, who also dealt with budgetary matters in the judicial system. Therefore, while not limitless, the bounds of acceptable criticism geared toward him were wider than in relation to a private individual. It is true that he did not lay himself open to public scrutiny and needed to enjoy confidence in conditions free of undue perturbation when on duty (see Janowski, cited above, § 33; and, mutatis mutandis, Steur v. the Netherlands, no. 39657/98, §§ 40 and 41, ECHR 2003 ‑ XI ). However, the need to ensure that civil servants enjoy public confidence in such conditions can justify an interference with the freedom of expression only where there is a real threat in this respect. The applicant ’ s remark obviously did not pose such a threat and did not hinder Mr S. in the performance of his official duties (see, mutatis mutandis, Yankov v. Bulgaria, no. 39084/97, § 142, ECHR 2003 ‑ XII). In this connection, it should also be borne in mind that, unlike the situation obtaining in Janowski, where two municipal guards had been insulted in the street, while performing their policing duties, in front of numerous bystanders (see Janowski, cited above, § § 8 and 34 ), the applicant ’ s remark was made in front of a limited audience, at a meeting held behind closed doors. Thus, no press or other form of publicity was involved (see, mutatis mutandis, Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611/96, § 52 in limine, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; Yankov, cited above, §§ 139 and 141; and, as an example to the contrary, Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 79, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI ). The negative impact, if any, of the applicant ’ s words on Mr S. ’ s reputation was therefore quite limited."
            ],
            [
                "49. Moreover, in view of the applicant ’ s previous professional interactions with Mr S. (see paragraph 8 above), his opinion about the latter, expressed at a meeting at which the Supreme Judicial Council was dealing with budgetary issues, could be considered as forming, to a certain extent, part of a debate on a matter of general concern, which calls for enhanced protection under Article 10. It should also be noted that the applicant apparently uttered the remark formed on the basis of material which he offered to produce in corroboration (see paragraph 10 above)."
            ],
            [
                "50. Another factor on which the Court places particular reliance is that the applicant was not subjected to a civil or disciplinary sanction, but instead to a criminal one (see, as examples to the contrary, P. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11456/85, Commission decision of 13 March 1986, Decisions and Reports 46, p. 222; Meister v. Germany, no. 30549/96, Commission decision of 10 April 1997, unreported; Fuentes Bobo, cited above; De Diego Nafría, cited above; Vides Aizsardzības Klubs v. Latvia, no. 57829/00, 27 May 2004; and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, ECHR 2005 ‑ ... ). It is true that the possibility of recurring to criminal proceedings in order to protect a person ’ s reputation or pursue another legitimate aim under paragraph 2 of Article 10 cannot be seen as automatically contravening that provision, as in certain grave cases – for instance in the case of speech inciting to violence – that may prove to be a proportionate response. However, the assessment of the proportionality of an interference with the rights protected thereby will in many cases depend on whether the authorities could have resorted to means other than a criminal penalty, such as civil and disciplinary remedies (see Lehideux and Isorni v. France, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VII, p. 2886, § 51 in fine and p. 2887, § 57; and, mutatis mutandis, Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 115, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI ). The Court further notes that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were instituted on the insistence of Mr S. ’ s superior, the Prosecutor ‑ General, who reacted on the spot, characterising the applicant ’ s remark as a “crime” immediately after it had been uttered, and shortly after that instructing the Sofia City Prosecutor ’ s Office to open a preliminary inquiry against the applicant (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). Mr S. did not participate as a party to them and did not make a claim for non ‑ pecuniary damages against the applicant, as he could have done (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above; and also Fuentes Bobo, cited above, § 48 in fine ). In this connection, the Court notes that later the relevant provisions of the Bulgarian Criminal Code were amended and at present provide that insult is privately prosecutable in all cases without exception (see paragraph 30 above and, mutatis mutandis, Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre, cited above, § 115 in fine )."
            ],
            [
                "51. It should also be observed that the applicant ’ s remark, while liable to be construed as a serious moral reproach, was apparently made in the course of an oral exchange and not in writing, after careful consideration (see Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, § 48, 29 February 2000; and, as an example to the contrary, De Diego Nafría v. Spain, no. 46833/99, § 41, 14 March 2002 ). Against this background, the reaction of the Prosecutor-General – who was Mr S. ’ s hierarchical superior –, the resulting criminal proceedings against the applicant, and his conviction seem as a disproportionate response to the incident in issue. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the dominant position which those in power occupy makes it necessary for them to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified criticisms of their adversaries (see, mutatis mutandis, Castells v. Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, pp. 23 ‑ 24, § 46; and Ceylan v. Turkey [GC], no. 23556/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV ). The applicant ’ s resulting sentence – a fine and a public reprimand –, while being in the lower range of the possible penalties, was still a sentence under criminal law, registered in the applicant ’ s criminal record (see Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v.

The Court would observe in this connection that in view of the margin of appreciation left to Contracting States a criminal measure as a response to defamation cannot, as such, be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 59, ECHR 2007-..., Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, § 40, ECHR 2004-II and Rumyana Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 36207/03, § 68, 14 February 2008 ). Nevertheless, when a statement, whether qualified as defamatory or insulting by the domestic authorities, is made in the context of a public debate, the bringing of criminal proceedings against the maker of the statement entails the risk that a prison sentence might be imposed. In this connection, the Court recalls that the imposition of a prison sentence for a press offence will be compatible with journalists'freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been impaired, as for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v.

For the Court, similar considerations should apply to insults expressed in connection with a public debate. The Court would further observe that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in its Resolution 1577 (2007) urged those member States which still provide for prison sentences for defamation, even if they are not actually imposed, to abolish them without delay (Resolution Towards decriminalisation of defamation adopted on 4 October 2007)."

                "Excluding the headline and the caption, the article referred to in the indictment was drafted by [the first applicant]. It was written in the article, in a manner described in the indictment, that [X.] is transferred to do research work. This passage of the article was the basis of the headline, \"Child Ombudsman removed from office\" .",
                "It appears from the testimonies of witnesses [ I .], [ K. -T .], [ W .] and [ K .] that [X.] had not been transferred to a researcher post but that she had instead undertaken research work and had therefore been on 80 % research leave from 1 October to 31 December 1996.",
                "On 11 December 1996 Ilta-Sanomat published an article reporting on [X.'s] transfer to research work. The defendants have invoked this article, arguing that it and the article referred to in the indictment had no essential difference and that [X.] has not claimed rectification or filed a criminal complaint on account of the article in Ilta-Sanomat.",
                "The District Court holds that there is a relevant difference between reporting that a person will transfer or has transferred to other tasks and reporting that the person has been transferred to other tasks. The latter wording, which [the first applicant] has used in his article, is negative vis-à-vis a person, such is also the headline of the article, which is based on this wording and alleges [X .'s] removal from office. Such a wording suggests that the person in question has committed some misconduct in his or her work or performed it inappropriately and is therefore removed from office and transferred to other tasks due to his or her own fault. In [X .'s] case such a transfer did not take place, and the information given in the article was incorrect. This incorrect information disclosed in the article included a hint that [X. ], when performing her work, had been guilty of an act which warranted her transfer to other tasks. This incorrect information was conducive to causing damage to her performance in office and to her success. Furthermore, [X .'s] tasks were not changed at the turn of the years 1996-1997.",

                "It has appeared in the matter, also from [X.'s] testimony, that the information about the lack of research experience and training is not false as such. In a manner described in the indictment, this reference is connected to the allegation made in the article that [X.] had been transferred to research work. However, as the allegation of transfer has been found incorrect, the information about [X.'s] lack of research experience and training, truthful as such, has, in the manner described in the indictment, strengthened the erroneous impression given by the article that [X.] had been transferred to other tasks due to her own fault, and even to tasks for which she was unqualified in terms of training and experience. In the context in question, the information violated [X.'s] honour and strengthened the significance of the incorrect information disclosed in the article.",

The article contained incorrect information which was conducive to causing damage to [X.'s] performance in office and her success. [The first applicant], responsible for the text of the article, and [the second applicant], responsible for the text and the headline of the article, have not verified the information given in the article although it was easily verifiable from the Mannerheim League for Child Welfare, for example from Secretary General [I.]. The information about the transfer of [X. ] to research work has been the erroneous conclusion of [the first applicant], and the headline of the article, an aggravated expression highlighting the erroneous allegation, which has been created by the editorial staff on the basis of the said conclusion. ”"

                "18. The Court of Appeal's assessment of the evidence was the following:",
                "“ The Court of Appeal holds that no reason exists to assess the evidence presented in the case differently from the assessment made by the District Court regarding the incorrectness of the article published in Seura magazine. Thus, the article in issue was not truthful to the extent that it alleged that [X.] had been transferred to do research work. Likewise, the headline of the article and the caption under [X.'s] photograph, which were based on the said allegation, were untruthful. The Court of Appeal holds, in line with the District Court, that the article published in Ilta-Sanomat on 11 December 1996, which, according to [the first applicant] was the basis for his article, has not corresponded to the article published in Seura in respect of the parts in issue. According to the headline of the article in Ilta-Sanomat, [X.] has undertaken research work, and according to the text of the article itself, [X.] was transferring to research work. The article also stated that [X.] had agreed on the change to research work more than one year earlier, that [X.] had already started a special study in addition to her daily work as the Child Ombudsman and that the main emphasis of her work would be shifted onto research and that according to [ the Secretary General ], no replacement was needed for the Child Ombudsman. Although witness [ V .] had reported that when writing the article Ilta-Sanomat had thought that there were conflicts behind [X.'s] changeover to research work, the article in the newspaper cannot lead to the conclusion that [X. ] was transferred to research work for such reasons. Therefore, [the first applicant] could not have based his allegation about the transfer of [X. ] on the article in Ilta-Sanomat. The fact that witness [ V .] remembers having read about [X .'s] changeover in some little article in another news publication or in some press release already, is without significance in assessing the liability of [the first applicant]. Further, it has not been substantiated solely on the basis of the testimony of witness [ V .] that such a piece of news or press release even existed. Neither has it been clarified that the leaders of the Mannerheim League for Child Welfare were otherwise revising the job description of [X. ] as the Child Ombudsman in 1996. Therefore, it is to be considered that [the first applicant], by failing to verify the truthfulness of the allegation of transfer of [X. ] to research work, intentionally, against his better knowledge, made a false allegation, which may have subjected [X. ] to contempt or caused damage to her livelihood or success.",
                "[The first applicant] has submitted that he did not write the headline and the caption of the article in Seura. [The second applicant], too, has submitted that the headline and the caption were written by editorial staff, probably by a subeditor. However, [the second applicant] has admitted that he, as the editor-in-chief, was also responsible for the headline of the article, which the groundless allegation by [the first applicant] made possible.",
                "[The second applicant] has submitted in the Court of Appeal that he did not read the article by [the first applicant] in advance or discuss it with him. However, when questioned in the pre-trial investigation, he remembered the incidents better. [The second] applicant has reported in the police investigation on 30 April 1998 that he discussed the article and its truthfulness with [the first applicant] before it was published. No reason exists to doubt the reliability of the testimony given by [the second applicant] in the pre-trial investigation. It has thus been substantiated that [the second applicant] approved the publishing of the article. Therefore, the second applicant has intentionally published the false allegation described above.",
                "On the aforementioned grounds and otherwise on the grounds stated by the District Court, it has been substantiated that [the first and second applicants], are guilty of public defamation, against their better knowledge, committed through printed material under Chapter 27, section 1, of the Penal Code in force at the time of the offence, as imputed to them by the District Court. The act also fulfils the essential elements of defamation under the current Chapter 24, section 9, subsection 1, of the Penal Code. Since the offence was committed through mass media, and considering the circumstances mentioned by the District Court in the reasoning for its judgment and the fact that the article gives the picture that [X. ] had committed misconduct in work or performed it inappropriately and was therefore transferred to other tasks against her own will, the defamation is also to be considered aggravated when assessed as a whole. Since applying the new law will thus not lead to a more lenient result than the law in force at the time of the offence, the earlier Chapter 27, section 1, of the Penal Code is to be applied."

Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no “democratic society”. This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article 10 § 2, which must, however, be strictly construed. The need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, for example, Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, § 41, Series A no. 103, and Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, § 43, ECHR 1999-VIII)."

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Janowski v. Poland [GC], no. 25716/94, § 30, ECHR 1999-I)."

In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the remarks made by the applicants and the context in which they made them. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were “relevant and sufficient” (see Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 62, Series A no. 30; Lingens, cited above, § 40; Barfod v.

Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest (see Jersild, cited above, § 31; De Haes and Gijsels v.

Not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them (see, Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), cited above, § 65 ). In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v.

This obligation is highlighted in section 10 of the Guidelines for Journalists, which have been drafted by media professionals for the purposes of instilling within the profession a commitment to basic deontological rules including the pursuit of accuracy in reporting. While it is true that the applicants may have failed to verify sufficiently all of the information in the impugned article, the Court considers, however, that in the present case the applicants can mainly be blamed for misreporting. Moreover, the Court would observe that the domestic courts failed to weigh in the balance the competing interests involved, namely the interests of X. and the rights of the applicants, with the result that the applicants'right to publish the incriminated article was never addressed."

In addition all the applicants, together with the applicant company, were ordered to pay damages jointly and severally in a total amount of approximately EUR 8, 8 00 (including interest).

The Court would observe in this connection that in view of the margin of appreciation left to Contracting States a criminal measure as a response to defamation cannot, as such, be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 59, ECHR 2007-..., Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, § 40, ECHR 2004-II and Rumyana Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 36207/03, § 68, 14 February 2008 ). Nevertheless, when a statement, whether qualified as defamatory or insulting by the domestic authorities, is made in the context of a public debate, the bringing of criminal proceedings against the maker of the statement entails the risk that a prison sentence might be imposed. In this connection, the Court recalls that the imposition of a prison sentence for a press offence will be compatible with journalists'freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been impaired, as for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 115, ECHR 2004-XI; and Długołęcki v. Poland, no. 23806/03, § 47, 24 February 2009 ). For the Court, similar considerations should apply to insults expressed in connection with a public debate. The Court would further observe that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in its Resolution 1577 (2007) urged those member States which still provide for prison sentences for defamation, even if they are not actually imposed, to abolish them without delay (Resolution Towards decriminalisation of defamation adopted on 4 October 2007)."

A significant feature of the present case is that the applicant did not make the objectionable statements himself but assisted in their dissemination in his capacity of television journalist responsible for a news programme of Danmarks Radio (see paragraphs 9 to 11 above). In assessing whether his conviction and sentence were \"necessary\", the Court will therefore have regard to the principles established in its case-law relating to the role of the press (as summarised in for instance the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 29-30, para. 59).",
                "The Court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and that the safeguards to be afforded to the press are of particular importance (ibid.). Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, in the interest of \"the protection of the reputation or rights of others\", it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas of public interest. Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of \"public watchdog\" (ibid.). Although formulated primarily with regard to the print media, these principles doubtless apply also to the audiovisual media.",
                "In considering the \"duties and responsibilities\" of a journalist, the potential impact of the medium concerned is an important factor and it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media (see Purcell and Others v. Ireland, Commission ’ s admissibility decision of 16 April 1991, application no. 15404/89, Decisions and Reports (DR) 70, p. 262). The audiovisual media have means of conveying through images meanings which the print media are not able to impart.",
                "At the same time, the methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably, depending among other things on the media in question. It is not for this Court, nor for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists. In this context the Court recalls that Article 10 (art. 10) protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed (see the Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 25, para. 57).",
                "The Court will look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient and whether the means employed were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see the above-mentioned Observer and Guardian judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 59). In doing so the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities did apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 (art. 10) and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, for instance, the Schwabe v. Austria judgment of 28 August 1992, Series A no. 242-B, pp. 32-33, para. 29).",
                "The Court ’ s assessment will have regard to the manner in which the Greenjackets feature was prepared, its contents, the context in which it was broadcast and the purpose of the programme. Bearing in mind the obligations on States under the UN Convention and other international instruments to take effective measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination and to prevent and combat racist doctrines and practices (see paragraph 21 above), an important factor in the Court ’ s evaluation will be whether the item in question, when considered as a whole, appeared from an objective point of view to have had as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas."

On 31 May 1985 the newspaper Information published an article describing the racist attitudes of members of a group of young people, calling themselves \"the Greenjackets\" (\" grønjakkerne \"), at Østerbro in Copenhagen. In the light of this article, the editors of the Sunday News Magazine decided to produce a documentary on the Greenjackets. Subsequently the applicant contacted representatives of the group, inviting three of them together with Mr Per Axholt, a social worker employed at the local youth centre, to take part in a television interview. During the interview, which was conducted by the applicant, the three Greenjackets made abusive and derogatory remarks about immigrants and ethnic groups in Denmark. It lasted between five and six hours, of which between two and two and a half hours were video-recorded. Danmarks Radio paid the interviewees fees in accordance with its usual practice."

Some of the young people in this neighbourhood have already been involved in criminal activities and have already been convicted.",

                "(A) Is that why you hear stories about people from out here fighting with knives etc., night after night. Is the reason for this the fact that they are not afraid of the police getting hold of them?",
                "(G) Yes, nothing really comes of it, I mean, there are no bad consequences, so probably that ’ s why. For instance fights and stabbings and smashing up things ... If you really get into the joint it would be such a ridiculously small sentence, so it would be, I mean ... usually we are released the next day. Last time we caused some trouble over at the pub, they let us out the next morning. Nothing really comes of it. It doesn ’ t discourage us, but there were five of us, who just came out and then we had a celebration for the last guy, who came out yesterday, they probably don ’ t want to go in again for some time so they probably won ’ t commit big crimes again.",

Firstly, because she is a girl, statistics show that the risk is not that high, I mean they probably don ’ t do it, but you don ’ t have to be a criminal because you live in an environment with a high crime rate. I just wouldn ’ t accept it, if she was mugging old women and stealing their handbags.",

                "(G) That would be okay. I wouldn ’ t have anything against that.",

He argued that the conduct of the applicant and Mr Jensen could in no way be compared to that of the other three defendants, with whose views they did not sympathise. They sought merely to provide a realistic picture of a social problem; in fact the programme only provoked resentment and aroused pity in respect of the three other defendants, who had exposed themselves to ridicule on their own terms. Accordingly, it was by no means the intention of Danmarks Radio to persuade others to subscribe to the same views as the Greenjackets, rather the contrary. Under the relevant law a distinction had to be drawn between the persons who made the statements and the programme editors, the latter enjoying a special freedom of expression. Having at that time a broadcasting monopoly, Danmarks Radio was under a duty to impart all opinions of public interest in a manner that reflected the speaker ’ s way of expressing himself. The public also had an interest in being informed of notoriously bad social attitudes, even those which were unpleasant.

The object of the programme had been to demonstrate the attitude of the Greenjackets to the racism at Østerbro, previously mentioned in the article in Information, and to show their social background. Accordingly, so the City Court held, the applicant had himself taken the initiative of making the television programme and, further, he had been well aware in advance that discriminatory statements of a racist nature were likely to be made during the interview. The interview had lasted several hours, during which beer, partly paid for by Danmarks Radio, was consumed. In this connection the applicant had encouraged the Greenjackets to express their racist views, which, in so far as they were broadcast on television, in itself constituted a breach of Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code. The statements were broadcast without any counterbalancing comments, after the recordings had been edited by the applicant. He was accordingly guilty of aiding and abetting the violation of Article 266 (b).",

In view of the nature of these views, any counterbalancing during or immediately before or after would not have served a useful purpose. Although it concerned a relatively small group of people holding extreme views, the programme had a fair degree of news and information value.

Their news or information value was not such as to justify their dissemination and therefore did not warrant acquitting the defendants.

According to the applicant, such a balance was envisaged in a clause contained in Article 4 of the UN Convention to the effect that \"due regard\" should be had to \"the principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights ... in Article 5 of [the UN] Convention\". The clause had been introduced at the drafting stage because of concern among a number of States that the requirement in Article 4 (a) that \"[States Parties] shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred\" was too sweeping and could give rise to difficulties with regard to other human rights, in particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression. In the applicant ’ s further submission, this explained why the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, when urging member States to ratify the UN Convention, had proposed that they add an interpretative statement to their instrument of ratification, which would, inter alia, stress that respect was also due for the rights laid down in the European Convention (Resolution (68) 30 adopted by the Ministers ’ Deputies on 31 October 1968).",

The overall impression of the programme was that it sought to draw public attention to a matter of great public concern, namely racism and xenophobia. The applicant had deliberately included the offensive statements in the programme, not with the intention of disseminating racist opinions, but in order to counter them through exposure. The applicant pointed out that he tried to show, analyse and explain to his viewers a new phenomenon in Denmark at the time, that of violent racism practised by inarticulate and socially disadvantaged youths. Joined by the Commission, he considered that the broadcast could not have had any significant detrimental effects on the \"reputation or rights of others\".

The Government contended that the applicant had edited the Greenjackets item in a sensationalist rather than informative manner and that its news or information value was minimal. Television was a powerful medium and a majority of Danes normally viewed the news programme in which the item was broadcast. Yet the applicant, knowing that they would incur criminal liability, had encouraged the Greenjackets to make racist statements and had failed to counter these statements in the programme. It was too subtle to assume that viewers would not take the remarks at their face value. No weight could be attached to the fact that the programme had given rise to only a few complaints, since, due to lack of information and insufficient knowledge of the Danish language and even fear of reprisals by violent racists, victims of the insulting comments were likely to be dissuaded from complaining. The applicant had thus failed to fulfil the \"duties and responsibilities\" incumbent on him as a television journalist. The fine imposed upon him was at the lower end of the scale of sanctions applicable to Article 266 (b) offences and was therefore not likely to deter any journalist from contributing to public discussion on racism and xenophobia; it only had the effect of a public reminder that racist expressions are to be taken seriously and cannot be tolerated.",

Nevertheless, the issue was already then of general importance, as is illustrated for instance by the fact that the UN Convention dates from 1965. Consequently, the object and purpose pursued by the UN Convention are of great weight in determining whether the applicant ’ s conviction, which - as the Government have stressed - was based on a provision enacted in order to ensure Denmark ’ s compliance with the UN Convention, was \"necessary\" within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).",

Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them.

Ireland, Commission ’ s admissibility decision of 16 April 1991, application no. 15404/89, Decisions and Reports (DR) 70, p. 262).

In doing so the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities did apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 (art. 10) and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, for instance, the Schwabe v.

                "The Court is not convinced by the argument, also stressed by the national courts (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above), that the Greenjackets item was presented without any attempt to counterbalance the extremist views expressed. Both the TV presenter ’ s introduction and the applicant ’ s conduct during the interviews clearly dissociated him from the persons interviewed, for example by describing them as members of \"a group of extremist youths\" who supported the Ku Klux Klan and by referring to the criminal records of some of them. The applicant also rebutted some of the racist statements for instance by recalling that there were black people who had important jobs. It should finally not be forgotten that, taken as a whole, the filmed portrait surely conveyed the meaning that the racist statements were part of a generally anti-social attitude of the Greenjackets.",
                "Admittedly, the item did not explicitly recall the immorality, dangers and unlawfulness of the promotion of racial hatred and of ideas of superiority of one race.

The punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so. In this regard the Court does not accept the Government ’ s argument that the limited nature of the fine is relevant; what matters is that the journalist was convicted.",

Austria, 26 April 1995, § 38, Series A no. 313, and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § 59). By reason of the “duties and responsibilities”, which are inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, § 65, cited above, and Alithia Publishing Company Ltd and Constantinides v. Cyprus, no. 17550/03, § 65, 22 May 2008). The methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably, depending among other things on the media in question; it is not for the Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted by journalists (see Jersild, cited above, § 31). In considering the “duties and responsibilities” of a journalist, the potential impact of the medium concerned is an important factor; audiovisual media often have a much more immediate and powerful effect than print media (see Purcell and Others v. Ireland, no. 15404/89, Commission decision of 16 April 1991, Decisions and Reports 70). For instance, the Court noted the differences between a portal operator and a traditional publisher and a certain development in favour of distinguishing between the legal principles regulating the activities of the traditional print and audiovisual media on the one hand and Internet-based media operations on the other (see Delfi AS v.

Both articles were critical of Mr Stroyev, the then governor of the Orel Region and the former Chairman of the Federation Council (the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament). Governor Stroyev was a candidate at those elections: he was no. 1 on the regional list of United Russia ( Единая Россия ), a political party aligned with President Putin and dominant in the State Duma. The Communist Party was one of the main opposition parties at those elections."

                "9. The first article was entitled ‘ Hatred, Stroyev style ’. It can be summarised as follows. It described Governor Stroyev as a person consumed by hatred towards people who oppose him. The journalist referred to the decision of the governor to wind up a publicly owned newspaper, Gorod Orel. According to journalist O., that decision was a direct consequence of a conflict between Mr Stroyev and the newspaper ’ s former editor-in-chief who kept criticising Stroyev ’ s policies. The speaker of the municipal council, who was politically weak owing to a corruption scandal involving municipal land, was unable to oppose the decision of the governor to close the newspaper. Most of the regional journalists under Stroyev became servile; those few who, like the editor-in-chief of Gorod Orel, remained independent and refused to flatter Mr Stroyev, were subjected to pressure and fell victim to Mr Stroyev ’ s hatred. The article then turned to the story of two deputies of the regional legislature. They were elected as members of the Communist Party and were originally in opposition to Mr Stroyev, but later they both became members of United Russia. One of them was a businessman. The author suspected that the first deputy had changed political sides because of very serious pressure exerted by the Stroyev administration on local businessmen. The second deputy was a history professor. The article suggested that his decision to leave the Communist Party was also forced. The journalist ironically supposed that in fact Mr Stroyev did not want United Russia to win the elections, since he was doing everything to make the electorate angry with the ruling party. In 2006 the town population voted in large numbers for the Communist Party, which was in fact a vote of disapproval of Mr Stroyev ’ s policies. However, the journalist supposed that Mr Stroyev ’ s personal interests always prevailed over those of the United Russia party. The town mayor tried to protect himself by joining United Russia, but this was a weak defence against Mr Stroyev ’ s hatred. The only people Mr Stroyev loved and defended were his own relatives and protégés. The article cited the example of Mr Stroyev ’ s nephew, a businessman suspected of abuse of public funds and fraud. His case was still pending; the article suggested that regional law-enforcement agencies being discouraged from pursuing the investigation actively. The article then turned to the dismissal of the head of the regional public Audit Chamber, who reported on abuses of funds allocated for road maintenance. The newly appointed head of the Audit Chamber, who was Mr Stroyev ’ s man, came to the opposite conclusion, namely that the manipulation of the road funds had been perfectly in order. Nevertheless, the money had been spent; as a result, the federal authorities had had to allocate additional funds for road maintenance in the Orel Region. Mr Stroyev tried to get credit for that funding, but it was not United Russia ’ s money that had been used, as they claimed, but taxpayers ’ money. In the opinion of the author, by trying to present the whole situation as his personal achievement Mr Stroyev was making a fool of President Putin and of the population of the Orel Region.",
                "The article had a long post-scriptum. It cited the European Court ’ s findings in the case of Chemodurov v. Russia ( no. 72683/01, judgment of 31 July 2007). That case concerned a defamation claim lodged by a governor of another Russian region against a journalist of a local newspaper. The case ended with a finding of a violation of Article 10 of the Convention by the Court. The author alluded to similarities between her criticism of Mr Stroyev ’ s policies and the situation in the Chemodurov case."

                "10. The second article was entitled ‘ Stroyev sues people : people sue Stroyev ’. It also concerned several topics. It opened with the statement that the electorate of Orel Region did not trust the authorities and at the 2006 and 2007 elections preferred to support the Communist Party. Next, it touched upon the story of Ms Ch., a former forest inspector who was dismissed from her job as a result of a reorganisation of the forestry authority. Forty-two other workers of the forest authority also lost their jobs. The article alleged that the reform of the forest authorities was initiated by Governor Stroyev in breach of federal legislation. It suggested that the reform was driven by the need to facilitate industrial tree-cutting. Ms Ch. sued the regional authorities, and at the relevant time the proceedings were pending. However, in the opinion of the journalist, there was little hope for impartiality on the part of the regional courts. The article then turned to the case of Ms G., who had made statements critical of the governor during a public rally and had been prosecuted for slander. The article then analysed recent public statements of the governor, who had criticised the policy lines of former President Yeltsin, whereas he himself during that period had been Chairman of the Federation Council, and therefore the second most important statesman in the country. According to the journalist, the proceedings in the case of Mr G. were adjourned, probably because Governor Stroyev wanted to avoid a scandal before the date of elections. The article closed with the suggestion that President Putin should not have associated himself such controversial figures as Governor Stroyev."

Free elections also require protection of the right to information and the freedom to express opinions. Therefore, the legislator must protect citizens ’ rights to receive and disseminate information about elections, while striking a balance between two constitutional values, namely the right to free elections and freedom of information and expression, avoiding inequality and disproportionate restrictions.",
                "- Mass media outlets carry out a social function consisting in information support for elections, and should accompany the free expression of the citizens ’ choice and transparent elections. The exercise of the freedom of mass information is accompanied by particular duties and a particular responsibility on the part of mass media outlets. Thus, while acting on the basis of editorial independence and the rules of self-regulation, the representatives of the mass media outlets must take ethical and balanced stances and cover election campaigns in a fair, balanced and impartial manner. Distinguishing between two elements of information support for elections (namely “ information” and “campaigning”) the Electoral Rights Act is intended to exclude representatives of mass media outlets from “campaigning” activities. This distinction is aimed at securing open elections and at ensuring the process of formation ( формирование ) of the free expression of the citizens ’ choice. Unlike “information”, “campaigning” is not subject to the requirement of objectivity.",

                "- Restrictions or limitations on the freedom of mass information must be necessary and proportionate to the constitutionally recognised aims. Where constitutional rules allow such restrictions, the regulation should not impinge upon the very essence of the right or freedom being restricted, and should not empty it of its real content; the State should not use excessive measures; the regulatory legislation should be clear and precise, without room for extensive interpretation of the allowable restrictions and arbitrary application.",
                "- All the above corresponds to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in relation to the scope of the freedom of expression and right to information in the context of elections ( Bowman v. the United Kingdom, 19 February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I ).",
                "- Both “campaigning” and “ information ” may induce the electorate to vote in favour of one choice or another. The only criterion for distinguishing between them is the presence of a special goal inherent in “campaigning ”, that is to induce voters to vote in one specific direction and to provide support, whether that is for or against a candidate. If this were not so the line between “information” and “campaigning” would be blurred to the extent that all information disseminated in this period would be classified as “campaigning”. In view of the prohibition on mass media outlets ’ “campaigning ”, this would entail unlawful restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of information, while also breaching the principles of free and open elections.",
                "- As such, the expression of a positive or negative opinion about a candidate does not amount to “campaigning”, and thus cannot entail administrative offence liability on the part of the mass media outlet.

Thus, expression of a preference by a representative of a mass media outlet cannot be classified as an offence in the absence of a campaigning purpose.",
                "- The relevant provisions of the Act did not permit an extensive interpretation of the notion of “pre-election campaigning ” in so far as the ban concerns the professional activities of mass media.

Judge Gadzhiyev expressed a separate opinion, noting that in Bowman v. the United Kingdom (cited above) the European Court assessed the freedom of expression in the light of the right to free elections, which means that neither has priority over the other. This is the only kind of approach which makes it possible to seek a balance between these equally valued fundamental rights. The exercise of one right creates “ inherent boundaries” for the other right. Having regard to Article 15 of the Russian Constitution, which defines Russia ’ s international treaties as “an integral part of its legal system”, the choice between the relevant legitimate aims may be used to set limits on a protected right, in line with the European Convention. Given the aims listed in Article 10 of the European Convention, only some of the aims listed in Article 55 of the Russian Constitution may be referred to when limits are set on the freedom to express opinions."

While upholding the majority ’ s restrictive interpretation and application of the “campaigning” regulations, the judge noted that some provisions of the Electoral Rights Act could not but be assessed as absurd and utterly lacking reasonable grounds. All possible and justified restrictions on the freedom of the mass media are listed in section 4 of the Mass Media Act. There is no reason to treat an electoral campaign as an emergency situation that would justify wider limitations on rights and freedoms. Quite to the contrary, the voters ’ need to receive and disseminate information, to express opinions, and to know about views held in society are greater during an election campaign. Print, broadcast and other media serve as a necessary means of exercising the right to free choice, without losing their autonomous and independent role in society. Freedom to express opinions should be given a wider possible interpretation. In 1999 the Constitutional Court of Slovakia declared a similar statute unconstitutional, dismissing the argument justifying the restriction in the interest of free competition among political actors. That court held that, democracy not being a form of government instituted exclusively for the sake of political parties, denial of fundamental rights and freedoms for the benefit of parties equals denial of democracy."

Judge Kononov concluded that there were no compelling reasons for opposing freedom of expression and freedom of choice, and thus no justification for putting in place special limitations on the mass media during an election period. Before the Constitutional Court the Russian authorities referred to the need to counter “black PR”, or negative paid-for publications, rather than to the need to ensure free choice for voters. One of the Election Commission officials admitted that if there had been an efficient mechanism to supervise payment for publications there would have been no need to create restrictions on the wording of “campaigning” by the mass media. In Judge Kononov ’ s view, the issue of paid -for publications should have been resolved by other, more appropriate, means, rather than by restricting fundamental freedoms."

Free elections require free expression of the citizens ’ choice, which is achievable if there is a choice available, and also unhindered expression of preferences by way of free expression of opinions for or against a candidate. The free expression of choice requires access to information, which should be truthful and objective. Referring to the European Court ’ s judgment in Bowman ( cited above), the majority overlooked that a conflict between freedom of expression and the right to free elections arises only in “certain circumstances” so that “ usually ” restrictions on freedom of expression “ would not be acceptable”. In the absence of any pressing social need during a pre-election period, varied opinions and information, including information containing preference for a candidate, should be allowed to circulate freely. The requirements of objectivity and truthfulness apply, so that the relevant information will guide voters, irrespective of the preference expressed within the text of the information."

The primary criterion for distinguishing between campaigning and information had to be the presence of a particular campaigning aim, namely to incline voters in one direction, to secure either support for or opposition to a specific candidate or electoral bloc.",
                "The Constitutional Court also found, in its 2003 ruling on the provisions of the Electoral Rights Act concerning the procedure for giving information, that news bulletins and printed publications must confine their information about pre-election events to one separate information note, without comment and without giving preference to any one or electoral bloc. The Constitutional Court held in the ruling that the above provisions should not be interpreted as banning the mass media from expressing opinions or from commenting outside the scope of the information note.",
                "Thus, assessing the impugned legislative provision within the scope of the current regulatory framework and the above-mentioned statements of principle by the Constitutional Court, and taking into account the special role of the mass media in the electoral process, the impugned provision could not be perceived as giving preference to the mass media over other participants in the electoral process.

To reconcile any conflict between these competing rights and freedoms, the legislature was to maintain the balance of constitutional values and not put in place disproportionate restrictions that would not be necessary in a democratic society and that would impinge upon the very essence of the protected rights.",
                "The exclusion of Russian citizens from election campaigning and the absence of legislative safeguards would mean, in substance, refusing them a realistic opportunity to influence the electoral process, confining them to the action of casting a vote. The absence of free political discussion and opportunities for a free exchange of opinions, including both candidates and citizens, during the elections would make it impossible to consider such elections as free.",

Opinions and comments, by their nature, contain value judgments and the potential to induce a choice or a preference. Moreover, it is frequently difficult to determine the exact intention behind an utterance. Thus, exclusion of value judgments from the notion of “information”, their arbitrary classification as “ campaigning ”, and the removal from ordinary citizens of the opportunity to express their attitude toward a candidate and his or her policy choices significantly impinged upon the constitutional rights set out in Article 29 of the Constitution.",

Actually, freedom of the press is more vital in campaigning than in any other moment of political life, since it permits to express opinions on candidate programs and to criticize public powers.

In particular, the neutrality requirement applies to the electoral campaign and coverage by the media, especially the publicly owned media, as well as to public funding of parties and campaigns. This means that there are two possible interpretations of equality: either “strict” equality or “proportional” equality. “Strict” equality means that the political parties are treated without regard to their present strength in parliament or among the electorate. It must apply to the use of public facilities for electioneering purposes (for example bill posting, postal services and similar, public demonstrations, public meeting rooms). “Proportional” equality implies that the treatment of political parties is in proportion to the number of votes. Equality of opportunity (strict and/or proportional) applies in particular to radio and television airtime, public funds and other forms of backing. Certain forms of backing may on the one hand be submitted to strict equality and on the other hand to proportional equality.”",

The Court reached this conclusion notwithstanding the tangible changes brought to this procedure, such as the reduction of the time-limit for lodging a supervisory review application from one year to six months, the introduction of an obligation of prior exhaustion of ordinary avenues of appeal, and the abolition of the essentially unfettered discretionary power of the presidents of the regional courts to overrule decisions by their judges dismissing such applications. In particular, the Court criticised the maintaining of several consecutive judicial instances of supervisory review at both regional and federal level, the existence of an overall six-month time-limit open to differing interpretations, and not least the powers of the President or Deputy President of the Supreme Court to reverse any decision by a judge of the same court dismissing a supervisory review application (see Martynets, cited above)."

During the relevant period the applicant organisation had issued two publications contributing to the creation of a negative view of one of the candidates in the State Duma election. According to the Government, the “ campaigning ” aim of the impugned and other publications was demonstrated by the following: the underlying idea of presenting effects of the same person “holding the reins of power”; a pattern of consistently negative assessment, over a period of time, of one candidate ’ s activities; the regional branch of the Communist Party was one of the two founders of the newspaper; the applicant organisation had expressed to the Electoral Commission its intention to accept proposals for publications for a fee and, as required by the law, had published the fees applicable to publications on behalf of political parties; the applicant organisation had signed a contract with the Communist Party for this purpose, and some of the publications in the applicant organisation ’ s newspaper during the electoral campaign had indeed mentioned the Party ’ s sponsorship (see paragraph 7 above). In the Government ’ s view, the above convincingly confirmed the applicant organisation ’ s intention to engage in “ campaigning ” during the election campaign. The impugned publications also fell within the scope of the “ campaigning ” criteria set out in 1999 by the Journalists ’ Union of Russia to identify “campaigning” aims in the activities of the mass media: dissemination of adverse information without taking adequate measures to verify it approaching the person referred to; blurring of the line between opinions and established fact; violation of the Declaration of Principles on the Conduct of Journalists, including reporting only in accordance with facts of which the journalist knows the origin, the use of fair methods to obtain information, and doing the utmost to rectify any published information which is found to be harmfully inaccurate."

The Court notes that the applicant organisation was fined for committing the administrative offence that was defined as a violation of the “procedure” applicable to media work during one part of an election period, namely during the month preceding election day (see paragraph 38 above). This violation concerned the failure to indicate the name of the political party or the candidate to the State Duma who had commissioned two publications in the newspaper, with or without paying a fee. This requirement became incumbent on the editorial board of the newspaper (the applicant organisation ) as the content of the impugned publications contained “campaigning material”. The publications were classified as “campaigning” because they were considered to predominantly contain information about one candidate in combination with negative comments."

Indeed, although the applicant organisation was not the author of the contested articles, it participated in their dissemination by publishing and distributing them. The Court reiterates in this respect that publishers, irrespective of whether they associate themselves with the content of publications, play a full part in the exercise of freedom of expression by providing authors with a medium (see Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 22, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV; and Andrushko v. Russia, no. 4260/04, § 42, 14 October 2010 ).

Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 52, ECHR 2000-V, and Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, § 30, ECHR 2004-I). The level of precision required of domestic legislation – which cannot provide for every eventuality – depends to a considerable degree on the content of the law in question, the field it is designed to cover, and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 142, ECHR 2012 ). The applicant organisation ’ s conviction had its basis in Article 5.5 of the Code of Administrative Offences taken in conjunction with sections 45 and 52 of the Electoral Rights Act of 2002 and section 55 of the State Duma Deputies Election Act of 2005. The applicant organisation mentioned the ambiguity of the notion of “ campaigning ” as distinguished from the notion of “information for voters”. The Court does not find it necessary in the present case to take any stance on the question of lawfulness, in view of its conclusion below regarding proportionality (see paragraph 134 below). In any event, it will take up the relevant matters below in the context of an analysis of proportionality, in particular as regards the classification of the impugned publications as “campaigning material” and the related administrative offence proceedings against the applicant organisation."

Further, the Government do not suggest that the interference pursued the aim of protecting Mr Stroyev ’ s reputation, and the domestic court decisions contain no specific assessment of any such comments. Accordingly, as the aim of the interference in the present case was not to protect Mr Stroyev ’ s reputation, the circumstances of the case do not turn on the balancing exercise between the rights and freedoms under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention."

The general principles concerning the question whether an interference with freedom of expression is “necessary in a democratic society” are well established in the Court ’ s case-law and have been summarised as follows (see Animal Defenders International, cited above, § 100, with further references):",
                "“( i ) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "(ii) The adjective ‘ necessary ’, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘ pressing social need ’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ...”"

            [
                "107. The breadth of the margin of appreciation to be afforded to domestic authorities depends on a number of factors, such as the type of the expression at issue. There is little scope under Article 10 § 2 for restrictions on debates on questions of public interest (see Animal Defenders International, cited above, § 102 ). The margin is also narrowed by the strong interest of a democratic society in the press exercising its vital role as a public watchdog: freedom of the press and other news media affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of political leaders. It is incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on subjects of public interest and the public also has a right to receive them (ibid.)."

Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 31, Series A no. 298; De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24 February 1997, § 37, Reports 1997 ‑ I; and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v.

By reason of the “duties and responsibilities”, which are inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, § 65, cited above, and Alithia Publishing Company Ltd and Constantinides v. Cyprus, no. 17550/03, § 65, 22 May 2008). The methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably, depending among other things on the media in question; it is not for the Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted by journalists (see Jersild, cited above, § 31). In considering the “duties and responsibilities” of a journalist, the potential impact of the medium concerned is an important factor; audiovisual media often have a much more immediate and powerful effect than print media (see Purcell and Others v. Ireland, no. 15404/89, Commission decision of 16 April 1991, Decisions and Reports 70). For instance, the Court noted the differences between a portal operator and a traditional publisher and a certain development in favour of distinguishing between the legal principles regulating the activities of the traditional print and audiovisual media on the one hand and Internet-based media operations on the other (see Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 11 3, ECHR 2015 )."

The two rights are inter-related and operate to reinforce each other: for example, freedom of expression is one of the “conditions” necessary to “ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” (see Mathieu- Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 54). For this reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely. In the context of election debates, the unhindered exercise of freedom of speech by candidates has particular significance (see Kudeshkina v. Russia, no. 29492/05, § 87, 26 February 2009)."

In Mathieu ‑ Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, §§ 52 and 54, the Court recognised that the Contracting States have a wide margin of appreciation with regard to their electoral systems. Referring to this, in Bowman (cited above, § 43 ) the Court stated that, in striking the balance between the rights under Article 10 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Contracting States have a margin of appreciation, as they do generally with regard to their electoral systems. More recently, in a case concerning advertisement of a political nature, the Court stated that the political nature of the advertisements that were prohibited called for strict scrutiny and a correspondingly circumscribed national margin of appreciation with regard to the need for the restrictions. The Court did not find it appropriate in that case to attach much weight to the various justifications for allowing States a wide margin of appreciation with reference to Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. Otherwise, the application of this provision would be left to the discretion of the Contracting States to a degree that might lead to results incompatible with the privileged position of free political speech under Article 10 of the Convention (see TV Vest AS and Rogaland Pensjonistparti, cited above, §§ 64 and 66)."

The quality of the parliamentary and judicial review of the necessity of the measure is of particular importance in this respect, including to the operation of the relevant margin of appreciation ... It is also relevant to take into account the risk of abuse if a general measure were to be relaxed, that being a risk which is primarily for the State to assess ... A general measure has been found to be a more feasible means of achieving the legitimate aim than a provision allowing a case-by-case examination, when the latter would give rise to a risk of significant uncertainty as well as of discrimination and arbitrariness ... The application of the general measure to the facts of the case remains, however, illustrative of its impact in practice and is thus material to its proportionality ...",
                "109. It follows that the more convincing the general justifications for the general measure are, the less importance the Court will attach to its impact in the particular case ...",

The central question as regards such measures is not ... whether less restrictive rules should have been adopted or, indeed, whether the State could prove that, without the prohibition, the legitimate aim would not be achieved. Rather the core issue is whether, in adopting the general measure and striking the balance it did, the legislature acted within the margin of appreciation afforded to it ...",

While the risk to pluralist public debates, elections and the democratic process would evidently be more acute during an electoral period, the Bowman judgment does not suggest that that risk is confined to such periods since the democratic process is a continuing one to be nurtured at all times by a free and pluralist public debate ...",

By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, their societies and their needs, the legislative and judicial authorities are best placed to assess the particular difficulties in safeguarding the democratic order in their State ...

Russia, no. 35016/03, §§ 52-53 and 62-70, 21 October 2010). It has not been substantiated that the impugned publications were (paid-for) political advertisements, rather than “ordinary” journalistic work. There is no proof that any related arguments were raised and examined in the domestic proceedings, in particular in relation to ascertaining the presence of a campaign aim or other essential elements of the offence. It follows from the available material that the applicant organisation clearly specified on the front page of the periodical its formal affiliation to a political party (the Communist Party) and also clearly declared its readiness to publish material on the part of any political party, electoral bloc or candidate in a specific election. While it is true that it declared that the fees it announced would not “apply to the newspaper ’ s founder”, as a matter of fact, the same fee was charged to the Communist Party. Nothing in the domestic proceedings or before the Court discloses that the impugned articles were among those mentioned in the contract between the application organisation and the local branch of the Communist Party."

The State must therefore be accorded some discretion as regards this country-specific and complex assessment which is of central relevance to the legislative choices at issue (ibid.).

This role is not limited to using the press as a medium of communication, for instance by way of political advertising, but also encompasses an independent exercise of freedom of the press by mass media outlets such as newspapers on the basis of free editorial choice aimed at imparting information and ideas on subjects of public interest.

In this connection, the assessment of impugned publications should, as it is for instance in defamation cases, be subject to the traditional criteria under Article 10 of the Convention, including the distinction to be drawn between statements of fact and value judgments (see, as a recent authority, Morice v.

Possibly via third parties, the documents subsequently came into the possession of De Telegraaf, which published information about this in January of this year.

Technical measures, such as the introduction of new security technology in authorised systems, and measures within the area of personnel management, such as the continuation of sound security investigations and reviews of new and existing staff, will also contribute to a further reduction of security risks. Extreme alertness to signals which might indicate security risks and better (social) control of non-security-conscious behaviour are indispensible in this connection.",

As the [first applicant] has correctly argued, Article 10 of the Convention also comprises the protection of journalistic sources in order to safeguard the right freely to gather news ( recht van vrije nieuwsgaring ). However, the Regional Court does not consider that that right has been violated in the instant case. The Regional Court stresses that the journalists concerned have not been required to give their active co-operation to the investigation into the identity of the source, but that in the instant case all that has been sought is the handover of material that exists independently from the will of the journalists and which, in addition, is the object of a criminal act. The Regional Court therefore considers that any sanctioning of the Public Prosecution Service’s actions in the present case will not hinder any future exchange of information – albeit perhaps in a different form – between the [first applicant] and its sources.”"

They claimed to be aware that the applicants De Haas and Mos had been subject to telephone tapping and observation, presumably by AIVD agents, from late January 2006 onwards. Such measures, in the contention of the applicants, lacked a legal basis, since the AIVD was using powers granted it by section 6 (2)(a) of the 2002 Intelligence and Security Services Act ( Wet op de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten – see paragraph 51 below) to carry out duties set out in section 6(2)(c) of that Act. In the alternative, since clearly the target of the measures was the second and third applicants’ journalistic source and not the applicants themselves, basic requirements of subsidiarity and proportionality had been disregarded, the more so since the said two applicants were journalists and therefore entitled pursuant to Article 10 of the Convention to protect their journalistic sources. The applicants also claimed the protection of the second and third applicants’ private and family life, home and correspondence under Article 8 of the Convention. They sought, in essence, a provisional measure in the form of an order for the cessation of all investigations and the use of special powers against the second and third applicants, in so far as these related to the press publications referred to above; the destruction of all data obtained by their use; and an order preventing the AIVD from handing over the data to the Public Prosecution Service for use in criminal proceedings against the second and third applicants."

Proceeding on the assumption that the AIVD had in fact made use of its surveillance powers – which the respondent had not confirmed or denied – he then went on to hold that such use was contrary to Article 10 of the Convention.

They also stated that the first, second and third applicants had gone beyond the needs of informing the public, especially by unlawfully retaining original copies of secret documents the possession of which was in itself a crime and in exposing the AIVD’s use of informants. Moreover, adequate safeguards existed in the form of the Supervisory Board for Intelligence and Security Services ( Commissie van toezicht voor de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten, hereafter “Supervisory Board”), two of whose members including the chairman were members of the judiciary; the Supervisory Board exercised supervision on a regular basis but also entertained complaints, and in so doing had access to information denied the civil courts.

This interfered with their rights under Articles 8 (private life) and 10, and was unlawful in so far as the use of the powers concerned continued after the identification of a target other than the applicants, to whom moreover the need for source protection apparently did not apply.

The Court of Appeal was entitled to hold, without violating section 6 of the 2002 Intelligence and Security Services Act, that in view of the danger threatening the effectiveness and integrity of the AIVD as a result of a ‘leak’ within the security service itself, weighty State interests were at stake, and draw the conclusion that the AIVD’s investigations against the journalists were, at least initially, covered by sub-paragraph a. ...”",

[The Court of Appeal’s finding] that ‘in view of the importance of the protection of journalistic sources to the freedom of the press in a democratic society and the possible chilling effect ( afschrikwekkende werking ) which results from the knowledge that the AIVD is using the said special powers against the journalists, ... such use is only justified by an undeniable need in the public interest ( onloochenbare behoefte in het algemeen belang )’ unambiguously implies that the Court of Appeal, in applying its test, has had regard to the condition, formulated by the European Court of Human Rights, of an ‘overriding requirement in the public interest’”",

The protection of journalistic sources thus becomes entirely illusory, since the AIVD, by starting its investigation with the journalist, will always be able to trace (a person leading closer to) the source, so it is argued.",

The protection of journalistic sources reaches its limits in, among other things, the protection of national security and the need to prevent the dissemination of confidential information, as set out in Article 10 § 2 of the Convention. The Court of Appeal, in stressing the importance of ‘extreme reticence in the use of special powers’, was right not to exclude [such measures].”",

The counter-argument made by De Telegraaf and the other appellants that other means were available, namely that the AIVD might have asked the journalists to name their source, was rejected by the Court of Appeal on the ground, essentially, that the journalists would not have named their source in that case either precisely because they are doing their very best to keep their sources secret. The other defence submitted by De Telegraaf and the other appellants, that the AIVD could have awaited the outcome of the criminal investigation was rejected by the Court of Appeal by pointing out that the criminal investigation and the investigation by the AIVD are entirely unrelated to each other, by which the Court of Appeal meant to express that the two investigations pursue different aims and serve different interests, so that in order to answer the question whether the use of the special powers meets the requirement of subsidiarity the outcome of the criminal investigation is, in principle, irrelevant. ...”",

The Court of Appeal has dismissed the primary claim under 2 (B) [i.e. the claim for an order preventing the AIVD from handing over the data to the Public Prosecution Service for use in criminal proceedings against the second and third applicants] because it could not determine which information had and which had not been lawfully obtained – meaning, plainly, on the basis of investigations what ... can be considered still lawful, or no longer lawful, vis-à-vis the journalists – and because it could not be ruled out beforehand that all the information collected had been obtained unlawfully, so that the Court of Appeal could not in reason determine what information ought to be discarded. This ground of the decision is not called into question in the statement of points of appeal, and rightly so, because the Court of Appeal had the latitude in summary injunction proceedings to find and decide thus.",

The AIVD is therefore not entitled to employ any special powers with the aim of a criminal investigation. The intelligence service may only use these powers within the context of its own tasks. The areas of attention of the police and the [Public Prosecution Service] on the one hand and of the AIVD on the other hand, are sometimes in line with one another. The investigative services and the AIVD however each have their own approach towards their investigations, they operate from different perspectives. A criminal investigation is aimed at obtaining evidence on behalf of criminal proceedings. An investigation of the AIVD is on the other hand aimed at timely informing the authorities that are competent to act on any threats against the democratic legal system or threats to the security or other vital interests of the state with the purpose of preventing the harming of these interests. In the case of the leaked state secrets, a story covered by De Telegraaf, it is the investigative services’ task to collect information about the question who stole the state secrets at the BVD and which unauthorised third parties keep or kept possession of the leaked material. The investigation by the AIVD has a different focus, owing to the fact that the AIVD investigates to what extent the integrity and effective functioning of the AIVD have been, and possibly still are being, harmed. In case of a leak of this extent it is, moreover, necessary to find out if possibly more documents have been leaked and where these are, in order to identify the damage for current operational investigations and the danger to human sources and staff of the AIVD. Although the AIVD investigation is not aimed at collecting evidence for criminal proceedings, in performing its task the AIVD may come across information that may also be important for the criminal investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. In that case the AIVD based on [section 38 of the 2002 Intelligence and Security Services Act] has the possibility to make available the information to the [Public Prosecution Service] via an official message to the National Public Prosecutor for Counter-terrorism. In the investigation in hand several official messages were issued to the [Public Prosecution Service].”"

The tapping of the telephone of one non-target was not in keeping with the requirement of subsidiarity, and transcriptions had been made of various intercepted telephone conversations that were unrelated to the case and were also of no relevance to the performance by the AIVD of its duties. The Supervisory Board also found some transcriptions of intercepted telephone conversations in cases where the Minister had not yet given consent for electronic surveillance.

                "The Board considers that the decision to make use of special powers against the journalists of De Telegraaf met the requirements of necessity, subsidiarity and proportionality. In other respects too, the decision to use special powers did not, in the Board’s opinion, give rise to impropriety vis-à-vis De Telegraaf and the other complainants.",

The Board is of the opinion that the way in which this was done should be considered an (implied) part of the complaint of De Telegraaf and the other complainants. After all, the complaint relates to the application of special powers. Such application includes, in the Board’s opinion, the transcription and recording of intercepted conversations. The Board finds that several of the journalists’ conversations have been transcribed and recorded which did not relate to the investigation into the leak within the AIVD and which have no further relevance to the AIVD’s discharge of its duties. Even on initial consideration this ought to have been clear in respect of a (major) portion of these too far-reaching transcriptions. The Board also finds that this information has not been destroyed after having been recorded and considered more closely.",

The special powers have thus not been used for the purpose of the criminal investigation. The Board therefore takes the view that there has been no adulteration of the AIVD investigation with the criminal investigation headed by the Public Prosecution Service. The issuing of official reports ( ambtsberichten ) in this case cannot lead to the finding that there has been adulteration of tasks and powers between the AIVD and the Public Prosecution Service. After all, this concerns the regular provision of information – which the AIVD has obtained based on its own tasks – to the Public Prosecution Service in accordance with the law in force.",

An implied part of the complaint, namely the transcription and recording of intercepted telephone conversations, I declare well-founded in part.",
                "The recording and transcribing of the conversations was begun one hour too early and the conversations have been partly recorded and transcribed to too great an extent. This has harmed the interests of the journalists because too much information about them has been recorded and this information has been kept by the AIVD for too long. I have not found any circumstances requiring me to deviate from the advice of the Board on any of the parts of the complaint.",

An interference with the right freely to gather news – including the interest of protection of a journalistic source – can be justified under Article 10 § 2 in so far as the conditions set out in that provision have been complied with. That means in the first place that the interference must have a basis in national law and that those national legal rules must have a certain precision. Secondly, the interference must serve one of the aims mentioned in Article 10 § 2. Thirdly, the interference must be necessary in a democratic society for attaining such an aim. In this, the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality play a role. In that framework it must be weighed whether the interference is necessary to serve the interest involved and therefore whether no other, less far-reaching ways ( minder bezwarende wegen ) can be followed along which this interest can be served to a sufficient degree. Where it concerns a criminal investigation, it must be considered whether the interference with the right freely to gather news is proportionate to the interest served in arriving at the truth.

Court H.R., Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, 27 March 1996, para. 39). Journalists may receive their information from all kinds of sources. Therefore, a wide interpretation of this term is necessary. The actual provision of information to journalists can constitute an action on the side of the source, for example when a source calls or writes to a journalist or sends to him or her recorded information or pictures. Information shall also be regarded as being ‘provided’ when a source remains passive and consents to the journalist taking the information, such as the filming or recording of information with the consent of the source.”",

Since the implementation in practice of measures of secret surveillance is not open to scrutiny by the individuals concerned or the public at large, it would be contrary to the rule of law for the legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Weber and Saravia, cited above, §§ 93-95 and 145; Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v.

The first applicant in that case being a journalist, the Court found that her right to protect her journalistic sources was in issue ( loc. cit., §§ 144-45). However, the aim of strategic monitoring was not to identify journalists’ sources. Generally the authorities would know only when examining the intercepted telecommunications, if at all, that a journalist’s conversation had been monitored. Surveillance measures were, in particular, not directed at uncovering journalistic sources. The interference with freedom of expression by means of strategic monitoring could not, therefore, be characterised as particularly serious ( loc. cit., § 151). Although admittedly there was no special provision for the protection of freedom of the press and, in particular, the non-disclosure of sources once the authorities had become aware that they had intercepted a journalist’s conversation, the safeguards in place, which had been found to satisfy the requirements of Article 8, were considered adequate and effective for keeping the disclosure of journalistic sources to an unavoidable minimum ( loc. cit., § 151)."

Germany, 6 September 1978, § 56, Series A no. 28, and Kennedy, cited above, § 167). However, in both cases the Court was prepared to accept as adequate the independent supervision available. In Klass and Others, this included a practice of seeking prior consent to surveillance measures of the G 10 Commission, an independent body chaired by a president who was qualified to hold judicial office and which moreover had the power to order the immediate termination of the measures in question ( mutatis mutandis, Klass and Others, §§ 21 and 51; see also Weber and Saravia, §§ 25 and 117). In Kennedy ( loc. cit. ) the Court was impressed by the interplay between the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (“IPT”), an independent body composed of persons who held or had held high judicial office and experienced lawyers which had the power, among other things, to quash interception orders, and the Interception of Communications Commissioner, likewise a functionary who held or had held high judicial office ( Kennedy, § 57) and who had access to all interception warrants and applications for interception warrants ( Kennedy, § 56)."

The Court takes the view that the actual handover of the documents taken was not necessary: since – as appears from the Minister’s letter of 20 December 2006 to the Lower House (see paragraph 18 above) – these were copies not originals, visual inspection to verify that they were complete, followed by their destruction (as was in fact proposed by the first applicant, see paragraph 22 above), would have sufficed."

He maintained that the acts for which he had been investigated and sanctioned were part of a journalistic investigation that he had undertaken in order to determine whether the information brought to his attention was true and of public interest. As soon as he had verified the said information, he had contacted the central office of his newspaper and subsequently entered into contact with his colleague, O.O. The manner in which his colleague from the central office and the newspaper where he was employed had chosen to publish the information had not depended on him. Moreover, his statements as well as the witness statements given by other journalists during the investigation were meant to protect their sources and their colleagues.

Subsequently, he had worked with his colleagues from the central office of his newspaper, who had finally decided to make public the fact that classified information had been leaked by the Romanian army. This type of information was clearly a matter of public interest. The applicant also submitted that having received the information in question from a colleague journalist, it could have been easily inferred that the said secret information was already in the public domain, a fact recognised also in the prosecutor ’ s decision of 15 August 2007. On this point the applicant was of the opinion that his case differed from the case of Stoll v.

In the Government ’ s opinion, since the applicant ’ s pre-trial detention had been revoked by the domestic courts, the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim in that respect. As far as the administrative fine was concerned, the Government considered it a minor sanction, of a rather low amount, which by October 2013 the applicant had still not paid.

Public servants were subject to reasonable and qualified obligations of confidentiality to which members of the public were not.

States increasingly distinguished between the offences or penalties available for the unauthorised disclosure of information by members of the public on the one hand, and public servants on the other. For instance, in Germany, the criminal law had been amended in 2012 to release journalists from the risk of being charged with aiding and abetting the “violation of official secrets” for disclosing classified information. If the unauthorised disclosure did not amount to treason or espionage, and was not in wartime, several countries – including Moldova, the Russian Federation and Slovenia – limited criminal responsibility for unauthorised disclosure only to public servants. Many other countries – including Belgium, Denmark, France, Poland and the United Kingdom – provided separate or heightened offences for public servants who disclosed information to which private persons, including those working in the media, were not subject."

It could not be lawful for a journalist who received information which the State did not want disseminated to be unprotected in the absence of disclosure. On this point, there was growing support in international and national law and practice against sanctions for unauthorised possession, including in the area of national security. For instance, where there was no espionage, demonstration of intent to harm, or actual harm, the laws of Albania, Moldova and Poland provided no punishment for the unauthorised possession of classified information by members of the public or public servants, despite clear penalties for the unauthorised disclosure of such information. In other States – including the Czech Republic, Germany, Serbia and Slovenia – the offence of unauthorised possession required that the offender was a public servant, had had an intent to disclose, had used unlawful means, or had caused harm."

                "83. The fundamental principles concerning the question whether an interference with freedom of expression is “necessary in a democratic society” are well established in the Court ’ s case-law and were summarised in Stoll (cited above, § 101) and restated more recently in Bédat v. Switzerland ([GC], no. 56925/08, § 48, ECHR 2016) as follows:",
                "“ ( i ) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "(ii) The adjective ‘ necessary ’, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘ pressing social need ’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ...”"
            ],
            [
                "84. As regards the level of protection, there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on freedom of expression in two fields, namely political speech and matters of public interest. Accordingly, a high level of protection of freedom of expression, with the authorities thus having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation, will normally be accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest. However, the protection afforded by Article 10 of the Convention to journalists is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism. The concept of responsible journalism, as a professional activity which enjoys the protection of Article 10 of the Convention, is not confined to the contents of information which is collected and/or disseminated by journalistic means. That concept also embraces the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist, and the fact that a journalist has breached the law is a relevant, albeit not decisive, consideration when determining whether he or she has acted responsibly (see Pentikäinen v. Finland [GC], no. 11882/10, § 90, ECHR 2015 and the cases referred to therein; see also Bédat, cited above, §§ 49-50).",

In the view of the Romanian courts, the applicant had committed an offence by virtue of having shared secret military information with other people. The information in dispute – copies of secret documents belonging to a Romanian military unit operating in Afghanistan – concerned the national defence and was classified."

In the current case, in order to answer whether the information in question was of public interest, the Court firstly takes note of the context surrounding the applicant ’ s actions – more specifically, the public debate on the kidnapping of three journalists in Iraq (see paragraph 9 above). In addition, the information in question and the fact that it was leaked was amply discussed in the media, with journalists speculating that it could have serious implications in connection with the conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq (see paragraphs 10 - 14 above). Furthermore, the disclosure of the documents to the public gave rise to an internal investigation within the Ministry of Defence, and to a high number of disciplinary sanctions (see paragraph 15 above). It must also be noted that the High Court of Cassation and Justice recognised in its judgment of 23 March 2009 that the issue of the leak of secret information from the army was a matter of public interest (see paragraph 34 above). Therefore, in the Court ’ s view the documents in the applicant ’ s possession, as well as the fact that they had been leaked from the Romanian army, were likely to raise questions of public interest."

On this point the Court also reiterates the principle adopted in Resolution 1551 (2007) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on fair-trial issues in criminal cases concerning espionage or divulging State secrets, whereby publication of documents is the rule and classification the exception (see paragraph 43 above). Similarly, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has taken the view that the disclosure of State-held information should play a very important role in a democratic society because it enables civil society to control the actions of the government to whom it has entrusted the protection of its interests (see Stoll, cited above, § 111)."

As regards the interests the domestic authorities sought to protect and the repercussions in the circumstances of the present case, the Court must ascertain whether the applicant ’ s actions were, at the relevant time, capable of causing “considerable damage” to national security (see Hadjianastassiou v.

Russia, no. 69519/01, § 86, 22 October 2009, for cases concerning military interests and national security in the strict sense; and, mutatis mutandis, Stoll, cited above, § 130 ). That being so, the Court does not doubt that secret information concerning military operations in a conflict zone is a priori information that must be protected. However, it is important to note that the prosecutor observed that the information was outdated and that its disclosure was not likely to endanger national security (see paragraph 28 above). Moreover, the documents issued by the Romanian military unit liable for the leak had been de-classified after the beginning of the investigation (see paragraph 23 above). Under these circumstances, the Court notes that the Government did not succeed in demonstrating that the gathering and the disclosure of the information by the applicant to E.G. and I.M. had been liable to cause considerable damage to national security."

It does not appear from the investigation whether the latter tried to recover the documents or warn about possible dangers in the event of their disclosure. On this point, the Court reiterates that whoever exercises his freedom of expression undertakes “duties and responsibilities” the scope of which depends on his situation and the technical means he uses (see Dammann, cited above, § 55). However, it is for the States to organise their services and to train their personnel in such a way as to ensure that no confidential information is disclosed (ibid.). These findings are valid in the current case too, especially since the lack of action on the part of the institution concerned by the leak of the secret information was noted also by the prosecutor (see paragraph 28 above)."

The courts did not address the prosecutor ’ s finding that the disclosure by the applicant of the information under dispute was not likely to endanger national security and failed to actually verify whether the said information could indeed have posed a threat to military structures. Moreover, although the applicant invoked the guarantees provided by Article 10 of the Convention (see paragraph 31 above), the courts did not appear to weigh, in the circumstances of the case, the interests in maintaining the confidentiality of the documents in question over the interests of a journalistic investigation and the public ’ s interest in being informed of the leak of information and maybe even of the actual content of the documents (contrast Stoll, cited above, § 138).",

However, the applicant in the current case is a journalist claiming to have made the disclosure in the context of a journalistic investigation and not a member of the military who collected and transmitted secret military information to foreign nationals (see Pasko, cited above, § 13) or to private companies (see Hadjianastassiou, cited above, § 7)."

In the light of the duty of discretion referred to above, such disclosure should be made in the first place to the person ’ s superior or other competent authority or body.

It further considers that the circumstances of the instant case – a classic case of defamation of an individual in the context of a debate on a matter of public interest – presented no justification for the imposition of a prison sentence. Such a sanction, by its very nature, will inevitably have a chilling effect on public discussion, and the notion that the applicant ’ s sentence was in fact suspended does not alter that conclusion particularly as the conviction itself was not expunged (see, mutatis mutandis, Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre, cited above, § 116 and Salov v.

                "Olga Kudeshkina (OK): Indeed. Years of working in the Moscow City Court have led me to doubt the existence of independent courts in Moscow. Instances of a court being put under pressure to take a certain decision are not that rare, not only in cases of great public interest but also in cases encroaching on the interests of certain individuals of consequence or of particular groups.",
                "EM: So what about that case in which you were confronted with such bare and ruthless pressure, what was it?",
                "OK: Some of you have probably heard about the criminal case concerning the smuggling of furniture which was subsequently sold in the large Moscow shopping centres ‘ Tri Kita ’ and ‘ Grand ’. The damage caused by this crime, as the investigation has revealed, amounted to several million roubles. Among those who came within the sights of the investigators, led by Zaytsev, were extremely influential and prominent people. This case received great publicity after the Prosecutor General hastily withdrew the file from the investigation unit of the Ministry of the Interior and charged the investigator Zaytsev [with abuse of official powers].",
                "EM: So you examined Zaytsev ’ s case, and not that of the furniture dealers?",
                "OK: Yes, [the case] against Zaytsev. First the Moscow City Court examined the case and acquitted him. What is more, the court expressly stated in the judgment that the office of the Prosecutor General itself sometimes failed to conform to, or was in direct breach of, the law. The reputation of the Prosecutor General ’ s Office had been publicly challenged.",
                "EM: And the judgment was quashed, as I remember?",

                "EM: What happened just before the withdrawal?",
                "OK: During the hearing the court was considering the evidence for the prosecution and started to cross-examine the victims. However, the public prosecutor, a representative of the Prosecutor General ’ s Office, must have reckoned that the victims ’ testimonies ran contrary to the prosecution ’ s version of events. He therefore attempted to bring the proceedings to naught. In 20 years in the judiciary this was the first time that I was confronted with such behaviour ... he was trying to keep the court within the strict bounds of the questions he thought the court ought to ask the victims ... if the court went beyond these limits he started challenging the court and bombarding it with unreasoned requests.",

                "A judge, although defined by law as the embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity, in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk, a subordinate of a court president. The mechanism of how a decision is imposed on a judge is not to contact [the judge] directly: instead, a prosecutor or an interested person calls the court president, who then tries to talk the judge into a ‘ right ’ decision, first gently, by offering advice or a professional opinion, then pushing him or her more strongly to take the ‘ correct ’ decision, that is, one that is convenient to somebody. A judge, on the other hand, is dependant on the president for the daily basics, such as accommodation grants, bonuses, and also the distribution of cases between the judges. The president can always find a flaw in the judge ’ s work if he or she wishes (as simple as exceeding judicial time-limits, a situation impossible to avoid in practice, given the volume of work). On these grounds the president may seek termination of the judge ’ s office, which is decided upon by the qualification board, usually controlled by the same court bureaucrats. ... in reality a court still more often than not takes the position of the prosecution. The courts then become an instrument of commercial, political or personal manipulation.",

The law applies quite strictly to ordinary people, but this is not the case when it comes to persons holding important posts. But they break the law too. I would like to participate in making laws that would provide for real independence of the judicial power ...",
                "Izvestiya : What does the pressure look like in practice?",
                "OK: There is a kind of consultation, legal advice, usually in cases of great public interest. Sometimes this has a healthy pretext, such as academic debate. The judge expresses his position, and the deputy president replies. The court president rarely speaks to the judges directly. Through such conventions the court administration tests each judge to see how flexible he is, so that when it comes to [the allocation of cases] they know who can be entrusted with a delicate case and whom to avoid.",
                "Izvestiya : So how exactly was pressure exerted on you?",
                "OK: The public prosecutor exerted pressure on me. You put a question to the victim, and he immediately challenges you. In 20 years of practice I have not seen anything like it. Zaytsev was accused of abuse of official powers. He carried out a search without authorisation from a prosecutor. The law allows this in urgent cases, but the investigator must report to the prosecutor within 24 hours. Zaytsev reported to the prosecutor [in time], and it was for the court to verify whether there had indeed been any urgency in conducting those searches. Therefore it was necessary to examine the criminal case files against the firms ‘ Grand ’ and ‘ Tri Kita ’ who were dealing in furniture. Through his constant objections, however, the public prosecutor would not allow the court to touch this subject ...”"

The Moscow City Court President also insisted on excluding from the hearing minutes any mention of the behaviour by the public prosecutor which the assessors had regarded as pressure. In essence, Yegorova was pushing me to forge the case file. Moreover, she proposed that I ensure that the assessors did not turn up for the hearing, literally ‘ ask them not to come to the court any more ’.

The applicant was absent from the proceedings, apparently without any valid excuse. The Judiciary Qualification Board of Moscow decided that the applicant had committed a disciplinary offence and that her office as a judge was to be terminated in accordance with the Law “On the Status of Judges in the Russian Federation ”. The decision, in so far as relevant, read as follows:",
                "“During her election campaign, in order to win fame and popularity with the voters, judge Kudeshkina deliberately disseminated deceptive, concocted and insulting perceptions of the judges and judicial system of the Russian Federation, degrading the authority of the judiciary and undermining the prestige of the judicial profession, in violation of the Law On the Status of Judges in the Russian Federation and the Code of Honour of a Judge in the Russian Federation.",
                "Thus, in November 2003, when meeting with [members of her] constituency, judge Kudeshkina stated that the Prosecutor General ’ s Office exerts unprecedented pressure on judges during examination of a number of criminal cases by the Moscow City Court.",
                "In the live broadcast of her interview with the radio station Ekho Moskvy on 1 December 2003, judge Kudeshkina stated that ‘ years of working in the Moscow City Court have led me to doubt the existence of independent courts in Moscow ’; ‘ a judge, although defined by law as an embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity, in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk, a subordinate of a court president ’; ‘ the courts of law are used as an instrument of commercial, political or personal manipulation ’; ‘ if all judges keep quiet this country may soon end up in a [state of] judicial lawlessness. ’",
                "In the interview with the newspaper Izvestiya of 4 December 2003, judge Kudeshkina stated: ‘ looking around, one is just stunned by the lawlessness. The law applies quite strictly to ordinary people, but this is not the case when it comes to persons holding important posts. But they break the law too – although they are not subject to liability ’; ‘ the court administration tests each judge to see how flexible he is, so that when it comes to [the allocation of cases] they know who can be entrusted with a delicate case and whom to avoid ’.",
                "In another interview with judge Kudeshkina, published in Novaya Gazeta on 4 December 2003, she also stated that ‘ in Siberia, by the way, the courts are much purer than in Moscow. There you cannot imagine such brutal manipulation and would not be talking about corruption to such an extent ’; ‘ I doubt that any provincial courts would harbour scandals as outrageous as those in the Moscow City Court, but this a question of degree, while the problems are more general ’; ‘ a judge, although defined by law as an embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity, in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk, a subordinate of a court president. The mechanism of how a decision is imposed on a judge is not to contact [the judge] directly, instead a prosecutor or an interested person calls the court president, who then tries to talk the judge into a ‘ right ’ decision, first gently, by offering advice or a professional opinion, then pushing him or her more strongly to take the ‘ correct ’ decision, that is, one that is convenient to somebody ’; ‘ in reality a court still more often than not takes the position of the prosecution. The courts then become an instrument of commercial, political or personal manipulation. No one can rest assured that his case – whether civil or criminal or administrative – will be resolved in accordance with the law, and not just to please someone ’.",
                "In so doing judge Kudeshkina knowingly and intentionally disseminated in civil society false and untruthful fabrications about the arbitrariness allegedly prevailing in the judicial sphere; that, in dealing with specific cases, judges find themselves under constant and undisguised pressure exercised through the court presidents; that the court presidents pre-test to what extent one or other judge may be controlled in order to determine who could be entrusted with delivering a knowingly unjust judgment in a case; that no one can be sure that his case is examined by an impartial tribunal; that judges in fact betray the interests of justice by adopting the position of the prosecution in most cases; that a judge in this country is not independent and honest, but [is] a typical subordinate public servant; that in this country we have complete lawlessness, and judicial chaos.",
                "The above-mentioned statements by judge Kudeshkina are clearly based on fantasies, on knowingly false and distorted facts.",
                "However, dissemination by a judge of such information poses a great public danger because it signifies deliberate slandering of the authority of the judiciary and intentional undermining of the prestige of the judicial profession, and also promotes incorrect ideas about corrupted, dependent and biased judicial authorities in this country, which leads to the loss of public trust in the fairness and impartiality of examination of cases brought before the courts of law.",
                "As a result, the false information imparted to civil society by judge Kudeshkina, a member of the judiciary of Russia, undermined public confidence that the judiciary in Russia are independent and impartial; consequently, many citizens were lead to believe, erroneously, that all judges in this country are unprincipled, biased and venal, that in exercising their functions they only pursue their own mercenary ends or other selfish goals and interests.",
                "In support of her unsubstantiated and groundless attempts to defile the judicial system of our country, judge Kudeshkina referred [in her interviews] to the criminal case against P.V. Zaytsev, in which she had earlier acted as judge.",
                "She referred to the same case in her complaint to the High Judiciary Qualification Panel of the Russian Federation.",
                "According to the note of the President of the High Judiciary Qualification Panel (ref. no. BKK-7242/03 of 17 May 2004), the High Judiciary Qualification Panel of the Russian Federation carried out an enquiry to verify the allegations made by judge Kudeshkina in her complaint; the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation concluded, on the basis of the above, that there were no grounds to grant her request.",
                "Thus, the allegations of interference with judge Kudeshkina ’ s exercise of judicial function have not been confirmed by the conclusions of the enquiry.",
                "The Qualification Board of Moscow notes that judge Kudeshkina did not make these allegations during the period when she was examining the case against Zaytsev, but nearly half a year later, during and immediately after the election campaign. Therefore the Panel considers that the dissemination by judge Kudeshkina of false and untrue information is based only on her subjective conjectures and personal insinuations.",
                "Besides, in making her statements in the media judge Kudeshkina disclosed specific factual information concerning the criminal proceedings in the case against Zaytsev, before the judgment in this case had entered into legal force.",
                "[The Law on the Status of Judges in the Russian Federation and the Code of Honour of a Judge in the Russian Federation ] obliged her to refrain from any public statements discrediting the judiciary and the justice [system] in general.",
                "In sum, the Judiciary Qualification Board of Moscow finds the actions of judge Kudeshkina to have degraded the honour and dignity of a judge, discredited the authority of the judiciary [and] caused substantial damage to the prestige of the judicial profession, thus constituting a disciplinary offence.",
                "In choosing the disciplinary sanction to be imposed on judge Kudeshkina the qualification board takes into account that in making her statements [she] dishonoured the judges and the judicial system of Russia; she disseminated false information about her colleagues; she traded the dignity, responsibility and integrity of a judge for a political career; demonstrated bias when hearing a case; preferred her own political and other interests to the values of justice; abused her status as a judge in propagating legal nihilism and causing irreparable damage to the foundations of judicial authority. ...”"

The Government claimed that the termination of the applicant ’ s judicial office was proportionate to the pursued legitimate aim and that it corresponded to a “pressing social need”. They referred to the Court ’ s case-law, which stated that “ whenever civil servants ’ right to freedom of expression is in issue the ‘ duties and responsibilities ’ referred to in Article 10 § 2 assume a special significance, which justifies leaving to the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate to the above aim ” (the Government cited Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, § 53, Series A no. 323 ). They contended that the restrictions on judges ’ freedom of expression had even greater importance than that of other civil servants.

The Government argued that even if those statements were to be regarded as value judgments, they still needed to have some underlying factual ground and, in any event, should have remained within the limits compatible with the high moral standards required from judges. In the present case, the applicant went beyond what was acceptable from a civil servant, particularly a judge. Although freedom of expression was guaranteed to everyone, the rules of judicial ethics imposed certain restrictions on holders of judicial posts. The latter persons acted as guarantors of the rule of law, and it was therefore necessary to set strict limits on their permissible conduct in order to ensure the authority and the impartiality of the judiciary. Moreover, opinions expressed by a judge carried a greater danger of misleading the public because they carried greater weight than those expressed by laymen. The audience tended to trust persons with professional knowledge of the judicial system and their views were usually respected as authoritative and balanced."

Neither the applicant ’ s eligibility for public service nor her professional ability to exercise judicial functions were part of the arguments before the domestic authorities. Accordingly, the measure complained of essentially related to freedom of expression, and not the holding of a public post in the administration of justice, the right to which is not secured by the Convention (see Harabin v.

As regards her arguments relating to the unfairness of the disciplinary proceedings and the lack of impartiality of the Moscow City Court, the Court considers that they essentially concern the proportionality of the disputed measure and will be more appropriately considered under this head. The same applies to the arguments adduced in contesting the legitimate aim relied on by the Government.

In assessing whether the decision to bar the applicant from holding judicial office, taken in response to her public statements, was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court will consider the circumstances of the case as a whole and examine these in the light of the principles established in the case-law, which have been summed up as follows (see, among other authorities, Jersild v. Denmark, of 23 September 1994, § 31, Series A no. 298; Hertel v. Switzerland, 25 August 1998, § 46, Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 1998-VI; and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 87, ECHR 2005 ‑ II):",
                "“( i ) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "(ii) The adjective ‘ necessary ’, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘ pressing social need ’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ...”"

In addition, the Court reiterates that the fairness of the proceedings, the procedural guarantees afforded (see, mutatis mutandis, Steel and Morris, cited above, § 95) and the nature and severity of the penalties imposed (see Ceylan v.

                "84. In assessing whether there was a “pressing social need” capable of justifying interference with the exercise of freedom of expression, a careful distinction needs to be made between facts and value judgments. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24 February 1997, § 42, Reports 1997 ‑ I, and Harlanova v. Latvia ( dec .), no. 57313/00, 3 April 2003). However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists sufficient factual basis for that statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (see De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, § 47, and Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, § 43, ECHR 2001 ‑ II )."

The Court further reiterates that Article 10 applies also to the workplace, and that civil servants, such as the applicant, enjoy the right to freedom of expression (see Vogt, cited above, § 53; Wille v. Liechtenstein [GC], no. 28396/95, § 41, ECHR 1999-VII; Ahmed and Others v. the United Kingdom, 2 September 1998, § 56, Reports 1998-VI; Fuentes Bobo v.

At the same time, the Court is mindful that employees owe to their employer a duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion. This is particularly so in the case of civil servants since the very nature of civil service requires that a civil servant is bound by a duty of loyalty and discretion (see Vogt, cited above, § 53; Ahmed and Others, cited above, § 55; and De Diego Nafría v. Spain, no. 46833/99, § 37, 14 March 2002). Disclosure by civil servants of information obtained in the course of work, even on matters of public interest, should therefore be examined in the light of their duty of loyalty and discretion (see Guja, cited above, §§ 72-78)."

                "86. The Court reiterates that issues concerning the functioning of the justice system constitute questions of public interest, the debate on which enjoys the protection of Article 10. However, the Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary, which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a law-governed State, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties. It may therefore prove necessary to protect that confidence against destructive attacks which are essentially unfounded, especially in view of the fact that judges who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, § 34, Series A no. 313 ). The phrase “authority of the judiciary” includes, in particular, the notion that the courts are, and are accepted by the public at large as being, the proper forum for the settlement of legal disputes and for the determination of a person ’ s guilt or innocence on a criminal charge (see Worm v. Austria, 29 August 1997, § 40, Reports 1997-V ). What is at stake as regards protection of the judiciary ’ s authority is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the accused, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, and also in the public at large (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, Fey v. Austria, 24 February 1993, Series A no. 255-A). For this reason the Court has found it incumbent on public officials serving in the judiciary that they should show restraint in exercising their freedom of expression in all cases where the authority and impartiality of the judiciary are likely to be called into question (see Wille, cited above, § 64 )."

It has held that the right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic regime (see Melnychenko v. Ukraine, no. 17707/02, § 59, ECHR 2004-X ).

Turning to the present case, the Court notes that the Judiciary Qualification Board of Moscow charged the applicant with a disciplinary offence on account of a number of statements made in the course of her three media interviews. In their decision of 19 May 2004 (see paragraph 34 above) they cited the following statements :",
                "“– years of working in the Moscow City Court have led me to doubt the existence of independent courts in Moscow;",
                "– a judge, although defined by law as an embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity, in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk, a subordinate of a court president;",

                "– if all judges keep quiet this country may soon end up in a [state of] judicial lawlessness;",
                "– looking around, one is just stunned by the lawlessness. The law applies quite strictly to ordinary people, but this is not the case when it comes to persons holding important posts. But they break the law too – although they are not subject to liability;",
                "– the court administration tests each judge to see how flexible he or she is, so that when it comes to [the allocation of cases] they know who can be entrusted with a delicate case and whom to avoid;",
                "– in Siberia, by the way, the courts are much purer than in Moscow. There you cannot imagine such brutal manipulation and would not be talking about corruption to such an extent;",
                "– I doubt that any provincial courts would harbour scandals as outrageous as those in the Moscow City Court, but this is a question of degree, while the problems are more general;",
                "– a judge, although defined by law as an embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity, in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk, a subordinate of a court president. The mechanism of how a decision is imposed on a judge is not to contact [the judge] directly; instead a prosecutor or an interested person calls the court president, who then tries to talk the judge into a ‘ right ’ decision, first gently, by offering advice or a professional opinion, then pushing him or her more strongly to take the ‘ correct ’ decision, that is, one that is convenient to somebody;",
                "– in reality a court still more often than not takes the position of the prosecution. The courts then become an instrument of commercial, political or personal manipulation. No one can rest assured that his case – whether civil or criminal or administrative – will be resolved in accordance with the law, and not just to please someone. ”"

The Court, for its part, sees nothing in the three impugned interviews that would justify the claims of “disclosure”. Indeed, in support of her criticism of the role of court presidents, the applicant described her experience as a judge in the criminal proceedings against Zaytsev, alleging that the court was under pressure from various officials, in particular the Moscow City Court President. This, however, differed from the divulgation of classified information of which one may become aware in the course of his or her work (cf. Guja, cited above). The applicant ’ s accounts of her experience in the above proceedings should therefore be regarded as statements of fact which, in the given context, were inseparable from her opinions expressed in the same interviews, extracts of which are listed above. The Court will therefore have to assess the factual foundation of the applicant ’ s statements before deciding on the appropriateness of the value judgments expressed in the interviews."

They relied on the enquiry by the High Judiciary Qualification Panel, conducted following the applicant ’ s complaint against Ms Yegorova. The Panel found itself short of evidence to prove that Ms Yegorova had attempted to influence the applicant, or to ascertain the absence of such attempts (see the internal report by judge S. , paragraph 29 above). While the Court might accept the difficulties of establishing the content of communications between the applicant and Ms Yegorova in private, it notes that the applicant ’ s account has support in the statements of the lay assessors and the court secretary. Furthermore, the Court cannot but note the Panel ’ s overlooking of irregularities in the ensuing transfer of the case to another judge. The Court notes that pursuant to Article 242 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the case must be examined by the same court composition except when one of the judges is no longer able to take part in the hearing. However, it follows from the report by judge S. that Ms Yegorova decided to withdraw the case from the applicant because of her disapproval of the applicant ’ s conduct of the hearing and “the existence of confidential reports by relevant agencies” on the applicant ’ s examination of Zaytsev ’ s case. In the Court ’ s view, the mere suggestion that such considerations may have triggered the transfer of a case under judicial examination from one judge to another should have warranted support for the applicant ’ s allegations. Having overlooked this point, the qualification panel failed to secure a reliable factual foundation for their assessment, and this omission has not been made up for by any of the ensuing instances. Accordingly, the applicant ’ s allegations of pressure have not been convincingly dispelled in the domestic proceedings."

Having concluded on the existence of a factual background for the applicant ’ s criticism, the Court reiterates that the duty of loyalty and discretion owed by civil servants, and particularly the judiciary, requires that the dissemination of even accurate information is carried out with moderation and propriety (see Guja, cited above, and Wille, cited above, § § 64 and 67). It will therefore continue to examine whether the opinions expressed by the applicant on the basis of this information were nevertheless excessive in view of her judicial status."

The Court observes that the applicant made the public criticism with regard to a highly sensitive matter, notably the conduct of various officials dealing with a large-scale corruption case in which she was sitting as a judge. Indeed, her interviews referred to a disconcerting state of affairs, and alleged that instances of pressure on judges were commonplace and that this problem had to be treated seriously if the judicial system was to maintain its independence and enjoy public confidence. There is no doubt that, in so doing, she raised a very important matter of public interest, which should be open to free debate in a democratic society. Her decision to make this information public was based on her personal experience and was taken only after she had been prevented from participating in the trial in her official capacity."

In so far as the applicant ’ s motive for making the impugned statements may be relevant, the Court reiterates that an act motivated by a personal grievance or a personal antagonism or the expectation of personal advantage, including pecuniary gain, would not justify a particularly strong level of protection (see Guja, cited above, § 77). Political speech, on the contrary, enjoys special protection under Article 10 (see the case-law cited in paragraph 87 above). The Court has previously established that even if an issue under debate has political implications, this is not by itself sufficient to prevent a judge from making any statement on the matter (see, Wille, cited above, § 67). The Court notes, and it is not in dispute between the parties in the present case, that the interviews were published in the context of the applicant ’ s election campaign. However, even if the applicant allowed herself a certain degree of exaggeration and generalisation, characteristic of the pre-election agitation, her statements were not entirely devoid of any factual grounds (see paragraph 92 above), and therefore were not to be regarded as a gratuitous personal attack but as a fair comment on a matter of great public importance."

The Court observes that the question of termination of judicial office lay within the competence of the relevant judiciary qualification board, whose decision was subject to judicial review by the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court. It further notes that before the start of the first instance proceedings the applicant requested both the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court to have the case transferred from the Moscow City Court to another court of first instance on the grounds that the former had been implicated in the interviews that caused controversy and that the members of that court would lack objective impartiality for the purposes of her disciplinary proceedings. However, the Moscow City Court considered that it lacked legal capacity to order the transfer, whereas the Supreme Court disregarded the applicant ’ s request and found later, acting as the appeal instance, that the applicant had failed to raise the issue when it was appropriate."

It notes that the disciplinary proceedings entailed the loss of the judicial office she held in the Moscow City Court and of any possibility of exercising the profession of judge. This was undoubtedly a severe penalty and it must have been extremely distressing for the applicant to have lost access to the profession she had exercised for 18 years. This was the strictest available penalty that could be imposed in the disciplinary proceedings and, in the light of the Court ’ s findings above, did not correspond to the gravity of the offence. Moreover, it could undoubtedly discourage other judges in the future from making statements critical of public institutions or policies, for fear of the loss of judicial office."

It did not find the applicant guilty of spreading the impugned statements by any other means. The court found the first statement to be false and defamatory because V.P. had been legally elected as the leader of the collective farm. The court also held the second statement to be defamatory because V.P. had been able to present a diploma from a university in the Russian Federation. In so far as the third statement was concerned, in declaring it defamatory the court relied on a letter of the Prosecutor's Office in reply to the applicant's letter of May 2003, in which the Prosecutor's Office stated that V.P.'s title to the shares was legitimate. As to the fourth statement, the court found that since V.P. had been the leader of the collective farm, he had had the right to administer its property and, therefore, the statement “used by shameless people” was defamatory of V.P. Finally, the court also found the last statement to be defamatory on the basis of a document issued by the police, according to which V.P. did not possess any registered guns. The court did not refer in its reasoning to the submissions of a witness put forward by the applicant, who claimed to have been threatened with a gun by V.P. In calculating the compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered by V.P., the court held that the fact that the impugned letter had been written during the election campaign and that the applicant had been a member of the electoral staff of the candidate running against V.P. in the elections were aggravating factors on the part of the applicant."

It appears that in September 2004 the mayor's office of the applicant's village had made an inquiry of the university in the Russian Federation which V.P. had stated that he had graduated from. According to a letter signed by the president of the university dated 9 September 2004, no person named V.P. had graduated from that university in the year indicated on V.P.'s diploma.

In this respect the Court notes that the applicant's allegation that V.P. had a false diploma was considered to be serious enough by the Prosecutor's Office to initiate criminal proceedings against V.P. The Court would underline that it does not accept the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, namely that the allegations of possession of a false diploma by V.P. should have first been proved in criminal proceedings that ended with a conviction (see paragraph 13 above).

The applicant's letter contained both factual allegations of irregular conduct on the part of V.P. and value judgments about his unethical behaviour. It has been the Court's consistent view that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the rights secured by Article 10 (see Savitchi v. Moldova, no. 11039/02, § 49, 11 October 2005 ). In the present case the Court considers that some of the impugned statements made by the applicant, such as “ V.P. who, as a matter of coincidence, was the leader of the collective farm is shameless...”, “the property [of the collective farm] which was gathered by the people over a very long period of time is now used by shameless people ... ” were value judgments that represented the applicant's subjective appraisal of V.P .'s personality.

Indeed, the courts held that the hyperlinking amounted to dissemination of information and imposed objective liability – a course of action that effectively precluded any balancing between the competing rights, that is to say, the right to reputation of the political party and the right to freedom of expression of the applicant company (see, mutatis mutandis, Magyar Tartalomszolgáltatók Egyesülete and Index.hu Zrt, cited above, § 89). In the Court’s view, such objective liability may have foreseeable negative consequences on the flow of information on the Internet, impelling article authors and publishers to refrain altogether from hyperlinking to material over whose changeable content they have no control.

The Court has established that the second defendant, Roma Produkciós Iroda Alapítvány; the fourth defendant, I.V.; the fifth defendant, Magyar Jeti; the sixth defendant, Inform Média Kft; and the eighth defendant HVG Kiadó Zrt. also violated the plaintiff’s inherent right to be protected against defamation as the second defendant uploaded the first defendant’s false statement to youtube.com, and the fourth defendant made it available and disseminated it on romaclub.hu, the fifth defendant on 444.hu, the sixth defendant on haon.hu and the eighth defendant on hvg.hu.",

Such events are rejected and regarded with disdain by a wide layer of society, and force the legal entity ‘associated’ with the events to explain and clarify its role (or in this case, its lack of role). In the case of a political party with parliamentary representation, this kind of non-pecuniary damage can especially be caused by such a violation of inherent rights committed nearly six months prior to the parliamentary elections.",

The fact that the defendants also included [Mr J.Gy.’s statements] does not infringe the procedure expected of the staff of press outlets in such a situation, [is] not regarded as a deliberately false publication, and therefore does not call for the establishment of whether the employees of the defendants in question failed to examine the veracity of the facts, and in relation to this, failed to act with the precision necessary for the responsible exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of expression.

Contrary to the fifth defendant’s viewpoint as expressed in its appeal, an infringement of the law by dissemination occurs even if the disseminator does not identify with the statement, and even if the disseminator’s trust in the veracity of the statement is ungrounded. Making lawful content available in any form qualifies as dissemination; and the disseminator bears objective responsibility for sharing another person’s unlawful statement owing to the occurrence of the sharing.",

CLI of 2011 on the Constitutional Court (“the Constitutional Court Act”), arguing in essence that under the Civil Code, media outlets assumed objective liability for dissemination of false information, which according to judicial practice meant that media outlets were held liable for the veracity of statements that clearly emanated from third parties. Thus, even if a media organ prepared a balanced and unbiased article on a matter of public interest, it could still be found to be in violation of the law. This would result in an undue burden for publishers, since they could only publish information whose veracity they had established beyond any doubt, making reporting on controversial matters impossible. The applicant company argued that the judicial practice was unconstitutional since it did not examine whether a publisher’s conduct had been in compliance with the ethical and professional rules of journalism, but only whether it had disseminated an untrue statement. In the area of the Internet, where the news value of information was very short-lived, there was simply no time to verify the truthfulness of every statement."

It emphasised that, as established by the lower-level courts, its report on the issue had been balanced. It further maintained that the statement of J.Gy. qualified as an opinion rather than a fact.

The Internet is only one possible alternative for publishing; it is a forum for dissemination, meaning that information and facts are shared through a computer network. An Internet link to one’s own publication serves as an appendix; it becomes accessible and readable with a single click. The Civil Code has established objective liability for dissemination, irrespective of the good or bad faith of the disseminator. In the Kúria ’s view, requiring media outlets not to make injurious statements accessible does not constitute a restriction of freedom of the press or freedom of expression; nor is it an obligation on them which in practice cannot be satisfied.”"

In such cases, according to the Constitutional Court, journalists neither made their own statements, nor did they intend to influence public opinion with their own thoughts. Therefore, the liability of the press for falsehoods was to be distinguished from situations where media content was merely defined by the editors’ and journalists’ own choices and decisions. Specifically, in these situations the aim of a publication was neither to enrich nor to influence public debate with the journalists’ own arguments, but to provide an up-to-date and credible report on the statements of third parties participating in public debates. The interest in a public debate required accurate reporting about press conferences."

The press report had summarised information concerning an event of public interest. A press report fell outside the definition of dissemination only if the aim of the publication was to provide a credible and up-to-date presentation of statements by third parties in a public debate.

Without hyperlinks, most of the information on the Internet would be difficult or impossible to find and accessibility of information on the Internet would be reduced. Article 19 referred to comparative-law material concerning judicial decisions in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States, in particular, showing that hyperlinks alone did not constitute publication but were merely reference tools, similar to footnotes, offering readers the possibility of pursuing further reading of separate publications. Another reason, in the intervener’s opinion, to exclude liability for hyperlinking was that the linked content was liable to change over time without the person who used the hyperlink being made aware of it. Furthermore, in Article 19’s submission, no liability should be imposed unless the person who used the hyperlink was aware that the linked content was unlawful and where the hyperlink was presented in such a way as to expressly endorse the linked content.

The European Publishers’ Council, the Media Law Resource Center Inc., the Newspaper Association of America, BuzzFeed, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Index on Censorship, Professor Lorna Woods, Dr Richard Danbury and Dr Nicole Stremlau jointly submitted that hyperlinking had a number of public-interest benefits, including facilitating the journalistic process by enabling content to be delivered more swiftly and assisting journalists in reporting in a more concise and readily accessible manner, enabling readers to check for themselves the original sources of the journalistic content and thereby to verify the veracity of the publication. Hyperlinking also promoted diversity within the media and facilitated an informed public debate by allowing information and opinions to be more freely expressed and accessed. In the interveners’ submission, the imposition of strict liability for hyperlinking had a chilling effect, since journalists were not in a position themselves to verify the legality of the content on any linked pages and as a consequence would rather refrain from this reporting technique in favour of a more traditional approach. They also pointed out that in practice hyperlinked content could itself be changed so that it ceased to be lawful by the entity which controlled the relevant web page, for which it would be unreasonable to hold the journalist responsible. The imposition of strict liability did not meet a pressing social need because anyone whose rights had been adversely affected by the placing of unlawful content online would be able to seek adequate protection by suing the person who had placed the unlawful content online and requesting that the injurious content be removed. The interveners accepted that there could be situations where a journalist’s or journalistic organisation’s liability arose, for example when they proclaimed specific unlawful content to be true or when they refused to remove a hyperlink to a web page which had been found by a court judgment to contain a substantial amount of illegal content."

Hyperlinks contributed to the development of new media, providing greater (a) interactivity between journalists and readers; (b) credibility, by giving context, facts and sources to support the information; (c) transparency, by allowing readers to trace back the reporting and news gathering process; and (d) critical reading, by allowing journalists and readers to compare contrasting sources.

Turkey, no. 3111/10, § 48, ECHR 2012). At the same time, the risk of harm posed by content and communications on the Internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms, particularly the right to respect for private life, is certainly higher than that posed by the press (see Egill Einarsson v. Iceland, no. 24703/15, § 46, 7 November 2017). Because of the particular nature of the Internet, the “duties and responsibilities” of Internet news portals for the purposes of Article 10 may differ to some degree from those of a traditional publisher, as regards third-party content (see Delfi AS, cited above, § 113). Although Internet news portals are not publishers of third-party comments in the traditional sense, they can assume responsibility under certain circumstances for user-generated content (see Magyar Tartalomszolgáltatók Egyesülete and Index.hu Zrt v.

The domestic courts found that the posting of such a hyperlink automatically qualified as the publication of the defamatory statement, which finding entailed the objective liability of the journalist and the news portal run by the applicant company. The question before the Court is therefore whether the ensuing interference with the applicant company’s rights under Article 10 of the Convention was, in the particular circumstances, based on relevant and sufficient reasons and consequently necessary in a democratic society."

However, no such immunity existed for the dissemination of false or defamatory information falling outside the scope of press conferences, where the standard of objective liability applied, irrespective of the question of whether the author or publisher acted in good or bad faith and in compliance with their journalistic duties and obligations."

Furthermore, bearing in mind the role of the Internet in enhancing the public’s access to news and information, the Court points out that the very purpose of hyperlinks is, by directing to other pages and web resources, to allow Internet users to navigate to and from material in a network characterised by the availability of an immense amount of information. Hyperlinks contribute to the smooth operation of the Internet by making information accessible through linking it to each other."

                "74. Hyperlinks, as a technique of reporting, are essentially different from traditional acts of publication in that, as a general rule, they merely direct users to content available elsewhere on the Internet. They do not present the linked statements to the audience or communicate its content, but only serve to call readers’ attention to the existence of material on another website."

A further distinguishing feature of hyperlinks, compared to acts of dissemination of information, is that the person referring to information through a hyperlink does not exercise control over the content of the website to which a hyperlink enables access, and which might be changed after the creation of the link – a natural exception being if the hyperlink points to content controlled by the same person. Additionally, the content behind the hyperlink has already been made available by the initial publisher on the website to which it leads, providing unrestricted access to the public."

Consequently, given the particularities of hyperlinks, the Court cannot agree with the domestic courts’ approach equating the mere posting of a hyperlink with the dissemination of defamatory information, automatically entailing liability for the content itself. Instead, it considers that the issue of whether the posting of a hyperlink may justifiably, from the perspective of Article 10, give rise to such liability requires an individual assessment in each case, regard being had to a number of elements."

Neither did he use the hyperlink in a context that, in itself, conveyed a defamatory meaning. It can thus be concluded that the impugned article did not amount to an endorsement of the impugned content."
            ],
            [
                "80. In connection with the question of repetition, the Court reiterates that “punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so” (see Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 35, Series A no. 298; Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, § 62, ECHR 2001 ‑ III § 62; and Novaya Gazeta and Milashina v. Russia, no. 45083/06, § 71, 3 October 2017). A general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press’s role of providing information on current events, opinions and ideas (see Thoma, cited above § 64). With these principles in mind, the Court would not rule out the possibility that, in certain particular constellations of circumstances, even the mere repetition of a statement, for example in addition to a hyperlink, may potentially engage the question of liability. This could include situations where a journalist does not act in good faith in accordance with the ethics of journalism and with the diligence expected in responsible journalism dealing with a matter of public interest (see in this respect, for example, Novaya Gazeta and Milashina, cited above, § 72). However, this was not the case in the present application, where, as observed above, the article in question repeated none of the defamatory statements, and the publication was indeed limited to posting the hyperlink."

                "81. As to whether the journalist and the applicant company knew or could reasonably have known that the hyperlink provided access to defamatory or otherwise unlawful content, the Court notes at the outset that the domestic courts, with the exception of the first-instance court, did not find this aspect relevant, and therefore did not examine it. The Court also considers that this issue must be determined in the light of the situation as it presented itself to the author at the material time, rather than with the benefit of hindsight on the basis of the findings of the domestic courts’ judgments. At this juncture, the Court reiterates that an attack on personal honour and reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and must have been carried out in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see Delfi AS, cited above, § 137, and Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 83). Furthermore, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider as regards a politician – or a political party – as such than as regards a private individual. Unlike private individuals, politicians and political parties inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 46, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV)."

Relying on these principles, the Court considers that the journalist in the present case could reasonably have assumed that the content to which he provided access, although perhaps controversial, would remain within the realm of permissible criticism of political parties and, as such, would not be unlawful. Although the statements by J.Gy. were ultimately found to be defamatory because they implied, without a factual basis, that persons associated with Jobbik had committed acts of a racist nature, the Court is satisfied that such utterances could not be seen as clearly unlawful from the outset (contrast Delfi AS, cited above, §§ 136 and 140)."

Indeed, the courts held that the hyperlinking amounted to dissemination of information and imposed objective liability – a course of action that effectively precluded any balancing between the competing rights, that is to say, the right to reputation of the political party and the right to freedom of expression of the applicant company (see, mutatis mutandis, Magyar Tartalomszolgáltatók Egyesülete and Index.hu Zrt, cited above, § 89). In the Court’s view, such objective liability may have foreseeable negative consequences on the flow of information on the Internet, impelling article authors and publishers to refrain altogether from hyperlinking to material over whose changeable content they have no control. This may have, directly or indirectly, a chilling effect on freedom of expression on the Internet."

Thus, the Supreme Court had to determine whether that provision was in conformity with the Constitution. The Supreme Court found that section 31 - 1 of the Imprisonment Act interfered with the right – enshrined in Article 44 § 1 of the Constitution – to freely obtain information disseminated for public use. It noted that the aims of imprisonment included the protection of the legal order and steering detainees towards law-abiding behaviour. As the possibility could not be technically excluded that detainees might misuse the right to use the Internet, access to the Internet was prohibited to them by section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act. The exception made in respect of the official databases of legislation and the database of judicial decisions was necessary in order to ensure that detainees were afforded an effective possibility to protect their own rights. It had to be taken into account that the official texts of legal acts were only accessible to detainees via the Internet."

Granting detainees access to any additional Internet site increased the security risk of their obtaining information running contrary to the aims of imprisonment. Moreover, this could create an opportunity for detainees to use the Internet for purposes other than that of freely obtaining information disseminated for public use. Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that the prohibition of detainees ’ access to the Internet sites www.coe.ee, www.oiguskantsler.ee and www.riigikogu.ee was justified by the need to achieve the aims of imprisonment and in particular the need to secure public safety."

In respect of the proportionality of the restriction the Supreme Court considered that the denial of detainees ’ access to the Internet sites www.coe.ee, www.oiguskantsler.ee and www.riigikogu.ee prevented them from misusing the Internet via these sites and that public safety was thereby protected. Moreover, granting detainees access to these Internet sites could increase the risk of their engaging in prohibited communication; this in turn would necessitate increased levels of control (and therefore costs). Thus, there were no alternative, equally effective means – besides the prohibition imposed by section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act – of achieving the legitimate aim in question. Lastly, the Supreme Court noted that detainees were able to contact the Riigikogu and the Chancellor of Justice by mail and make a request for information ( teabenõue ). Therefore, detainees ’ access to the public information contained on the Internet sites in question was not unduly restricted. Detainees ’ access to the Internet site of the European Court of Human Rights was guaranteed, pursuant to section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act; those of the Council of Europe ’ s conventions and treaties that had been ratified by Estonia were accessible on the Internet site www.riigiteataja.ee. The Supreme Court noted that it did not doubt that the printed works of the Council of Europe were accessible through prison libraries, and nor were detainees prevented from contacting the Council of Europe by post. The Supreme Court concluded that the restriction preventing detainees from accessing the Internet sites www.oiguskantsler.ee, www.riigikogu.ee and www.coe.ee was one of “ low intensity ”; the Supreme Court gave more weight to the aim sought by that restriction. It considered that permitting detainees extensive use of the Internet would increase the likelihood of prison authorities losing control over detainees ’ activities, as it could not be completely excluded that via the Internet sites in question detainees could use the Internet for other, unauthorised purposes. Accordingly, the impugned restriction was in conformity with the Constitution."

They considered that the use of the Internet sites in question did not generally pose a threat to public safety and was in conformity with the aims of imprisonment. It was unclear what additional costs the State would have to bear, since – in line with the applicable law – prisons were equipped with computers specially adapted to allow detainees access to the official databases of legislation and judicial decisions, and the prison service exercised supervision over the use of such resources. The information available on the Internet sites in question aided the exercising of the right of recourse to the courts. While it was true that detainees could also avail themselves of the right to make a request for information, this was a more time-consuming avenue and, particularly in the case of the Internet site of the Chancellor of Justice, required knowledge of which information was available on such Internet sites. No request for information under the Public Information Act ( Avaliku teabe seadus ) could be made to the Council of Europe Information Office in Tallinn. The rulings of the European Court of Human Rights available in the HUDOC database – which was accessible to detainees – were not in Estonian ( unlike the unofficial translations published on the Internet site www.coe.ee ), and it could not be presumed that detainees had sufficient command of English or French to be able to read them. The printed works of the Council of Europe that were available in prison libraries did not include all the information that was published on the Internet site of the Council of Europe Information Office in Tallinn.

As regards the issue of whether the interference was “necessary” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, the Court notes that according to the Government, granting prisoners access to a greater number of Internet sites would have increased security risks and required the allocation of additional material and human resources in order to mitigate such risks. By contrast, the applicant was of the opinion that allowing access to three more websites ( in addition to those already authorised ) would not have given rise to any additional security issues. Possible security issues were already effectively managed by the Ministry of Justice, which blocked any links or other such features on already authorised websites that could cause security concerns; there was no reason, according to the applicant, why this should be different in the case of the three requested additional websites."

The Court notes that the websites of the Council of Europe Information Office in Tallinn, the Chancellor of Justice, and the Riigikogu, to which the applicant wished to have access, predominantly contained legal information and information related to fundamental rights, including the rights of prisoners. For example, the website of the Riigikogu contained bills together with explanatory memoranda to them, verbatim records of the sittings of the Riigikogu, and minutes of committee sittings. The website of the Chancellor of Justice (who is also an ombudsman in Estonia) contained his selected legal opinions. The Court considers that the accessibility of such information promotes public awareness and respect for human rights and gives weight to the applicant ’ s argument that the Estonian courts used such information and the applicant needed access to it for the protection of his rights in the court proceedings. The Court has also taken note of the applicant ’ s argument that legal research in the form of browsing through available information (in order to find relevant information) and making specific requests for information were different matters and that the websites were meant for legal researches rather than making specific requests. Indeed, in order to make a specific request one would need to be aware of which particular information is available in the first place. The Court also notes that the domestic authorities have referred to alternative means of making available to the applicant the information stored on the websites in question (for example, by mail – see paragraph 17 above), but did not compare the costs of these alternative means with the additional costs that extended Internet access would allegedly incur."

The Court notes, in this connection, that when the applicant lodged his complaint with the domestic courts, the Estonian translations and summaries of the Court ’ s judgments were only available on the website of the Council of Europe Information Office and it was only later that this information was published elsewhere – in the online version of Riigi Teataja (see paragraph 40 above)."

The Court cannot overlook the fact that in a number of Council of Europe and other international instruments the public-service value of the Internet and its importance for the enjoyment of a range of human rights has been recognised. Internet access has increasingly been understood as a right, and calls have been made to develop effective policies to attain universal access to the Internet and to overcome the “digital divide” (see paragraphs 23 to 25 above). The Court considers that these developments reflect the important role the Internet plays in people ’ s everyday lives. Indeed, an increasing amount of services and information is only available on the Internet, as evidenced by the fact that in Estonia the official publication of legal acts effectively takes place via the online version of Riigi Teataja and no longer through its paper version (see paragraph 7 above). The Court reiterates that the online version of Riigi Teataja also currently carries Estonian summaries and Estonian translations of the Court ’ s judgments (see paragraph 40 above)."

Lastly, the Court reiterates that under the Imprisonment Act the prisoners have been granted limited access to the Internet via computers specially adapted for that purpose and under the supervision of the prison authorities. Thus, the Court observes that arrangements necessary for the use of the Internet by prisoners have in any event been made and the related costs have been borne by the authorities. While the security and economic considerations cited by the domestic authorities may be considered as relevant, the Court notes that the domestic courts undertook no detailed analysis as to the security risks allegedly emerging from the access to the three additional websites in question, also having regard to the fact that these were websites of State authorities and of an international organisation. The Supreme Court limited its analysis on this point to a rather general statement that granting access to additional Internet sites could increase the risk of detainees engaging in prohibited communication, thus giving rise to the need for increased levels of monitoring. The Court also considers that the Supreme Court and the Government have failed to convincingly demonstrate that giving the applicant access to three additional websites would have caused any noteworthy additional costs. In these circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that sufficient reasons have been put forward in the present case to justify the interference with the applicant ’ s right to receive information."

Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "(ii) The adjective ‘ necessary ’, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘ pressing social need ’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’. ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts. ..”"

Not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas, the public also have a right to receive them (see, with further references, Pentikäinen, cited above, § 88).

Consequently, it is not for this Court, or for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what reporting technique should be adopted by journalists.

S.P. was a municipal civil servant and the impugned article suggested that she had combined her duties in that capacity with employment at two private entities, Strela ZhSK and Strela-3 ZhSK. The Court has consistently held that although it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent politicians do, civil servants acting in an official capacity are, like politicians, subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ III; Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 80, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI; and Dyundin v. Russia, no. 37406/03, § 26, 14 October 2008)."

The Court further observes that the article ’ s subject matter was whether S.P. ’ s behaviour had been in compliance with the rule that municipal civil servants were not allowed to combine the performance of their official functions with other gainful employment. In the Court ’ s view, that issue, relating to the exercise of the functions of a local official, was a matter of legitimate public interest to the readership of the newspaper, the residents of Fryazino (see, for similar reasoning, Ziembiński v. Poland (no. 2), no. 1799/07, § 42, 5 July 2016). The Court thus considers that the domestic margin of appreciation with regard to the protection of S.P. ’ s reputation as a civil servant must be circumscribed by the interests of a democratic society in ensuring and maintaining freedom of the press (see Aleksandr Krutov v. Russia, no. 15469/04, § 27, 3 December 2009)."

                "79. The Court has consistently held that when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of the “protection of the reputation ... of others”, it may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authorities have struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the Convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases, namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by Article 10, and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8 (see, among many other authorities, Annen v. Germany, no. 3690/10, § 55, 26 November 2015 ). The Court emphasises that, in order for Article 8 of the Convention to come into play, an attack on a person ’ s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and its manner must cause prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see A. v. Norway, no. 28070/06, § 64, 9 April 2009, and Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, § 83, 7 February 2012 ). It is not convinced, however, in the circumstances of the present case, that the impugned statements could be considered as an attack reaching the requisite threshold of seriousness and capable of causing prejudice to S.P. ’ s personal enjoyment of private life. In any event, the Court considers that in the defamation proceedings instituted by S.P. the domestic courts did not perform a balancing exercise between the need to protect the plaintiff ’ s reputation and the Convention standard, which requires very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on debates on questions of public interest, thus failing to recognise that the case before them involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and protection of reputation (see, with further references, Reznik v. Russia, no. 4977/05, § 43, 4 April 2013)."
            ],
            [
                "80. The Court further notes that the domestic courts interpreted all the impugned statements as statements of fact. The Court reiterates in this connection that, in assessing whether there was a “pressing social need” capable of justifying interference with the exercise of freedom of expression, a careful distinction needs to be made between facts and value judgments (see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 98, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 of the Convention (see Morice, cited above, § 126 )."
            ],
            [
                "81. The Court is prepared to accept the domestic courts ’ view that the statements relating to S.P. ’ s concurrent employment as head of Strela ZhSK and as a bookkeeper at Strela-3 ZhSK, as well as the allegation that she “allowed financial irregularities” were indeed allegations of fact susceptible of proof. It would differ, however, with the Town Court ’ s conclusion that the applicant did not provide a justification for such allegations. A witness appeared before the Town Court to confirm that S.P. had indeed worked for Strela ZhSK, although she had not concluded a contract of employment with that entity. In the course of the defamation proceedings, a payroll document from Strela ZhSK confirmed that S.P. had received a salary from that association. When initiating criminal proceedings against S.P., the Shchelkovo town prosecutor ’ s office had considered her as “a person performing managerial functions” at Strela ZhSK (see paragraph 8 above). As noted by the applicant, Strela ZhSK had brought civil proceedings against S.P., which had been ongoing before a justice of the peace at the time the article was published (see paragraph 60 above). In the Court ’ s view, those elements were sufficient to demonstrate that, in so far as the impugned statements concerned statements of fact, the applicant relied on a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis proportionate to the nature and degree of factual allegations and thus acted in good faith and complied with the ordinary journalistic obligation to verify a factual allegation (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, § 78 )."
            ],
            [
                "82. Nevertheless, the Town Court chose to disregard those elements. Instead it approached Ya. ’ s statement selectively, focusing on the lack of a contract and ignoring the submission regarding S.P. ’ s de facto employment. The Town Court went on to state that “ the original of the document presented by the witness as a payroll document had not borne a statement to confirm that it was a payroll document ”. Indeed, the Government has raised the same argument before the Court (see paragraph 38 above ). Furthermore, the Town Court ignored the fact that at the time of the defamation proceedings a criminal investigation against S.P. in connection with her activities as head of Strela ZhSK had been ongoing (see paragraphs 8 and 16 above). It chose to employ a definition of “financial irregularities” found in an unauthoritative source to label the applicant ’ s statement as “untrue” (see paragraph 13 above). In view of such a selective approach to the circumstances of the defamation case before them, the Court is not satisfied that the domestic courts carried out an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, with further references, Stoll, cited above, § 101)."

            [
                "83. Regarding the remaining impugned statements relating to S.P. ’ s behaviour in the Public Reception Office, the Court is inclined to agree with the applicant ’ s assertion that they amounted to value judgments (see paragraph 61 above), considering that an assessment of rudeness is indeed an individual matter largely dependent on a listener ’ s perception. It also observes that the value judgments employed in the impugned article had sufficient factual basis (see, among many others, Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 105), as confirmed to the Town Court by two visitors to the Public Reception Office (see paragraph 13 above). The Court has on many occasions pinpointed a structural deficiency of the Russian law on defamation whereby no distinction was made between value judgments and statements of fact, referring uniformly to “statements” ( сведения ), and which proceeded from the assumption that any such “statement” was amenable to proof in civil proceedings (see, with further references, OOO Ivpress and Others, cited above, § 72). It notes that by the time the Town Court examined S.P. ’ s allegations, Resolution no. 3 of the Plenary Supreme Court had already entered into force, instructing Russian courts to distinguish statements of fact from value judgments (see paragraph 34 above). Nevertheless, neither the Town Court nor the Regional Court complied with those guidelines in the course of the proceedings under consideration, thus failing to draw a clear distinction between the two (ibid., § 73)."

                "84. The Court also observes that the impugned statements were not strongly worded, could otherwise be considered as offensive, or constituted a gratuitous personal attack. It is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that S.P. sustained particularly serious emotional suffering simply by virtue of her being a municipal civil servant (see paragraph 43 above). On the contrary, it reiterates its consistent position that the extent of acceptable criticism is narrower as regards private individuals than for civil servants acting in the exercise of their duties (see Palomo Sánchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06 and 2 others, § 71, ECHR 2011)."

In the Court ’ s view, it is clear that the award did not bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered (see Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, 13 July 1995, § 49, Series A no. 316 ‑ B). The fact that the domestic courts failed to recognise the wider limits of permissible criticism in respect of public officials is also relevant in this context (see OOO Ivpress and Others, cited above, § 79)."

It thus concludes for the purposes of the examination of the present case that, as regards the extent of acceptable criticism, L.K. ’ s position as a manager of a local branch of a State unitary enterprise could be likened to that of a civil servant (see paragraph 77 above)."

The Town Court did not dispute the fact that the complaint had been lodged. However, it held that N. had distorted the meaning of the complaint by omitting the word “possibly” when reporting its contents. In doing so, the Town Court disregarded the turn of phrase which N. had employed to mark reported speech, “... as transpires from a complaint by residents to the Shchelkovo town prosecutor ’ s office” (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above). The Regional Court, in turn, did not carry out any analysis of the impugned statement and endorsed the Town Court ’ s findings in a summary fashion (see paragraph 22 above)."

France [GC], no. 40454/07, § 142, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). A general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press ’ s role of providing information on current events, opinions and ideas (see Thoma, cited above, § 64). However, the domestic courts dealing with L.K. ’ s defamation proceedings paid no heed to the fact that the statements did not emanate from the applicant but were clearly identified as someone else ’ s (see Godlevskiy v.

It further reiterates that freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion about the ideas and attitudes of political leaders. More generally, freedom of political debate is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society which prevails throughout the Convention. The limits of acceptable criticism are accordingly wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual. Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance. There is no doubt that Article 10 § 2 of the Convention enables the protection of the reputation of others – that is to say, of all individuals – and that that protection extends to politicians too, even when they are not acting in a private capacity. However, in such cases the requirements of such protection have to be weighed in relation to the interests of open discussion of political issues (see Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, § 42, Series A no. 103)."

For that reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely (see Bowman v. the United Kingdom, 19 February 1998, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I; Długołęcki v.

Nevertheless, they did not consider it when assessing the applicant ’ s liability for the contents of the publication.

In support of this objection the Government relied on a judicial finding by a domestic court against the State for the excessive length of a set of judicial proceedings. The Government explained that the domestic courts could not have adduced the principle of res judicata in the case of the applicant company because decisions given by the chambre du conseil did not constitute res judicata. The Government also enclosed a 16 December 2005 judgment from the Luxembourg District Court and a judgment of 10 December 2009 in which the Court of Appeal had upheld the District Court’s judgment, declaring the Luxembourg State liable for the damage caused by a search, pursuant to section 1(1) of the 1988 Law. Otherwise the applicant company could always have sought compensation for the damage under section 1(1) of the 1988 Law, which provided for compensation for victims of damage, even where the functioning of State services had not been defective, in cases of flagrant injustice."

Moreover, it submitted that section 1 of the 1988 Law included an explicit reservation concerning the res judicata principle which meant that courts dealing with actions for damages pursuant to this Law could not find against the State for any injustices suffered by litigants as the result of a judicial decision (such as the judgment given in the instant case by the chambre du conseil of the Court of Appeal on 27 October 2009) constituting res judicata."

In length of proceedings cases, the diligence of the courts is under scrutiny, not the quality of their judicial activity. On the other hand, the case which was determined with final effect by the 10 December 2009 judgment of the Court of Appeal concerned not the principle of the search but the manner of its execution. The Court of Appeal in fact stated that “ in proceedings seeking to prove State liability vis-à-vis the execution of a search ordered by the investigating judge, it is unacceptable to focus the deliberations on the issue of the lawfulness, expediency and necessity of this investigative measure ”. Accordingly, the Government have not proved that the courts applied to under the 1988 Law would have jurisdiction to assess the necessity of an investigative measure, as the evidence produced shows that only the investigating judge holds such jurisdiction. However, the Government did not establish that it would still have been possible to apply to the investigating judge on this matter. Furthermore, the Government provided no examples of litigants obtaining compensation pursuant to section 1(2) of the 1988 Law.

In the alternative, the Government contended that the interference in question had been legally justified, had pursued the legitimate aims of preventing disorder and crime and protecting the rights and freedoms of others, and that it had been necessary in a democratic society. Confronted with facts which had constituted prima facie evidence of offences, it had been incumbent on the judicial authorities to initiate the requisite investigation for ascertaining the circumstances of the case in hand. The Government submitted that publishing companies could not be exempted from the implementation of criminal legislation, and that the impugned article had been published under a name which did not appear in the list of journalists officially recognised in Luxembourg, a fact which had necessitated investigations in order to identify the author of the article. Moreover, the interference had been fairly unintrusive given that the police officers had not actively searched for documents, all the documents seized had been voluntarily handed over by the journalist and the search and seizure had actually been in the journalist’s and the publishing house’s best interests. Furthermore, the investigating judge had only being doing his duty, since he had been obliged to gather both incriminating and exonerating evidence and since seizure was the only way to take possession of objects, even where they were handed over voluntarily."

The word “ domicile ” in the French version of Article 8 has a broader connotation than “home” and may, for example, also refer to a professional person’s office. Consequently, “home” is to be construed as including also the registered office of a company run by a private individual and a legal entity’s registered office, branches or other business premises (see Buck v. Germany, no. 41604/98, § 31, ECHR 2005-I; see also Société Colas Est and Others v. France, no. 37971/97, § 41, ECHR 2002-III, and Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH v.

Furthermore, no other name comprising these elements appears in the list. The list also points out that “De Araujo Martins Domingos Alberto” works for the newspaper Contacto. Therefore, the similarity in the names, the exclusiveness of the elements of the names and the connection with the newspaper in question forge an obvious link between the author of the impugned article and the person appearing on the list. Drawing on these elements, the investigating judge could have begun by ordering a less intrusive measure than a search in order to confirm the identity of the author of the article, if he had continued to deem such action necessary.

The search warrant conferred fairly extensive powers on the investigators (compare in this connection Roemen and Schmit, cited above, § 70). From this angle, the Court notes that the police officers, who were alone in carrying out the search, without any safeguards, were responsible for assessing the need to seize any given items."

                "61. Even though the Court cannot deduce from the evidence provided by the parties whether the purpose of the search was to disclose the journalist’s sources, the wording of the warrant is clearly too broad to rule out that possibility. The Court cannot accept the Government’s explanation that the sources were already mentioned in the impugned article. The fact of some sources having been published did not rule out the discovery of other potential sources during the search. The Court considers that the impugned search and seizure were disproportionate inasmuch as they enabled the police officers to search for the journalist’s sources. The Court notes that the insertion of a USB memory stick into a computer is a procedure which can facilitate the retrieval of data from the computer’s memory, thus supplying the authorities with information unrelated to the offence in question. The warrant of 30 March 2009 was not sufficiently narrow in scope to prevent possible abuse. In view of the Government’s contention before the Court that the sole aim of the search was to ascertain the real identity of the journalist who had written the article, a more succinct wording only mentioning this aim would have been sufficient."

According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court notes that the bills produced include costs other than those related to the application to have the warrant in issue declared void. Although the applicant company is only claiming partial reimbursement, it has failed to provide documentary evidence of the amount claimed. The Court therefore decides to make no award to the applicant company in respect of this part of its claim. As to the costs and expenses for the proceedings before the Court, based on a separate bill, the Court considers that they should be charged in their entirety to the respondent State. Accordingly, having regard to the documents in its possession and its case-law, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 5,635 for the proceedings before the Court and awards that sum to the applicant company."
