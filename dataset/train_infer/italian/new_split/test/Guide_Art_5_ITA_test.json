                "115. The Court reiterates that the difference between deprivation of liberty and restrictions on liberty of movement, the latter being governed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, is merely one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance. Although the process of classification into one or other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of Article 5 depends (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, §§ 92-93, Series A no. 39). In order to determine whether someone has been deprived of his liberty, the starting-point must be his specific situation and account must be taken of a whole range of factors such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see Storck, cited above, § 71, and Guzzardi, cited above, § 92)."

On an unspecified date in 2000, at the request of the applicant’s two relatives, the Ruse regional prosecutor applied to the Ruse Regional Court ( Окръжен съд ) for a declaration of total legal incapacity in respect of the applicant. In a judgment of 20 November 2000, the court declared the applicant to be partially incapacitated on the grounds that he had been suffering from simple schizophrenia since 1975, and that his ability to manage his own affairs and interests and to realise the consequences of his own acts had been impaired. The court found that the applicant’s condition was not so serious as to warrant a declaration of total incapacity. It observed, in particular, that during the period from 1975 to 2000 he had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital on several occasions. The court took into account an expert medical report produced in the course of the proceedings and interviewed the applicant. Furthermore, according to certain other people it interviewed, the applicant had sold all his possessions, begged for a living, spent all his money on alcohol and became aggressive whenever he drank."

The applicant’s lawyer challenged the refusal to bring the action, arguing that her client should have the opportunity to assess by himself whether or not, having regard to the living conditions at the home, it was in his interests to remain there. She pointed out that the enforced continuation of his stay in the home, on the pretext of providing him with treatment in his own interests, amounted in practice to a deprivation of liberty, a situation that was unacceptable. A person could not be placed in an institution without his or her consent. In accordance with the legislation in force, anyone under partial guardianship was free to choose his or her place of residence, with the guardian’s agreement. The choice of residence was therefore not a matter within the competence of the prosecution service.

Adults with milder forms of such disorders are to be partially incapacitated. Persons who are entirely deprived of legal capacity are placed under full guardianship ( настойничество ), whereas those who are partially incapacitated are placed under partial guardianship ( попечителство – literally “trusteeship”). In accordance with sections 4 and 5 of the Act, persons under partial guardianship may not perform legal transactions without their guardian’s consent.

In cases of unauthorised leave, the police had the power to search for and return the persons concerned.

Otherwise, there would be a sizeable gap in the protection from arbitrary detention, which would be inconsistent with the importance of personal liberty in a democratic society. The State is therefore obliged to take measures providing effective protection of vulnerable persons, including reasonable steps to prevent a deprivation of liberty of which the authorities have or ought to have knowledge (see Storck, cited above, § 102). Thus, having regard to the particular circumstances of the cases before it, the Court has held that the national authorities’ responsibility was engaged as a result of detention in a psychiatric hospital at the request of the applicant’s guardian (see Shtukaturov, cited above) and detention in a private clinic (see Storck, cited above).",

The Court observes at the outset that it is unnecessary in the present case to determine whether, in general terms, any placement of a legally incapacitated person in a social care institution constitutes a “deprivation of liberty” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1. In some cases, the placement is initiated by families who are also involved in the guardianship arrangements and is based on civil-law agreements signed with an appropriate social care institution. Accordingly, any restrictions on liberty in such cases are the result of actions by private individuals and the authorities’ role is limited to supervision. The Court is not called upon in the present case to rule on the obligations that may arise under the Convention for the authorities in such situations."

No members of the applicant’s family were involved in his guardianship arrangements, and the duties of guardian were assigned to a State official (Ms R.P.), who negotiated and signed the placement agreement with the Pastra social care home without any contact with the applicant, whom she had in fact never met. The placement agreement was implemented in a State-run institution by social services, which likewise did not interview the applicant (see paragraphs 12-15 above). The applicant was never consulted about his guardian’s choices, even though he could have expressed a valid opinion and his consent was necessary in accordance with the Persons and Family Act 1949 (see paragraph 42 above). That being so, he was not transferred to the Pastra social care home at his request or on the basis of a voluntary private-law agreement on admission to an institution to receive social assistance and protection. The Court considers that the restrictions complained of by the applicant are the result of various steps taken by public authorities and institutions through their officials, from the initial request for his placement in an institution and throughout the implementation of the relevant measure, and not of acts or initiatives by private individuals. Although there is no indication that the applicant’s guardian acted in bad faith, the above considerations set the present case apart from Nielsen (cited above), in which the applicant’s mother committed her son, a minor, to a psychiatric institution in good faith, which prompted the Court to find that the measure in question entailed the exercise of exclusive custodial rights over a child who was not capable of expressing a valid opinion."

The Court observes in this connection that there are situations where the wishes of a person with impaired mental faculties may validly be replaced by those of another person acting in the context of a protective measure and that it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the true wishes or preferences of the person concerned. However, the Court has already held that the fact that a person lacks legal capacity does not necessarily mean that he is unable to comprehend his situation (see Shtukaturov, cited above, § 108). In the present case, domestic law attached a certain weight to the applicant’s wishes and it appears that he was well aware of his situation.

In support of that contention, the applicant argued that the Director of the home had deemed him capable of integrating into the community and that attempts had been made to bring him closer to his family, albeit to no avail. Accordingly, the authorities had based their decision to place him in the home on the simple fact that his family were not prepared to take care of him and he needed social assistance. They had not examined whether the necessary assistance could be provided through alternative measures that were less restrictive of his personal liberty. Such measures were, moreover, quite conceivable since Bulgarian legislation made provision for a wide range of social services, such as personal assistance, social rehabilitation centres and special allowances and pensions. The authorities had thus failed to strike a fair balance between the applicant’s social needs and his right to liberty.

The Court had held that the lack of any fixed procedural rules on the admission and detention of such persons was striking. In its view, the contrast between this dearth of regulation and the extensive network of safeguards applicable to formal psychiatric committals covered by mental-health legislation was significant. In the absence of a formalised admission procedure, indicating who could propose admission, for what reasons and on what basis, and given the lack of indication as to the length of the detention or the nature of treatment or care, the hospital’s health-care professionals had assumed full control of the liberty and treatment of a vulnerable incapacitated person solely on the basis of their own clinical assessments completed as and when they saw fit. While not doubting that those professionals had acted in good faith and in the applicant’s best interests, the Court had observed that the very purpose of procedural safeguards was to protect individuals against any misjudgments and professional lapses (ibid., §§ 120-21)."

While it is true that Article 5 § 1 (e) authorises the confinement of a person suffering from a mental disorder even where no medical treatment is necessarily envisaged (see Hutchison Reid, cited above, § 52), such a measure must be properly justified by the seriousness of the person’s condition in the interests of ensuring his or her own protection or that of others.

The Court reiterates that Article 5 § 4 entitles detained persons to institute proceedings for a review of compliance with the procedural and substantive conditions which are essential for the “lawfulness”, in Convention terms, of their deprivation of liberty. The notion of “lawfulness” under paragraph 4 of Article 5 has the same meaning as in paragraph 1, so that a detained person is entitled to a review of the “lawfulness” of his detention in the light not only of the requirements of domestic law but also of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 § 1. Article 5 § 4 does not guarantee a right to judicial review of such a scope as to empower the court, on all aspects of the case including questions of pure expediency, to substitute its own discretion for that of the decision-making authority. The review should, however, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the “lawful” detention of a person according to Article 5 § 1 (see E. v. Norway, 29 August 1990, § 50, Series A no. 181-A). The reviewing “court” must not have merely advisory functions but must have the competence to “decide” the “lawfulness” of the detention and to order release if the detention is unlawful (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 200, Series A no. 25; Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 61, Series A no. 114; Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, § 130, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V; and A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, § 202, ECHR 2009)."

The Convention requirement for an act of deprivation of liberty to be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny is of fundamental importance in the context of the underlying purpose of Article 5 of the Convention to provide safeguards against arbitrariness. What is at stake is both the protection of the physical liberty of individuals and their personal security (see Varbanov, cited above, § 58). In the case of detention on the ground of mental illness, special procedural safeguards may be called for in order to protect the interests of persons who, on account of their mental disabilities, are not fully capable of acting for themselves (see, among other authorities, Winterwerp, cited above, § 60)."

Furthermore, since the applicant’s placement in the home is not recognised as a deprivation of liberty in Bulgarian law (see paragraph 58 above), there is no provision for any domestic legal remedies by which to challenge its lawfulness in terms of a deprivation of liberty.

In the Court’s view, the need to seek the intervention of the public prosecutor is scarcely reconcilable with direct access to court for persons under partial guardianship in so far as the decision to intervene is left to the prosecutor’s discretion.

However, the importance of exercising these rights will vary according to the purpose of the action which the person concerned intends to bring before the courts. In particular, the right to ask a court to review a declaration of incapacity is one of the most important rights for the person concerned since such a procedure, once initiated, will be decisive for the exercise of all the rights and freedoms affected by the declaration of incapacity, not least in relation to any restrictions that may be placed on the person’s liberty (see also Shtukaturov, cited above, § 71).

The Court recalls that in proclaiming the \"right to liberty\", paragraph 1 of Article 5 (art. 5-1) is contemplating the physical liberty of the person; its aim is to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of this liberty in an arbitrary fashion. As was pointed out by those appearing before the Court, the paragraph is not concerned with mere restrictions on liberty of movement; such restrictions are governed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2) which has not been ratified by Italy. In order to determine whether someone has been \"deprived of his liberty\" within the meaning of Article 5 (art. 5), the starting point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see the Engel and others judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 24, par. 58-59)."

It demonstrates very clearly the extent of the difference between the applicant ’ s treatment on Asinara and classic detention in prison or strict arrest imposed on a serviceman (see the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, p. 26, par. 63). Deprivation of liberty may, however, take numerous other forms. Their variety is being increased by developments in legal standards and in attitudes; and the Convention is to be interpreted in the light of the notions currently prevailing in democratic States (see notably the Tyrer judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, pp. 15-16, par. 31).",
                "Whilst the area around which the applicant could move far exceeded the dimensions of a cell and was not bounded by any physical barrier, it covered no more than a tiny fraction of an island to which access was difficult and about nine-tenths of which was occupied by a prison. Mr. Guzzardi was housed in part of the hamlet of Cala Reale which consisted mainly of the buildings of a former medical establishment which were in a state of disrepair or even dilapidation, a carabinieri station, a school and a chapel. He lived there principally in the company of other persons subjected to the same measure and of policemen. The permanent population of Asinara resided almost entirely at Cala d ’ Oliva, which Mr. Guzzardi could not visit, and would appear to have made hardly any use of its right to go to Cala Reale. Consequently, there were few opportunities for social contacts available to the applicant other than with his near family, his fellow \"residents\" and the supervisory staff. Supervision was carried out strictly and on an almost constant basis. Thus, Mr. Guzzardi was not able to leave his dwelling between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. without giving prior notification to the authorities in due time. He had to report to the authorities twice a day and inform them of the name and number of his correspondent whenever he wished to use the telephone. He needed the consent of the authorities for each of his trips to Sardinia or the mainland, trips which were rare and, understandably, made under the strict supervision of the carabinieri. He was liable to punishment by \"arrest\" if he failed to comply with any of his obligations. Finally, more than sixteen months elapsed between his arrival at Cala Reale and his departure for Force (see paragraphs 11, 12, 21, 23-42 and 51 above).",
                "It is admittedly not possible to speak of \"deprivation of liberty\" on the strength of any one of these factors taken individually, but cumulatively and in combination they certainly raise an issue of categorisation from the viewpoint of Article 5 (art. 5). In certain respects the treatment complained of resembles detention in an \"open prison\" or committal to a disciplinary unit (see the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, p. 26, par. 64). On 20 January 1976, the Milan Regional Court had let it be understood that it did not regard that treatment as satisfactory. The administrative authorities also had some misgivings for they investigated the possibility of taking remedial measures; since they did not pursue the matter in the face of the expense involved and the time needed, the Ministry of the Interior decided in August 1977 to strike Asinara out of the list of places for compulsory residence (see paragraphs 2 0 and 43 above). Two telegrams from the Ministry to the Milan Chief of Police, dated 19 and 23 August 1977 and concerning one Alberti Gerlando, establish that this decision was not unconnected with application no 7367/76 even though Mr. Guzzardi had already left Cala Reale; the Government appended these telegrams to their memorial of May 1980. Several items of the documentary evidence filed thus show that the island was not suitable for a normal application of the 1956 and 1965 Acts. This was eventually recognised by the Italian State.",

In addition, the decision referred to a non-existent district since in point of fact the island was no more than a sub-division of the district of Porto Torres ( Sardinia ). Mr. Catalano requested the Court of Appeal, in the first place, to quash the decision in its entirety; in the alternative, to limit it to special supervision without an order for compulsory residence; in the further alternative, to designate a district in Northern Italy where the applicant might find work, live with his family, meet with his lawyer in order to prepare his defence in the criminal proceedings and attend, as and when necessary, an urological clinic to receive the treatment required by his state of health."

It found no good reason for regarding Asinara as an unsuitable locality for compulsory residence. It emphasised that the contested measure was designed to separate the individual from his milieu and render his contacts with it more difficult. This requirement took precedence over other problems, such as the absence of regular employment and of adequate accommodation for a family; moreover, at the time of his marriage the applicant could not have hoped to live with his wife and son since he was then in detention on remand and under a serious charge. His criminal record, the most disquieting criminal activities in which he engaged under the cloak of honesty, his violent character and his exceptional cunning showed that he presented a marked danger to society ( spiccata pericolosità sociale ).

                "(i) It was not permissible under section 3 of the 1956 Act to make an order for a person ’ s compulsory residence - which amounted to subjecting him to a \"judicial sanction\" limiting his private and family liberty ( libertà privata e famigliare ) - on any scrap of land ( qualunque pezzo di terra), such as Asinara, regardless of its area ( quali che siano i metri quadrati entro cui si deve osservare il soggiorno ), rather than on the whole of the territory of a district. The contrary interpretation adopted by the Court of Appeal was \"restrictive and aberrant\" and disregarded a man ’ s right to private and family life ( alla vita privata e famigliare ) which was guaranteed by the European Convention and the Italian Constitution. If the Court of Cassation were nevertheless inclined to follow that interpretation, it should refer the matter to the Constitutional Court.",
                "(ii) The Court of Appeal ’ s statement that Mr. Guzzardi did not need any particular medical treatment was a misrepresentation of the facts ( travisamento dei fatti ).",
                "The law did not permit any curtailment of legal interests which it protected, conferred and made mandatory (non consent[iva] veruno affievolimento di situazioni giuridiche tutelate, volute e pretese proprio dalla legge ). It followed that the Court of Appeal had applied the law incorrectly (errata applicazione della legge ) when it held that the necessity for special supervision justified such curtailment.",
                "(iii) Finally, the reasoning was contradictory ( contraddittorietà ) in various respects. Thus, the Court of Appeal had - without an investigation on the spot - deemed Asinara to be suitable for the execution of the measure complained of although the applicant would not there be able to comply with the directives contained in the Milan Regional Court ’ s decision.",
                "Mr. Catalano therefore requested the Court of Cassation to quash the judgment of 12 March 1975 after transmitting the file to the Constitutional Court for the purpose of obtaining a ruling that section 3 of the 1956 Act, as interpreted by the Court of Appeal, was incompatible with Article 13, fourth paragraph, and Article 27, second and third paragraphs, of the Constitution.",
                "Article 13 concerns \"personal liberty\" : the fourth paragraph provides that \"the infliction of any physical or mental violence on persons subjected to any form of restriction on their liberty shall be a punishable offence\". The second paragraph of Article 27 enshrines the presumption of innocence; the third paragraph stipulates that \"punishment may not take the form of treatment repugnant to feelings of humanity and must be aimed at re-education of the convicted person\"."

Likewise, the \"curtailment\" of, and the \"undoubted limitations\" on, \"various rights of the individual concerned\" stemmed directly from the application of measures which had on numerous occasions been recognised to be in conformity with the Constitution, for example in a judgment delivered by the Constitutional Court on 15 June 1972.",

It requested him to cancel ( abolire ) the compulsory residence order, maintaining that if the President, or someone designated by him for the purpose, were to visit Asinara, he would be left in no doubt that the obligation to live there was contrary to the law, the legislation, justice and individual human rights.",

First of all, it affirmed that the implementation of preventive measures was a matter within the competence of the police authorities ( pubblica sicurezza ) and not of the judge supervising the execution of sentences. It added that exigencies of the protection of society justified the special form of isolation undergone by those sent to Asinara, namely individuals who were extremely dangerous. However, those exigencies necessitated neither separating those concerned from their families nor depriving them of regular employment.

Their argument ran as follows. In order to bring a case before the Commission, a \"person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals\" must claim to be the victim \"of a violation ... of the rights set forth in [the] Convention\". By these words, Article 25 (art. 25) identified both the persons empowered to lodge an application and the object of the proceedings instituted before the Commission and then, if appropriate, before the Court, namely a finding that the breach alleged by the applicant did occur. However, Mr. Guzzardi initially invoked only Articles 3, 8 and 9 (art. 3, art. 8, art. 9) of the Convention and Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2) (see paragraph 53 above). Whilst the characterisation in law to be given to a contested measure was a matter for the trial judge, the Commission had overlooked another general principle, that is to say the obligation to limit the decision to facts adduced by the litigant. In order to find a violation of Article 5 (art. 5), the Commission had relied on circumstances which Mr. Catalano had mentioned neither in his first letter, dated 17 November 1975, nor in the application form and explanatory memorandum of 30 January 1976, those circumstances being the restriction to 2.5 sq. km. of the area reserved for persons in compulsory residence, the almost permanent supervision, the impossibility of making social contacts and the length of the compulsory residence.

Never at any relevant moment had Mr. Guzzardi invoked, even in substance, the right embodied in Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention. He had in no way claimed to be deprived, in practice, of his liberty at Cala Reale; the Commission had erred in affirming the contrary when it ruled on the admissibility of his complaints. Furthermore, the procedure laid down by section 4 of the 1956 Act was concerned solely with the lawfulness of the compulsory residence order, whereas the settling of the arrangements for implementing the order was a matter for discretionary administrative decisions and hence fell outside the jurisdiction of the courts. This was so, for example, as regards the designation of the district where the person was to reside: the court merely \"took formal notice\" of the place \"specified\" by the administrative authority and, subject where necessary to a review of lawfulness, \"recorded\" the latter ’ s choice. This, so the Government maintained, was precisely what occurred in the present case."

In addition, the request was addressed to another authority lacking jurisdiction, namely the Milan Regional Court : in fact it declared itself to be without jurisdiction on 20 January 1976 whilst at the same time directing that the text of its decision be communicated to the Minister of the Interior and the Sassari Chief of Police. With regard to his living conditions on the island, in particular the limited space available, Mr. Guzzardi had not exercised any remedy either before the competent administrative authorities or, in the event of his representations being rejected, before a court - whether ordinary or administrative - in pursuance of Article 113 of the Constitution."

He asserted that he was physically and psychologically a prisoner on Asinara and was vegetating there in conditions worse than those of his detention on remand. He even described Cala Reale as a \"veritable concentration camp\". He requested that an investigation be carried out on the spot and invited the Court of Appeal to quash in its entirety the first instance decision of 30 January 1975; in the alternative to limit it to special supervision without an order for compulsory residence; in the further alternative, to direct that he be transferred to a district in Northern Italy (see paragraphs 13 and 16 above).",

It emphasised that the contested measure was designed to separate Mr. Guzzardi from his milieu and render his contacts with it more difficult. This requirement took precedence over other problems. Supervision of an individual as dangerous as the applicant was sufficiently important to justify the curtailment of other individual legal interests taken into account by the law (see paragraph 17 above).",

Admittedly, it is for each Contracting State to establish appropriate courts and tribunals, to set the limits on their jurisdiction and to lay down the conditions for bringing cases before them. However, Article 26 (art. 26), which refers to \"the generally recognised rules of international law\", should be applied with a certain degree of flexibility and without excessive regard for matters of form (see the Stögmüller judgment of 10 November 1969, Series A no. 9, p. 42, par. 11; the above-mentioned Ringeisen judgment, pp. 37-38, par. 89 and 92; the Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 17, 29 in fine; the Commission ’ s decision of 11 January 1961 on the admissibility of application no. 788/60, Austria v.

He did not, it is true, rely expressly on Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention; he confined himself to mentioning the Convention as a whole in the general context of the living conditions at Cala Reale. However, a more specific reference was not essential in the circumstances since it did not constitute the sole means of achieving the aim pursued. Before the Italian courts, the applicant adduced arguments such as to show that the manner in which the 1956 Act had been applied to him resulted in the measures restricting an individual ’ s liberty authorised by that Act being transformed into a veritable deprivation of liberty suffered in a locality which he went so far as to describe as a concentration camp in which he was imprisoned. He therefore derived from the Italian legislation pleas equivalent, in the Court ’ s view, to an allegation of a breach of the right guaranteed by Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention (see paragraph 71 above). In so doing, he provided the national courts, in particular the Court of Appeal, with the opportunity which is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by Article 26 (art. 26), namely the opportunity of putting right the violations alleged against them (see the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 29, par. 50; the Airey judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 10, par. 18). If his appeal to the Court of Cassation proved unsuccessful, on account of the impossibility of emphasising the issue of deprivation of liberty with the degree of precision called for, this was probably due to the limits on the powers of that Court: having jurisdiction on issues of law, it could scarcely take cognisance as an issue of fact of the situation obtaining on Asinara nor find in the decision of the Court of Appeal any material on which it could determine whether there existed a condition of detention incompatible with Italian law, of which the Convention forms an integral part."

The Court of Appeal, after instructing its registry to obtain information from the carabinieri in Sassari, came to the conclusion that neither the applicant ’ s state of health nor any other good reason caused Asinara to be unsuitable as a place for compulsory residence; the Court explained in detail why it judged a \"curtailment of ... individual legal interests taken into account by the law\" to be warranted on the facts (see paragraphs 14, 15 and 17 above). The Court of Cassation, for its part, accepted the submissions of the public prosecutor and dismissed the appeal as being devoid of foundation rather than inadmissible (see paragraph 19 above).",

On the other hand, the Government maintained that in this connection the courts confined themselves to recording the choice effected by the administrative authorities, subject to reviewing its lawfulness. Be that as it may, an irregularity may stem from the factual conditions prevailing in the locality specified by the police; in substance this was what Mr. Guzzardi pleaded had occurred in his case.",

Both applications were dealt with on 20 January 1976, in a single decision. The Regional Court first of all declared, in contrast to an Order by the Milan Court of Appeal (dated 27 October 1975), that the implementation of preventive measures was the responsibility of the police and not of the judge supervising the execution of sentences. It did not, however, confine itself to this remark and did not decline its own jurisdiction in the matter: exigencies of the protection of society, it added, justified the special form of isolation undergone by persons residing at Cala Reale. It was apparently for this reason of substance that the Regional Court dismissed the applications (respin[s]e le istanze ), whilst letting it be understood that the applicant ’ s living conditions should be improved and directing that a copy of its decision be communicated to the Minister of the Interior and to the Sassari questore (see paragraph 20 above).",

The factors listed above were not sufficient to render the situation of persons in compulsory residence on the island comparable to the situation of prisoners as laid down by Italian law; there existed a whole series of fundamental differences that the Commission had wrongly overlooked. The distinguishing characteristic of freedom was less the amount of space available than the manner in which it could be utilised; a good many districts in Italy and elsewhere were less than 2.5 sq. km. in area. The applicant was able to leave and return to his dwelling as he wished between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. His wife and son lived with him for fourteen of the some sixteen months he spent on Asinara; the inviolability of his home and of the intimacy of his family life, two rights that the Convention guaranteed solely to free people, were respected. Even as regards his social relations, he was treated much more favourably than someone in penal detention: he was at liberty to meet, within the boundaries of Cala Reale, the members of the small community of free people - about two hundred individuals - living on the island, notably at Cala d ’ Oliva; to go to Sardinia or the mainland if so authorised; to correspond by letter or telegram without any control; to use the telephone, subject to notifying the carabiniere of the name and number of his correspondent. The supervision of which he complained constituted the raison d ’ être of the measure ordered in his respect. Finally, the fact that more than sixteen months elapsed before his transfer to Force was of itself of no relevance (see paragraph 7 of the memorial of December 1979 and the oral pleadings of 29 January 1980 )."

In order to determine whether someone has been \"deprived of his liberty\" within the meaning of Article 5 (art. 5), the starting point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see the Engel and others judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 24, par. 58-59)."

It demonstrates very clearly the extent of the difference between the applicant ’ s treatment on Asinara and classic detention in prison or strict arrest imposed on a serviceman (see the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, p. 26, par. 63). Deprivation of liberty may, however, take numerous other forms. Their variety is being increased by developments in legal standards and in attitudes; and the Convention is to be interpreted in the light of the notions currently prevailing in democratic States (see notably the Tyrer judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, pp. 15-16, par. 31).",
                "Whilst the area around which the applicant could move far exceeded the dimensions of a cell and was not bounded by any physical barrier, it covered no more than a tiny fraction of an island to which access was difficult and about nine-tenths of which was occupied by a prison. Mr. Guzzardi was housed in part of the hamlet of Cala Reale which consisted mainly of the buildings of a former medical establishment which were in a state of disrepair or even dilapidation, a carabinieri station, a school and a chapel. He lived there principally in the company of other persons subjected to the same measure and of policemen. The permanent population of Asinara resided almost entirely at Cala d ’ Oliva, which Mr. Guzzardi could not visit, and would appear to have made hardly any use of its right to go to Cala Reale. Consequently, there were few opportunities for social contacts available to the applicant other than with his near family, his fellow \"residents\" and the supervisory staff. Supervision was carried out strictly and on an almost constant basis. Thus, Mr. Guzzardi was not able to leave his dwelling between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. without giving prior notification to the authorities in due time. He had to report to the authorities twice a day and inform them of the name and number of his correspondent whenever he wished to use the telephone. He needed the consent of the authorities for each of his trips to Sardinia or the mainland, trips which were rare and, understandably, made under the strict supervision of the carabinieri. He was liable to punishment by \"arrest\" if he failed to comply with any of his obligations. Finally, more than sixteen months elapsed between his arrival at Cala Reale and his departure for Force (see paragraphs 11, 12, 21, 23-42 and 51 above).",

In certain respects the treatment complained of resembles detention in an \"open prison\" or committal to a disciplinary unit (see the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, p. 26, par. 64). On 20 January 1976, the Milan Regional Court had let it be understood that it did not regard that treatment as satisfactory. The administrative authorities also had some misgivings for they investigated the possibility of taking remedial measures; since they did not pursue the matter in the face of the expense involved and the time needed, the Ministry of the Interior decided in August 1977 to strike Asinara out of the list of places for compulsory residence (see paragraphs 2 0 and 43 above). Two telegrams from the Ministry to the Milan Chief of Police, dated 19 and 23 August 1977 and concerning one Alberti Gerlando, establish that this decision was not unconnected with application no 7367/76 even though Mr. Guzzardi had already left Cala Reale; the Government appended these telegrams to their memorial of May 1980.

In paragraph 1 of section 1, the 1956 Act refers to \"idlers and habitual vagrants who are fit for work\", a phrase clarified by the Constitutional Court in its judgment no. 23 of 23 March 1964. In the Government ’ s opinion, the imposition on a \"vagrant\" of preventive measures restricting, or even depriving him of, his liberty was justified, under the Convention and Italian law, not so much by his lack of a fixed abode as by the absence of any apparent occupational activity (\" attività lavorativa palese \") and, hence, the impossibility of identifying the source of his means of subsistence. The existence of this danger factor, the Government continued, was recognised by the Milan Regional Court in its decision of 30 January 1975 (see paragraph 12 above); in addition and above all, that Court took notice of the far more serious risk stemming from the applicant ’ s links with mafia associations which engaged in kidnapping with a view to extracting ransoms. According to the Government, provision could not be made in an international instrument for the typically Italian phenomenon of the mafia, yet it would be an absurd conclusion to regard Article 5 par. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e) as allowing vagrants but not presumed mafiosi to be deprived of their liberty."

These authorities relied on the 1956 Act solely in combination with the 1965 Act which concerns individuals whom there are strong reasons to suspect of belonging to mafia-type associations (see paragraph 52 above). What is more, they in no way described or depicted Mr. Guzzardi as a vagrant. Admittedly, they noted, in passing, that there were serious doubts as to whether he really worked as a mason as he claimed, but they laid much greater stress on his record, his illegal activities, his contacts with habitual criminals and still more his links with the mafia. The Chief of Police even said that no state of poverty, idleness or vagrancy furnished an explanation for this criminal conduct (\"manifestazioni criminose che non hanno una causa giustificativa in uno stato di indigenza ovvero di ozio o di vagabondaggio\").",

In any event, the phrase under examination is not adapted to a policy of general prevention directed against an individual or a category of individuals who, like mafiosi, present a danger on account of their continuing propensity to crime; it does no more than afford the Contracting States a means of preventing a concrete and specific offence. This can be seen both from the use of the singular (\"an offence\", \"celle-ci\" in the French text; see the Matznetter judgment of 10 November 1969, Series A no. 10, pp. 40 and 43, separate opinions of Mr. Balladore Pallieri and Mr. Zekia) and from the object of Article 5 (art. 5), namely to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of his liberty in an arbitrary fashion (see the above-mentioned Winterwerp judgment, p. 16, par. 37)."

That case concerned the confinement of an individual who was of the requisite age but lacked the capacity to consent in a psychiatric institution he had never attempted to leave; the Court found that there had been a deprivation of liberty. In the present case, a fortiori, it must be concluded that there was a deprivation of liberty. The applicant ’ s lack of consent must also be regarded as the decisive feature distinguishing the present case from that of H.M. v. Switzerland (cited above, § 46), in which it was held that the placing of an elderly person in a foster home to ensure the necessary medical care had not amounted to a deprivation of liberty. However, the applicant in that case, who had been legally capable of expressing a view, had been undecided as to whether or not she wanted to stay in the nursing home. The clinic was then able to draw the conclusion that she did not object."

Even though Dr Heines ’ s clinic was a private institution, the State had been involved in her stay and treatment there since her sickness had been covered by compulsory health insurance ( gesetzliche Krankenversicherung ). This had created a public-law relationship between the clinic and the insurance company, as well as between the clinic and the applicant herself. Furthermore, the clinic had been integrated into the public health - care system. The clinic had also been informed by a doctor who was working for a State body and had arranged for the applicant ’ s admission to the clinic that the applicant ’ s detention in the clinic necessitated a court order. In addition to that, on 4 March 1979 the police had brought her back to the clinic by force after she had attempted to escape."

                "81. Firstly, the Court of Appeal ’ s interpretation of Article 852 § 1 of the Civil Code had constituted a disproportionate limitation on her right to claim damages. She could only be expected to have had knowledge of damage caused by a particular person within the meaning of that provision when she had learnt that the doctors ’ conduct had been unlawful and that the resulting damage was attributable to being given the wrong treatment and not to her own state of health. She had always been treated as a mentally ill person and had continued receiving medical treatment long after she had been released from Dr Heines ’ s clinic. At the relevant time, she had even lost her ability to speak for more than ten years. She could not therefore be considered to have had sufficient knowledge and could not reasonably have been expected to bring her claim for as long as she had not had access to her medical file. Access had not been granted to her until 24 February 1997 – that is, after she had brought proceedings in the Bremen Regional Court. In support of that view, the applicant relied on a decision of the Marburg Regional Court of 19 July 1995 (no. 5 O 33/90 ), in which that court had found that according to Article 852 of the Civil Code, time did not start running for the purposes of limitation until the person concerned had been granted access to his medical file.

Secondly, the applicant questioned the Court of Appeal ’ s assumption with respect to a possible claim for damages on account of the defective performance of a contract that the applicant had implicitly concluded with the clinic. She submitted that this interpretation was absolutely incomprehensible and therefore arbitrary. The same was true of the assumption that she might have agreed to her medical treatment on the basis of a contract concluded by her father with the clinic for her benefit. She stressed that, as was proved by her medical file, she had been opposed to her admission to the clinic, to the continuation of her stay there and to her medical treatment. Her various attempts to escape from the clinic would, in any event, have had to be interpreted as a termination of the alleged contract concerning her medical treatment. Even assuming the existence of such a contract, it would not have authorised her unlawful detention, the forcible administration of contraindicated medicines and her repeated immobilisation."

The applicant further took the view that Germany had failed to observe its positive obligation under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention to protect her from being deprived of her liberty by private persons. She pointed out that, as she had attained the age of majority, her confinement in the clinic should have required a court order. She disputed that the health authorities, by virtue of their supervisory powers, were sufficiently able to say whether this requirement had been complied with. She stressed that during her stay in the clinic, in which she had been prevented from escaping by, inter alia, being administered medication by force, she had not been in a position to secure help from outside. The telephone had been monitored by the clinic personnel and only her father had visited her, and he would not have taken any steps to obtain her release. She pointed out that the possible protection awarded to persons confined to mental institutions by the creation of a Board of Visitors pursuant to section 34 of the Act on measures of aid and protection in cases of mental disorders (see paragraphs 59-60 above ) had not been effective in her case. That Act, the enactment of which demonstrated the State ’ s acknowledgment of a need for protection in this respect, had only come into force on 9 July 1979 – that is, after her initial detention in Dr Heines ’ s clinic. Further, it did not entitle the health authorities to supervise mental institutions such as that clinic, which had not been authorised to admit persons confined pursuant to a court order. She argued that only an ombudsman, whom patients could contact at any time, could have adequately safeguarded her rights. Finally, neither the provisions of German civil law nor the safeguards of criminal law had offered her adequate protection against unlawful deprivation of liberty. While providing retroactive sanctions, they could not prevent the deprivation of liberty itself from occurring or continuing. In view of the serious nature of an infringement of the right to liberty, this could not be regarded as affording sufficient protection."

The applicant had been detained in a private clinic, and there had not been a court order or other decision by a State entity authorising her confinement. Nor had any State entities been involved in the applicant ’ s detention as supervisory authorities. Such supervision had only been provided for by law in respect of institutions competent to admit patients confined to a psychiatric hospital by a court order. Dr Heines ’ s clinic had not been such an institution. The clinic had had no obligation and indeed, on account of a doctor ’ s duty of confidentiality, no right to inform the State authorities about the applicant ’ s treatment there."

The applicant had not attempted to institute criminal proceedings against the persons responsible for her detention in Dr Heines ’ s clinic. Her civil action for damages against the clinic had been dismissed by the Bremen Court of Appeal. However, even assuming that Article 5 of the Convention had to be taken into consideration by that court in construing the provisions of German civil law applicable to the case, its interpretation could not be regarded as arbitrary.

Firstly, the Bremen Court of Appeal ’ s calculation of the three-year time-limit in Article 852 § 1 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 63 above) for the applicant to bring her claims in tort could not be regarded as unreasonable. The applicant had brought her action against Dr Heines ’ s clinic in 1997, eighteen years after the end of her initial treatment there. According to Article 852 § 1 of the Code, for the purposes of limitation, time for a claim in tort started to run when the person concerned learned that damage had been caused to him by a particular person. As had been correctly found by the Bremen Court of Appeal, the applicant had already known at the time when she had been confined in the clinic that she had – allegedly – been detained there against her will. This was proved by the expert opinions to the effect that she had, in fact, not suffered from schizophrenia at the relevant time. She had also been able to train as a draughtswoman ( technische Zeichnerin ) and to obtain a driving licence. She had therefore possessed the necessary intellectual capacities to have knowledge of the relevant facts. Consequently, the Bremen Court of Appeal had been entitled to assume that on her release from the clinic in 1981, at the latest, the applicant could have had the necessary knowledge and could also have been reasonably expected to bring her action in tort against the clinic. In any event, these were questions of fact to be resolved by the competent national courts."

Moreover, the Bremen Court of Appeal, with regard to the applicant ’ s possible claim for damages on account of the defective performance of a contract, had not arbitrarily assumed that the applicant had implicitly concluded a contract with the clinic about her medical treatment. She had not objected to her admission to the hospital or to her medical treatment. It had also not been arbitrary for the court to conclude that this contract had not been terminated by her various attempts to escape from the clinic. The additional findings of that court concerning a possible contract concluded by the applicant ’ s father with the clinic for the benefit of the applicant – which would not have entitled the clinic to treat her against her will – were therefore not decisive for its conclusion."

It was already questionable whether Article 5 of the Convention incorporated such a positive obligation at all. In any event, German law provided multiple instruments for an individual to be protected against interferences with his liberty. Firstly, confinement in a psychiatric hospital had to be ordered by a judge. Secondly, the competent health authorities had far-reaching supervisory powers in monitoring the execution of these court orders. Thirdly, section 34 of the Act on measures of aid and protection in cases of mental disorders (see paragraphs 59-60 above), which came into force on 9 July 1979, introduced a Board of Visitors to monitor the detention of persons ordered under the Act in psychiatric hospitals. It thereby created a further innovative mechanism of protection. Fourthly, a person who deprived another person of his liberty incurred a prison sentence of up to ten years under Article 239 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 62 above). An individual who had been illegally deprived of his liberty also had the right to claim damages, including for non-pecuniary damage, under Articles 823 and 847 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 63 above ). Furthermore, in accordance with section 30 of the Conduct of Trade Act (see paragraph 61 above ), the running of a private clinic required a licence issued by the State. In the course of the examination of the application lodged by Dr Heines ’ s clinic for the issuing and extension of such a licence, the competent State authorities had verified that the clinic ’ s management was reliable and that it provided sufficient medical treatment for its patients."

It agrees with the parties that in the present case there are three aspects that could engage Germany ’ s responsibility under the Convention for the applicant ’ s detention in the private clinic in Bremen. Firstly, her deprivation of liberty could be imputable to the State owing to the direct involvement of public authorities in the applicant ’ s detention. Secondly, the State could be found to have violated Article 5 § 1 in that its courts, in the compensation proceedings brought by the applicant, failed to interpret the provisions of civil law relating to her claim in the spirit of Article 5.

This led to the applicant ’ s claim being time-barred. In particular, the Court of Appeal, contrary to the Regional Court, found that the applicant, being conscious that she had allegedly been deprived of her liberty against her will, had had sufficient knowledge to bring a compensation claim while she was still being detained in the clinic."

Having regard to this, the Court considers that the Court of Appeal, in its interpretation of the provisions on the limitation period, did not have sufficient regard to the right to liberty laid down in Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. In particular, that court did not consider the applicant ’ s situation while being detained, in that she had in reality been incapable of bringing an action in court. Contrary to the Regional Court, it also took no account of the difficulties she had encountered after her release from the clinic. The applicant had been treated with strong medication at the time of her release and long afterwards. It is undisputed that, at that time, she was suffering from serious physical disorders and, in particular, lost the ability to speak for more than eleven years (from 1980 to 1991/ 92). She was also deemed to be mentally ill until she finally obtained two expert reports to the contrary in 1994 and 1999. Furthermore, it has to be noted that the applicant was refused access to the medical file concerning her treatment at the clinic before she brought her action in the Bremen Regional Court.

In rejecting these claims, the Court of Appeal assumed that the applicant had implicitly concluded a contract with the clinic on her medical treatment. With respect to this, the Court refers to its above findings regarding the question whether the applicant was deprived of her liberty (see paragraphs 71 -7 8 above ). Assuming that she had the capacity to consent, there is no factual basis whatsoever for the assumption that the applicant, who had clearly objected to her stay and had tried to escape on several occasions, had consented to her stay and treatment at the clinic, thereby implicitly concluding a contract. If the applicant, in the alternative, had not been capable of consenting following her immediate treatment with strong medication, she could in any event not be considered to have validly concluded a contract. Given this finding, a contract concluded implicitly between the applicant ’ s father and the clinic for the benefit of the applicant at the age of 18, which the Court of Appeal assumed in the alternative, could not have authorised her detention against her will.

In examining the contractual claims, the Court of Appeal assumed that the applicant had consented to her stay in the clinic – that is, had been willing to stay there.

With regard to persons in need of psychiatric treatment in particular, the Court observes that the State is under an obligation to secure to its citizens their right to physical integrity under Article 8 of the Convention. For this purpose, there are hospitals run by the State which coexist with private hospitals. The State cannot completely absolve itself of its responsibility by delegating its obligations in this sphere to private bodies or individuals ( see, mutatis mutandis, Van der Mussele v. Belgium, judgment of 23 November 1983, Series A no. 70, pp. 14-15, §§ 28-30, and Woś, cited above, § 60 ).

The Court finds that, similarly, in the present case the State remained under a duty to exercise supervision and control over private psychiatric institutions. Such institutions, in particular those where persons are held without a court order, need not only a licence, but also competent supervision on a regular basis of whether the confinement and medical treatment is justified."

In this case, the competent health authority also had powers to supervise the execution of these court orders. However, in the applicant ’ s case, the clinic, despite her lack of consent, had not obtained the necessary court order. Therefore, no public health officer had ever assessed whether the applicant – which was more than doubtful – posed a serious threat to public safety or order within the meaning of section 2 of the Act of the Land of Bremen on the detention of mentally insane persons, mentally deficient persons and drug addicts.

Moreover, a victim can, under German civil law, claim compensation in tort for damage caused by an unlawful detention. However, the Court, having regard to the importance of the right to liberty, does not consider that such retrospective measures alone provide effective protection for individuals in such a vulnerable position as the applicant. It notes that, particularly in the Act of the Land of Bremen on the detention of mentally insane persons, mentally deficient persons and drug addicts, there were numerous – necessary – safeguards for persons detained in a mental institution following a court order. However, these safeguards did not apply in the more critical cases of persons confined in a psychiatric institution without such an order.

Thereby, the public authorities, as shown above, were involved in the applicant ’ s detention in the clinic, and yet her escape and obvious unwillingness to return did not entail any review of the lawfulness of her forced stay there. This indicates the great danger of abuse in this field, notably in cases such as that of the applicant, in which family conflicts and an identity crisis were at the root of her troubles and long detention in a psychiatric hospital. The Court is therefore not convinced that the supervision exercised by the State authorities merely in connection with the issuing of a licence for the running of a private clinic pursuant to section 30 of the Conduct of Trade Act sufficed to ensure competent and regular supervisory control in respect of a deprivation of liberty in such a clinic.

In the course of such proceedings, the person concerned could be assigned counsel to protect his interests and had to be examined in court either in person or through a representative.

As regards the Court of Appeal ’ s finding that the applicant had concluded a contract concerning her medical treatment at the clinic, the Court notes that the applicant objected not only to her confinement in the clinic, but also to her medical treatment, and was administered medication by force on several occasions. Under these circumstances, the Court, presuming that the applicant had the capacity to consent, is unable to discern any reasonable factual basis for the national courts ’ conclusion that the applicant continuously consented to her medical treatment, thereby having validly concluded and not terminated a contract."

The Court, referring to its settled case-law, reiterates that there is a positive obligation on the State flowing from Article 8 to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure and protect individuals ’ rights to respect for their private life (see, inter alia, X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, p. 11, § 23, and Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 98, ECHR 2003-VIII )."

The Court, referring again to its findings concerning Article 5 § 1 (see paragraphs 100 - 0 8 above), considers that on account of its obligation to secure to its citizens their right to physical and moral integrity, the State remained under a duty to exercise supervision and control over private psychiatric institutions. It notes also that in the sphere of interferences with a person ’ s physical integrity, German law provided for retrospective sanctions, assault being punishable by up to ten years ’ imprisonment under Articles 223 to 226 of the Criminal Code. Moreover, a person whose physical integrity had been harmed could claim damages in tort for pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss. However, just as in cases of deprivation of liberty, the Court finds that such retrospective measures alone are not sufficient to provide appropriate protection of the physical integrity of individuals in such a vulnerable position as the applicant. The above findings as to the lack of effective State control over private psychiatric institutions at the relevant time (see paragraphs 10 3 - 0 8 above) are equally applicable as far as the protection of individuals against infringements of their physical integrity is concerned. The Court therefore concludes that the respondent State failed to comply with its positive obligation to protect the applicant against interferences with her private life as guaranteed by Article 8 § 1 of the Convention.",

The Court of Appeal, referring to settled case-law of the Federal Court of Justice on the subject, argued that it had not been necessary to apply a less strict rule on the burden of proof, as there had in any event not been a serious error in her medical treatment. The Court is aware of the general difficulty for a patient to prove that a doctor treating him made a mistake that caused damage to his health.

Nor have the Government demonstrated the existence of any current and long-standing practice between Cambodia and France in the battle against drug trafficking at sea in respect of ships flying the Cambodian flag; on the contrary, the use of an ad hoc agreement by diplomatic note, in the absence of any permanent bilateral or multilateral treaty or agreement between the two States, attests to the exceptional, one-off nature of the cooperation measure adopted in this case. Added to the fact that Cambodia had not ratified the relevant conventions, this shows that the intervention of the French authorities on the basis of an ad hoc agreement cannot reasonably be said to have been “foreseeable” within the meaning of the Court’s case-law, even with the help of appropriate advice. In any event, the Court considers that the foreseeability, for an offender, of prosecution for drug trafficking should not be confused with the foreseeability of the law pleaded as the basis for the intervention. Otherwise, any activity considered criminal under domestic law would release the States from their obligation to pass laws having the requisite qualities, particularly with regard to Article 5 § 1 of the Convention and, in so doing, deprive that provision of its substance."

The merchant ship suddenly changed course and began to steer a course that was dangerous both for the frigate and for members of the armed forces who had boarded a speedboat. While the Winner refused to answer the attempts of the commander of the frigate to establish radio contact, its crew jettisoned a number of packages into the sea; one of the packages, containing about 100 kilos of cocaine, was recovered by the French seamen. After several warnings and warning shots fired under orders from France’s maritime prefect for the Atlantic went unheeded, the French frigate fired a shot directly at the Winner. The merchant ship then answered by radio and agreed to stop. When they boarded the Winner, the French commando team used their weapons to open certain locked doors. When a crew member of the Winner refused to obey their commands, a “warning shot” was fired at the ground, but the bullet ricocheted and the crew member was wounded.

After retracing the details of the operations, including the fact that “on 13 June at 6 a.m. the French frigate spotted a merchant ship – first on its radar, then visually – travelling at slow speed and flying no flag, and identified it as the Winner ”, it pronounced judgment in the following terms:",
                "“Considering that the international effort to combat drug trafficking is governed by three conventions: the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 30 March 1961, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed at Montego Bay on [10] December 1982, and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, signed in Vienna on 20 December 1988; while France has signed and ratified all three conventions, Cambodia has not signed the Vienna Convention, Article 17 § 3 of which provides for derogations from the traditional principle of the ‘law of the flag State’.",
                "Considering that the applicants wrongly suggest in this case that in keeping with the traditional rule codified in Article 92 of the Montego Bay Convention, the authority of a State on ships on the high seas flying its flag is both full and exclusive and that coercion may be used to ensure that the rules of international law and the State’s own law are respected as Article 108 of that Convention, on ‘Illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances’, stipulates:",

                "2. Any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying its flag is engaged in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances may request the cooperation of other States to suppress such traffic.",
                "Considering that, based on that text and ‘with reference’ to the earlier United Nations Convention of 30 March 1961 against international drug trafficking, the French authorities were within their rights to request Cambodia’s cooperation with a view to obtaining that country’s authorisation to intercept the Winner in order to put a stop to the drug trafficking in which all or part of its crew was suspected of being involved; that as the provisions of the Vienna Convention do not apply to Cambodia, it was for that State to ask the French authorities for all the relevant information concerning the alleged drug trafficking to enable it to assess the merits of the request using its unfettered discretion; that the diplomatic telegram sent by the French embassy on 7 June 2002, which actually mentions the reasoned request submitted by the OCRTIS, suffices to establish the existence of an agreement given without restrictions or reservations by the government of Cambodia for the planned interception and all its consequences, and is authoritative until proven otherwise; that on this point the applicants cannot contend that the document does not meet the formal requirements of Article 17 § 3 of the Vienna Convention concerning bilateral agreements between parties, when they are also arguing that the Vienna Convention is not applicable to Cambodia because it has not signed it; and that the value of the diplomatic document is not affected by the fact that the accused did not know the exact status of the person who signed the message or the person who transmitted the Cambodian government’s agreement to the French embassy.",
                "Considering, on the other hand, that in proceeding to intercept the Winner it was the duty of the French authorities to comply with the procedures provided for both in the Vienna Convention signed by France – in particular to ‘take due account of the need not to endanger the safety of life at sea, the security of the vessel and its cargo’ – and in the Law of 15 July 1994, as amended by the Law of 29 April 1996 adapting French law to Article 17 of the Vienna Convention, Articles 12 et seq. of which define the sphere of competence of commanders of naval vessels and the procedures for the search, reporting, prosecution and judgment in the French courts of drug trafficking offences committed at sea.",
                "Considering that the reports drawn up by the commander of the Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Hénaff, duly authorised by the maritime prefect for the Atlantic, which are authoritative until proven otherwise, state that when the frigate drew within sight of the Winner, off the Cape Verde islands, the merchant ship was flying no flag and its captain not only failed to answer the requests to identify his ship, in breach of the rules of international law, and to stop his ship, but responded aggressively with a series of dangerous manoeuvres that jeopardised the safety of the French frigate and the lives of the sailors on board the speedboat; that it was also reported that the crew of the Winner were seen to be throwing suspicious parcels overboard, one of which was recovered and found to contain a large quantity of cocaine; that all these elements together amounted to reasonable grounds for the commander of the frigate to suspect that he was in the presence of drug traffickers who had jettisoned their cargo before attempting to escape; and that by using force to board the Winner and taking appropriate coercive measures to control the crew and confine them to their cabins and to take over and sail the ship, the commander of the frigate acted in strict compliance with:",
                "– the provisions of Article 17 § 4 of the Vienna Convention under which, if evidence of involvement in illicit traffic is found after a ship has been boarded and searched, appropriate action may be taken with respect to the vessel and the persons and cargo on board,",

                "Considering that, regard being had to the distinctly aggressive conduct of the captain of the Winner in attempting to evade inspection by the French naval authorities, and to the attitude of the crew members, who took advantage of the time thus gained to eliminate any traces of the drug trafficking by deliberately throwing the evidence overboard, the members of the commando unit who boarded the ship found themselves in the presence of large-scale international trafficking and were likely at any moment to come up against a hostile and potentially dangerous crew who could threaten the security of their mission; that they were obliged to use their weapons in response to the resistance put up by one of the ship’s crew; that it cannot be claimed that Article 13 of the Law of 15 July 1994 as amended provides only for administrative assistance measures and excludes any form of coercion in respect of people when it stipulates in general terms that the competent maritime authorities are authorised to carry out or have carried out ‘the inspection and coercion measures provided for in international law’, and Article 17 § 4 (c) of the Vienna Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs [and Psychotropic Substances] expressly mentions taking ‘appropriate action with respect to the persons on board’; that although the nature of these measures is not specified, the text at least provides for the possibility for the competent naval authorities to limit, if necessary, the freedom of the boarded ship’s crew to come and go, otherwise the provision would be meaningless and the safety of the men taking over control of the ship would be seriously jeopardised; that it cannot be ruled out in the course of such operations against international drug traffickers on the high seas that the crew may have weapons hidden away and may seek to regain control of the ship by force; that consequently, confining the members of the crew of the Winner – all but the wounded man, who was transferred to the frigate – to their cabins under the guard of the commando unit, so that the ship could be safely taken over and rerouted, fell within the appropriate measures provided for in Article 17 § 4 (c) of the Vienna Convention.",
                "Considering that the Law of 15 July 1994 necessarily requires some departure from ordinary criminal procedure to allow for the specific needs of the effort to combat drug trafficking by ships on the high seas, in keeping with the rules of international law, and for the fact that it is impossible in practice, bearing in mind the time needed to sail to the new port of destination, to apply the ordinary rules governing detention and the right to be brought promptly before a judge; and, that being so, that the restrictions placed on the movements of the boarded ship’s crew, as authorised in such cases by the United Nations Convention signed in Vienna on 20 December 1988, were not at variance with Article 5 § 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and did not amount to unlawful detention; and that it should be noted that as soon as the Winner docked in Brest, its crew were handed over to the police, immediately informed of their rights and placed in custody, then brought before the investigating judge.",

It found it sufficient to rely on Article 108 of the Montego Bay Convention, which provides: ‘Any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying its flag is engaged in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances may request the cooperation of other States to suppress such traffic.’ On the other hand, when carrying out the interception, a State Party to the Vienna Convention which stops such a ship – in this case, France – must comply with the rules laid down therein and may thus rely on the provisions of Article 17 of the Vienna Convention, concerning coercion measures.

On this last point the Chamber noted that although measures taken under the Law of 15 July 1994 were taken under the supervision of the public prosecutor, the public prosecutor was not a “competent legal authority” within the meaning the Court’s case-law gave to that notion (see Schiesser v.

They maintained that it could not be considered as a delegation of jurisdiction to France. Even assuming, for argument’s sake, that such an ad hoc agreement did justify French intervention in keeping with the principle of public international law that a State could relinquish part of its sovereignty other than by a convention, they alleged that the limits of such an exceptional transfer of power had been considerably exceeded in the present case. According to the Government’s own submissions, the agreement had merely concerned a “request to intercept”, while the Cambodian government had only authorised the “stopping” of the ship (“ arraisonnement ” in French). Strictly speaking, this consisted solely in stopping the ship at sea or on arrival in port to make certain verifications (concerning its identity and its nationality, for example): it did not extend to searches or arrests on board the ship. Yet that was what had happened in this case: the applicants had been arrested and confined to their cabins for thirteen days. Their detention on board the Winner and their judgment in another country had not been authorised by Cambodia. The applicants thus challenged the existence of any ad hoc agreement justifying the stopping of the Winner and considered that even if there had been such an agreement, it did not justify the detention of the crew following the French military operation."

In their preliminary observations the Government stressed that the events in this case had taken place on the high seas, so that it was necessary to take into account the specificities of the maritime environment and of navigation at sea. In the Government’s submissions this had two specific consequences. First of all, the Convention was completely silent about maritime matters and the Government argued that it was possible to draw a parallel with the solution adopted by the Court in cases concerning the handing over of persons by one State to another in the context of extradition (see Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, ECHR 2005-IV; Freda v. Italy, no. 8916/80, Commission decision of 7 October 1980, Decisions and Reports (DR) 21, p. 254; Altmann (Barbie) v.

Secondly, they submitted that freedom to come and go on board a ship had more restrictive limits, which were the confines of the ship itself: the lawful rerouting of a ship therefore necessarily authorised restrictions on the movements of the people on board; the specificities and the risks of navigation at sea justified the extensive powers enjoyed by ships’ captains. The Government inferred that the applicants had not been deprived of their liberty within the meaning of Article 5 but had been subjected to restrictions of liberty that were justified, restrictions they were challenging on a purely formalistic and litigious basis.

The Government considered in any event that the agreement given by Cambodia to the French authorities by diplomatic note had made the intervention of the French navy perfectly lawful from the international law perspective. The Montego Bay Convention well illustrated the signatory States’ aim of “cohabitation” in what belonged to all and yet to none, by strictly defining the conditions in which a State could interfere with another State’s sovereignty by having a naval vessel inspect a ship flying a foreign flag. And although Cambodia was not a party to the Vienna Convention, the agreement which that sovereign State had given by diplomatic note had been self-sufficient with regard to the principles of public international law and the law of the sea. The diplomatic note of 7 June 2002 had authorised the stopping of the ship and all “its consequences”, as confirmed by the Cambodian authorities in their note of 9 September 2008. In such circumstances the agreement concerned had provided a legal basis for the rerouting of the Winner and its crew."

As the sea could be a “safe haven” (see Öcalan, cited above, § 88) for traffickers, international law had provided for the flag State to be able to delegate its power to combat this type of crime. The Government further noted that in Rigopoulos v. Spain ((dec.), no. 37388/97, ECHR 1999-II), the Court had found that the verbal agreement given to Spain by Panama had been sufficient to make the operations lawful under public international law."

They submitted that in any event the Investigation Division had not based its findings solely on Article 17 of the Vienna Convention, but also on the general provisions of Law no. 94-589 of 15 July 1994, which empowered commanders of naval vessels responsible for surveillance at sea to carry out, or have carried out “inspection and coercion measures”. They accordingly considered that that part of the law had provided a legal basis for the measures complained of, because the ship was suspected of drug trafficking and because it had been flying no flag, had refused to identify itself and had responded aggressively by making dangerous manoeuvres."

As to the quality of the legal basis, which the Chamber had questioned, the Government maintained that the specificity of the law of the sea had to be taken into consideration to appreciate the precise meaning of the legal standards; the French Law of 15 July 1994, in conjunction with Cambodia’s agreement in conformity with the provisions of Article 17 § 4 of the Vienna Convention and the Montego Bay Convention, had authorised the rerouting of the ship. So, as the law provided for the ship to be rerouted, it also provided for restriction of the freedom of movement of those on board, as the two were inseparable. According to the Government, the rerouting was nevertheless to be considered as a preliminary to the suspects being brought before the judicial authorities."

The Government considered that the allegation that it had not been possible for the applicants to contact a relative or a lawyer was unfounded, as the technical conditions for such contact were not always available; besides, as the applicants had not established that they had been in contact with their families or their lawyers prior to the interception by the French navy, their practical situation had not been altered by the rerouting of their ship. The Government also pointed out that the length of the voyage had merely been a material contingency and that the applicants had not been questioned during the thirteen days spent on board, naval personnel having no power to take such action. Accordingly, the Government considered that the right to contact a lawyer or a family member would have been theoretical and illusory."

On this last point the Government developed arguments demonstrating the guarantees of the independence of public prosecutors in terms of their status, the way they were recruited, their powers and their institutional role.

Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, § 62, Series A no. 310).

When the Winner was spotted off Cape Verde on 13 June 2002, the frigate issued several warnings and fired warning shots, before firing directly at the merchant ship, under orders from France’s maritime prefect for the Atlantic. When they boarded the Winner, the French commando team were obliged to use their weapons to defend themselves, and subsequently kept the crew members under their exclusive guard and confined them to their cabins during the journey to France, where they arrived on 26 June 2002. The rerouting of the Winner to France, by a decision of the French authorities, was made possible by sending a tug out of Brest harbour to tow the ship back to the French port, escorted by another warship, the frigate Commandant Bouan, all under orders from the maritime prefect and at the request of the Brest public prosecutor."

Its aim is to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of this liberty in an arbitrary fashion. In order to determine whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5 the starting-point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III).

The crew members were placed under the control of the French special forces and confined to their cabins during the voyage. True, the Government maintained that during the voyage the restrictions were relaxed. In the Court’s view that does not alter the fact that the applicants were deprived of their liberty throughout the voyage as the ship’s course was imposed by the French forces."

Nevertheless, the special nature of the maritime environment relied upon by the Government in the instant case cannot justify an area outside the law where ships’ crews are covered by no legal system capable of affording them enjoyment of the rights and guarantees protected by the Convention which the States have undertaken to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction, any more than it can provide offenders with a “safe haven”.",

It does not provide in general for States to request cooperation whenever they suspect a ship not flying their flag of such trafficking. The Court considers that Article 108 does not provide any legal basis for the action taken by the French authorities in this case. As Cambodia is not party to the Montego Bay Convention, it cannot have been acting under that Convention when it sent its diplomatic note of 7 June 2002.

Lastly, while the provisions of the Montego Bay Convention concerning illegal drug trafficking on the high seas appear to suggest that the issue was not a part of customary law when that Convention was signed, the Government have not shown that there has since been any constant practice on the part of the States capable of establishing the existence of a principle of customary international law generally authorising the intervention of any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying the flag of another State is engaged in illicit traffic in drugs."

It is an undisputed fact that the meeting of the frigate Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Hénaff and the Winner owed nothing to chance. The Winner was under the observation of the American, Spanish and Greek drug control agencies when the Central Office Against Illegal Drug Trafficking (“the OCRTIS”), which suspected it of transporting a large quantity of drugs for the European market, requested authorisation to intercept it. The ship’s nationality being known in fact as early as 7 June 2002, the French embassy requested Cambodia’s consent to the French authorities’ intervention; that agreement was given in a diplomatic note of 7 June 2002 and the Ministry of Defence in Paris was immediately informed. Thus, by 7 June 2002 at the latest the Winner had been precisely identified as a ship flying the Cambodian flag, as expressly stated in the diplomatic note sent by the Cambodian authorities. As to the frigate Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Hénaff, it had been at anchor in Brest harbour, and had already been assigned another mission off the African coast when, instead, it was specially instructed to set sail immediately to intercept the Winner. In order to carry out this clearly defined mission it took on board a French navy special forces team specialised in boarding vessels at sea, as well as three experts from the OCRTIS."

The circumstances of the case do not support such an assertion.

On this point the Court observes first of all that the text of the diplomatic note mentions “the ship Winner, flying the Cambodian flag”, the sole object of the agreement, confirming the authorisation to intercept, inspect and take legal action against it (see paragraph 10 above). Evidently, therefore, the fate of the crew was not covered sufficiently clearly by the note and so it is not established that their deprivation of liberty was the subject of an agreement between the two States that could be considered to represent a “clearly defined law” within the meaning of the Court’s case ‑ law. As to the explanatory diplomatic note produced by the Cambodian authorities on 9 September 2008 in response to a request from the French authorities of 3 September 2008 and submitted by the respondent Government for the first time to the Grand Chamber, after the Chamber pronounced its finding of a violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention and more than six years after the events, the applicants having had no opportunity at the material time to familiarise themselves with the explanations given, the Court does not consider it decisive."

                "100. Secondly, the Court considers that the diplomatic note did not meet the “foreseeability” requirement either. Nor have the Government demonstrated the existence of any current and long-standing practice between Cambodia and France in the battle against drug trafficking at sea in respect of ships flying the Cambodian flag; on the contrary, the use of an ad hoc agreement by diplomatic note, in the absence of any permanent bilateral or multilateral treaty or agreement between the two States, attests to the exceptional, one-off nature of the cooperation measure adopted in this case. Added to the fact that Cambodia had not ratified the relevant conventions, this shows that the intervention of the French authorities on the basis of an ad hoc agreement cannot reasonably be said to have been “foreseeable” within the meaning of the Court’s case-law, even with the help of appropriate advice. In any event, the Court considers that the foreseeability, for an offender, of prosecution for drug trafficking should not be confused with the foreseeability of the law pleaded as the basis for the intervention. Otherwise, any activity considered criminal under domestic law would release the States from their obligation to pass laws having the requisite qualities, particularly with regard to Article 5 § 1 of the Convention and, in so doing, deprive that provision of its substance."

It is regrettable, in the Court’s view, that the international effort to combat drug trafficking on the high seas is not better coordinated bearing in mind the increasingly global dimension of the problem. The fact remains that when a flag State, like Cambodia in this case, is not a party to the Montego Bay or Vienna Conventions, the insufficiency of such legal instruments, for want of regional or bilateral initiatives, is of no real consequence. In fact, such initiatives are not always supported by the States in spite of the fact that they afford the possibility of acting within a clearly defined legal framework. In any event, for States that are not parties to the Montego Bay and Vienna Conventions one solution might be to conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements, like the San José Agreement of 2003, with other States. Having regard to the gravity and enormity of the problem posed by illegal drug trafficking, developments in public international law which embraced the principle that all States have jurisdiction as an exception to the law of the flag State would be a significant step in the fight against illegal trade in narcotics. This would bring international law on drug trafficking into line with what has already existed for many years now in respect of piracy."

On this point they noted that the interception had been planned for several weeks and the investigation opened no later than 24 June 2002: the two or three extra days in police custody had therefore been unnecessary.

Switzerland, 23 October 1990, Series A no. 188; and Brincat v. Italy, 26 November 1992, Series A no. 249-A), in particular because of his lack of independence vis ‑ à ‑ vis the executive. They maintained that the purely formal criterion relied on by the Government was ineffective in the light of the functional criterion developed by the Court in its case-law, as confirmed in the Chamber judgment. Thus, unlike the Spanish authorities in the Rigopoulos case, where the deprivation of liberty had been decided by the Central Investigating Court, an officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, by means of a promptly issued, duly reasoned detention order, the French authorities had made no attempt to regularise the applicants’ situation. Yet their ship was not an “area outside the law”, especially considering that an investigating judge could have been contacted by radio, and the crew could have been informed of their rights and allowed to contact a lawyer and alert a family member. In addition to the resulting alleged violation of Article 5 § 3, the applicants, referring to the partially dissenting opinion expressed by three of the Chamber judges, pointed out that they had had to wait another two or three days to be brought before the liberties and detention judge."

Investigating judges were fully independent judges whose job was to seek evidence both for and against the accused party, without participating in the prosecution or the judgment of the cases they investigated. In France the investigating judge supervised all custodial measures taken in the cases under his responsibility – be it police custody or detention pending trial – and could terminate them at any time.

A “Memorandum on detentions in connection with the international match between Denmark and Sweden on 10 October 2009”, prepared by Chief Inspector B.O., the strategic commander for the event, was submitted to the City Court. It stated that the police had received intelligence reports that hooligan groups from both countries were set on fighting each other on the match day. The risk of fighting was increased by the fact that the match would not start until 8 p.m., leaving considerable time for each group to consume alcoholic beverages beforehand. In order to prevent such clashes, the plan was to start engaging in proactive dialogue from 12 noon, when the first fans/spectators appeared, and in the event of clashes, first to arrest the instigators under section 755 of the Administration of Justice Act and charge them or, if that was not possible, to detain the instigators by virtue of section 5(3) of the Police Act. Since detention under the latter provision, as far as possible, should not exceed six hours, the memorandum specifically stated that it was preferable to avoid detaining anyone too early during the day, since they would then have to be released during or after the game, with the possibility that they would head for the city centre again and resume their involvement in brawls. At 3.41 p.m. the first big fight started between Danish and Swedish supporters at Amagertorv Square, on Strøget in the centre of Copenhagen, resulting in five or six individuals being detained, including the second and third applicants. Subsequently, elsewhere, other supporters were detained, including the first applicant. Up until the start of the match, further individuals who instigated and directed fights were detained, but the manoeuvre tactics continued to be a dialogue to ensure that the large number of supporters behaved and made their way to the stadium to watch the match. After the match, another large brawl started in the city centre, resulting in further detentions of a large group of Swedish and Danish supporters/hooligans."

                "“... that he was the strategic commander for the event and located in the control room in connection with the international football match between Denmark and Sweden on 10 October 2009. The police had received intelligence reports of intentions among various club factions from Denmark and Sweden to initiate hooligan brawls in connection with the match. The police were therefore prepared for it not to be the usual audience of festive Danish and Swedish supporters. This information had come from police ‘spotters’ in different networks of football fans. They had received information that Danish and Swedish groups had planned to collaborate ... Police preparations had targeted different locations in Copenhagen. It was the intention to locate the various groups, talk to them to calm them down and accordingly dampen tempers before they reached the national stadium. The police had already deployed forces and divided them into groups at around 2 p.m. on the basis of intelligence that the spectators would arrive early to go partying. They had managed to locate the groups of fans by means of their spotters, and it had turned out that the fans were divided into a Swedish and a Danish group. They had seen the first large fight between Danish and Swedish hooligans at around 3.40 p.m. The fight had occurred in the central part of Strøget, the pedestrian shopping street, outside bar D, where the Swedish group had settled down. Prior to the fight, they had located the Danish groups in the central courtyard of Boltens Gård. According to the intelligence, the Danish people involved were supporters of the football clubs of Brøndby, Lyngby [Copenhagen] and AGF [Aarhus]. This intelligence had been collected by police officers in the home towns of these clubs. Those police officers had come to Copenhagen to assist, and they had recognised supporters.",
                "The fight had taken the police somewhat by surprise, but they had managed to segregate the Swedish supporters at the bar D, and guide the Danish participants down Valkendorffsgade, a small side street off the pedestrian shopping street. It was a group of about fifty to sixty Danish fans altogether. He did not know the number of persons involved directly in the fight, but had understood from local reports that there were about fifty or sixty persons on either side. A fight of this kind causes a lot of uncertainty.",
                "He himself had been in the control room, but had had regular contact with people at the scene of the incident. He was the one who had made the decision to detain persons who could not be charged with an offence, that is, detention pursuant to the Police Act. It had been planned that only the instigators should be detained. To the extent possible, they had also intended to avoid detaining many people early in the day because those people would then have to be released during or right after the match and would then be able to head for the city centre again and resume fighting. He had made use of local [police] spotters to identify six leading members, who had then been detained. They had been identified on the basis of police officers’ prior knowledge of them, combined with their ongoing observations. The crucial factor had naturally been the individuals’ actual behaviour. They would not have been detained if they had not been acting as instigators ...",
                "The detainees had been released following an assessment of the situation in central Copenhagen. The police had started releasing the detainees after midnight, when the situation in central Copenhagen had calmed down and it had been assessed that there was no one with whom the newly released persons could start a fight. He was, of course, aware of the six-hour rule laid down in the Police Act, but it might be necessary to exceed this maximum period. They had done so deliberately that particular evening. Had there been no violence after the expiry of the six-hour period, there would have been no justification for not releasing the detainees. The purpose had definitely been to avoid confrontations and fights and situations causing uncertainty. They had made a continuous assessment during the period of detention.",
                "Normally there were no problems in relation to the six-hour rule in connection with matches played earlier in the day/on weekdays when people did not arrive so early. The control room team had included an investigator who had had regular contact with the Bellahøj police station regarding the detentions. The detainees who had been charged with an offence had been released after the match. As regards the persons detained under the Police Act, a comprehensive, general assessment had been made and then those persons had been released one by one when the danger had passed. He had been involved in the general assessment of the length of the detention periods, but not in the assessment of the individual cases. The control room had been closed down shortly after midnight, when the observers around the city had reported that things were quiet and that people were on their way home/back to their hotels. As already mentioned, it had been decided to release detainees on the basis of a general assessment made in the control room, but the actual releases had been effected at the Bellahøj police station. The police’s assessment had been that the detainees would meet up again and start new fights if released before the streets of the city centre had become quiet ...”"

They had received intelligence that hooligans from Aarhus would meet with other hooligans from Denmark to fight Swedish football fans. The Copenhagen Police had asked for help from the police of other districts in Denmark who were familiar with members of local factions. He and his colleagues had met at around 11 a.m. for a briefing. He and a colleague of his from the Police of Eastern Jutland had then moved around the city to look for any hooligans from Aarhus whom they might recognise. They had been told that people from Brøndby had gathered at a particular bar, and they had gone there. Among the people they had seen were [the first and second applicants]. [The second applicant] had been sitting together with A, the leader of South Side United (SSU), which is a local faction from Brøndby. There had been a good atmosphere, and no violence. The witness had remained standing outside for a short while and had talked to people from Aarhus. It had probably been around 1 p.m. He and his colleague and some other officers had then posted themselves opposite the bar to keep an eye on what was going on. They had received reports that Swedes and Danes were to meet and fight. At some point the Danish hooligans had started leaving the bar, walking down the pedestrian shopping street towards Amagertorv Square [around 700 metres from the bar].",
                "[The witness] had worked in the special patrol for four years and had met [the first and second applicants] several times at previous fights in connection with football matches. He had seen them take part in fights and heard them shout ‘White Pride Hooligan’. He and his colleagues had followed the group and reported back to the control room. When they had come closer to Amagertorv Square, police personnel carriers had been parked crosswise to prevent the group from colliding with the Swedish football fans. The Danish hooligans had then been turned around and taken down a side street, where they had been registered and searched.",

It had happened in a calm manner. The reason why [the second applicant] had been taken to the police station was that they had indeed seen him talking to A, combined with their prior knowledge of him. [The third applicant] had also been taken to the police station because of their knowledge of him. [The witness] had written a report on the detentions a couple of hours later.",

The purpose of detaining those two persons had been to create calm and prevent clashes. This had apparently succeeded because he had been present during the international match himself, and it had been obvious that the hooligans from Aarhus had been missing someone to take control. When the group from the bar was being guided into the side street, a couple of people might have tried to disappear into the crowd, but the group had followed directions from the police.",

Directions were issued by the leaders, and the directions were obeyed. The three factions present at the bar had come from Aarhus, Brøndby and Lyngby and were not usually friends.

Ten additional police officers were there to help. One of his tasks had been to make sure that the six-hour rule was observed. They had been faced with the issue that the six-hour period applicable to two of the persons detained under the Police Act expired at 9.50 p.m. He had contacted the control-room supervisor before the expiry of this period. Concurrently, clashes had been starting in the streets, and the control-room supervisor had decided not to let the relevant persons out. They had not wanted to add fuel to the fire. This decision had been made by the supervisors because he himself did not have the power to make such a decision. He had talked to the control room many times during that evening from 9.30 p.m. onwards. Very many detainees had been brought to the police station up until around 11 p.m., reaching a total of 136 detainees. Half of them had been detained under the Police Act. He had regularly asked when they should start releasing the detainees. He had not called and asked about specific names, but a general assessment had been made on an ongoing basis for all detainees from the time when the statutory six-hour periods started to expire. The radio communication had made it possible for him to keep updated about when things started calming down after the arrests of people in the Boltens Gård courtyard, and finally it had been confirmed that he could start releasing the persons detained under the Police Act. He did not keep a log of all telephone calls and was therefore unable to give the exact time. As far as he recalled, there had probably been one detainee under 18 years old who had been fetched by his parents before the end of the six-hour period, but otherwise no one else had been let out before the two initial detainees. It could very well have happened that some of his colleagues had started taking people out of the cells before the end of the six-hour period when they had received the information from the control room, because everybody was highly aware of the six-hour rule. If the persons concerned had subsequently been returned to their cells, the reason was an order from the control room saying that they should continue to be detained.”"

The court finds, in the circumstances of the present case, that there is no basis for invalidating the assessment made by the police, according to which the release of the detainees before the city centre had become quiet would have entailed a concrete and imminent risk of further unrest, including clashes with spectators who had been let out of the national stadium after the end of the match and who were still in the streets in large numbers.",

It also appears from the preparatory notes on the same provision that normally the six-hour period can only be exceeded in connection with actions involving the detention of a considerable number of people, in which situations the time spent on transfer to the police station and registration and identification of detainees would render it impossible, in practice, to observe the six-hour rule.",

A detention based on section 5(3) of the Police Act is outside the context of criminal proceedings (as opposed to an arrest under section 755 of the Administration of Justice Act, see paragraph 35 below). The purpose of a detention under section 5(3) is not to bring the person before a judge, neither to assess the lawfulness of a continued detention. The lawfulness may, however, subsequently be subject to judicial review. According to the preparatory notes on the Police Act, detention based on section 5(3) of the Police Act may not take place for the purpose of investigating or initiating criminal measures. The condition that the person must be causing a “risk or danger” implies that a concrete and imminent risk of disturbance of public order or of danger to the safety of individuals or public security must have been ascertained. What is crucial is the probability that the risk or danger will occur if the police do not intervene. The fact that a person is a well-known troublemaker does not as such justify such measures. Prior knowledge of a person or a group of persons may, however, be taken into account, together with the current circumstances. Whether the risk or danger is sufficient to justify a measure depends on an assessment made by the police of the individual situation. As to the wording “should not extend beyond six hours where possible”, the preparatory notes point out that the period should be reckoned from the time when the detention is effected. Any time spent on transfer to a police station must therefore be included in the calculation of the detention period. The six ‑ hour period would normally only be exceeded in connection with actions involving the detention of a large number of persons, when the time spent on transfer to the police station and registration and identification of detainees would render it impossible, in practice, to observe the six-hour rule."

For the purposes of its examination of the present case, the Court deems it useful to refer to the judgment of 15 February 2017 of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in R v The Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis, in which the Court’s case-law on Article 5 § 1 (b) was found to be inconclusive. The four applicants in that case had been detained for up to five and a half hours to prevent an imminent breach of the peace during the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on 29 April 2011. The police had argued that the detention was justified under both Article 5 § 1 (b) and Article 5 § 1 (c).",
                "The Administrative Court found that the detention had complied with Article 5 § 1 (c).",
                "The Court of Appeal agreed, but for other reasons. It concluded that the purpose of the applicants’ detention had been to bring them before the competent legal authority if that were to become necessary, so as to prolong their detention on a lawful basis. It declined to follow the majority view in Ostendorf v. Germany (no. 15598/08, 7 March 2013) that Article 5 § 1 (c) was incapable of authorising purely preventive detention, notwithstanding the existence of good grounds to believe an offence to be imminent, and that the person concerned must be suspected of having already committed a criminal offence.",
                "Finally, the Supreme Court, having analysed the Court’s case-law, and notably the divergent views expressed in the concurring opinion in Ostendorf (cited above), concluded that the detention was lawful under Article 5 § 1 (c). Lord Toulson (with whom Lord Mance, Lord Dyson, Lord Reed and Lord Carnwath agreed) stated, in particular:",
                "“31. In this case there was nothing arbitrary about the decisions to arrest, detain and release the appellants. They were taken in good faith and were proportionate to the situation. If the police cannot lawfully arrest and detain a person for a relatively short time (too short for it to be practical to take the person before a court) in circumstances where this is reasonably considered to be necessary for the purpose of preventing imminent violence, the practical consequence would be to hamper severely their ability to carry out the difficult task of maintaining public order and safety at mass public events. This would run counter to the fundamental principles previously identified.",
                "32. There is, however, a difficult question of law as to how such preventive power can be accommodated within article 5. The Strasbourg case law on the point is not clear and settled, as is evident from the division of opinions within the Fifth Section in Ostendorf. Moreover, while this court must take into account the Strasbourg case law, in the final analysis it has a judicial choice to make.",
                "33. The view of the minority in Ostendorf, that article 5.1(c) is capable of applying in a case of detention for preventive purposes followed by early release (that is, before the person could practicably be brought before a court), is in my opinion correct for a number of reasons.",
                "34. In the first place I agree with the Administrative Court that the situation fits more naturally within the language of article 5.1(c) than 5.1(b). On its plain wording article 5.1(c) covers three types of case, the second being when the arrest or detention of a person ‘is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence.’",
                "35. There is force in the argument that the interpretation adopted by the majority in Ostendorf collapses the second into the first (‘reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence’) and is inconsistent with Lawless [ Lawless v. Ireland (no. 3), 1 July 1961, Series A no. 3].",
                "36. It is accepted by the police that English courts should treat Lawless as authoritative, but in that case the court was not concerned with a situation in which the police had every reason to anticipate that the risk necessitating the person’s arrest would pass in a relatively short time and there was every likelihood of it ending before the person could as a matter of practicality be brought before a court. It would be perverse if it were the law that in such circumstances, in order to be lawfully able to detain the person so as to prevent their imminently committing an offence, the police must harbour a purpose of continuing the detention, after the risk had passed, until such time as the person could be brought before a court with a view to being bound over to keep the peace in future. This would lengthen the period of detention and place an unnecessary burden on court time and police resources.",
                "37. Some analogy may be drawn with Brogan, in which the court rejected the argument that at the time of the arrest the police must intend to take the arrested person before the court willy nilly, regardless of whether on investigation there was cause to do so.",
                "38. In order to make coherent sense and achieve the fundamental purpose of article 5, I would read the qualification on the power of arrest or detention under article 5.1(c), contained in the words ‘for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority’, as implicitly dependent on the cause for detention continuing long enough for the person to be brought before the court. I agree therefore with Judges Lemmens and Jäderblom in para 5 of their judgment in Ostendorf (cited at para 25 above) that in the case of an early release from detention for preventive purposes, it is enough for guaranteeing the rights inherent in article 5 if the lawfulness of the detention can subsequently be challenged and decided by a court.",
                "39. I prefer to put the matter that way, rather than as the Court of Appeal did by inferring the existence of a conditional purpose ab initio to take the appellants before the court, although it makes no difference to the result. I have no disagreement with the Court of Appeal that the appellants would have been brought before a court to determine the legality of their continued detention, if it had been considered necessary to detain them long enough for this to happen. The case would then have been materially similar to Nicol and Selvanayagam, where the applicants’ initial detention was preventive and they were later kept in custody and brought before the court to be bound over. It would be contrary to the spirit and underlying objective of article 5 if the appellants’ early release placed them in a stronger position to complain of a breach of article 5 than if it had been decided to detain them for longer in order to take them before magistrates to be bound over.",
                "40. As to article 5.1(b), I am inclined to the same view as the minority in Ostendorf that the obligation has to be much more specific than a general obligation not to commit a criminal offence (or, in this case, a breach of the peace), and that such a general obligation does not acquire the necessary degree of specificity by focusing narrowly on the particular facts or by the person concerned being given a reminder of it in specific circumstances. There are also practical considerations. The police may find it necessary to take action to prevent an imminent breach of the peace in circumstances where there is not sufficient time to give a warning. An example might be a football match where two unruly groups collide and the police see no alternative but to detain them, or the ringleaders on both sides, immediately for what may be quite a short time. In summary, I would be concerned that in stretching article 5.1(b) beyond its previously recognised ambit the majority found it necessary to impose limitations which in another case might leave the police effectively powerless to step in for the protection of the public.”"

The Government submitted that, as in Ostendorf (cited above), the applicants’ detention was covered by Article 5 § 1 (b), as it had been intended to prevent them from organising and taking part in brawls between hooligans. The applicants had been subject to an obligation to refrain from committing criminal offences, including the obligation not to instigate fights or exhibit any other form of violent behaviour likely to disturb public order. This obligation followed from a number of provisions on punishable acts, including section 3 of the Executive Order on Police Measures to Maintain Law and Order (which is considered to define a criminal offence), and sections 134a, 244, 245 and 291 of the Penal Code. The obligation was specific and concrete, and the time and place of the imminent commission of the offence had been sufficiently specified, as well as its potential victims. The applicants had been aware of the large police presence in the city and it must have been clear to them that the police were there to prevent violence and disturbance in connection with the football match, notably as all three applicants had previously been detained in connection with similar events. In the Government’s view, it would have been futile for the police to have given the applicants explicit orders to disperse and refrain from arranging/taking part in brawls, as the applicants could simply have walked away from the police and engaged in hooligan brawls elsewhere. Likewise, it would have made little sense to escort them to the stadium and warn them of detention if they left the groups of hooligans, as the police had done in Ostendorf (cited above), since many of them, including the third applicant, had not even had a ticket for the match."

The police had been in possession of sufficient facts and information to satisfy an objective observer that the applicants were planning to organise and participate in hooligan brawls, during which concrete and specific criminal offences would be committed (for example, those provided for in section 3 of the Executive Order on Police Measures to Maintain Law and Order and sections 134a, 244, 245 and 291 of the Penal Code)."

The Court had further emphasised that the person concerned had to have taken positive steps indicating that he would not fulfil the above-mentioned obligation. In Ostendorf the applicant had been classified as a “gang leader” and had received a specific and precise order from the police to stay with the group of supporters with whom he had travelled to a football match, and the group had even been informed of the consequences of not obeying such an order.

Moreover, in the applicants’ view the large police presence suggested that the police could have averted the alleged danger by resorting to much less radical means such as those listed in section 5(2) of the Police Act, instead of resorting to the most radical measure available to them, namely deprivation of liberty; however, the police had obviously already decided before the event to implement the most radical means straight away."

Its key purpose is to prevent arbitrary or unjustified deprivations of liberty. Three strands of reasoning in particular may be identified as running through the Court’s case-law: the exhaustive nature of the exceptions, which must be interpreted strictly, and which do not allow for the broad range of justifications under other provisions (Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention in particular); the repeated emphasis on the lawfulness of the detention, both procedural and substantive, requiring scrupulous adherence to the rule of law; and the importance of the promptness or speediness of the requisite judicial controls (see Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova [GC], no. 23755/07, § 84, ECHR 2016 (extracts), with further references)."

As regards the requirement to justify pre-trial detention under paragraph 3 of Article 5 in such cases, the Court has held that there must be relevant and sufficient reasons, and that the national authorities must display “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings. The Court has also held that justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities. When deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities are obliged to consider alternative means of ensuring his or her appearance at trial (ibid.).

The obligation not to commit a criminal offence may only be considered sufficiently “specific and concrete” for the purposes of sub ‑ paragraph (b) if the place and time of the imminent commission of the offence and its potential victim(s) have been sufficiently specified, if the person concerned was made aware of the specific act which he or she was to refrain from committing, and if that person showed himself or herself not to be willing to refrain from committing that act (see Schwabe and M.G., cited above, §§ 73 and 82 and Ostendorf, cited above, §§ 69-73, 93-94, 97, 99 and 101). The duty not to commit a criminal offence in the imminent future cannot be considered sufficiently concrete and specific to fall under Article 5 § 1 (b), at least as long as no specific measures have been ordered which have not been complied with (see Schwabe and M.G., cited above, § 82).",
                "In this connection it should be reiterated that in the case of Schwabe and M.G. (ibid., § 81) the fact that the police had given no such order was an important consideration for the Court to conclude that the matter fell outside the scope of paragraph 1 (b), whereas the fact that the police had given such an order was decisive for the Court to reach the opposite conclusion in Ostendorf (cited above, § 95). In the latter case, the police had specifically ordered the applicant, prior to his arrest, to stay with a group of football supporters, and had warned him in a clear manner of the consequences of his failure to comply with that order. Moreover, his group had already been searched and found to be in possession of instruments typically used in hooligan brawls.",

It will be recalled that this provision does not, according to the Court’s established case-law, permit a policy of general prevention directed against an individual or a category of individuals who are perceived by the authorities, rightly or wrongly, as being dangerous or having the propensity to commit unlawful acts. This ground of detention does no more than afford the Contracting States a means of preventing a concrete and specific offence (see, for example, Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, § 102, Series A no. 39; Ciulla v. Italy, 22 February 1989, § 40, Series A no. 148; and Shimovolos, cited above, § 54) as regards, in particular, the place and time of its commission and its victim(s) (see M. v. Germany, no. 19359/04, §§ 89 and 102, ECHR 2009). This can be seen both from the use of the singular (“an offence”) and from the object of Article 5, namely to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of his or her liberty in an arbitrary fashion (see Guzzardi, cited above, § 102, and M. v. Germany, cited above, § 89)."

                "90. According to the Court’s case-law, however, the “offence” does not have to be limited to conduct that has been characterised as an offence under national law. In Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom (23 September 1998, §§ 46-49 and 55, Reports 1998 ‑ VII), the Court found, as was undisputed by the parties, that the concept “breach of the peace” ought to be regarded as “an offence” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (c), despite not being classified as an offence under English law. It bore in mind (ibid., § 49) the nature of the proceedings in question and the penalty at stake. Moreover, it observed (ibid., § 55):",
                "“the concept of breach of the peace has been clarified by the English courts over the last two decades, to the extent that it is now sufficiently established that a breach of the peace is committed only when an individual causes harm, or appears likely to cause harm, to persons or property or acts in a manner the natural consequence of which would be to provoke others to violence ... It is also clear that a person may be arrested for causing a breach of the peace or where it is reasonably apprehended that he or she is likely to cause a breach of the peace...",
                "Accordingly, the Court considers that the relevant legal rules provided sufficient guidance and were formulated with the degree of precision required by the Convention (see, for example, the Larissis and Others v. Greece judgment of 24 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 377, § 34)”."

The condition that there should be no arbitrariness also demands that both the order to detain and the execution of the detention genuinely conform to the purpose of the restrictions permitted by the relevant sub-paragraph of Article 5 § 1 (see Saadi, cited above, § 69). Where, for example, detention is sought to be justified by reference to the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (c) in order to bring a person before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence, the Court has insisted upon the need for the authorities to furnish some facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence in question (see James, Wells and Lee v. the United Kingdom, nos. 25119/09 and 2 others, § 193, 18 September 2012, and O’Hara v. the United Kingdom, no. 37555/97, §§ 34-35, ECHR 2001 ‑ X). Similarly, the Court is of the view that in order for a detention to be justified under the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (c), the authorities must show convincingly that the person concerned would in all likelihood have been involved in the concrete and specific offence, had its commission not been prevented by the detention."

In respect of the first limb of sub-paragraph (c) the Court has found that the absence of any grounds in the judicial authorities’ decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time was incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 § 1 (see Urtāns v. Latvia, no. 16858/11, § 28, 28 October 2014). Conversely, it has found that an applicant’s detention on remand could not be said to have been arbitrary if the domestic court gave certain grounds justifying the continued detention, unless the reasons given were extremely laconic and did not refer to any legal provision which would have permitted the applicant’s detention (ibid.; see also Mooren, cited above, § 79, with further references).",

The Court answered the question in the negative (ibid., §§ 77-89), whilst expressing its awareness of the importance, in the German legal system, of preventive police custody in order to avert dangers to the life and limb of potential victims or significant material damage, in particular in situations involving the policing of large groups of people during mass events (ibid., § 88)."

From the Ostendorf judgment it appears that a decisive consideration for finding sub-paragraph (c) inapplicable was that it permitted deprivation of liberty only in connection with criminal proceedings and governed pre-trial detention (ibid., §§ 66-68). This interpretation was restated in different ways in the judgment, for instance in paragraph 82: “the second alternative of Article 5 § 1 (c) ... only governs pre-trial detention and not custody for preventive purposes without the person concerned being suspected of having already committed a criminal offence”. In paragraph 86 the Court held that “detention under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1 may be ordered, in particular, against a person having carried out punishable preparatory acts to an offence in order to prevent his committing that latter offence”. This interpretation was given with reference to the requirements under paragraphs 1 (c) and 3 respectively that the person’s detention was to be effected “for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority” and that the person was to “be brought promptly before a judge” and was “entitled to a trial within a reasonable time” under paragraph 3 (ibid., §§ 68, 82, 85 and 86), and also with reference to previous case-law (ibid., §§ 67-69) to the effect that sub-paragraph (c) permitted deprivation of liberty only in connection with criminal proceedings.

In the first place, starting with the aforementioned Lawless case, the first to come before the Court raising questions of interpretation of the provisions at issue, this concerned the Irish authorities’ internment of IRA members without trial. The applicant was detained for five months, without being brought before a judge, under legislation which gave ministers special powers of detention without trial, whenever the government published a proclamation that such powers were necessary to secure the preservation of peace and order. The Government argued that the applicant’s detention could be justified as being “necessary to prevent his committing an offence”, which did not also require “the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority”. The Court, however, rejected this argument, on the following grounds (emphasis added):",
                "“13. Whereas, in this connection, the question referred to the judgment of the Court is whether or not the provisions of Article 5, paragraphs 1 (c) and 3, prescribe that a person arrested or detained ‘when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence’ shall be brought before a judge, in other words whether, in Article 5, paragraph 1 (c), the expression ‘effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent judicial (sic) authority [ devant l’autorité judiciaire compétente ]’ qualifies only the words ‘on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence’ or also the words ‘when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence’;",
                "14. Whereas the wording of Article 5, paragraph 1 (c), is sufficiently clear to give an answer to this question; whereas it is evident that the expression ‘effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority’ qualifies every category of cases of arrest or detention referred to in that sub-paragraph; whereas it follows that the said clause permits deprivation of liberty only when such deprivation is effected for the purpose of bringing the person arrested or detained before the competent judicial authority, irrespective of whether such person is a person who is reasonably suspected of having committed an offence, or a person whom it is reasonably considered necessary to restrain from committing an offence, or a person whom it reasonably considered necessary to restrain from absconding after having committed an offence;",
                "Whereas, further, paragraph 1 (c) of Article 5 can be construed only if read in conjunction with paragraph 3 of the same Article, with which it forms a whole; whereas paragraph 3 stipulates categorically that ‘everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge ...’ and ‘shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time’; whereas it plainly entails the obligation to bring everyone arrested or detained in any of the circumstances contemplated by the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) before a judge for the purpose of examining the question of deprivation of liberty or for the purpose of deciding on the merits; whereas such is the plain and natural meaning of the wording of both paragraph 1 (c) and paragraph 3 of Article 5;",
                "Whereas the meaning thus arrived at by grammatical analysis is fully in harmony with the purpose of the Convention which is to protect the freedom and security of the individual against arbitrary detention or arrest; whereas it must be pointed out in this connexion that, if the construction placed by the Court on the aforementioned provisions were not correct, anyone suspected of harbouring an intent to commit an offence could be arrested and detained for an unlimited period on the strength merely of an executive decision without its being possible to regard his arrest or detention as a breach of the Convention; whereas such an assumption, with all its implications of arbitrary power, would lead to conclusions repugnant to the fundamental principles of the Convention;"

Moreover, the requirement that the detention “be effected for the purpose of bringing [the person] before the competent [judicial] authority” applied in respect of each ground, as did the obligation to bring the person before a judge either for the purpose of examining the question of deprivation of liberty or for the purpose of deciding on the merits of a criminal charge, under paragraphs 1 (c) and 3 of Article 5."

Nor does it seem consistent with the additional statement in Ostendorf (cited above, § 82) that “the second alternative of Article 5 § 1 (c) ... only governs pre-trial detention and not custody for preventive purposes without the person concerned being suspected of having already committed a criminal offence”. On the contrary, in the first and third of the above-mentioned British cases, the Court left open what part of the measures fell under the one or the other ground, and in the second case it clearly distinguished between them, specifying that the initial detention fell under the preventive ground. On the basis of this analysis, the line taken in the three British cases is in a sense reminiscent of that taken in Ireland v. the United Kingdom and Guzzardi (both cited above). The former left open to what extent the respective limbs applied to the case before the Court, whereas the latter identified more clearly the application of the second limb (see paragraph 107 above) in a manner that can be traced back to the clear distinction made between the two limbs in Lawless, consistent with the Report of the Conference of Senior Officials on Human Rights to the Committee of Ministers in relation to Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 of the second draft Convention (see paragraph 42 above)."

Against this background, the Court considers that there are weighty arguments in favour of espousing the interpretation adopted in Lawless and reflected in a number of rulings thereafter to the effect that Article 5 § 1 (c) contemplates the lawful arrest or detention of a person in distinct circumstances, including, under the second limb, “when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence”. Not only the unequivocal wording of the second limb but also the preparatory work related thereto clearly indicate that the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (c) is to be considered to refer to a distinct ground, notably separate from the first limb. In Lawless (cited above, § 14), the guarantee to bring everyone arrested or detained before a judge was also deemed to be “fully in harmony with the purpose of the Convention to protect the freedom and security of the individual against arbitrary detention and arrest”."

However, it should be noted that the Court has recognised in other cases that this requirement is to be interpreted and applied with a certain flexibility when the intention which once existed of “bringing the applicant before the competent legal authority” does not materialise for some reason. The fact that an arrested person was neither charged nor brought before a judge does not necessarily mean that the purpose of his or her detention was not in accordance with Article 5 § 1 (c). Thus, in Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom (29 November 1988, Series A no. 145 ‑ B) the four applicants had been arrested and detained under prevention-of-terrorism legislation on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. They were released without charge after periods of between four and six days (the shortest being four days and six hours) and without having been brought before a magistrate. The Court held that in the case of each of the four applicants there had been a violation of Article 5 § 3 on account of the failure to observe the requirement of promptness, but no violation of Article 5 § 1 (only the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (c) was concerned). It stated (ibid., § 53):",

As the Government and the Commission have stated, the existence of such a purpose must be considered independently of its achievement and sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1 does not presuppose that the police should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges, either at the point of arrest or while the applicants were in custody.",
                "Such evidence may have been unobtainable or, in view of the nature of the suspected offences, impossible to produce in court without endangering the lives of others. There is no reason to believe that the police investigation in this case was not in good faith or that the detention of the applicants was not intended to further that investigation by way of confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicions which, as the Court has found, grounded their arrest ...

In this regard, the Court considers that the question whether the purpose requirement has been complied with should depend on an objective assessment of the authorities’ conduct, in particular whether the detainee, as required by Article 5 § 3, is brought promptly before a judge to have the lawfulness of his or her detention reviewed or is released before such time.

Such flexibility is further circumscribed by the requirement that the arrest and detention be “reasonably considered necessary” (see paragraph 77 above and the further elaboration of this criterion affirmed in paragraph 161 below).

Article 5 § 3 includes a procedural requirement for the “judge or other officer authorised by law” to hear the individual brought before him or her in person, and a substantive requirement for the same officer to review the circumstances militating for or against detention – that is, whether there are reasons to justify detention – and to order release if there are no such reasons (see, for example, Buzadji, cited above, § 98, with further references). The initial automatic review of arrest and detention must be capable of examining lawfulness issues and whether or not the reasonable suspicion that the arrested person has committed an offence persists, or in other words, ascertaining that the detention falls within the permitted exception set out in Article 5 § 1 (c) (ibid., § 99)."

This understanding is supported by the reference in Lawless (cited above, § 14, quoted in paragraph 104 above) to two options when bringing a person before a judge: either for the purpose of examining the question of deprivation of liberty or for the purpose of deciding on the merits of a criminal charge. Moreover, as the Court pointed out in Brogan and Others (cited above, § 58):",
                "“the fact that a detained person is not charged or brought before a court does not in itself amount to a violation of the first part of Article 5 § 3. No violation of Article 5 § 3 can arise if the arrested person is released ‘promptly’ before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible (see the de Jong, Baljet and van den Brink judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, p. 25, § 52).

Malta [GC], no. 25642/94, § 48, ECHR 1999 ‑ III), the strict time constraint imposed by this requirement leaves little flexibility in interpretation; otherwise there would be a serious weakening of a procedural guarantee to the detriment of the individual and a risk of impairing the very essence of the right protected by this provision (see, for example, McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 33, ECHR 2006 ‑ X)."

It therefore appears that the period needed between a person’s detention for preventive purposes and the person’s prompt appearance before a judge or judicial officer should be shorter than in the case of pre-trial detention in criminal proceedings. Whereas for a person deprived of his or her liberty “on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence” under the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (c), any period in excess of four days is prima facie too long (see paragraph 131 above) a significantly shorter period might be required in order to be viewed as “prompt” in the case of a person deprived of his or her liberty outside the context of criminal proceedings “when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence”."

It does not follow from the fact of resorting to preventive detention that the authorities have any intention of charging the person in question or carrying out further investigations in order to verify whether a charge can be brought.

The bar was located approximately 700 metres from Amagertorv Square (see paragraph 22 above) on the Strøget pedestrian shopping street in the centre of Copenhagen, where the first big fight broke out at 3.41 p.m. The three applicants, together with the group, left the pub and went through Strøget towards Amagertorv Square.

It discerns no evidence of bad faith or neglect on the part of the national authorities in applying the relevant legislation. On the contrary, as Chief Inspector B.O. explained before the domestic court, the police’s intention was, first, to talk to the various groups in an attempt to calm them down. After the first fights, it was planned that only the instigators should be detained. The assessment in this regard was to be made on the basis of the actual behaviour of those concerned, and the premise was that no persons would be detained who did not act as instigators (see paragraph 21 above). However, all three applicants were considered instigators (see, in particular, the statements of police officers P.W. and M.W. in paragraphs 22 and 23 above). The domestic courts accepted the facts as presented by the police officers. These findings were neither arbitrary nor manifestly unreasonable, and the Court lacks any objective reasons, let alone cogent evidence, to call into question the assessment made at national level."

Moreover, Article 134a of the Penal Code set out the obligation not to take part in fights or become involved in other serious breaches of the peace in a public place where such actions took place by mutual consent or with several persons acting together; a breach of this provision was punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and six months.

Indeed, as it was considered that the second and third applicants and the first applicant respectively had been prevented from instigating or continuing to instigate a brawl between football hooligans at Amagertorv Square at 3.50 p.m. and in front of Tivoli Gardens at 4.45 p.m. on the relevant day, the place and time could be very precisely described.

With a view to its examination of the preventive detention at issue in the present case, the Court considers it useful to elaborate on this criterion in respect of the second limb. In its view, less severe measures have to be considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained. Preventive detention cannot reasonably be considered necessary unless a proper balance is struck between the importance in a democratic society of preventing an imminent risk of an offence being committed and the importance of the right to liberty. In order to be proportionate to such a serious measure as deprivation of liberty, the concrete and specific “offence” referred to under the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (c) must also be of a serious nature, entailing danger to life and limb or significant material damage. It follows in addition that the detention should cease as soon as the risk has passed, which requires monitoring, the duration of the detention being also a relevant factor (on the latter point, see, for example, Schwabe and M.G., cited above, § 78)."

Moreover, although there were several fights up until the start of the match, the manoeuvre tactics continued to be a dialogue to ensure that the large number of spectators behaved and made their way to the stadium to watch the match. In his statement (see paragraph 22 above) Police Constable P.W. confirmed that at the beginning there had been a good atmosphere and no violence. He and a colleague had simply “kept an eye” on the Danish football fans in the bar. When they had received reports that Swedish and Danish fans were to meet and fight and the group had started leaving the bar, walking down the pedestrian shopping street towards Amagertorv Square, approximately 700 metres away, where the first fight had broken out at 3.41 p.m., the police had followed the Danish group and had reported back to the control room.

It is true that detention for an unpredictable amount of time owing to a legislative gap is in breach of the requirement of legal certainty (see Baranowski, cited above, § 56; Gigolashvili v. Georgia, no. 18145/05, §§ 31 and 35, 8 July 2008; Yeloyev v. Ukraine, no. 17283/02, § 53, 6 November 2008; Solovey and Zozulya v.

Ukraine, no. 6759/11, § 36, 16 April 2015). But that was not the case here. Georgian law provided a clear basis for the applicant’s pre-trial detention and itself limited its duration. Admittedly, in three judgments the Court has said that if a national court does not fix the duration of pre-trial detention, that gives rise to uncertainty even if its maximum is clear from domestic law (see Lutsenko v. Ukraine, no. 6492/11, § 73, 3 July 2012; Gal, cited above, § 37; and Kleutin v. Ukraine, no. 5911/05, § 105, 23 June 2016). But those rulings must be understood in context. In all three cases the national courts had also failed to give even minimally cogent reasons for ordering pre-trial detention. They are similar to several cases in which the Court found a breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention owing to the combination of a lack of any reasons for ordering pre-trial detention and a failure to fix its duration (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, §§ 136-37, ECHR 2005-X (extracts); Vladimir Solovyev v. Russia, no. 2708/02, §§ 95-98, 24 May 2007; Gubkin v. Russia, no. 36941/02, §§ 111-14, 23 April 2009; Arutyunyan v.

Those judgments should not therefore be read as laying down a requirement under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention for the national courts to fix the duration of pre-trial detention in their decisions regardless of how the matter is regulated in domestic law. All that this provision requires is rules that are foreseeable in their application."

Since 2009 he had crossed the border more than sixty times. Secondly, the applicant’s wife had left the country on 21 May 2013, immediately after the applicant had been served with the summons to appear for his interview with the investigator in Kutaisi. Thirdly, the search of the applicant’s flat on 21 May 2013 had revealed large sums in cash.

Yet he had been arrested by an investigator from the district prosecutor’s office of Western Georgia, and charged by a prosecutor from the same office. His arrest and the criminal proceedings against him were therefore unlawful. Moreover, his arrest had been in breach of Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 144 below). The alleged risk that he would flee was not supported by concrete evidence, and was belied by his repeated appearances before the investigating authorities and his public pledge that he would cooperate with them. Also, he had been out of Georgia many times and had not once tried to flee, including after the opening of the investigation. On the day of his arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning. There had therefore been no need to detain him without a judicial warrant. The alleged risk of his obstructing the investigation was also not specifically borne out. Moreover, the investigation had already lasted several months without any instances of his having interfered with it being reported.

In particular, by law only acting, not former, members of the Government had to be prosecuted by the Minister of Justice rather than a regular prosecutor. The court went on to say that there was enough information to show that there was a reasonable suspicion against the applicant and Mr Z.T. The other pre-requisites for placing the applicant in pre-trial detention were also in place. A number of investigative steps were yet to be carried out, and as was apparent from the prosecution’s request, there was a risk that the applicant would tamper with the evidence or put pressure on witnesses. That was borne out, in particular, by the applicant’s having already tried to put pressure on a witness against him. Another factor which suggested such a risk was that the applicant had for many years held high public office and was still an influential figure in some circles of Georgian society, especially bearing in mind that the charges against him related to his time in office. Many witnesses were former subordinates of his or people under his professional or personal influence. The court also agreed with the prosecution that there was a risk that the applicant would flee.

He argued that on a proper reading of the relevant statutory provisions the Minister of Justice alone was competent to prosecute offences committed by anyone in their capacity as member of the Government, not only someone who was such a member at the time when the prosecution was being brought. He also argued that the Kutaisi City Court had erred by not examining in detail the lawfulness of his arrest. That arrest had been in breach of Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in particular because on the day of the arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning. It was also hard to believe that the Kutaisi City Court, which had ruled on the prosecution’s request just three or four hours after it had been made, had really studied the evidence said to give rise to a reasonable suspicion against the applicant. There were no facts or information in the case file to suggest that he had committed the offences. The lower court had also expected him to disprove the risks of flight and obstruction of justice alleged by the prosecution rather than require the prosecution to establish those risks. Its finding that the applicant had put pressure on a witness ran counter to the presumption of innocence. He had never called or threatened the head of the Border Police. The Kutaisi City Court had also disregarded the fact that in the months before his arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning several times. Neither that court nor the prosecution had pointed to evidence showing that he would flee abroad. He had travelled out of Georgia many times since the investigation had been opened. The argument that his being an influential figure in some circles suggested that he could influence witnesses made it clear that he was a victim of political persecution. His character showed that there was not even a minimal risk of his fleeing, putting pressure on witnesses or destroying evidence."

Prosecutors have questioned 6 156 persons, most of them UNM party activists, as witnesses in the framework of investigations into different suspected crimes, including misuse of the State funds and money laundering. The opposition party considers this questioning to be a politically motivated attack on the opposition. Currently, 35 former central officials are charged of whom 14 are in pre-trial detention, 14 have been released on bail, one is released without restrictive measure, one has been pardoned by the President after conviction and five have left the country. Other former civil servants have also been charged or were convicted.",
                "One of those charged and held in pre-trial detention is [the applicant] who is not only a former Prime Minister and former Minister of Internal Affairs but was also Secretary General of UNM at the time of arrest. The UNM has consistently and vehemently been challenging the necessity of applying this measure of restraint. The case has raised deep concerns in relation to the forthcoming presidential election – as one of the key organisers of the opposition became prevented from contributing to the campaign.",
                "There are signs that the courts are more independent than earlier in relation to requests from the prosecutors. For instance, there was an acquittal in a case against another former Minister, and the request for pre-trial detention was refused in another case against a leading UNM politician.”"

The United National Movement (UNM) has reported that several thousand of its activists and supporters were regularly interrogated and intimidated by various investigative agencies (some up to 30 times). A number of major opposition figures, including members of parliament, were violently attacked.

Many interlocutors have reported that there seems to be less political interference in the work of the courts and that the judiciary has become increasingly more independent, including in relation to the prosecution, which has been a point of concern in previous reports. This seems to be confirmed by the court proceedings against former government members, where requests of the prosecution have regularly been denied. There has been a decrease in the granting of pre-trial detention by the courts, combined with a decline of requests by the prosecution service. According to the authorities, in the first half of 2013, the prosecution service made 9% fewer requests for pre-trial detention than in the same period the previous year, and only 46% of the requests for measures of constraint, such as pre-trial detention or bail, were granted by the courts.

More than 4 000 claims concern allegations of torture and ill-treatment in prisons, while more than 1 200 concern violations of property rights and approximately 1 000 complaints were filed against in total 322 prosecutors by persons claiming that they were forced to accept plea-bargain agreements.",

In the following months a number of leading members of the former governing party and ministerial officials were arrested for alleged crimes committed under their responsibility during their tenure in office. The United National Movement has decried these arrests as political prosecutions and as revanchist justice. For its part, the authorities have stressed that no selective or political motivated justice is taking place, or will take place, in Georgia, but that these people are accused of serious ordinary crimes, for which the authorities have sufficient proof to warrant an investigation or initiate prosecution.",

However, especially in the current political context, it is important that in the criminal cases against former government officials, any perception of politically motivated or revanchist justice is avoided. The authorities should therefore ensure that the legal processes are conducted transparently and in a way which fully respects Georgia’s obligations under Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Not only should selective or politically motivated justice not take place, it should also be seen as not taking place.”"

In its report, published in December 2014, the Office noted a number of shortcomings with respect to those fourteen cases, including the cases against the applicant. The specific points in the report highlighted by the applicant related to the criticisms, in paragraphs 222-29, of the Georgian courts’ failure to give appropriate reasons regarding the credibility of the witness and other evidence against him, of the cogency of those courts’ findings in relation to each of the elements of the offences of which he was convicted, for example the exact manner in which he had exceeded his powers, and of the quality of their reasoning in relation to the factors determining his sentence."

There were, however, some aspects which raised concerns in that respect, such as the practices of transferring judges between courts, allocating cases without a fully transparent procedure, and changing judges in the course of ongoing proceedings with no explanation. Another issue was comments by public officials about ongoing criminal proceedings made in a manner implying that they had some control over the prosecuting authorities (see paragraph 7 of the executive summary). Public officials had also expressed their views on the guilt of some defendants before they had been convicted, which raised an issue with regard to the presumption of innocence (see paragraph 9 of the executive summary). The report also expressed concern about the courts’ failure in some cases to give reasons for their decisions to order pre-trial detention or to reject requests for release, and about the lack of provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure for periodic review of pre-trial detention. That had contributed to a practice of automatic prolongation of pre-trial detention up to the maximum statutory time-limit of nine months (see paragraph 11 of the executive summary).",

In a recent case, in which the Venezuelan authorities had refused to renew the broadcasting licence of the country’s oldest and most popular television station, a vocal critic of the government, the Inter-American Court first noted that in their decisions the authorities had set out an aim – to ensure more variety in the content available to viewers – which was legitimate. However, the court went on to examine whether that had been the real aim of the decisions. It took as its starting point the presumption that the authorities had acted in good faith. But it noted four strongly worded public statements by the then president, Mr Hugo Chávez, made shortly before the decisions, that the licence would not be renewed because the television station was hostile to the government. Analysing those statements jointly, the court concluded that the refusal to renew the licence had in reality been meant to silence criticism of the government. Though not referring to Article 30 of the American Convention, it held that this had been a misuse of power (see Judgment of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Granier et al.

The Georgian courts’ practice of not fixing time-limits for pre-trial detention was in breach of the requirement of legal certainty.

                "199. It is true that detention for an unpredictable amount of time owing to a legislative gap is in breach of the requirement of legal certainty (see Baranowski, cited above, § 56; Gigolashvili v. Georgia, no. 18145/05, §§ 31 and 35, 8 July 2008; Yeloyev v. Ukraine, no. 17283/02, § 53, 6 November 2008; Solovey and Zozulya v.

Ukraine, no. 6759/11, § 36, 16 April 2015). But that was not the case here. Georgian law provided a clear basis for the applicant’s pre-trial detention and itself limited its duration. Admittedly, in three judgments the Court has said that if a national court does not fix the duration of pre-trial detention, that gives rise to uncertainty even if its maximum is clear from domestic law (see Lutsenko v. Ukraine, no. 6492/11, § 73, 3 July 2012; Gal, cited above, § 37; and Kleutin v. Ukraine, no. 5911/05, § 105, 23 June 2016). But those rulings must be understood in context. In all three cases the national courts had also failed to give even minimally cogent reasons for ordering pre-trial detention. They are similar to several cases in which the Court found a breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention owing to the combination of a lack of any reasons for ordering pre-trial detention and a failure to fix its duration (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, §§ 136-37, ECHR 2005-X (extracts); Vladimir Solovyev v. Russia, no. 2708/02, §§ 95-98, 24 May 2007; Gubkin v. Russia, no. 36941/02, §§ 111-14, 23 April 2009; Arutyunyan v.

Those judgments should not therefore be read as laying down a requirement under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention for the national courts to fix the duration of pre-trial detention in their decisions regardless of how the matter is regulated in domestic law. All that this provision requires is rules that are foreseeable in their application."

Those charges, though leading to a separate decision on 30 May 2013 by the Tbilisi City Court to place him in pre-trial detention (ibid.), did not serve as a basis for keeping him in such detention for longer than nine months, as he was convicted in the criminal case under consideration here less than nine months after his arrest. The second time was on 24 June 2013, one month and five days after he was first placed in pre-trial detention (see paragraph 57 above). Those charges did not, however, become a basis for keeping the applicant in pre-trial detention, as the Tbilisi City Court turned down the prosecution’s request to that effect (ibid.). All those factors, and in particular the relatively short interval between bringing the initial and the subsequent charges, make it hard to see those subsequent charges as an expedient on the part of the prosecuting authorities to circumvent the statutory rule capping the amount of time that the applicant could be kept in pre-trial detention."

In their submissions to the Kutaisi City Court on that date the applicant’s counsel and the prosecution essentially rehashed the arguments about the risk of flight and the risk of influencing witnesses that they had already made on 22 May 2013. The only new arguments by the prosecution appear to have been that the applicant might have other unidentified fake passports and that such passports had already been used by other former officials to flee abroad, and that the risk of influencing witnesses remained, as the witnesses, though already interviewed, were still due to testify at trial, which was by law the only way of adducing their evidence.

It thus entirely disregarded the passage of time and made it clear that it was for the applicant to show that his detention was no longer justified (see paragraph 51 above). However, under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention it is incumbent on the authorities, rather than the detainee, to establish the persistence of reasons justifying continued pre-trial detention (see Ilijkov, cited above, § 85, and Bykov v.

That was particularly relevant in this case, in which criminal proceedings had been used to prevent a major opposition politician from taking part in the political process. The role of Article 18 was to prevent such abuses. The question how complaints under that provision were to be made out had been answered inconsistently by the Court in its case-law. Divergences could be detected in particular with respect to the standard of proof and the types of evidence capable of showing an ulterior purpose.

Senior officials had from the outset dismissed his allegations out of hand and opposed a proper investigation into them. Both investigations into those allegations had been carried out by officials who had not been sufficiently independent. The second investigation, by the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, had been opened only after the Chamber judgment. The Government’s explanation about the limited amount of time for which the surveillance camera footage was kept was unconvincing. The footage from the surveillance cameras of private establishments and the road-traffic cameras had not been properly examined and had not been provided to his lawyer, in spite of his express request. The statements by prison officers during the internal inquiry had been very brief and formulaic. Neither Mr O.P. nor Mr D.D., the main protagonists, had been interviewed in the course of that inquiry. Nor had any attempt been made to take the applicant to Mr D.D.’s office in order to check his assertion that he could recognise it. It was odd that in their statements gathered during the criminal investigation all the prison officers had been able, without referring to contemporaneous records, to recall their movements and actions on a particular day two and a half years earlier; that called their credibility into question. There was evidence from three inmates, Mr G.Ts., Mr I.P. and Mr K.T., which supported the applicant’s account and which had not been properly rebutted by the Government. The statements of Mr O.P. and Mr D.D. during the second investigation were not credible. There had been no attempt to verify the applicant’s allegations by checking the mobile telephone records of the men in the car transporting him from Prison no. 9 to the Penitentiary Department or by carrying out an identity parade.

In all cases which it examined on the merits and in which a complaint had been made under Article 18, the Court either found no need to deal with the complaint or dismissed it summarily by reference to its rulings under the substantive Articles in conjunction with which Article 18 had been pleaded – often because the parties had either not pursued the point at all or had done so with insufficient specificity (see, among others, Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, §§ 93 and 104, Series A no. 22; Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 64, Series A no. 24; The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 75, Series A no. 30; Sporrong and Lönnroth v.

The first was that Article 18 could only be applied in conjunction with another Article of the Convention, but could be breached even if there was no breach of that other Article taken alone. The second was that a breach could only arise if the right at issue was qualified, that is, subject to restrictions permitted under the Convention (see Gusinskiy, cited above, § 73)."

First, it did not explain what proof would be required to sustain an allegation that a restriction had been applied for an ulterior purpose. In Gusinskiy itself, direct proof flowed from a written agreement, endorsed by a government minister, linking the dropping of the charges against Mr Gusinskiy to the sale of his company, and from the terms of the decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against him, which referred to that agreement; also, the respondent Government had not sought to deny that link (ibid., § 75). Secondly, the judgment did not clearly explain what the position was when, as had happened in that case, and as often happens in practice, there was a plurality of purposes, that is, when a restriction pursued both a purpose prescribed by the Convention and an ulterior one; it merely stated that since Mr Gusinskiy’s right to liberty had been restricted not only for the purpose prescribed under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention but also for other reasons, there had been a breach of Article 18 (ibid., §§ 77-78)."

Moldova (no. 35615/06, §§ 49-53, 13 November 2007), it found that the head of a State-owned company had been placed in pre-trial detention on fabricated charges in order to pressure him with a view to hindering a private company with which he was linked from pursuing its application to the Court. The Court based that finding on the fact that the materials in the case could not lead an objective observer reasonably to believe that Mr Cebotari could have committed the offence in relation to which he had been detained, although it was also influenced by the context of the case (ibid., §§ 52-53)."

                "275. The next case in which the Court dealt in detail with a complaint under Article 18 was Khodorkovskiy (cited above). Mr Khodorkovskiy, a wealthy businessman who was also active in politics, complained that the real aims of a criminal case against him and his related pre-trial detention were to take him out of the public arena and enable the State to appropriate the assets of his company, Yukos, one of the biggest oil producers in Russia (ibid., §§ 249 and 251). The Court found no breach of Article 18. It started from the general assumption that the High Contracting States’ authorities acted in good faith, and held that it could only be rebutted if applicants “convincingly show[ed] that the real aim of the authorities [had] not [been] the same as that proclaimed (or as [could] be reasonably inferred from the context)” (ibid., § 255). In relation to such allegations, the Court “applie[d] a very exacting standard of proof”, and the burden of proof remained on the applicant throughout the proceedings (ibid., § 256). The Court then found that the authorities’ perception of Mr Khodorkovskiy as a serious political opponent and the benefit accruing to a State-owned company as a result of Yukos’s demise were not enough to establish a breach of Article 18 because the criminal prosecution of anyone with such a high profile would benefit his opponents, and because the charges against Mr Khodorkovskiy had been genuine (ibid., §§ 257-58). The opinions of others – political institutions, non-governmental organisations or public figures – regarding the political motivation behind the case against him were not evidence in the legal sense (ibid., § 259). The rulings of courts which had refused to extradite associates of his to Russia, or had denied legal assistance to, issued injunctions against, or made awards against the Russian authorities in Yukos-related cases, although a strong argument, were not sufficient because the evidence and arguments before those courts could have differed from those before the Court, and because, in any event, the standard of proof applied by the Court in cases under Article 18 was very high and could be different from those applied domestically. The claim that the authorities had acted in bad faith throughout the entire criminal proceedings required “incontrovertible and direct proof”, which, in contrast to Gusinskiy, was lacking (ibid., § 260)."

Russia (no. 14902/04, §§ 663-66, 20 September 2011), which concerned related tax proceedings leading to Yukos’s demise, the Court likewise found no breach of Article 18. It again held that such finding could only be based on “incontrovertible and direct proof” adduced by the applicant (ibid., § 663). With reference to its conclusions regarding Yukos’s substantive complaints, it found that the authorities had legitimately acted to counter tax evasion and that it was for the applicant company to show that in doing so they had had an improper purpose (ibid., § 664). As in Khodorkovskiy, the Court held that the opinions of others on the political reasons behind the case against Yukos were of little evidentiary value for the purposes of Article 18. Since there was no evidence of further defects in the tax proceedings, it could not conclude that the authorities had misused them to destroy Yukos and take control of its assets (ibid., § 665)."

In neither case did it accept the allegations that the whole criminal cases against the applicants, former government ministers and leaders of opposition parties, had pursued political purposes. It focused instead on specific aspects of those proceedings (see Lutsenko, §§ 104 and 108, and Tymoshenko, § 298, both cited above). In Lutsenko this was the arguments in the investigator’s request to place Mr Lutsenko in pre-trial detention that, by talking to the media, he was trying to distort public opinion, discredit the prosecuting authorities and influence his upcoming trial. For the Court, that showed that the detention had pursued a reason not envisaged by Article 5 § 1 (c) – to punish Mr Lutsenko for publicly disputing the charges against him (see Lutsenko, cited above, §§ 26 and 108-09). In Tymoshenko this was statements in the prosecution’s request to place Ms Tymoshenko in pre-trial detention and in the corresponding court order which showed that the purpose had been to punish her for disrespect towards the court and perceived obstructive conduct during hearings (see Tymoshenko, cited above, §§ 30, 31 and 299)."

The question of plurality of purposes did not arise, as in both cases the Court found that there had been no valid grounds to detain the applicants (see Lutsenko, §§ 63-65 and 67-72, and Tymoshenko, §§ 269-71, both cited above)."

It resisted the applicants’ suggestion that if they provided contextual evidence of ulterior purpose, the burden to prove otherwise should shift to the respondent Government (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, §§ 899-903). It did not accept that the whole criminal case against the applicants had been for an ulterior purpose, an allegation which the Court described as “sweeping” and contrasted with allegations about specific episodes in such proceedings. Even if there had been a mixed intent behind that case, the ulterior purpose was not fundamental or decisive, as the case concerned serious accusations relating to common criminal offences unrelated to the applicants’ political activities and had a “healthy core” (ibid., §§ 904-08)."

The cases concerned the pre-trial detention of, respectively, an opposition politician and blogger critical of the Government, and that of a well-known human-rights activist. In both cases the Court analysed the factual and legal aspects of the charges and found that the detention had not been based on a reasonable suspicion, in breach of Article 5 § 1 (see Ilgar Mammadov, §§ 93-101, and Rasul Jafarov, §§ 121-34, both cited above). In itself, that was not enough to find a breach of Article 18, but proof of ulterior purpose – to silence or punish the applicant in the first case for criticising the authorities and spreading information that they were trying to suppress, and the applicant in the second case for his human-rights activities – derived from a juxtaposition of the lack of suspicion with contextual factors. In the first case, these were a close chronological correlation between the applicant’s blog entries, the authorities’ public statement denouncing them, the charges, and the arrest (see Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, §§ 141-43). In the second case, they were the increasingly harsh regulation of non-governmental organisations and their funding in Azerbaijan, allegations by officials and the pro-government media that activists such as the applicant were a “fifth column”, and the contemporaneous detention of other such activists (see Rasul Jafarov, cited above, §§ 156-62).",

But inasmuch as they underscore the exhaustiveness of the purposes for which the rights in the Convention may be restricted, Article 18’s terms (“shall not be applied for any purpose other than ...”) appear capable of allowing a more objective assessment of the presence or absence of an ulterior purpose and thus of a misuse of power (“ détournement de pouvoir ”, as stated in the Convention’s Travaux Préparatoires – see paragraph 154 above). Moreover, an approach that simply focuses on proof of bad faith does not sit well with that taken by the Court with respect to the restriction clauses in the Convention, which Article 18 is intended to complement. For example, in examining whether an interference with the rights guaranteed by Articles 8 to 11 is “necessary in a democratic society” for the pursuit of a legitimate aim, the Court always insists that its supervision is not limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State’s authorities have exercised their discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith (see, for example, The Sunday Times (no. 1), cited above, § 59; Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, § 68, Series A no. 130; and Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 196 (iii), ECHR 2015 (extracts)).

The question in such situations is whether the prescribed purpose invariably expunges the ulterior one, whether the mere presence of an ulterior purpose contravenes Article 18, or whether there is some intermediary answer."

                "293. In assessing that point, the Court will begin by taking account of Article 18’s wording and place in the general scheme of the Convention. As already noted, it complements the clauses which provide for restrictions of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention. Its wording (“shall not be applied for any purpose other than”) matches closely the wording of those clauses (for example, Article 5 § 1, second sentence: “save in the following cases”; Article 8 § 2: “no interference ... except such as ... is necessary in the interests of”; Article 9 § 2: “be subject only to such limitations as ... are necessary ... in the interests of”; and Article 11 § 2: “No restrictions ... other than such as ... are necessary ... in the interests of”). The similarity is even clearer in the French text (Article 18: “ que dans le but ”; Article 5 § 1: “ sauf dans les cas suivants ”; Article 8 § 2: “ Il ne peut y avoir ingérence ... que pour autant que ”; Article 9 § 2: “ d’autres restrictions que celle qui ”; and Article 11 § 2: “ ne peut faire l’objet d’autres restrictions que celles qui ”). Since the Convention must be interpreted in a way which promotes harmony between its provisions (see, among other authorities, Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, § 68, Series A no. 28; Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 48, ECHR 2005-X; and A and B v. Norway [GC], nos. 24130/11 and 29758/11, § 133, ECHR 2016), and since, when using the same terms, its different provisions must normally be taken to refer to the same concept (see Perinçek, cited above, §§ 134 and 146, with further references), in interpreting Article 18 the Court must thus take into account its usual approach to those restriction clauses."

In such situations, the mere presence of a purpose which does not fall within the respective restriction clause cannot of itself give rise to a breach of Article 18. There is a considerable difference between cases in which the prescribed purpose was the one that truly actuated the authorities, though they also wanted to gain some other advantage, and cases in which the prescribed purpose, while present, was in reality simply a cover enabling the authorities to attain an extraneous purpose, which was the overriding focus of their efforts. Holding that the presence of any other purpose by itself contravenes Article 18 would not do justice to that fundamental difference, and would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of Article 18, which is to prohibit the misuse of power. Indeed, it could mean that each time the Court excludes an aim or a ground pleaded by the Government under a substantive provision of the Convention, it must find a breach of Article 18, because the Government’s pleadings would be proof that the authorities pursued not only the purpose that the Court accepted as legitimate, but also another one."

It has since then relied on the concept of burden of proof in certain particular contexts. On a number of occasions, it has recognised that a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio, that is that the burden of proof in relation to an allegation lies on the party which makes it, is not possible, notably in instances when this has been justified by the specific evidentiary difficulties faced by the applicants (see, for example, Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 68, in relation to the exhaustion of domestic remedies; Baka, cited above, §§ 143 in fine and 149, and the examples cited therein, in relation to various substantive Articles of the Convention; and J.K. and Others v.

Although the criminal prosecutions against a number of former ministers and other high officials from UNM could suggest a wish to eliminate or harm that party, they could equally reflect a desire to deal with alleged wrongdoings under a previous government whose members could not be held to account while in power. The mere fact that a politician is criminally prosecuted, even during an electoral campaign, is not automatically in breach of his or her right to run for office (see Uspaskich v. Lithuania, no. 14737/08, §§ 90-100, 20 December 2016).

Such statements can only be seen as proof of ulterior purpose behind a judicial decision if there is evidence that the courts were not sufficiently independent from the executive authorities. No such evidence has been put forward in this case. On the contrary, it appears that in many cases against former UNM officials – including the case against the applicant’s co ‑ accused, Mr Z.T. – the courts turned down the prosecution’s requests to impose pre-trial detention, and that, as of September 2013, fourteen out of the thirty-five former high officials from UNM who had been charged with criminal offences were in pre-trial detention and fourteen others had been released on bail (see paragraphs 39, 131 and 134 above).

But, without going into the question whether that was in line with the Georgian rules of criminal procedure – a point not discussed by either party in their observations – the Court is not persuaded that this was redolent of forum shopping, for two reasons. First, although it placed the applicant in pre-trial detention, the Kutaisi City Court ordered the release on bail of his co-accused, Mr Z.T., who was also a prominent UNM figure. Secondly, on 30 May 2013, just eight days after that decision, the Tbilisi City Court also placed the applicant in pre-trial detention in relation to separate charges brought against him on 28 May 2013 (see paragraph 56 above)."

It is sensitive to its subsidiary role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a primary finder of fact. Yet, when faced with allegations of such a serious nature as those made by the applicant, who at the relevant time was in the authorities’ custody, it must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny, even if – as here – domestic investigations have taken place.

The fact that the applicant only voiced his allegations three days after the said meeting does not weaken their credibility. Even assuming that he could have done so earlier, it is not surprising that, being in custody, he chose to make them in a way designed to achieve maximum publicity.

It is true that Mr G.Ts.’s and Mr I.P.’s statements are hearsay and that their reliability may be open to question in view, in particular, of the positions of subordination to the applicant that the two of them had previously held (see paragraph 96 above). But in Mr G.Ts.’s case that factor was somewhat offset by the fact that the applicant had dismissed him from his post and had caused him to be detained (see paragraph 108 in fine above). Moreover, when seen against the backdrop of the fact that in December 2013 Mr G.G. was paid an extraordinarily high bonus, apparently on the basis of the decision of another official alleged to have played a central role in the events on 14 December 2013, Mr D.D. (see paragraph 93 above), Mr G.Ts.’s and Mr I.P.’s statements cannot be dismissed out of hand, even if such bonuses were also paid to other prison officials. The authorities do not appear to have attempted to verify those statements by objective means, for example by obtaining the video recording from the pre-trial hearing during which Mr G.G. was said to have spoken about his role in the events of 14 December 2013, or third-party evidence about Mr G.G.’s whereabouts in the early hours of 14 December 2013. They instead focused their efforts on interviewing Mr G.G., Mr I.M.

Its reliability is somewhat weakened by Mr K.T.’s previous position of subordination to the applicant, and much further still by the fact that a physical examination carried out by the investigators showed that the prison corridor could not be observed from Mr K.T.’s cell because there was no gap in the door, by Mr K.T.’s reluctance to take part in the ensuing experiment which was supposed to test that point, and by the conflicting statements of all Mr K.T.’s cellmates (see paragraphs 113-115 above)."

To begin with, by the time the applicant was pressured to provide information about Mr Zhvania’s death and Mr Saakashvili’s bank accounts, the reasons for keeping him in pre-trial detention appear to have receded, which led the Court to find a breach of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in relation to the period from 25 September 2013 onwards, which was shortly before the incident of December 2013 (see paragraphs 233-235 above). Then, at that time, December 2013, Mr Saakashvili, who has since then become the target of several criminal investigations, had just left Georgia following the end of his term of office as President (see paragraphs 13 and 126 above). For its part, the investigation into Mr Zhvania’s death, which had been renewed in late 2012, had apparently not made significant progress (see paragraph 61 above). It is clear that both topics were of considerable importance for the authorities. The Government’s statement at the hearing before the Grand Chamber that there was still a “huge question” for the applicant to answer in relation to Mr Zhvania’s death is particularly telling in that regard (see paragraph 61 above). At the same time, the prosecuting authorities had the power to drop all charges against the applicant at any point without judicial control, with the consequence that the courts would have had to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him (see paragraph 153 above), and thus cause him to be released from pre-trial detention, as promised to him by the Chief Public Prosecutor, Mr O.P., if he provided the requested information. The weight which the authorities attached to the matter is also apparent from the way in which the entire incident on 14 December 2013 unfolded and was later commented upon and investigated. The applicant was taken to meet with Mr O.P., who had been appointed to the post three weeks previously (see paragraph 60 above), in a covert and apparently irregular manner, in a clandestine operation carried out in the middle of the night. The authorities’ initial reaction to the applicant’s allegations in that respect was to issue firm denials (see paragraphs 68 and 70 above), and the ensuing inquiry and investigation were, as already noted, marred by a series of omissions from which it can be inferred that the authorities were eager that the matter should not come to light. Thus, the main protagonists, Mr O.P. and Mr D.D., were not interviewed during the inquiry but only in the course of the investigation, in September 2016, nearly three years after the events, and the crucial evidence in the case – the footage from the prison surveillance cameras – was not recovered."

The Court notes, however, that that provision is worded in quite general terms: it neither establishes legal preconditions for claiming compensation nor provides for specific mechanisms or procedures. Instead, Article 1176 refers to a separate law regulating those issues. It appears that it is the special law on compensation which should be applicable (see paragraphs 23 ­ 24 above). The Government did not refer to that law in their observations. Nor did they specify which provision of the domestic law the applicant ’ s detention had in fact violated.

Furthermore, a person convicted at first instance and detained pending appeal cannot be considered to be detained for the purpose of bringing him or her before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence under Article 5 § 1 (c) (see, in particular, Solmaz v.

The “quality of the law” implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application to avoid all risk of arbitrariness. The standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail.

Hungary, no. 41242/08, § 57, 2 October 2012). One general principle established in the Court ’ s case-law is that detention will be “arbitrary” where, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities or where the domestic authorities neglected to attempt to apply the relevant legislation correctly (see Mooren, cited above, § 78 )."

In the context of detention pursuant to Article 5 § 1 (a), the Court has generally been satisfied that the decision to impose a sentence of detention and the length of that sentence are matters for the national authorities rather than for this Court (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, § 103, 16 December 1999, and Saadi, cited above, § 71).

A measure which in itself is in conformity with the requirements of the Article enshrining the right or freedom in question may, however, infringe it when read in conjunction with Article 14, for the reason that it is of a discriminatory nature.

However, only differences in treatment based on a personal characteristic (or “status”) by which persons or groups of persons are distinguishable from each other are capable of triggering the application of Article 14. The words “other status” in the text of this provision have generally been given a wide meaning, and their interpretation has not been limited to characteristics which are personal in the sense that they are innate or inherent (see Khamtokhu and Aksenchik, cited above, § 61, and Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 70, ECHR 2010)."

The Court has previously recognised that the “place of residence constitutes an aspect of personal status for the purposes of Article 14” (see Carson and Others, cited above, §§ 70-71 ) and can trigger the protection of that Article. In so far as the applicant ’ s place of residence was explicitly mentioned as a factor in the sentencing decision, it introduced a difference of treatment based on this ground between the applicant and other offenders convicted of similar offences and eligible for a sentence of probation or a fine (see Paraskeva Todorova, cited above, §§ 37-44, and Moldovan and Others v. Romania (no. 2), nos. 41138/98 and 64320/01, § 139, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII (extracts)). The Court also notes that the difference in treatment introduced by the Chertanovskiy District Court and upheld on appeal by the Moscow City Court does not seem to follow from domestic law (see paragraph 10 above) and that the Criminal Code provides for the possibility for a person serving a suspended sentence to change his place of residence under certain conditions (see paragraph 9 above)."

Consequently, the illegitimacy of one of the grounds has the effect of contaminating the entire decision (see E.B. v. France [GC], no. 43546/02, § 80, 22 January 2008).

It did not explain in any form the relevance of this fact to the decision to impose a custodial sentence. While acknowledging the existence of strong social links in the applicant ’ s home town of Cheboksary, where he had good references from his neighbours and work colleagues, the district court did not justify why the benefit of a non-custodial sentence should have been conditional on the applicant ’ s ability to have a permanent residence outside his home region and near the place where he had been tried and sentenced.

It sentenced him to six years and six months ’ imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention under Article 66 § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 36 below). The court found that the applicant had stalked his former girlfriend, terrorised her and her family with telephone calls, sudden appearances and threats against their life and limb, had finally waylaid his former girlfriend in front of her workplace and had stabbed her twice in the neck with a pair of scissors with the intention of killing her. He had stopped short of stabbing his victim to death. Endorsing the findings psychiatric expert A. had set out in his report, the court was of the view that the applicant had acted with diminished criminal responsibility as he had been in a state of affective excitement and suffered from a neurasthenic syndrome at the time of the offence. The court found that the applicant, who had previously been convicted in 1975, 1977, 1981, 1983 and 1988 of comparable offences including dangerous and sexual assault and rape, committed mostly against former girlfriends at the end of their relationship with him, had a propensity to commit serious violent offences and was dangerous to the public."

Expert B. had examined the applicant on four occasions between February and September 2005. S. had performed psychological tests with the applicant in March 2005. Both experts had issued their common written medical report on 15 September 2005 and had supplemented it with a further medical statement answering the questions of counsel representing the applicant on 20 April 2006.

They were of the view that there was a very high risk that the applicant would reoffend because of his personality structure and could be expected to commit serious criminal offences mainly directed against potential female victims ’ physical and sexual integrity. The applicant had continually committed new offences while on probation, so that his probation had been revoked on five occasions. He had mostly committed crimes against the physical and sexual integrity of women and usually at the end of his relationships, when he had been unable to accept that his girlfriend had left him. Therapeutic treatment had not been successful so far."

It ruled that although the applicant had not committed any offences during his year at liberty, and although he had voluntarily and regularly undergone psychological treatment during that year, there was no reason to believe that he would abstain from reoffending. In the past the applicant had already abstained from committing further offences for longer periods. Situations similar to those in which the applicant had previously committed offences, especially against the physical and sexual integrity of his female partners, at the end of relationships, were likely to arise and to escalate again just as in the past."

The court also heard the applicant on 25 September 2009. It further based its decision to extend the applicant ’ s preventive detention on the opinion of psychotherapy expert B. and psychologist S. of 15 September 2005, supplemented on 20 April 2006 (see paragraph 13 above).

The court held that, in accordance with the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court ( see decision of 3 February 2003, file no. 2 BvR 1512/02) and of the Constitutional Court of Berlin ( see decision of 4 March 2009, file no. VerfGH 104/07) it was otherwise within the discretion of the court assessing the need to extend the preventive detention order to decide whether a new expert opinion was necessary. As a rule, an expert opinion would be necessary if the detainee suffered from psychiatric anomalies that demanded a psychiatric expert ’ s assessment in order to be able to predict the danger he represented for the public. Otherwise, a new psychiatric expert report was generally not necessary unless special new circumstances demanded a new examination of the detainee."

It referred to the arguments given in the Court of Appeal ’ s decision of 27 May 2008, adding that there had been no significant changes since then. The applicant had refused to undergo therapeutic treatment within the detention centre since he had been returned to preventive detention. His age of 57 years did not warrant a different conclusion as regards the danger he represented in the circumstances of his case. The written expert opinion of B. and S. of 15 September 2005, supplemented on 20 April 2006 and explained by B. at two hearings, lasting a total of six hours, before the Regional Court in June 2007, was therefore still recent enough."

                "24. On 24 March 2010 the Berlin Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant ’ s appeal. The court considered that releasing the applicant on probation on the condition that he underwent therapeutic treatment outside the detention centre would be irresponsible. There were no convincing and verifiable indications that the applicant had tackled his offences or the flaws in his character that had led to them. The year he had spent at liberty during the interruption of his preventive detention did not prove otherwise, although he had not reoffended during that period of time. The applicant had already abstained from committing offences for longer periods of time in the past, but had nevertheless repeatedly committed serious offences against the physical integrity of his female partners when they had ended their relationship with him. Having regard also to the personality disorders leading to his dangerousness, the period of one year at liberty was therefore too short to prove that the applicant was no longer dangerous. In this regard, the court referred to the reasoning in its decision of 27 May 2008 and the expert opinion of B. and S. on which that decision was based ( see paragraphs 13-15 above)."

However, it considered that there was no proof of the success of this treatment. Instead, the impulsive and offensive way in which the applicant treated other people, notably those working in the detention centre, showed that his attitude and his character had not changed and that he was still unwilling to cooperate."

Moreover the court found that, although the prison authorities had, without giving proper reasons, refused to grant the applicant escorted short ‑ term leave from prison, especially short-term leave for the purpose of meeting his external therapist So., such deficiencies in the execution of the preventive detention did not justify the applicant ’ s release. The court recognised that prison leave was necessary in order to enable the applicant, in the long run, to prove his capacity to live at liberty again without committing further offences. However, the court was of the view that, even if the applicant had been granted the necessary leave since his readmission into preventive detention, the period passed since then would have been too short to prove that he was no longer dangerous. Therefore, the continuation of the applicant ’ s detention was not yet excessive."

The Court of Appeal was moreover of the view that the Regional Court ’ s decision not to commission a new medical expert opinion was lawful and did not breach its duty to establish the relevant facts. As explained above, a new psychiatric expert would not be confronted with a significantly different situation to the one B. and S. had found when they prepared their expert report. The applicant ’ s refusal to cooperate and to accept further psychological treatment within the detention centre showed that the therapy with So. had not significantly changed his character and behaviour.",

As the prison authorities had ignored and boycotted the court ’ s orders to grant the applicant access to external psychological treatment for years in a way the court had never seen before and which it found to be unconstitutional, the applicant ’ s interest in being at liberty now outweighed the public interest."

The Government submitted, first, that the said causal connection had not been broken, in particular, by the temporary refusal to allow the applicant to continue the external therapy he had started while at liberty. Since he had returned to preventive detention in May 2008, the applicant had declined all offers of suitable internal therapy made by the prison authorities until the impugned decision of 24 March 2010, in particular psychological counselling sessions in prison or psychotherapy treatment in the prison ’ s social therapy unit."

The Government further explained that the domestic courts ’ refusal to obtain a new expert report on the applicant ’ s dangerousness lay within their margin of appreciation and had not rendered the applicant ’ s detention unlawful for the purposes of Article 5 § 1. The domestic courts had not been obliged under the provisions of domestic law (Article 463 § 3 read in conjunction with Article 454 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; see paragraph 37 above) to obtain a new expert report as they did not intend to suspend the applicant ’ s preventive detention and grant probation."

Furthermore, the domestic courts had given extensive and convincing reasons why fresh expert advice was not necessary to establish sufficiently whether the applicant was still dangerous to the public. The assessment of the applicant ’ s dangerousness in the expert report of 2005/2006 had been updated by expert B. at the hearing before the Regional Court in June 2007, having regard to the impression he had gained from the applicant at the hearing and notably the applicant ’ s impulsive and offensive behaviour, and thus dated back only some two years and six months."

Moreover, the domestic courts had explained why the fact that the applicant had been at liberty for a short period of time and had undergone therapy voluntarily during that period did not alter the prognosis regarding his dangerousness against the background of his previous, numerous violent offences and the profound nature of his personality disorder. In particular, there had not been any change in the factual basis on which the prognosis as to the applicant ’ s dangerousness was to be based. The applicant had a tendency to commit violent offences in case of conflict in a relationship with a woman. As he had not had a relationship during the period when he was at liberty in 2007/2008, the fact that he did not reoffend did not prove that he had overcome his personality disorder. Furthermore, the weekly external therapy sessions he had started had not yielded any results concerning the treatment of his personality disorder, which had not been successfully treated in prison either, but had ended in a situation which resembled those in the applicant ’ s past relationships with women, prior to his committing serious offences against them."

Detention of a person “after” conviction, for the purposes of sub ‑ paragraph (a) of Article 5 § 1, means that there must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty at issue (see, inter alia, Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 117, ECHR 2008). However, with the passage of time, the link between the initial conviction and further deprivation of liberty gradually becomes less strong. The causal link required by sub-paragraph (a) might eventually be broken, first, if a position were reached in which a decision not to release was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the initial decision (by a sentencing court) or, second, on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. In those circumstances, a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 ( see M. v. Germany, cited above, § 88 with further references)."

Germany, no. 36035/04, § 74, 22 March 2012; and H.W. v. Germany, cited above, § 112; and in the context of detention in a psychiatric hospital Klinkenbuß v.

The reasonableness of the decision to extend a person ’ s detention in order to protect the public from further offences committed by that person is called into question, in particular, where the domestic courts plainly had at their disposal insufficient elements warranting the conclusion that the person concerned was still dangerous to the public, notably because the courts failed to obtain indispensable and sufficiently recent expert advice (see, in the context of preventive detention, Dörr, cited above, and H.W. v. Germany, cited above, § 107; compare, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Article 5 §§ 1 (e) and 4, Ruiz Rivera v. Switzerland, no. 8300/06, § 60, 18 February 2014)."

Germany, no. 36356/10, §§ 34-37, 21 October 2014 with further references).

Germany, cited above, § 109, for instance, the domestic courts based their assessment of the dangerousness of the applicant, against whom a preventive detention order was being executed, on an expert report dating back more than twelve years which was drawn up in a different context, at a time when the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still pending. In contrast, in Dörr, cited above, and W.P. v. Germany, no. 55594/13, § 52-53, 6 October 2016, the Court considered that there were no substantial changes in the applicants ’ personal or therapeutic situation during the execution of their preventive detention since the last expert reports dating back six years and two-and-a-half years respectively."

Germany, cited above, § 111). Furthermore, in “deadlock situations” in which no means of cooperation between the detainee and the prison authorities could be found for a considerable time, the importance to consult an external expert in order to obtain fresh propositions for initiating the necessary therapeutic treatment was repeatedly stressed (compare, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Article 5 §§ 1 (e) and 4, Ruiz Rivera, cited above, § 64, which concerned an expert report dating back less than four years, and Vogt v.

In determining whether the applicant ’ s continued preventive detention, ordered by the Berlin Regional Court on 12 October 2009 and confirmed on appeal, complied with Article 5 § 1, the Court notes that the applicant ’ s preventive detention was imposed by the Berlin Regional Court on 1 October 1998 together with his conviction for dangerous assault. The detention could therefore be justified under sub-paragraph (a) of Article 5 § 1 if it occurred “after” that conviction, that is, if there was still a sufficient causal connection between the applicant ’ s conviction in 1998 and his continued deprivation of liberty ordered in 2009/2010."

The Court observes in this respect that the domestic courts ’ impugned order for the continuation of the applicant ’ s preventive detention was made as the courts considered that there was a high risk that the applicant would commit further serious offences, especially against the physical integrity of women, if released ( see paragraphs 19-20, 24 and 14 above). These grounds as such were in line with the objectives which the sentencing Berlin Regional Court pursued by ordering the applicant ’ s preventive detention in 1998. The latter court had found that the applicant, in view of his repeated offences including dangerous and sexual assault and rape, committed mostly against former female partners at the end of a relationship with him, had a propensity to commit serious violent offences and was dangerous to the public ( see paragraph 6 above)."

It observes that the domestic courts themselves considered that granting the applicant prison leave specially for therapy sessions was important in order to enable him to prove his capacity to live at liberty without committing further offences ( see paragraphs 23 and 26 above). The applicant was therefore finally allowed to pursue his therapy with So. and resumed that therapy shortly after the impugned decisions of the Regional Court and the Court of Appeal, until it ended for reasons outside the authorities ’ control and responsibility ( see paragraphs 29-30 above)."

While it is true that the applicant had been refused, for a considerable period of time, the possibility of continuing external therapy with So. it is uncontested that the applicant had repeatedly been offered therapeutic treatment in prison and there is nothing to indicate that the treatment offered by the prison authorities could not objectively be considered as equally suitable to reduce the danger posed by the applicant. Nor does there appear to have been any legal basis, under domestic law, for the applicant to insist on availing of an external therapist for whom he initially expressed a preference. The applicant ’ s continued refusal to countenance the therapy on offer also influenced the negative prognosis issued by the prison authorities and was relied on by the Court of Appeal as a factor when reaching its impugned decision."

The 1965 Act had the general effect of removing juveniles from the ambit of the criminal law. In addition to its preventive aspect, it makes provision in section 37 for a series of measures designed to avoid as far as possible any intervention by criminal courts and any deprivation of liberty (see paragraph 28 above). A juvenile may be detained only in the cases exhaustively listed in the Act. As for temporary placement in a remand prison, the authors of the Act treated this as a measure which should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances and be of extremely short duration: section 53 authorises it only where it is materially impossible to find an individual or an institution able to accept the juvenile immediately (see paragraphs 28, 29 and 32 above)."

The concept of \"material impossibility\" within the meaning of section 53 of the 1965 Act is a source of controversy in Belgium, and neither the various submissions made by those who appeared before the Court nor any of the other pieces of evidence suffice to satisfy the Court that there was any unlawfulness resulting from a failure to comply with domestic law."

As is apparent from the words \"for the purpose of\" (\"pour\"), the \"detention\" referred to in the text is a means of ensuring that the person concerned is placed under \"educational supervision\", but the placement does not necessarily have to be an immediate one. Just as Article 5 § 1 recognises - in sub-paragraphs (c) and (a) (art. 5-1-c, art. 5-1-a) - the distinction between pre-trial detention and detention after conviction, so sub-paragraph (d) (art. 5-1-d) does not preclude an interim custody measure being used as a preliminary to a regime of supervised education, without itself involving any supervised education.

Moreover, having been in touch with the physicians whom [ the applicant ] has [recently] contacted voluntarily [P. H. and C. G. ], the county medical officer considers that these consultations were partly economically motivated [on account of the fact that the applicant needed medical certificates in order to continue to receive sickness benefit ], partly motivated by his wish to be declared mentally healthy, but [not motivated] by any willingness to commence treatment.

He has been subjected to compulsory isolation since February 1995 and has during this period absconded from the hospital on several occasions – on the latest occasion for more than two years. During these two years he did not have any contact with the county medical officer or the consulting physician. Periodically he has used a false name and has been living a very secluded life, obviously owing to the risk of being discovered. A life at liberty makes great demands upon the person carrying the infection. During the time preceding his compulsory isolation, [the applicant] was not able to follow the practical instructions issued. Subsequently, he has consistently declined the help offered by the consulting physician and the psychiatrist at the special care facility at the hospital and has instead responded with aversion and mistrust – and by escaping. [The Court] finds that it has been difficult for [the applicant] to accept the information regarding the HIV infection and that he needs help in dealing with this critical situation. It appears from the evidence that [the applicant] still shows aversion to the treatment offered and that he is considered likely to abscond. [The Court] has not been convinced that [the applicant] is not misusing alcohol and finds that, especially in connection with alcohol consumption, [the applicant] is likely to be unable to control his sexual behaviour. Against this background, [the Court] finds that there is good reason to suppose that, if he remains free, [the applicant] will not comply with the practical instructions issued and that this entails a risk of the infection spreading.”"

G. , which stated, inter alia, the following:",
                "“The opinions [by other psychiatrists and one psychologist] resulting from previous examinations were fairly unanimous in their conclusion that [ the applicant] was a man with a paranoid personality disorder, who misused alcohol.'Misuse'in psychiatric terms is defined as a maladaptive use of substances ... This diagnosis is to be distinguished from alcohol dependency, which means a compulsive use of alcohol with abstinence and social complications, and is more difficult to master. The diagnosis'paranoid personality disorder'is defined as a pervading suspiciousness and lack of trust in other people, whose motives are consistently perceived as malicious. It follows from the definition of'paranoid personality disorder'itself that this is manifest in the patient's personality from the time he or she becomes an adult. Owing to the fact that the person in question perceives the disorder as part of his or her own self, the motivation for change is usually insufficient. It is not correct to talk in terms of lack of awareness of a disease, since it is not considered that a disease is involved but rather a variation in personality, although the latter may well cause complications in relations with other individuals and society. When such complications occur, an individual with a personality disorder may display different symptoms such as depression, anxiety, etc. In [my] interview with [ the applicant], the latter was fairly open and talkative. When he talked about experiences from his time at school, he displayed different emotions. He also showed empathy as far as other people from those years were concerned. He was also partly able to shoulder responsibility for his own mistakes, without blaming others. However, he was very rigid in his interpretation of what had occurred in his adult life and particularly the events of recent years after he had been informed that he had the HIV virus in September 1994. His attitude towards the county medical officer and the staff at the infection ward, whom he believed had kept harassing him unjustly, was almost hateful. [ The applicant ] felt that he had been subjected to persecution between 1994 and 1995. This could possibly be interpreted as a symptom of delusion. From 1996, he had not experienced feelings of persecution, inter alia since he had secured his own liberty. With regard to sexual relations, [ the applicant ] has stated that he preferred sexual contact with boys around the age of 17. He was not interested in pre-pubescent boys. He had been celibate since 1996 and had no longer any particular sexual desires or fantasies. He was fully aware that he was carrying the HIV virus and was careful to stress that he was not afraid to die. His attitude towards medication against the HIV infection was negative. The reasons for this were that such medication could have side effects and perhaps, above all, because it would entail limitations on his freedom since he would be subjected to various check-ups. [ The applicant ] spontaneously expressed a wish to have further talks on a voluntary basis. When asked whether such talks could be part of a treatment plan in cooperation with the county medical officer and the staff at the infection ward, he answered'no', the reason being that he would feel ashamed of himself if he were to give up this fight.”",

G. , found that the applicant fulfilled the criteria for a paranoid personality disorder, and that, judging from previous information, the applicant suffered from misuse of alcohol but not from alcohol dependency. According to C. G. the applicant could be described in everyday terms as an odd person, but not as mentally ill. With regard to the risk that the applicant might pass on the HIV infection to other persons, C. G. believed that neither he nor anyone else could do anything but guess.

The application of specific human rights in the context of the HIV/Aids epidemic” ), several examples of the application of specific human rights to HIV/Aids are illustrated. For example, Section 9, “Right to liberty and security of person” reads as follows:",
                "“ 110. Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that'Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedures as are established by law'.",
                "111. The right to liberty and security of person should, therefore, never be arbitrarily interfered with, based merely on HIV status by using measures such as quarantine, detention in special colonies, or isolation. There is no public health justification for such deprivation of liberty. Indeed, it has been shown that public health interests are served by integrating people living with HIV/Aids within communities and benefiting from their participation in economic and public life.",
                "112. In exceptional cases involving objective judgments concerning deliberate and dangerous behaviour, restrictions on liberty may be imposed. Such exceptional cases should be handled under ordinary provisions of public heath, or criminal laws, with appropriate due process protection.",
                "113. Compulsory HIV testing can constitute a deprivation of liberty and a violation of the right to security of person. This coercive measure is often utilised with regard to groups least able to protect themselves because they are within the ambit of government institutions or the criminal law, e.g. soldiers, prisoners, sex workers, injecting drug users and men who have sex with men. There is no public health justification for such compulsory HIV testing. Respect for the right to physical integrity requires that testing be voluntary and that no testing be carried out without informed consent. ”",
                "In order to reflect new standards in HIV treatment as regards the international law on health rights, Guideline 6 concerning “Access to prevention, treatment, care and support” was revised following the Third International Consultation on HIV/Aids and Human Rights in Geneva on 25 to 26 July 2002.",

Public heath policy, C. Health controls) :",

In particular, the notions “reasonable cause” and “a manifest risk of the infection being spread” were too vague and the preparatory notes gave no indication as to their meaning. Moreover, the requirements set out in the provision in question had never been fulfilled, since it required not only that he should have failed to comply with the practical instructions issued, but also that this should have entailed a manifest risk of his spreading the HIV virus. In addition, the instructions issued by the county medical officer had not been included in his medical record as prescribed by section 16 of the 1988 Act.",
                "Thus, although admittedly he had failed to appear at some of his appointments with the county medical officer and had absconded, thereby failing to comply with practical instructions issued by the county medical officer, this could not be said to have entailed a manifest risk of his spreading the HIV infection. In this connection, he referred to the fact that, during his last two years on the run, he had had to seek medical treatment twice and on both occasions he had said that he had the HIV virus. Moreover, he referred to his present conduct, including his sexual conduct, as confirmed by the witness who owned the farm hostel where he had stayed during his period at large from February 1997 until February 1999. He noted in addition, taking into consideration the advanced system in Sweden for registering the spreading of disease, that during his periods at large, which altogether amounted to more than four and a half years, there had been no indication that he had infected anybody. Furthermore, he drew attention to the statement submitted by the specialist in psychiatry, C. G.",

Even if he had, in fact, been isolated for “only” one and a half years, he pointed out that the parliamentary committee entrusted with the task of reviewing the legislation concerning infectious diseases had proposed in its report, having regard to Article 5 of the Convention, that any compulsory isolation should permanently end after a maximum of three months."

The detention had been lawful and free from arbitrariness and the 1988 Act satisfied the test of being precise and foreseeable as to effect.",
                "With specific regard to Article 5 § 1 (b), the Government observed that, pursuant to section 13 of the 1988 Act, it was incumbent on a person infected with a serious disease to comply with the instructions issued by a physician. Such instructions had been issued to the applicant by the county medical officer on 1 September 1994. The latter had, however, failed to satisfy a number of specific and concrete obligations that followed from those instructions. Moreover, it could be deduced from the 1988 Act that involuntary placement in a hospital was viewed as the last resort when voluntary measures had failed or were considered inadequate in order to protect other members of society. Thus, the applicant's detention had not been intended to punish him for not complying with the instructions but had been resorted to in the hope that his attitude and behaviour would change.",
                "With specific regard to Article 5 § 1 (e), the Government noted the Court's lack of case-law as to the detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases. They noted the “ Winterwerp conditions” relating to the detention of people of unsound mind and found that these conditions could also reasonably be applied in the present case.",
                "As to the question whether the measures taken were proportionate to the aim pursued, the Government stated that the objective of the measure in dispute had not been to provide medical treatment for the disease. They added that no treatment of an HIV-infected person would be carried out by means of coercive measures. Instead, the aim of confinement was to support, assist and encourage the carrier of the dangerous infection to change his or her attitude and lifestyle in such a way that his or her compulsory isolation could be ended as soon as possible.",
                "The Government considered that a number of voluntary measures had been attempted in vain during the period between September 1994 and February 1995 to ensure that the applicant's behaviour would not contribute to the spread of the HIV infection. Also, they noted the particular circumstances of the case, notably : the applicant's personality and behaviour, as described by various physicians and psychiatrists; his preference for teenage boys; the fact that he had transmitted the HIV virus to a young man; and the fact that he had absconded several times and refused to cooperate with the staff at the hospital. Thus, the Government found that the involuntary placement of the applicant in hospital had been proportionate to the purpose of the measure, namely to prevent him from spreading the infectious disease.",

Furthermore, they alleged that had the applicant not absconded so many times it might have been possible for the staff to assist and support him in such a way that a change in his attitude would have taken place earlier, thus shortening the length of his compulsory isolation.",

Accordingly, the Court endorses the view that Article 5 § 1 (e) is applicable.

                "36. The expressions “lawful” and “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law” in Article 5 § 1 essentially refer back to national law and state the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently accessible and precise to allow the person – if necessary with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences a given action may entail (see, for example, Varbanov v. Bulgaria, no. 31365/96, § 51, ECHR 2000-X; Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 50, ECHR 2000-II; Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, p. 2735, § 54; Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 850- 51, § 50; and Hilda Hafsteinsdóttir v. Iceland, no. 40905/98, § 51, 8 June 2004).",
                "Moreover, an essential element of the “lawfulness” of a detention within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (e) is the absence of arbitrariness (see, amongst other authorities, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996- V, p. 1864, § 118, and Witold Litwa v. Poland, no. 26629/95, § 78, ECHR 2000-III ). The detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or the public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained. That means that it does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is in conformity with national law, it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see, for example, Witold Litwa, cited above, § 78) and in accordance with the principle of proportionality (see, for example, Vasileva v. Denmark, no. 52792/99, § 41, 25 September 2003)."

With regard to the relevant domestic legislation, the applicant maintained that the notions “reasonable cause” and “manifest risk of the infection being spread” under section 38 of the 1988 Act were too vague; that the preparatory work on the Act did not give any indications in this regard; and that the requirements of clearness and foreseeability had therefore not been fulfilled."

Belgium, judgment of 29 February 1988, Series A no. 129, p. 21, § 49). In the instant case, pursuant to section 16 of the 1988 Act, the consulting physician was entrusted with a wide discretion when issuing the practical instructions needed to prevent the spread of infection. Those instructions could refer to the “person's contacts with the physician, hygiene, isolation in the home, employment and attendance at educational establishments, as well as his general way of life ... ”. Under section 17 of the Act, the county medical officer could alter those instructions in the manner he found most appropriate.",
                "On 1 September 1994 the county medical officer issued the following instructions to the applicant: he was not allowed to have sexual intercourse without first informing his partner about his HIV infection; he was required to use a condom; he was to abstain from consuming such an amount of alcohol that his judgment would thereby be impaired and others put at risk of being infected with HIV; if the applicant was to have a physical examination, an operation, a vaccination or a blood test or was bleeding for any reason, he was obliged to tell the relevant medical staff about his HIV infection; he was also to inform his dentist about it; he was prohibited from giving blood and donating organs or sperm; and finally, he was to visit his consulting physician again and keep appointments fixed by the county medical officer.",
                "Throughout the domestic proceedings the applicant's conduct, including his sexual conduct, and his compliance with the instructions set out by the county medical officer were thoroughly examined. Moreover – despite the fact that being admitted to psychiatric treatment or treatment for alcohol abuse was not amongst the instructions issued by the county medical officer on 1 September 1994 – subjects relating to those topics were extensively inquired into in respect of the applicant. These examinations led the County Administrative Court to conclude, in its judgment of 16 February 1995, and its subsequent orders to prolong the compulsory confinement of the applicant, that the requirements of section 38 of the 1988 Act were fulfilled. The same conclusion was reached in its judgment of 23 April 1999, upheld on appeal by the Administrative Court of Appeal on 18 June 1999. Accordingly, the national courts considered that the applicant had not voluntarily complied with the measures needed to prevent the virus from spreading; that there was reasonable cause to suspect that the applicant, if released, would fail to comply with the practical instructions issued by the county medical officer; and that such non-compliance would entail a risk of the infection spreading."

By way of comparison, for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 (e), an individual cannot be deprived of his liberty as being of “unsound mind” unless the following three minimum conditions are satisfied: firstly, he must reliably be shown to be of unsound mind; secondly, the mental disorder must be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement; and thirdly, the validity of continued confinement depends upon the persistence of such a disorder (see Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, judgment of 24 October 1979, Series A no. 33, pp. 17-18, § 39; Johnson v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 24 October 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p. 2409, § 60; and, more recently, Varbanov, cited above, § 45 ). Furthermore, there must be some relationship between the ground of permitted deprivation of liberty relied on and the place and conditions of detention. In principle, the “detention” of a person as a mental health patient will only be “lawful” for the purposes of sub-paragraph (e) of paragraph 1 if effected in a hospital, clinic or other appropriate institution (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 93, p. 21, § 44).",

Poland, cited above, §§ 57-63 ) unless other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained. That means that it does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is executed in conformity with national law; it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see, for example, Witold Litwa, cited above, § 78, and Hilda Hafsteinsdóttir, cited above, § 51 )."

Moreover, Article 5 § 1 (e) of the Convention refers to several categories of individuals, namely persons spreading infectious diseases, persons of unsound mind, alcoholics, drug addicts and vagrants. There is a link between all those persons in that they may be deprived of their liberty either in order to be given medical treatment or because of considerations dictated by social policy, or on both medical and social grounds. It is therefore legitimate to conclude from this context that a predominant reason why the Convention allows the persons mentioned in paragraph 1 (e) of Article 5 to be deprived of their liberty is not only that they are a danger to public safety but also that their own interests may necessitate their detention (see Guzzardi v. Italy, judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, pp. 36-37, § 98 in fine, and Witold Litwa, cited above, § 60, )."

Whilst this information must be conveyed promptly, it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest. Whether the content and promptness of the information conveyed were sufficient is to be assessed in each case according to its special features. Moreover, when a person is arrested on suspicion of having committed a crime, Article 5 § 2 neither requires that the necessary information be given in a particular form, nor that it consists of a complete list of the charges held against the arrested person. Furthermore, when a person is arrested with a view to extradition, the information given may be even less complete. However, this information should be provided to the detained in an adequate manner, so that the person knows why he has been deprived of his liberty (see Kaboulov v.

In their opinion, the applicant, having received no answer from the Lviv Regional Prosecutor ’ s Office, had a right to challenge the latter ’ s failure to act with a higher Prosecutor ’ s Office or a court. Prior to 1 September 2005 this challenge could be made before a civil court (Article 248-1 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Ukraine), and after 1 September 2005 before an administrative court (Article 2 of the Code of Administrative Procedure of Ukraine).

Such a decision could afterwards serve as a basis for awarding the person concerned compensation for damages resulting from unlawful acts or omissions on the part of State officials. The Government referred to the proceedings for compensation in the case of Kats and Others v.

They stressed that the applicant had made an unsuccessful compensation claim to Przemyśl District Court and that the latter had informed the applicant that his claim should be lodged at the place where the unlawful actions had allegedly been taken by the Ukrainian police officers; however the applicant had not done so, either on his own behalf or through an appointed representative.

Where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch v.

While the applicant did not present, and indeed was not in a position to present, any direct independent evidence capable of confirming his allegation that his injuries were caused by the Ukrainian police officers, the Court considers that, viewed cumulatively, the medical evidence, the applicant ’ s statements, the undisputed fact of his detention at Lviv police station and the lack of any plausible alternative explanation as to the origin of the applicant ’ s injuries, give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the injuries were caused by the police."

In the instant case, however, it does not appear that the applicant ’ s allegations were investigated, although under domestic law the relevant law-enforcement bodies are obliged to institute criminal proceedings in every case where evidence of a crime has been discovered and to take all necessary measures prescribed by law to establish that a crime has been committed and to identify and punish the offenders (see paragraph 24 above). Taking into account the specific circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that as the applicant had lodged his complaint and provided medical documents confirming the ill-treatment, the applicant had unequivocally raised his complaint with the Ukrainian authorities.

This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5: by virtue of paragraph 2 any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with Article 5 § 4. Whilst this information must be conveyed “promptly” (in French: “ dans le plus court délai ”), it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest. Whether the content and promptness of the information conveyed were sufficient is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see Čonka, cited above, § 50, with further references). It also reiterates that paragraph 2 of Article 5, like paragraph 4, is applicable both to persons deprived of their liberty by arrest and to those deprived of it by detention (see, by implication, Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, § 414).

In the meantime, pending the above asylum proceedings, the applicant lodged an application with the IAB on 28 June 2011 in order to challenge the legality of his detention in terms of the Immigration Act. The application was based on Article 5 § 1 of the Convention and Regulation 11(10) of the Common Standards and Procedures for Returning Illegally Staying Third-Country Nationals Regulations (Legal Notice 81 of 2011, hereinafter “LN 81” ) ( see “ Relevant domestic law ” below). In his application the applicant argued that the decision to detain him, as well as his ongoing detention, were contrary to the law. With regard to the original decision to detain him, the applicant argued that, contrary to the requirements of Regulation 11(8) of LN 81, when he was presented with the Return Decision and Removal Order no assessment had been made as to the possibility of exploring “other sufficient and less coercive measures”. Furthermore, in deciding to detain him, the responsible authorities had decided a priori and without an individual assessment of his situation that he presented a risk of absconding and that he was avoiding or hindering the return or removal procedure. Moreover, the decision was taken without the applicant having had an opportunity to make a request for voluntary departure. The applicant further argued that his ongoing detention was also contrary to the law because once he had presented his asylum application in April 2011, return procedures could not be commenced or continued in his regard under Regulation 12 of the Procedural Standards in Examining Applications for Refugee Status Regulations (Legal Notice 243 of 2008, hereinafter “LN 243” ) (see “ Relevant domestic law ” below )."

Indeed it had been correct to rely on Regulation 12(1) of LN 243, which stated that an individual had the right to enter or remain on the island pending a decision on his asylum request. In the present case, that situation had applied to the applicant when he instituted his challenge before the IAB. In the applicant ’ s case, had the asylum request still been pending, Section IV of LN 81 would in fact have been applicable, in particular in so far as an individual could not be kept in detention unless return proceedings were under way or he or she presented a risk of absconding. However, the situation had changed, given that on 2 April 2012 the applicant ’ s asylum request had been rejected by a final decision. The latter implied that Section IV of LN 81 was no longer applicable to the applicant and thus the IAB could no longer decide on the request in terms of Regulation 11(8) of LN 81. Moreover, the applicant was not arguing the illegality of his detention on the basis of its length.

At the end of their detention, migrants, including refugees, beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, asylum seekers and persons whose asylum claims have been rejected, are accommodated in open centres around Malta. Conditions prevailing in these centres vary greatly, with adequate arrangements reported in the smaller centres that cater for some vulnerable groups, such as families with children or unaccompanied minors, and far more difficult conditions in the bigger centres. As mentioned above, when the Commissioner ’ s visit took place the number of irregular arrivals had been very low for over 18 months and the 2011 arrivals from Libya had not yet started. As a result, the vast majority of migrants had moved out of the detention centres and were living in open centres, with the respective populations numbering at 49 and 2 231 respectively.

The only female detainee of the centre was accommodated in a separate facility. The Commissioner wishes to note however, that in accordance with the mandatory detention policy referred to above, most of the persons (approximately 1 100) who have arrived from Libya since his visit have been placed in detention centres.

Malta judgment (application no. 24340/08, 27 July 2010), it had taken more than a year to determine his application.

The applicant submitted that, as the Court had held in Louled Massoud, there was no effective domestic remedy for the purposes of Article 5 § 4 which he could undertake in order to challenge the lawfulness of his detention. Indeed, although the applicant had attempted a remedy, it had taken more than a year for the IAB to determine his claim."

As to the constitutional redress proceedings, and particularly the request for hearing with urgency, the applicant noted that the two cases cited by the Government had been in the context of the enforcement of a return order concerning a child following wrongful removal under the relevant Maltese law incorporating the Hague Convention on the International Aspects of Child Abduction, and thus represented exceptional situations. Moreover, the Hague Convention explicitly mentioned a six week time- limit within which the courts must reach a decision. The applicant considered that it was uncertain whether such a request for hearing with urgency would be effective in other circumstances. He made reference to the application in the case of Tafarra Besabe vs Commissioner of Police et al (27/2007), which had been lodged in 2007 with a request to be treated with urgency and in April 2013 ( the date of writing) was still pending. According to the applicant, despite the rules regarding court practice and procedure mentioned by the Government, it transpired from the Maltese judgments database that constitutional applications which ended with a judgment on the merits (as opposed to those struck out or withdrawn) generally required over a year to be concluded. The applicant submitted that in 2011 approximately eighty applications had been lodged before the courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction and only fourteen had been decided at first instance in that same year; a further thirty-three were still pending at first instance at the time of writing. One case had been decided on appeal in that same year, nine had been decided on appeal in 2012, ten in 2013, and eight were still pending on appeal. The statistics (submitted to the Court ) were even worse for applications lodged in 2012. These clearly showed that as a rule constitutional redress proceedings were not determined within days. Indeed, according to the 2013 EU Justice Scoreboard, the Maltese judicial system was one of the systems with the longest delays among the Member States. The two cases mentioned by the Government underlined the limited applicability of the urgent procedure before the courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction, which were the final level of judicial proceedings. Moreover, given that the courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction reviewed points of law, they rarely entered into a detailed examination of the facts, which would have been done by the courts below; thus, it could not be said that the whole judicial process was determined during the period of weeks when the case was being heard before them under the urgent procedure."

Nor was any explanation given to persons in the same situation as the applicant ’ s regarding their legal rights and the applicable procedures.

As to the Government ’ s submissions in respect of a bail application, the applicant submitted that the Government had failed to explain in what way this procedure was accessible to him, noting particularly that bail was usually granted in the course of appeals against removal orders and return decisions. In any event the granting of bail was subject to conditions such as the deposit of an amount usually in the region of EUR 1,000 and a guarantor who would provide subsistence and accommodation, conditions which were hardly ever met by immigrants reaching Malta by boat. Moreover, IAB practice showed that such bail was granted exclusively to persons having overstayed their visa to remain in Malta. Furthermore, a bail application was not intended to assess the legality of detention or to provide a remedy in the event that a violation was upheld."

The Government submitted in particular that the applicant could have sought judicial review in respect of the lawfulness of his detention by instituting constitutional redress proceedings before the domestic courts, which had wide - ranging powers and could redress any Convention violation. As to the length of such proceedings the Government submitted that a mechanism was in place for such proceedings to be treated expeditiously. They firstly made reference to subsidiary legislation 12.09 namely, the Court Practice and Procedure and Good Order Rules, which emphasised the need for speedy resolution of such matters (see “Relevant domestic law ” above). Secondly, they noted that it was possible for an applicant to request that a case be treated, heard and concluded with urgency. The Government submitted two examples : Richard John Bridge vs Attorney General, where the case had been decided by two levels of jurisdiction over approximately a month and a half (from 6 July 2012 to 24 August 2012), and a second case, Michael Caruana vs Attorney General, which had been brought on 2 August and decided on 14 August 2012 (no appeal having been lodged), in the context of Hague Convention proceedings. In their further observations at a later stage in the case, the Government submitted a further two examples, namely Stacy Chircop vs Attorney General (4/2013) concerning a breach of fair - trial rights in ongoing criminal proceedings, which had been lodged on 22 January 2013 and decided at first instance on 8 February 2013 (no appeal lodged ), and Jonathan Attard vs the Commisioner of Police and the Attorney General in representation of the Government (13/2013), concerning complaints under Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention, which had been lodged on 14 February 2013, had been decided at first instance on 1 April 2013 and was ( in May 2013 ) pending on appeal before the Constitutional Court."

Similarly, in relation to the reference to the Tefarra Besabe case, the applicant had not proved that a request for hearing with urgency had been lodged in that case. The Government considered that delays were exceptional and not the rule, and that the EU Justice Scoreboard should be ignored by the Court as there were no guarantees of its accuracy; moreover, it had not referred to constitutional cases. It was also wrong to consider that constitutional proceedings did not assess the facts as this was often the case, given that the complaints differed from those debated before the ordinary courts."

They considered that this could only be done when there were no effective remedies, which was in their view clearly not the case, given the examples above. It further noted that in Louled Massoud the Court had erred in finding that constitutional redress proceedings were ineffective. They considered that the Court had reached that conclusion on the basis of incomplete information about the workings of that system with regard to requests for hearing with urgency. They requested the Court to act in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and to let the domestic courts asses the evidence, allowing the Government to cross- examine witnesses."

Moreover, there was unlimited access to legal assistance provided by NGOs. The Government alleged that, had the applicant asked the detention centre staff for the services of a lawyer, he would have been provided with the services of a legal - aid lawyer. To substantiate their claim the Government submitted one example where a legal - aid lawyer had instituted legal proceedings on behalf of a person in detention ( Mourad Mabrouk vs Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs (39/2008) )."

While such a remedy was usually used in the context of challenges to removal orders, Article 25A (9) did not exclude the possibility that such an application could be made in other circumstances. The Government considered that Article 25 A (10) addressed the applicant ’ s complaint and although sub- article (11) provided for exceptions, release could not be excluded completely – in particular, the prospects of success were greater if the applicant ’ s identity had been established. Again, such a procedure could have been accompanied by a request for hearing with urgency.

The ICJ report considered that there was a need for substantial reform of the system of immigration appeals, by, among other things, entrusting to a court of law the task of reviewing in full the decisions taken by the executive immigration authorities or, at least, reviewing in full the IAB ’ s decision, with automatic suspensive effect on the execution of the expulsion."

Under Article 5 § 4, an arrested or detained person is entitled to bring proceedings for a review by a court bearing upon the procedural and substantive conditions which are essential for the “lawfulness” of his or her detention (see Amie and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 58149/08, § 80, 12 February 2013 ). The notion of “lawfulness” under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention has the same meaning as in Article 5 § 1, so that the arrested or detained person is entitled to a review of the “lawfulness” of his detention in the light not only of the requirements of domestic law, but also of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 § 1 (see E. v. Norway, 29 August 1990, § 50, Series A no. 181, Louled Massoud v. Malta, no. 24340/08, § 39, 27 July 2010; and Rahmani and Dineva v. Bulgaria, no. 20116/08, § 75, 10 May 2012 ). Article 5 § 4 does not guarantee a right to judicial review of such breadth as to empower the court, on all aspects of the case including questions of pure expediency, to substitute its own discretion for that of the decision-making authority. The review should, however, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the lawful detention of a person according to Article 5 § 1 (see S.D. v. Greece, no. 53541/07, § 72, 11 June 2009; and Popov v. France, nos. 39472/07 and 39474/07, § 94, 19 January 2012 )."

According to the Court ’ s case-law, Article 5 § 4 refers to domestic remedies that are sufficiently certain, otherwise the requirements of accessibility and effectiveness are not fulfilled. The remedies must be made available during a person ’ s detention with a view to that person obtaining a speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of his or her detention capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release (see Kadem v. Malta, no. 55263/00, § 41, 9 January 2003 and Raza v. Bulgaria, no. 31465/08, § 76, 11 February 2010 ). Indeed, Article 5 § 4, in guaranteeing arrested or detained persons a right to bring proceedings to challenge the lawfulness of their detention, also proclaims their right, following the institution of such proceedings, to a speedy judicial decision concerning the lawfulness of that detention (see Musial v. Poland [GC], no. 24557/94, § 43, ECHR 1999-II).",

The Court notes that the courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction in the Maltese legal system would have been competent to examine the lawfulness of the applicant ’ s detention in the light of the Convention. However, the Court has also held on numerous occasions that constitutional proceedings in Malta are rather cumbersome for Article 5 § 4 purposes, and that lodging a constitutional application does not ensure a speedy review of the lawfulness of an applicant ’ s detention (see Sabeur Ben Ali v. Malta, no. 35892/97, § 40, 29 June 2000; Kadem, cited above § 53; Stephens v. Malta (no. 2), no. 33740/06, § 90, 21 April 2009; and Louled Massoud, cited above, § 45). Where an individual ’ s personal liberty is at stake, the Court has very strict standards concerning the State ’ s compliance with the requirement of a speedy review of the lawfulness of detention (see, for example, Kadem, cited above, §§ 44-45; Rehbock v. Slovenia ( no. 29462/95, § 82-86, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, where the Court considered periods of seventeen and twenty-six days excessive for deciding on the lawfulness of the applicant ’ s detention ); and Mamedova v. Russia ( no. 7064/05, § 96, 1 June 2006, where the length of appeal proceedings lasting, inter alia, twenty-six days, was found to be in breach of the “ speediness ” requirement) )."

The Court notes that the first two cases submitted by the Government refer to the specific context of Hague Convention proceedings, where, as also noted by the applicant, the courts are bound by a strict time ‑ limit established by law. The other two cases mentioned in their supplementary observations are more recent. One of them can be said to have been dealt with speedily, although it is unclear for what reason this was so, but in any case the Court notes that in that case no appeal had been lodged. On the other hand the second case (concerning Article 5 § 3 ) was still pending on appeal three months after it was lodged. Consequently, the only example submitted by the Government which could be of some relevance, bearing in mind the subject matter, itself fails to fulfil the speediness criterion required by Article 5 § 4."

While it is true that those statistics failed to mention whether a request for hearing with urgency had been granted in any of the cases concerned, the Government failed to shed light on that matter. Likewise, the Government did not submit any details as to how often requests for hearing with urgency were granted, nor did they argue that requests for hearing with urgency in proceedings regarding the lawfulness of detention were, as a rule, acceded to by the courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction. It cannot be ignored that the example submitted by the applicant concerning the lawfulness of immigrants ’ detention and the conditions of such detention (as apparent from public information) was still pending six years after it was lodged. Against this background, little comfort can be found in the subsidiary legislation cited by the Government, which states that constitutional cases “ shall be expeditious”."

It is clear from the above that the Government have not submitted any information or case-law capable of casting doubt on the Court ’ s prior conclusions as to the effectiveness of this remedy.

                "The Government made reference to both sub-article (6) and sub- article (9), seemingly considering them as one remedy to which sub - articles (10) and (11) applied. On reading the law the Court observes that it is unclear whether the provisions are independent : the first, sub- article (6), refers to provisional release and the second, sub- article (9), refers simply to “release from custody”. While it is clear that sub- articles ( 10 ) - ( 13 ) refer to release under sub -article (9), it is unclear whether they have any connection with sub ‑ article ( 6 ), the purpose of which remains vague in the absence of any appropriate explanations by the Government or the domestic case-law.",
                "In any event, the Court observes that both provisions deal solely with provisional release from detention. Indeed, sub-article ( 6 ) is explicit to that effect, while under sub-article (9) this conclusion transpires from the fact that, as clearly stated in sub-article ( 12 ), a decision granting release can be revoked.",
                "The Government considered that Article 25A (10) addressed the applicant ’ s complaint and that, although sub- article (11) provided for exceptions, release could not be excluded completely. The Court observes that release under the said provisions may be granted only if it is shown that the detention was unreasonable on account of its duration or if there is no prospect of deportation. It follows that such a remedy is not applicable to a person in the initial stages of detention, pending a decision on an asylum application, and in consequence cannot be considered as a remedy for persons in that situation."
            ],
            [
                "57. In so far as this remedy may have been available to the applicant at a later stage, namely after his application for asylum had been determined, the Court notes that, even assuming that it could have resulted in his temporary release (had the applicant not been excluded for the reasons mentioned below), it would not have provided for a formal assessment of the lawfulness of his detention as required under Article 5 § 4. The Government did not deny this, limiting themselves to considering that there was no distinction between such temporary release and a finding that the person ’ s detention was not lawful. The Court cannot agree. It suffices to mention two basic notions : ( a) if that were the case, in a criminal context there would be no purpose in having two separate provisions in the Convention, namely Article 5 § 3 and Article 5 § 4; and ( b) while a finding that a period of detention was unlawful allows an applicant to raise a claim under Article 5 § 5, a decision granting bail does not, given that it is granted or refused irrespective of the legality of the detention."

However – even if one were to consider that a decision on provisional release which was dependent on whether the duration of the detention was excessive or on whether there was any prospect of deportation could in substance be considered as an informal assessment of lawfulness in view of the link with the requirements of the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (f) – the Court has already held such remedy to be ineffective. Indeed, in Louled Massoud ( cited above, § 44 ), the Court held that proceedings under Article 25 are limited in scope and offer no prospects of success for someone in the applicant ’ s situation (namely where the identity of the detainee, including his nationality, has yet to be verified). It is inconsistent for the Government to argue that despite the exceptions in sub ‑ article ( 11 ) the applicant ’ s release could not be excluded, given that the Government ’ s arguments under Article 5 § 1 revolve around the lack of cooperation by the applicant, his voluntarily misleading the authorities as to his identity and the threat he posed to national security and public order, all exceptions under the said sub-article. Moreover, in Louled Massoud the Court also held that such proceedings could not be considered to determine requests speedily as required by Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. The Government submitted no new examples capable of altering that conclusion, nor did they substantiate their argument that such proceedings could be heard with urgency. Indeed, the proceedings undertaken by the applicant to contest the lawfulness of his detention ( albeit under Regulation 11(10) of LN 81 and not Article 25A of the Act ) were also duly lodged before the same Board, and it took the IAB more than a year to determine the claim, only to find that the provision no longer applied at that stage and that it was not competent to assess any violation of Article 5. In the light of all this, the Court cannot but reiterate that, as they stand, proceedings before the IAB cannot be considered to determine requests speedily as required by Article 5 § 4 of the Convention."

The Court notes the apparent lack of a proper system enabling immigration detainees to have access to effective legal aid. Indeed, the fact that the Government were able to supply only one example of a detainee under the Immigration Act making use of legal aid – despite the thousands of immigrants who have reached Maltese shores and have subsequently been detained in the past decade and who, as submitted by the Government, have no means of subsistence – appears merely to highlight this deficiency. The Court notes that, although the authorities are not obliged to provide free legal aid in the context of detention proceedings ( see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, § 84, 25 October 2007 ), the lack thereof, particularly where legal representation is required in the domestic context for the purposes of Article 5 § 4, may raise an issue as to the accessibility of such a remedy (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia v.

The applicant recalled Malta ’ s obligations under Article 31 of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and particularly the prohibition of refoulement. The applicant argued that the Court ’ s statement in Saadi v. the United Kingdom ( [GC], no. 13229/03, ECHR 2008 ), to the effect that temporary admission to enter a country after applying for asylum did not amount to a lawful entry, had been confined to situations where a State had not authorised entry. In his view it was not a universally applicable principle that no asylum seeker could be considered to have been granted lawful entry, an assertion which would be contrary to the sovereign right of States to regulate entry into their territories. The applicant considered that he had received explicit authorisation under Regulation 12 of LN 243. Moreover, the applicant made reference to the European Union ’ s Return Directive (Preamble, recital 9) which, albeit not legally binding, provided that a third - country national who had applied for asylum in a Member State should not be regarded as staying illegally on the territory of that Member State until a negative decision on the application, or a decision ending his or her right of stay as an asylum seeker, had entered into force."

Nevertheless, on 7 January 2013, nine months after the applicant had ceased to be an asylum seeker, the Government had initiated deportation proceedings despite the fact that the criminal proceedings were then still ongoing.

As in Yoh-Ekale Mwane, in the present situation the applicant ’ s identity had been known to the Maltese authorities – upon his arrival, since he had disclosed all details requested of him, following his completion of the Preliminary Questionnaire and following his interview with the Office of the Refugee Commissioner – and at no stage had the Maltese authorities indicated the presence of a real risk of his absconding. In fact, the applicant had applied for asylum in Malta, clearly expressing his wish to be granted international protection in that country.

The applicant submitted that, significantly, the legal basis for his detention had been insufficiently clear and precise. The length of his detention had been based on a Government policy that had not had the force of law. In exacerbation of this lack of clarity and legal basis, the Government policy stated that if a detained migrant was imprisoned in Corradino Correctional Facility for any number of days (167 in the applicant ’ s case), this duration was deemed not to form part of the period of mandatory detention for that specific migrant, despite the fact that the asylum application would still be processed during that time."

He underlined that at no stage had an individual assessment been conducted in his regard in order to ascertain whether he did in fact present a threat to national security or otherwise, his detention being an automatic decision. The Maltese authorities had repeatedly stated that detention was necessary to safeguard national security, to ensure the smooth provision of services and to guarantee an efficient asylum procedure. In the light of that, the applicant opined that they could easily have applied reception arrangements that did not involve deprivation of his liberty. In his view, the provision of medical assistance, shelter, sustenance and other basic needs could certainly be carried out in an environment that was more conducive to a person ’ s physical and psychological well-being than Malta ’ s detention centres. Moreover, the nature and material conditions of the detention centres certainly did not conform to the Maltese Government ’ s stated intention of securing orderly and efficient procedures. The applicant stressed that the place and conditions of his detention had been inappropriate for the purpose pursued (whatever this may have been). He referred to several expert reports that not only highlighted the military nature of Malta ’ s detention centres but also commented on the low standard of the material conditions in those centres ( see the relevant extracts under “ Relevant international reports ” above, and the report relied on by the third party intervener ). He noted that Safi B ‑ Block was an apartment - style building entirely closed off by chicken wire and constantly guarded by soldiers or security officers, where no provision was made for the special situation of asylum seekers highlighted by the Court ( he cited, for example, M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, ECHR 2011, and Louled Massoud, cited above ) and by UNHCR (see paragraph 33 above).

Asylum seekers remained unauthorised entrants and were liable to be detained under Article 5 § 1 (f) to prevent their unauthorised entry. Moreover, such detention needed not be necessary in each case. They submitted that the sole fact that the applicant had made an asylum claim was not capable of regularising his position, nor could such an application render his detention unlawful.

They noted that none of the irregular immigrants reaching Malta carried documents, making it impossible for the authorities to ascertain the identity of the persons concerned upon entry. This resulted in a lengthy process which depended on the immigrants ’ cooperation. In the present case it was the applicant who had intentionally given wrong information (about his country of origin), thereby hindering the process of deportation. The Government submitted that the detention policy had been framed with reference to the situation regarding migration in Malta. It was based on domestic law and was not discriminatory. Detention applied to persons irregularly entering Malta or whose presence in Malta was otherwise irregular. However, vulnerable persons were not subject to detention."

In relation to the third - party submissions, the Government submitted a press release which they had issued as a reaction to the International Commission of Jurists (“ICJ”) report, in which they criticised the report as highly unrealistic. They considered that the ICJ had portrayed a very negative picture of a small country which had been doing its best to cope with a totally disproportionate influx of prohibited immigrants. The Court therefore had to take this into consideration. The Government considered that the limitations referred to in Article 25A (11) of the Immigration Act were in line with the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers ’ Recommendation to member states on measures of detention of asylum seekers (Recommendation Rec (2003)5 ) (see paragraph 33 above). Detention was consequent to breaches of domestic law and as such protected immigrants by giving them shelter, medical assistance, food and clothing, without which they would be homeless and without means of subsistence. In that light there was no point in deciding cases on a case - by - case basis. They further considered that the Return Directive did not apply to the applicant given that he had crossed irregularly by sea and had not subsequently obtained authorisation or a right to stay. Moreover, the twelve or eighteen months ’ detention periods were maximum periods justified by the need to prevent individuals from absconding and avoiding deportation. Such absconding was common, as evidenced by the various immigrants returned to Malta under the Dublin II Regulation.

The intervener drew attention to the fact that detention for the purposes of preventing unauthorised entry could be justified only where the detention could be shown to be closely connected to that purpose, for the whole period of the detention. In the light of international refugee law, as well as the relevant European standards, the circumstances in which it was permissible to detain an asylum seeker on the grounds of unauthorised entry had to be narrowly drawn. They noted that the recently revised UNHCR Guidelines (mentioned above at paragraph 33) and the Conclusions adopted by the Executive Committee on the International Protection of Refugees, established a presumption against detention. Those provisions stipulated that detention could only be resorted to where necessary on specified grounds prescribed by law (guidelines 4.1 and 4.2). They stipulated that the detention of asylum seekers for other purposes, such as to deter future asylum seekers, or to dissuade asylum seekers from pursuing their claims, or for punitive or disciplinary reasons, was contrary to the norms of refugee law. The ICJ considered that inconsistency of national laws or practices with these norms would be an indicator of arbitrariness under Article 5 § 1 (f). Moreover, EU legislation clearly considered asylum seekers as “lawfully staying” in a Member State during the process of their asylum application. As a consequence, their detention on grounds of unauthorised entry could not be provided for except for very short periods and in exceptional circumstances. The ICJ submitted that European Union law in the field of asylum should be interpreted as constituting “national law” for the purposes of Article 5 of the European Convention, unless domestic law provided for higher standards, since the Common European Asylum System was directly applicable in EU Member States as a minimum standard."

Further, the ICJ referred to the Council of Europe ’ s Twenty Guidelines on Forced Return which established a general principle whereby alternatives to the detention of migrants should be considered first, irrespective of vulnerability. Guideline 6 (see paragraph 33 above) had been held by the Court of Justice of the European Union to be an authoritative instrument of interpretation of EU asylum law, alongside the European Convention and the Court ’ s case-law. Similarly, the said UNHCR Guidelines clearly spelt out the pre-eminence of alternative measures over detention (Guideline 4.3). In a series of cases, this Court had found the measure of detention not to have been carried out in good faith, as, despite the situation of vulnerability, the authorities had not considered less severe measures ( the third-party intervener made reference to Yoh- Ekale Mwanje, cited above ). Even the UN Human Rights Committee, in C v Australia ( Communication No. 900/1999, 28 October 2002) had found a violation of the right to liberty because the respondent State had not demonstrated that there were no less invasive means of achieving the same ends. However, in Malta, any prohibited immigrant subject to a removal order had to “ be detained until he [was] removed from Malta”. This meant that the detention of undocumented migrants was the rule and not the exception; it was not applied on a case ‑ by ‑ case basis or where necessary as a last resort. The EU Return Directive excluded arrivals by sea from the further protection contained in it. Whether this exclusion also referred to persons authorised under national law (Article 12 of LN 243 of 2008) to stay in Malta pending the resolution of their application was unclear."

It considered that until a State had “authorised” entry to the country, any entry was “unauthorised” and the detention of a person who wished to effect entry and who needed but did not yet have authorisation to do so, could be, without any distortion of language, to “prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry”. It did not accept that, as soon as an asylum seeker had surrendered himself to the immigration authorities, he was seeking to effect an “authorised” entry, with the result that detention could not be justified under the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (f) (§ 65). It considered that to interpret the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (f) as permitting detention only of a person who was shown to be trying to evade entry restrictions would be to place too narrow a construction on the terms of the provision and on the power of the State to exercise its undeniable right of control referred to above. Such an interpretation would, moreover, be inconsistent with Conclusion No. 44 of the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ’ Programme, the UNHCR ’ s Guidelines and the Committee of Ministers ’ Recommendation (see §§ 34-35 and § 37 of the Saadi judgment), all of which envisaged the detention of asylum seekers in certain circumstances, for example while identity checks were taking place or when elements on which the asylum claim was based had to be determined. However, detention had to be compatible with the overall purpose of Article 5, which was to safeguard the right to liberty and ensure that no-one should be dispossessed of his or her liberty in an arbitrary fashion ( ibid ., § 66)."

Where the “lawfulness” of detention is in issue, including the question whether “a procedure prescribed by law” has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 § 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 § 1 and the notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention ( see Saadi, cited above, § 67)."

Nevertheless, in the context of Greece, the Court examined and found a violation of Article 5 § 1 under its second limb on the basis that the applicant ’ s detention pending asylum proceedings could not have been undertaken for the purposes of deportation, given that national law did not allow for deportation pending a decision on asylum (see Ahmade v. Greece, no. 50520/09, §§ 142-144, 25 September 2012, and R.U. v. Greece, no. 2237/08, § § 88-96, 7 June 2011 )."

The Court considers that the applicant ’ s argument to the effect that Saadi should not be interpreted as meaning that all member States may lawfully detain immigrants pending their asylum claim, irrespective of national law, is not devoid of merit. Indeed, where a State which has gone beyond its obligations in creating further rights or a more favourable position – a possibility open to it under Article 53 of the Convention – enacts legislation (of its own motion or pursuant to European Union law) explicitly authorising the entry or stay of immigrants pending an asylum application (see for example, Kanagaratnam, cited above, § 35 in fine, in relation to Belgian law ), an ensuing detention for the purpose of preventing an unauthorised entry may raise an issue as to the lawfulness of detention under Article 5 § 1 (f). Indeed, in such circumstances it would be hard to consider the measure as being closely connected to the purpose of the detention and to regard the situation as being in accordance with domestic law. In fact, it would be arbitrary and thus run counter to the purpose of Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention to interpret clear and precise domestic law provisions in a manner contrary to their meaning (see Longa Yonkeu v. Latvia, no. 57229/09, § 125, 15 November 2011 ). The Court notes that in Saadi the national law (albeit allowing temporary admission) did not provide for the applicant to be granted formal authorisation to stay or to enter the territory, and therefore no such issue arose. The Court therefore considers that the question as to when the first limb of Article 5 ceases to apply, because the individual has been granted formal authorisation to enter or stay, is largely dependent on national law."

                "98. Turning to the facts of the present case, and reiterating that it is primarily for the national authorities to interpret domestic law, the Court observes that it is faced with conflicting interpretations of LN 243, and particularly of Regulation 12(1) thereof, which provides that an applicant shall be “ allowed to enter or remain in Malta pending a final decision of his application”. On the one hand, the Government asserted that the provision did not grant any right to stay; on the other hand, the IAB ’ s decision held that the applicant had been correct to rely on it in order to challenge his detention, given that it provided that an individual had the right to enter and to remain on the island pending a decision on his asylum request. It is not for the Court to interpret the intention of the legislature one way or another. However, it may well be that what was intended was for the provision to reflect international standards to the effect that an asylum seeker may not be expelled pending an asylum claim (see for example, S.D. v. Greece, no. 53541/07, § 62, 11 June 2009), without necessarily requiring that an individual be granted formal authorisation to stay or to enter the territory. The fact that the provision, while establishing the conditions to be met by the asylum seeker, does not provide for any formal authorisation procedure or for the issuance of any relevant documentation (as per Article 9 of the Immigration Act) lends support to this interpretation. In this situation the Court considers that the first issue that arises concerns the quality of domestic law. The Court reiterates that the words “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law” do not merely refer back to domestic law; they also relate to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention. Quality in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible and precise in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, § 55, ECHR 2001-II, citing Amuur v. France, § 50, cited above )."

However, in the present circumstances, while considering that clarification of the legal framework is called for in the domestic system, the Court is ready to accept that the detention had a sufficiently clear legal basis, namely Article 5 in conjunction with Article 14 of the Act, and that, given that it has not been established that the applicant had actually been granted formal authorisation to stay – the Court in fact notes that the applicant had not been issued with the relevant written documentation under Article 9 of the Act – his detention between 8 April 2011 ( the date of his arrival) and 2 April 2012 ( the date of rejection of his asylum claim) (excluding the period of detention in connection with the criminal proceedings) fell under the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (f)."

In respect of the latter, the Court notes that Recommendation Rec(2003)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on measures of detention of asylum seekers, which was extensively cited by the Government, also considers that “ [m] easures of detention of asylum seekers should be applied only after a careful examination of their necessity in each individual case”.

Both the CPT and the ICJ considered that the conditions in question could amount to inhuman and degrading treatment under Article 3 of the Convention; furthermore, those conditions must surely have been exacerbated during the Libyan crisis, a time when the applicant was in detention.

Therefore the Court must only examine for the purposes of this complaint the period, amounting to more than six months in total, during which he was detained for the purposes of the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (f). Nevertheless, the Court has already considered periods of three months ’ detention pending a determination of an asylum claim to be unreasonably lengthy, when coupled with inappropriate conditions (see Kanagaratnam, cited above, §§ 94-95). Hence, it cannot consider a period of six months to be reasonable, particularly in the light of the conditions of detention described by various independent entities (see, a contrario, Saadi, cited above, where it took the authorities seven days, during which the applicant was detained in suitable conditions, to determine the applicant ’ s asylum application despite the difficult administrative problems with which the United Kingdom was confronted during the period in question, with an escalating flow of huge numbers of asylum seekers )."

The application had been lodged shortly after the termination of those proceedings and therefore could not be considered as out of time."

                "112. The applicant submitted that on his entry to Malta in an irregular manner the only documentation provided to him, subsequent to his classification as a “prohibited immigrant” under the terms of Article 5 of the Immigration Act, was the Return Decision and Removal Order (RDRO) together with a booklet bearing the title “Your Entitlements, Responsibilities and Obligations while in Detention”, produced by the Ministry for Parliamentary and Home Affairs. The Return Decision and Removal Order were of limited quality in both content and form. The document consisted of a standard text provided exclusively in English (see paragraph 27 above), and no interpretation or further explanation was provided to ensure that it was made comprehensible. In the Return Decision and Removal Order no reference was made to the applicant ’ s detention, the possible reasons for it or the possibility of challenging the legality of his detention. Similarly, the information booklet mentioned by the Government contained absolutely no information on the reasons for detention, either in a general manner or in a manner specifically relating to the applicant. The applicant noted that Regulation 12 of the said document provided information – albeit of an extremely basic nature – on the possibility of applying to the IAB if an individual felt that his detention was no longer reasonable. Furthermore, the document referred to the possibility of applying to the Board merely on grounds of the possible unreasonableness of the person ’ s detention and not on grounds of its unlawfulness. In addition, while stating that an appeal was possible the documentation did not provide any explanation as to how to lodge such an appeal or on what grounds, nor did it indicate the address of the Board or any other means of contacting the IAB, legal representatives or NGOs. Thus, the applicant submitted that he had at no point been informed promptly, in a language that he understood, of the reasons for his arrest, in violation of his rights under Convention Article 5 § 2. Even assuming that the reasons of the detention were self-evident given the circumstances, the applicant submitted that at some point in time the grounds for his detention had changed from the first limb to the second limb of Article 5 without any explanation being forthcoming. He further noted that according to the Court ’ s case- law such information had to give the real reason for detention, in order to enable the detention to be challenged under Article 5 § 4, and that different grounds of detention required different levels of information as well as different timeframes ( the applicant cited, for example, Kaboulov v. Ukraine, no. 41015/04, 19 November 2009, and Saadi, cited above )."

                "113. The Court reiterates that Article 5 § 2 contains the elementary safeguard that any person arrested should know why he is being deprived of his liberty. This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5: by virtue of paragraph 2 any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with Article 5 § 4. Whilst this information must be conveyed “promptly” (in French: “ dans le plus court délai ”), it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest. Whether the content and promptness of the information conveyed were sufficient is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see Čonka, cited above, § 50, with further references). It also reiterates that paragraph 2 of Article 5, like paragraph 4, is applicable both to persons deprived of their liberty by arrest and to those deprived of it by detention (see, by implication, Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, § 414). Thus, Article 5 § 2 applies to Article 5 § 1 (f) cases, although less detailed reasons are required to be given than in Article 5 § 1 (c) cases ( see Bordovskiy v. Russia, no. 49491/99, § 5 6, 8 February 2005 )."

                "115. The Court notes that the RDRO informed the applicant that he was considered as a prohibited immigrant according to Article 5 of the Immigration Act because he had entered Malta illegally and had no means of subsistence. He was further informed that his stay had been terminated and that an entry ban, a return decision and a removal order were being issued because the request for voluntary departure (which in practice he had never lodged) had been refused. The Court observes that, contrary to the applicant ’ s assertion, the RDRO also informed him that he could appeal against this decision/ order/ entry ban to the IAB within three working days at the Board ’ s Registry, Fort St Elmo, Valletta. However, the applicant stressed that nowhere in the RDRO was any reference made to the fact that as a consequence of such a situation he had to be detained, or to the legal basis for such detention, namely Article 14 of the Act. Nevertheless, the booklet, which listed the entitlements, responsibilities and obligations of the persons concerned while in detention ( and which was also given to the applicant on his arrival) explained that a prohibited immigrant could apply for refugee status and that pending the determination of that application “you will be placed in detention for a period up to 18 months” (which could be extended in certain circumstances). The booklet also informed the applicant, amongst other things, that any person detained under the Immigration Act could apply to the IAB if he felt that his detention was no longer reasonable. However, the Court observes that this information – which, moreover, explained solely that the applicant would be detained pending any asylum claim he might wish to lodge – again failed to give the legal basis for his detention, or even a part thereof (referring to the periods before, during or after the asylum procedure)."
            ],
            [
                "116. The Court thus observes that, while the information supplied by means of the RDRO and the booklet enabled the applicant to know why he was being detained throughout the different stages of his detention, what it failed to supply was the actual legal provision forming the basis for his detention. While the Court finds this regrettable, it considers that the information given to the applicant would have allowed him to contest the legality of his detention on the basis of the Immigration Act. While it is true that the information provided did not give details as to the method of instituting proceedings challenging the lawfulness of the detention (as opposed to proceedings challenging its unreasonableness or appeals against the orders issued), Article 5 § 2 does not require the State to give such elaborate details, especially where it is not alleged that the applicant requested more information on the procedure (as the applicant in the present case was allowed to do according to the information provided in the booklet) and that this request was refused. The information furnished therefore satisfied the requirements of Article 5 § 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Čonka, cited above, § 52 )."

Romania, no. 69273/01, § 54, 10 June 2008 ), nor did he claim that he was unable to understand any other language in which the booklet was provided.

The Court reiterates that by Article 46 of the Convention the Contracting Parties have undertaken to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they are parties, execution being supervised by the Committee of Ministers. It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a breach of the Convention or the Protocols thereto imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction, but also to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in their domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress as far as possible the effects (see Menteş and Others v. Turkey (Article 50), 24 July 1998, § 24, Reports 1998 ‑ IV; Scozzari and Giunta, [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII; and Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, § 47, ECHR 2004-I). In principle it is not for the Court to determine what may be the appropriate measures of redress for a respondent State to perform in accordance with its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention (see Scozzari and Giunta, cited above; Brumărescu v. Romania ( just satisfaction) [GC], no. 28342/95, § 20, ECHR 2001- I; and Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 210, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV ). With a view, however, to helping the respondent State fulfil its obligations under Article 46, the Court may seek to indicate the type of individual and/or general measures that might be taken in order to put an end to the situation it has found to exist (see Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 3 1443/96, § 194, ECHR 2004-V; Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 148, ECHR 2009; and Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, § 255, 1 7 January 2012 )."

Albania, no. 33771/02, § 122, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... (extracts) ). The Court ’ s concern is to facilitate the rapid and effective suppression of a defective national system hindering human-rights protection. In that connection, and having regard to the situation which it has identified above (see paragraphs 59-60 above and also Louled Massoud, cited above, § 47 ), the Court considers that general measures at national level are undoubtedly called for in execution of the present judgment."

In the instant case the Court considers that it is necessary, in view of its finding of a violation of Article 5 § 4, to indicate the general measures required to prevent other similar violations in the future. It observes that it has found a violation of Article 5 § 4 on account of the fact that none of the remedies available in Malta could be considered speedy for the purposes of that provision. Thus, the Court considers that the respondent State must above all, through appropriate legal and/or other measures, secure in its domestic legal order a mechanism which allows individuals taking proceedings to determine the lawfulness of their detention to obtain a determination of their claim within Convention - compatible time- limits, but which nevertheless maintains the relevant procedural safeguards. The Court reiterates that although it is not always necessary that an Article 5 § 4 procedure be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the type of deprivation of liberty in question ( see A. and Others, cited above, § 203, and Idalov v.

On 16 February 2004 they left the house for an appointment at the Ministry for Refugees, but disappeared before ever arriving there. On 25 February 2004 the Georgian media, citing a Russian agency report, announced that the missing men were being held in a Russian prison in the town of Essentuki, on suspicion of having crossed the Russo-Georgian border illegally. On 5 March 2004 Ms Mukhashavria informed the Court of this and stated that she was anxious about the health of Mr Baymurzayev, who apparently needed an operation on his jaw. She explained that, following their release, the three applicants had not left their residence unless accompanied by their representatives.

On 29 March 2004 the Russian Government alleged that the two applicants had been arrested in Larsi on 19 February 2004 by the Federal Security Service on the ground that they were on the list of wanted persons. At the time of his arrest, Mr Khashiev had been carrying a false passport in the name of Mulkoyev (see paragraph 88 above).

In July 2002 they had allegedly crossed illegally into the Itum-Kalinsk region in Chechnya, with about sixty members of the armed group in question. On 27 July 2002, surrounded by Russian border guards, the group had opened fire and attacked the guards. Eight Russian soldiers had been killed and several others injured.

They were also acquitted of the offences listed in Article 188 § 4 and Article 208 § 2 of the same Code (see paragraph 66 above) on the ground that there was no corpus delicti in their actions. Mr Khashiev and Mr Baymurzayev were convicted of participation in an illegal armed group, crossing the border illegally and of carrying, transporting and handling weapons illegally; they were sentenced to thirteen years'and twelve years'imprisonment respectively, to be served in a closed prison. Mr Khashiev was also convicted of using a false passport in the name of Mulkoyev (see paragraph 101 above). In imposing those sentences, the Supreme Court stated that it took account of the applicants'ages and the fact that they had no criminal record. Mr Baymurzayev's health (serious deformation of the lower jaw) was also taken into consideration. An appeal to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation lay against those judgments.",

The request, accompanied by the applicants'photographs and fingerprints, was intended to identify the persons concerned and had been drawn up at the end of August 2002.

Mr Mskhiladze submitted to the Court a copy of this letter of notification, which also informed the lawyers that they were entitled to apply to a court on behalf of their clients. As he was unable to send the letter by fax on account of electricity problems – a regular occurrence in Georgia – Mr Mskhiladze instructed Mr Darbaydze to leave the letter at the lawyers'offices (see paragraph 168 above).

The main purpose of his visit had been to discuss the alarming situation prevailing in the Pankisi Gorge, a Georgian valley which bordered Chechnya. On that occasion he submitted the request for extradition of the applicants and certain supporting documents. Mr Gabrichidze had initially refused this request for the reasons set out in paragraphs 62 and 63 above.

During the proceedings, firm assurances were obtained from the Russian authorities that the death penalty would not be applied and that the extradited individuals would not be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment and would receive legal assistance. In addition, account had been taken of the fact that a moratorium on capital punishment had been in force in Russia since 1996 and that the imposition of that penalty was hardly possible since the Constitutional Court's judgment of 2 February 1999.

However, Mr Gabrichidze noted that the Code of Criminal Procedure contained only one provision on this subject, which was worded in general terms, did not set out either the procedure or the time-limits for lodging an appeal and did not identify the relevant court. He conceded that, given this deficiency in the legislation and the total lack of precedent, the fact that no appeal had been made was not entirely imputable to the lawyers. Between 1996 (the year in which the Minsk Convention came into force in respect of Georgia ) and October 2002, there had been no instance in Georgia of a judicial appeal against an extradition order.

He had subsequently called Mr Fridinskiy on a regular basis; the latter had kept him abreast of progress in the proceedings and had gone so far as to provide very detailed information. This had led Mr Gabrichidze to conclude that Mr Fridinskiy was following the case closely and monitoring the applicants'situation, as he had promised. In conclusion, Mr Gabrichidze maintained that, had the Georgian authorities wished to subject the applicants to arbitrary extradition, they would have handed them over on 6 August 2002 to Mr Ustinov, who had been accompanied by a special unit for that very purpose (see paragraph 182 above).",

Yet the Code of Criminal Procedure does not prescribe the procedure to be followed when examining such a request ... Nonetheless, this shortcoming in the legislation cannot prevent the individual from exercising his or her rights as enshrined in the Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure ... The Bench considers that Mr Aliev's request must be examined on the basis of an interpretation by analogy with Article 242 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that an action or decision of the inquiry officer, investigator or prosecutor may be challenged before the courts if the individual concerned considers it to be unfounded or unlawful. Given that the decision to extradite Mr Aliev was taken by the Procurator-General's Office, his application must be examined by the Krtsanissi-Mtatsminda Court of First Instance in Tbilisi, which has territorial jurisdiction .”"

Some of the cases, notably that of Lipkhan Bazaeva who is both an activist and an applicant, have already been mentioned.

In their final submissions of 20 July 2004 (see paragraph 50 above), the Russian Government argued that it was procedurally impossible for the Court to adopt a judgment in the present case. They gave the following reasons. Firstly, the criminal case against Mr Shamayev, Mr Khadjiev, Mr Adayev and Mr Vissitov was still pending before the domestic courts (see paragraph 108 above) and the court to which the case had been remitted should correct the violations found by the Court of Cassation before the Court ruled on the application. Secondly, given that their signatures had been forged by Ms Mukhashavria and Ms Dzamukashvili, the above-named applicants had never applied to the Court (see paragraph 230 above).

Admittedly, the extradited applicants'situation may enable the reliability of the assurances provided by the Russian authorities to their Georgian counterparts to be assessed (see paragraph 20 above), but the alleged incompletion of the criminal proceedings brought against them in Russia is not, in this case, such as to prevent the Court from ruling on the complaints against Russia (see paragraphs 480 et seq. below).

In view of the lack of evidence concerning the eight other applicants, they had resisted the demands made and the pressure exerted by their Russian counterparts. The Georgian authorities had acted in conformity with the Court's well-established case-law, according to which the State from which an individual is extradited has a duty to ensure that the extradited person will not be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. Before agreeing to the extradition of the five applicants, the Procurator-General's Office had taken the necessary measures to obtain as many firm assurances as possible from the Russian authorities to the effect that those individuals would not be sentenced to death or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In support of this claim, the Government referred to the terms of the letters from the Russian Procurator-General's Office dated 26 and 27 August and 27 September 2002 (see paragraphs 68 et seq. above). In addition to those written assurances, the Georgian Procurator-General had also obtained verbal undertakings from his Russian colleagues. When the decision on the extradition request was taken, the fact that Russia was a member of the Council of Europe, the moratorium on the application of the death penalty, in force in Russia since 1996, and the Russian Constitutional Court's judgment of 2 February 1999 had also been taken into account.

They pointed out that the Russian authorities had sent their Georgian counterparts identical assurances in support of the extradition request and had provided undertakings that the applicants would not be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. The extradited applicants were detained in conditions that complied with the requirements of that provision. This had been observed by journalists from the Russian television channels RTR, ORT and NTV who had visited the applicants in prison and interviewed them.

They pointed out that the CPT itself had stated in one of its statements that Russia was failing to respect the undertakings that it had signed (see paragraph 267 (e) above). In their opinion, the Georgian authorities had not ensured that the assurances provided had any real value. On the contrary, they had actively cooperated with their Russian counterparts to facilitate the extraditions. Thus, they had sent photographs of the applicants which were subsequently used to support the extradition request, and had kept the Russian authorities informed of changes in the applicants'identities. Assisted in this way, the Russian authorities had “updated” their extradition request, altering the applicants'names to reflect the changes in identification. The Georgian authorities had not taken the measure of either the political nature of the accusations made against the applicants by the Russian authorities or the latter's clear bias in the disputed extradition proceedings. They had not required any prima facie evidence of those accusations. The letters referred to by the Georgian Government (see paragraph 324 above) did not contain a guarantee that the applicants would not be sentenced to death, but simply an assurance that a moratorium was in force in Russia."

The applicants'representatives alleged that this decree did not deal with the issue of a moratorium at all, but merely required the government to prepare “a federal draft law on the Russian Federation's accession to Protocol No. 6 [to the Convention]”. They pointed out that the decree by no means ordered the abolition of the death penalty or suspension of its implementation. Thus, it was not a moratorium but an interim measure concerning the administration of capital punishment. As to the Constitutional Court's judgment of 2 February 1999, it too did not prohibit the implementation of the death penalty (see paragraph 26 2 above) but suspended its use until such time as jury trials had been introduced throughout the territory of the Russian Federation. In view of the Law of 27 December 2002, which provided for completion of the process of introducing jury trials by 1 January 2007 (see paragraph 265 above), the death penalty would again be applicable in Russia from that date."

With regard to the allegations of ill-treatment of males of Chechen origin by representatives of the Russian authorities, the lawyers argued that, when it decided to extradite the applicants, the Georgian Procurator-General's Office could not have failed to be aware of the systematic nature of such acts of violence. They referred to the CPT's public statements, the resolutions adopted in 2003 by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the reports of Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International's Report for 2004 and the reports of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture. Passages from some of those documents are cited above (see paragraphs 267, 268 and 270). The lawyers considered that, having regard to the findings of Human Rights Watch, set out in the document “Welcome to Hell” (see paragraph 268 above), the extradited applicants'total isolation in “a SIZO in the Stavropol region” raised serious doubts concerning the treatment that awaited them in that establishment."

Most of the applicants are aged between twenty-two and thirty-one. Capital punishment has not been abolished in Russia, but the Russian courts would appear to be abstaining from its use at present. The Court observes that Protocol No. 13 to the Convention has not been signed by Russia and that Protocol No. 6, signed on 16 April 1996, has still not been ratified by that State. In so far as it is able to ascertain from information in its possession (see paragraph 107 above), the Court notes that Mr Shamayev, Mr Adayev, Mr Khadjiev and Mr Vissitov, four of the extradited applicants, were not sentenced to the death penalty by the first-instance court. This is also true in respect of Mr Khashiev (Elikhadjiev, Mulkoyev ) and Mr Baymurzayev (Alkhanov), who were sentenced on 14 September and 11 October 2004 to thirteen and twelve years'imprisonment by the Chechen Supreme Court (see paragraph 106 above)."

A Contracting State which has not ratified Protocol No. 6 and has not acceded to Protocol No. 13 is authorised to apply the death penalty under certain conditions, in accordance with Article 2 § 2 of the Convention. In such cases, the Court seeks to ascertain whether the death penalty itself amounts to ill-treatment as prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. It has already established that Article 3 cannot be interpreted as generally prohibiting the death penalty ( see Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, pp. 40-41, § § 103-04 ), since that would nullify the clear wording of Article 2 § 1. That does not, however, mean that circumstances relating to a death sentence can never give rise to an issue under Article 3. The manner in which it is imposed or executed, the personal circumstances of the condemned person and a disproportionality to the gravity of the crime committed, as well as the conditions of detention while awaiting execution, are examples of factors capable of bringing the treatment or punishment received by the condemned person within the proscription under Article 3 ( see Soering, cited above, p. 41, § 104). Attitudes in the Contracting States to capital punishment are relevant for assessing whether the acceptable threshold of suffering or degradation has been exceeded ( see Poltoratskiy v. Ukraine, no. 38812/97, § 133, ECHR 2003 ‑ V). The Court has also found that, as a general principle, the youth of the person concerned is a circumstance which is liable, with others, to put in question the compatibility with Article 3 of measures connected with a death sentence ( see Soering, cited above, pp. 40-43, §§ 103 ‑ 08)."

While the establishment of such responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of conditions in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of that country under general international law, whether under the Convention or otherwise. In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may be incurred, it is liability incurred by the extraditing Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment ( see Mamatkulov and Askarov v.

In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be “inhuman” or “degrading”, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate punishment ( see Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, pp. 14-15, §§ 29-30). The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the treatment or punishment, the manner and method of its execution, its duration and its physical or mental effects ( see Soering, cited above, p. 39, § 100). In assessing the evidence, the Court applies the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, pp. 64-65, § 161, and Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 111, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV). A “ reasonable doubt” is not a doubt based on a merely theoretical possibility or raised in order to avoid a disagreeable conclusion, but a doubt for which reasons can be drawn from the facts presented (see the “ Greek case ”, applications nos. 3321/67, 3322/67, 3323/67 and 3344/67, Commission's report of 5 November 1969, and, mutatis mutandis, Naumenko v.

Having regard to the endemic violence which has held sway in the Chechen Republic since the beginning of the conflict and to the climate of impunity which reigns in that region (see the relevant passages in paragraphs 267 to 270 above), the Court has no doubt that the applicants'fear of being confronted with a threat to their lives or treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention was subjectively well-founded and genuinely perceived as such. The subjective view of events which may arouse feelings of fear or uncertainty in an individual with regard to his or her fate is, without any doubt, an important factor to be taken into account when assessing the facts (see paragraphs 378- 81 and 445 below).

It is also appropriate to note that the prosecution authorities fulfil a supervisory role in respect of the rights of prisoners in the Russian Federation, and that this role includes, inter alia, the right to visit and supervise places of detention without hindrance ( ibid .)."

The respective identities of Mr Shamayev, Mr Khadjiev, Mr Aziev and Mr Adayev, as established by the Georgian Procurator-General's Office (see paragraph 72 above), were, apart from a few differences in spelling, confirmed by the applicants who appeared before the Court in Tbilisi (see paragraph 119 above). The communications from Mr Aziev and Mr Khadjiev, two extradited applicants (see paragraphs 235 and 238 above), also prove that the Georgian authorities had genuinely determined their identity before agreeing to their extradition.

The medical certificates included in the case file were all supplied by the Government, and the applicants themselves have not had an opportunity to complain about their state of health.

It notes that the applicants heard by it in Tbilisi had all submitted that neither they nor the extradited applicants had been carrying weapons when they crossed the border (see paragraph 128 above). Some of them even claimed to have been leading a peaceful civilian life in Chechnya or in the border regions of Georgia adjacent to Chechnya (see paragraphs 128, 134, 140 and 141 above). However, it does not appear from the judicial decisions in Georgia that this was really the case (see paragraphs 89 and 91 above).

It is also inconceivable that prisoners should be confronted with a fait accompli in this way and be made aware that transfer to another country is indeed imminent only when they are asked to leave their cell."

Another striking feature of the case is the fact that, although the extradition concerned only four of the individuals detained in cell no. 88, the eleven applicants in the cell were in despair and subject to panic, since they were unaware of who was to be extradited (see paragraphs 73, 98, 124, 215 and 216 above). The collective resistance which they offered to the State employees seems to have been linked to the legitimate fears that they experienced at the idea of their extradition (see paragraph 340 above). In the light of the evidence in its possession, the Court considers that the tactic of trickery and speed adopted by the Georgian authorities was intended to trap the applicants and, by presenting them with a fait accompli, to avoid complications (see, mutatis mutandis, Čonka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, §§ 41 and 42, ECHR 2002 ‑ I; Bozano v.

On the contrary, the authorities'attitude, and the manner in which they managed the extradition enforcement procedure, incited the applicants to riot ( contrast Caloc v. France, no. 33951/96, § 100, ECHR 2000 ‑ IX ). In the Court's opinion, the recourse to physical force in such circumstances cannot be regarded as having been justified by the prisoners'conduct."

Mr Khanchukayev also had a fractured left shoulder. Mr Issayev had bruising to the face, especially around the right eye. Mr Khashiev and Mr Baymurzayev showed no traces of violence. However, according to their representatives, Mr Baymurzayev, who ordinarily suffered from a serious deformation of the jawbone, was hospitalised on account of a fracture to that area (see paragraphs 106 and 208 above). Mr Kushtanashvili had not been examined by the doctor in question. Apart from the statements by the non-extradited applicants and one prison warden (see paragraphs 125, 135 and 158 above), heard in Tbilisi, the Court has no documents describing the injuries sustained by Mr Shamayev, Mr Aziev, Mr Khadjiev and Mr Vissitov, the four applicants extradited from cell no. 88."

Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ VIII, pp. 3271-72, § 11 ) and the fracture to the left shoulder sustained by Mr Khanchukayev indicate that those applicants'injuries were sufficiently serious to amount to ill-treatment within the scope of Article 3 ( see A. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ VI, p. 2699, § 21, and Ribitsch v.

Prior to that date the applicants received information about their detention with a view to extradition only through rumours and, given the case's high media profile, journalists (see paragraphs 136, 145, 176 and 183 above). Even supposing that Mr Darbaydze and Ms Nadareishvili provided the applicants with sufficient information on 23 August 2002 as to the reason for their detention since 19 August 2002, in the specific context of the present case an interval of four days must be deemed incompatible with the constraints of time imposed by the notion of promptness in Article 5 § 2 ( see Fox, Campbell and Hartley, cited above, pp. 19-20, §§ 41-43, and Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300 ‑ A, p. 33, § 78 )."

It merely observes that they were instructed by the competent authorities at the Procurator- General's Office to go to the prison and inform the prisoners that extradition proceedings had been brought against them (see paragraphs 162 and 176 above). Within the Procurator -General's Office the trainee prosecutors in question were also responsible for performing various tasks in connection with the extradition case against the applicants (see paragraphs 162 and 171 above). Notwithstanding their status within the Georgian public service, and in the light of the functions entrusted to them, the Court considers that the actions of the trainee prosecutors engaged the State's responsibility under the Convention ( see Assanidze v.

According to the record of that meeting, signed only by Mr Darbaydze and Ms Nadareishvili, the latter visited the applicant “to obtain [from him] an explanatory statement concerning his extradition”. However, this statement, drawn up in Russian by Ms Nadareishvili and signed by Mr Darbaydze, makes no mention of extradition proceedings. It contains information concerning the identity of Mr Khanchukayev, who was known at that time under the name of Khanoyev ( ibid.). The applicant refused to sign the statement and the minutes of the meeting, and declared that he would only provide explanations if his lawyer (and an interpreter, according to Mr Darbaydze ) was present. Faced with this refusal, subsequently repeated by the other applicants in the investigation room (Mr Shamayev, Mr Khadjiev, Mr Issayev and Mr Aziev), Mr Darbaydze and his colleague left the premises (see paragraph 165 above)."

When the interpreter asked what he was to interpret for the applicants, Mr Darbaydze asked that the applicants provide him with information about their identity. Since the applicants refused, Mr Darbaydze left the premises. He did not give the applicants any documents (see paragraph 192 above). Subsequently, since he was required to prove to his hierarchical superiors that he had visited the applicants on the date in issue, Mr Darbaydze contacted Mr Saydayev (see paragraphs 170 and 195 above) and had him draw up an affidavit. In that certified document Mr Darbaydze had the interpreter attest that he had informed the applicants of the extradition proceedings against them. When he appeared before the Court in Tbilisi, Mr Saydayev confirmed Mr Darbaydze's presence in the prison on 13 September 2002, but categorically denied that the latter had informed the applicants of the extradition proceedings. Having regard to all the evidence in its possession, the Court considers that Mr Saydayev's explanations for the erroneous statement in the affidavit, to the effect that the applicants had been informed of the extradition proceedings, are reliable (see paragraphs 195- 98 above)."

For the Court, the issue is not whether the applicants concluded or could have concluded from various clues that extraditions proceedings were pending against them, or whether Mr Saydayev ought to have shown zeal in the context of a favour which he was providing unofficially to a State employee. The issue is whether that employee himself, instructed by his hierarchical superiors to perform a specific task, properly informed the applicants of the fact that they were being held on account of a request for extradition to Russia. The Court has not overlooked the fact that it was impossible for Mr Darbaydze to assess the accuracy of the impugned interpretation into Chechen; however, in the light of the responsible task entrusted to him and the serious objections that the question of extradition could have provoked among the applicants, it was incumbent on him to phrase his interpretation request with meticulousness and precision.

However, this ground does not in itself justify refusing the applicants all access to documents which had direct repercussions on their rights and on which the exercise of the remedy set out in Article 5 § 4 of the Convention was contingent. The Court does not accept the Government's argument that, since the right not to be extradited is not guaranteed by the Convention, it was not the task of the Procurator -General's Office to grant the applicants access to the case files concerning their extradition (see paragraph 395 above). It points out that, while Article 5 § 2 does not require that the case file in its entirety be made available to the person concerned, the latter must nonetheless receive sufficient information so as to be able to apply to a court for the review of lawfulness provided for in Article 5 § 4 ( see Fox, Campbell and Hartley, cited above, § 40; and Čonka, cited above, § 50)."

Those orders were decisions to place the applicants in detention in the context of the criminal proceedings against them in Russia; having been recognised as enforceable in Georgia, they represented, together with the extradition request, the legal basis of the applicants'detention pending extradition (see paragraphs 404-05 above). As the procedure provided for in Article 5 § 4 requires that the individual concerned be given guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question ( see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp, cited above, pp. 40-41, § 76), the Russian orders, issued for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 (c), cannot be construed as including a review, under Georgian law, of the lawfulness of the applicants'detention pending extradition."

The Court has recently reiterated that, where there is plausibly asserted to be a risk of irreparable damage to the enjoyment by the applicant of one of the core rights under the Convention, the object of an interim measure is to maintain the status quo pending the Court's determination of the justification for the measure. As such, being intended to ensure the continued existence of the matter that is the subject of the application, the interim measure goes to the substance of the Convention complaint. As far as the applicant is concerned, the result that he or she wishes to achieve through the application is the preservation of the asserted Convention right before irreparable damage is done to it. Consequently, the interim measure is sought by the applicant, and granted by the Court, in order to facilitate the “effective exercise” of the right of individual petition under Article 34 of the Convention in the sense of preserving the subject matter of the application when that is judged to be at risk of irreparable damage through the acts or omissions of the respondent State. It is implicit in the notion of the effective exercise of the right of application that for the duration of the proceedings in Strasbourg the Court should remain able to examine the application under its normal procedure ( see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, § 108). Indications of interim measures given by the Court, as in the present case, allow it not only to carry out an effective examination of the application but also to ensure that the protection afforded to the applicant by the Convention is effective; they also subsequently allow the Committee of Ministers to supervise execution of the final judgment. Such measures thus enable the State concerned to discharge its obligation to comply with the final judgment of the Court, which is legally binding by virtue of Article 46 of the Convention ( ibid., § 125). Thus, in Mamatkulov and Askarov, the Court concluded that a failure by a Contracting State to comply with interim measures is to be regarded as preventing the Court from effectively examining the applicant's complaint and as hindering the effective exercise of his or her right and, accordingly, as a violation of Article 34 ( ibid., § 128)."

If it had then appeared to the magistrate that the arrest had been unlawful, the magistrate would have been obliged to order release under Article 137 of the Criminal Code read in conjunction with the Convention and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. Although the applicant had produced some decisions which seemed to indicate that the powers of the magistrate before whom the accused first appeared were more limited than the Government maintained, these decisions emanated from lower courts and, in any event, the accused in these cases had not contended that the law did not allow arrest in their case or that there was no reasonable suspicion to justify arrest."

Although the law spelt out in great detail what happened when the accused first appeared before a magistrate, it made no provision concerning release in cases of unlawful arrest. Moreover, there was no instance of an arrested person being released on being brought before a magistrate on the ground that the magistrate had decided that the arrest was unlawful. Additional arguments could be drawn a contrario from Articles353 (see paragraph 24 above) and 397(5) of the Criminal Code. The latter provision provided that the court could also order the arrest of an accused person who was not already in custody. In any event, even assuming that the applicant could have made an application under Article 137 of the Criminal Code, this would not have ensured compliance with Article 5 § 3 of the Convention which required an automatic review. Finally, the applicant’s arrest and detention could not have been considered unlawful because in the Ellul case the Constitutional Court had found that the limitations imposed by the system in force on the magistrate’s power of release did not raise any issues under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 25 above)."

His application was examined first by the First Hall of the Civil Court, which admitted it, and then, on appeal by the respondents, by the Constitutional Court, which examined it as to the substance and rejected it (see paragraphs 17-19 above).

As to the Government’s reliance on Article 137 of the Criminal Code read in conjunction with Article 353, it is first to be noted that the applicant’s complaint to the Commission was not that he did not have available to him, in accordance with Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, a habeas corpus remedy to obtain a court decision on the lawfulness of his detention under Maltese law. The applicant alleged the absence of a procedure ensuring the specific kind of judicial control required by Article 5 § 3. In so far as the Government’s argument is that, if the applicant had invoked the above-mentioned Articles of the Criminal Code, he would have obtained a review of his detention by a judge as envisaged by Article 5 § 3, this is an argument going directly to the issue of compliance with that provision. Accordingly, the Government’s preliminary objection is to be joined to the merits.",

However, domestic law did not require the police to substantiate the grounds militating in favour of his arrest and the magistrate could release him only if he submitted a bail application. Since the offence for which the applicant had been arrested carried a penalty exceeding three years’ imprisonment, the bail application had to be communicated to the Attorney-General, who should normally have had one working day in which to decide whether he would oppose it or not. During that period the magistrate was not competent to decide on the the applicant’s release. According to standard practice, after the accused’s first appearance before a magistrate the case went to the registrar who chose by lot the magistrate who would hear the evidence. This system was introduced to eliminate the possibility of forum-shopping by the police. The magistrate who heard the evidence also examined the bail application after the Attorney-General had had the opportunity of expressing his view. As a result, the bail application was often examined by a different magistrate from the one before whom the accused had first appeared."

Moreover, the applicant could have invoked Article 137 of the Criminal Code to raise any other complaints he might have had concerning the lawfulness of his arrest.",
                "Quite apart from this consideration, the Government submitted that, in cases where the court had found an arrest to be lawful, it was open to the arrested person to request provisional release on bail. In this connection, the Government argued that although Article 5 § 3 required that the accused be brought promptly before a judge it did not require that the decision on the bail application be taken immediately. The reason why certain bail applications were communicated to the Attorney-General was to ensure that the principles of audi alteram partem and equality of arms were respected. In any event, the Attorney-General replied expeditiously and, as a result, the review of the accused’s detention could be concluded within the time-frame of Article 5 § 3. If the Attorney-General did not reply within the time-limit set by the magistrate, the latter could give a ruling on the bail application without hearing the Attorney-General’s views, which were not in any event binding. The period of eleven days which had elapsed between the applicant’s arrest (20 July 1992) and the decision on his bail application (31 July 1992) could not be considered a breach of Article 5 § 3. Furthermore, the Government stressed that the applicant had had ample opportunity to present his case in writing and could have made oral submissions. The Convention did not require that the magistrate who decided on an arrested person’s bail application should be the same as the magistrate before whom the arrested person initially appeared. Although the second magistrate had not heard the applicant in person, he had had at his disposal all the information required and was totally independent of the executive. In any event, the applicant could have asked the second magistrate to hear him in person."

As the Court has pointed out on many occasions, Article 5 § 3 of the Convention provides persons arrested or detained on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence with a guarantee against any arbitrary or unjustified deprivation of liberty (see, inter alia, the Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, p. 3298, § 146). It is essentially the object of Article 5 § 3, which forms a whole with paragraph 1 (c), to require provisional release once detention ceases to be reasonable. The fact that an arrested person had access to a judicial authority is not sufficient to constitute compliance with the opening part of Article 5 § 3. This provision enjoins the judicial officer before whom the arrested person appears to review the circumstances militating for or against detention, to decide by reference to legal criteria whether there are reasons to justify detention, and to order release if there are no such reasons (see the De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, pp. 21-24, §§ 44, 47 and 51).

Promptness has to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see the De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink judgment cited above, pp. 24 and 25, §§ 51 and 52). However, the scope of flexibility in interpreting and applying the notion of promptness is very limited (see the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, pp. 33-34, § 62)."

It cannot be made to depend on a previous application by the detained person. Such a requirement would not only change the nature of the safeguard provided for under Article 5 § 3, a safeguard distinct from that in Article 5 § 4, which guarantees the right to institute proceedings to have the lawfulness of detention reviewed by a court (see the De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink judgment cited above, pp. 25-26, § 57). It might even defeat the purpose of the safeguard under Article 5 § 3 which is to protect the individual from arbitrary detention by ensuring that the act of deprivation of liberty is subject to independent judicial scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, the Kurt v. Turkey judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1185, § 123). Prompt judicial review of detention is also an important safeguard against ill-treatment of the individual taken into custody (see the Aksoy v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2282, § 76). Furthermore, arrested persons who have been subjected to such treatment might be incapable of lodging an application asking the judge to review their detention.

Even assuming the Government’s interpretation of national law to be correct, the Court considers that Article 5 § 3 would not be complied with. The matters which, by virtue of Article 5 § 3, the judicial officer must examine go beyond the one ground of lawfulness cited by the Government. The review required under Article 5 § 3, being intended to establish whether the deprivation of the individual’s liberty is justified, must be sufficiently wide to encompass the various circumstances militating for or against detention (see paragraph 47 above). However, the evidence before the Court does not disclose that the magistrate before whom the applicant appeared on 22 July 1992 or any other judicial officer had the power to conduct such a review of his or her own motion."

However, compliance with Article 5 § 3 cannot be ensured by making an Article 5 § 4 remedy available. The review must be automatic (see paragraph 49 above). Furthermore, even in the context of an application by an individual under Article 137 and having regard to Article 353, the scope of the review has not been established to be such as to allow a review of the merits of the detention. Apart from the cases where the forty-eight-hour time-limit was exceeded, the Government have not referred to any instances in which Article 137 of the Criminal Code has been successfully invoked to challenge either the lawfulness of or the justification for an arrest on suspicion of a criminal offence. Moreover, from what the Court can deduce from the domestic cases cited before it, the absence of a reasonable suspicion or of reasons militating in favour of the applicant’s continued detention would not necessarily have rendered the applicant’s arrest and detention unlawful under Maltese law (see paragraphs 22, 25 and 26 above). It follows that the Government have not substantiated their preliminary objection that the applicant has not exhausted domestic remedies because he did not seek to rely on Article 137 of the Criminal Code read together with Article 353.

The first element is the perpetration of indecent actions, which are described as actions which are “improper or impudent, expressed through curses, raving, bad manners or other actions scandalising society”. Indecent actions must both grossly violate public order and demonstrate overt disrespect for society. Gross violation of public order occurs when “through his actions the perpetrator makes a brutal demonstration against the established order”.

Turning to the provision relied on by the Government, section 2(2) of the SRDA, the Court must firstly determine whether it was capable of remedying the applicant ’ s grievance under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention. On this point, it notes that the Supreme Court of Cassation ’ s 2004 binding interpretative decision, which clarifies in respect of what facts compensation is due under this provision, refers to “pre ‑ trial detention”, a term taken from the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure and referring exclusively to one form of deprivation of liberty imposed in the course of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 36 above). However, in the case at hand the applicant was never placed in “pre ‑ trial detention”. He was first in police detention under section 70(1) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act (see paragraphs 13 and 31 above) and then in detention ordered by a prosecutor under Article 152a § 3 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, pending a judicial determination of whether or not he should be placed in “pre ‑ trial detention” (see paragraphs 17 and 34 above). When brought before a judge, he was released on bail (see paragraph 20 above). It thus seems unlikely that the domestic courts would have found that his deprivation of liberty fell within the ambit of section 2 (2) of the SRDA and that he was entitled to compensation for it, despite his acquittal. The Government – who are under the burden of proving the effectiveness of the remedies which they invoke – have not pointed to any domestic court judgment under section 2(2) of the SRDA in which compensation has been awarded in such circumstances.

There is no indication – and it has not been suggested by the Government – that in examining the claim the courts would have touched upon the substance of the applicant ’ s freedom - of - expression grievance, as it is not part of the cause of action.

Bulgaria, judgment of 20 March 1997, § 41, Reports 1997 ‑ II ). According to its settled case ‑ law, this expression stipulates not only full compliance with the procedural and substantive rules of national law, but also requires that any deprivation of liberty be consistent with the purpose of Article 5 – to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary fashion (see, among many other authorities, Steel and Others, cited above, § 54). Seeing that paragraph 1 of this provision contains an exhaustive list of permissible grounds for deprivation of liberty, it must be interpreted strictly (see Lukanov, cited above, § 41 )."

Apart from its factual side, which is most often in issue, the existence of such suspicion additionally requires that the facts relied on can be reasonably considered as behaviour criminalised under domestic law. Thus, there could clearly not be a “reasonable suspicion” if the acts held against a detained person did not constitute an offence at the time when they were committed (see Włoch, cited above, §§ 108 and 109)."

                "59. In so far as insult is concerned, the Court observes that, following the March 2000 amendments to the 1968 Criminal Code, at the relevant time it was a privately prosecutable offence and could not attract a sentence of imprisonment (see paragraph 30 above). The levelling of charges of insult could not therefore have served as a basis for the applicant ’ s detention between 11 and 14 July 2000 under Article 152a § 3 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see, as an example to the contrary, Douiyeb v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 31464/96, § 46, 4 August 1999 ). By making an order to this effect the Pleven District Prosecutor ’ s Office blatantly ignored the clear and unambiguous provisions of domestic law. It is not for the Court to speculate whether this happened because that Office was not aware of the March 2000 amendments to the 1968 Criminal Code or for other reasons. As regards the immediately preceding period, when the applicant was in police detention, the Court notes that section 70(1)(1) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act does not distinguish between privately and publicly prosecutable offences (see paragraph 31 above). However, it is apparent from the interpretation given to this provision by the Supreme Administrative Court that the powers which it bestows upon the police are ancillary to their duty to investigate crime (see paragraph 32 above). It is clear that the police have no power to conduct preliminary investigations in respect of privately prosecutable offences such as insult. The applicant ’ s police detention on this basis was therefore also unlawful."

As regards hooliganism, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s actions consisted of the gathering of signatures calling for the resignation of the Minister of Justice and displaying two posters calling him a “top idiot”. When examining the criminal charges against the applicant the Supreme Court of Cassation specifically found that these actions had been entirely peaceful, had not obstructed any passers ‑ by and had been hardly likely to provoke others to violence. On this basis, it concluded that they did not amount to the constituent elements of the offence of hooliganism and that in convicting the applicant the Pleven District Court had “failed to give any arguments” but had merely made blanket statements in this respect (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). Nor did the orders for the applicant ’ s arrest under section 70(1) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act and for his detention under Article 152a § 3 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure – which were not reviewed by a court – contain anything which may be taken to suggest that the authorities could reasonably believe that the conduct in which he had engaged constituted hooliganism, whose elements were comprehensively laid down in the Supreme Court ’ s binding interpretative decision of 1974 (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above, as well as Lukanov, § § 43 and 44; mutatis mutandis, Steel and Others, § 64, and, as an example to the contrary, Włoch, §§ 111 and 1 12, all cited above )."

While promptness has to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see, among others, Aquilina v. Malta, [GC], no. 25642/94, § 48, ECHR 1999 ‑ III ), the strict time constraint imposed by this requirement of Article 5 § 3 leaves little flexibility in interpretation, otherwise there would be a serious weakening of a procedural guarantee to the detriment of the individual and the risk of impairing the very essence of the right protected by this provision (see, recently, McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 33, ECHR 2006 ‑ X )."

In the circumstances, this does not appear prompt. He was arrested on charges of a minor and non-violent offence. He had already spent twenty ‑ four hours in custody when the police proposed to the prosecutor in charge of the case to request the competent court to place the applicant in pre-trial detention. Exercising his powers under Article 152a § 3 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 34 above), the prosecutor ordered that he the applicant be detained for a further seventy ‑ two hours, without giving any reasons why he considered it necessary, save for a stereotyped formula saying that there was a risk that he might flee or re ‑ offend. It does not seem that when thus prolonging the applicant ’ s detention the prosecutor took appropriate steps to ensure his immediate appearance before a judge, as mandated by the provision cited above (see paragraph 17 above). Instead, the matter was brought before the Pleven District Court at the last possible moment, when the seventy ‑ two hours were about to expire (see paragraph 20 above). The Court sees no special difficulties or exceptional circumstances which would have prevented the authorities from bringing the applicant before a judge much sooner (see, mutatis mutandis, Koster v. the Netherlands, judgment of 28 November 1991, § 25, Series A no. 221; and Rigopoulos v.

Thus, as found by the Supreme Court of Cassation, the applicant ’ s actions on 10 July 2000 were entirely peaceful, did not obstruct any passers ‑ by and were hardly likely to provoke others to violence (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above, and Steel and Others, cited above, § 110 ). However, the authorities in Pleven chose to react vigorously and on the spot in order to silence the applicant and shield the Minister of Justice from any public expression of criticism. They also kept the applicant in custody for an inordinate amount of time – three days and twenty ‑ three hours – before bringing him before a judge who ordered his release. These measures were clearly not “necessary in a democratic society”. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the Government and of its members must be subject to close scrutiny by the press and public opinion. Furthermore, the dominant position which the Government and its members occupy makes it necessary for them – and for the authorities in general – to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, and the associated custodial measures, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of their adversaries (see, mutatis mutandis, Castells v.

A “Memorandum on detentions in connection with the international match between Denmark and Sweden on 10 October 2009”, prepared by Chief Inspector B.O., the strategic commander for the event, was submitted to the City Court. It stated that the police had received intelligence reports that hooligan groups from both countries were set on fighting each other on the match day. The risk of fighting was increased by the fact that the match would not start until 8 p.m., leaving considerable time for each group to consume alcoholic beverages beforehand. In order to prevent such clashes, the plan was to start engaging in proactive dialogue from 12 noon, when the first fans/spectators appeared, and in the event of clashes, first to arrest the instigators under section 755 of the Administration of Justice Act and charge them or, if that was not possible, to detain the instigators by virtue of section 5(3) of the Police Act. Since detention under the latter provision, as far as possible, should not exceed six hours, the memorandum specifically stated that it was preferable to avoid detaining anyone too early during the day, since they would then have to be released during or after the game, with the possibility that they would head for the city centre again and resume their involvement in brawls. At 3.41 p.m. the first big fight started between Danish and Swedish supporters at Amagertorv Square, on Strøget in the centre of Copenhagen, resulting in five or six individuals being detained, including the second and third applicants. Subsequently, elsewhere, other supporters were detained, including the first applicant. Up until the start of the match, further individuals who instigated and directed fights were detained, but the manoeuvre tactics continued to be a dialogue to ensure that the large number of supporters behaved and made their way to the stadium to watch the match. After the match, another large brawl started in the city centre, resulting in further detentions of a large group of Swedish and Danish supporters/hooligans."

                "“... that he was the strategic commander for the event and located in the control room in connection with the international football match between Denmark and Sweden on 10 October 2009. The police had received intelligence reports of intentions among various club factions from Denmark and Sweden to initiate hooligan brawls in connection with the match. The police were therefore prepared for it not to be the usual audience of festive Danish and Swedish supporters. This information had come from police ‘spotters’ in different networks of football fans. They had received information that Danish and Swedish groups had planned to collaborate ... Police preparations had targeted different locations in Copenhagen. It was the intention to locate the various groups, talk to them to calm them down and accordingly dampen tempers before they reached the national stadium. The police had already deployed forces and divided them into groups at around 2 p.m. on the basis of intelligence that the spectators would arrive early to go partying. They had managed to locate the groups of fans by means of their spotters, and it had turned out that the fans were divided into a Swedish and a Danish group. They had seen the first large fight between Danish and Swedish hooligans at around 3.40 p.m. The fight had occurred in the central part of Strøget, the pedestrian shopping street, outside bar D, where the Swedish group had settled down. Prior to the fight, they had located the Danish groups in the central courtyard of Boltens Gård. According to the intelligence, the Danish people involved were supporters of the football clubs of Brøndby, Lyngby [Copenhagen] and AGF [Aarhus]. This intelligence had been collected by police officers in the home towns of these clubs. Those police officers had come to Copenhagen to assist, and they had recognised supporters.",
                "The fight had taken the police somewhat by surprise, but they had managed to segregate the Swedish supporters at the bar D, and guide the Danish participants down Valkendorffsgade, a small side street off the pedestrian shopping street. It was a group of about fifty to sixty Danish fans altogether. He did not know the number of persons involved directly in the fight, but had understood from local reports that there were about fifty or sixty persons on either side. A fight of this kind causes a lot of uncertainty.",

He was the one who had made the decision to detain persons who could not be charged with an offence, that is, detention pursuant to the Police Act. It had been planned that only the instigators should be detained. To the extent possible, they had also intended to avoid detaining many people early in the day because those people would then have to be released during or right after the match and would then be able to head for the city centre again and resume fighting. He had made use of local [police] spotters to identify six leading members, who had then been detained. They had been identified on the basis of police officers’ prior knowledge of them, combined with their ongoing observations. The crucial factor had naturally been the individuals’ actual behaviour. They would not have been detained if they had not been acting as instigators ...",

The police had started releasing the detainees after midnight, when the situation in central Copenhagen had calmed down and it had been assessed that there was no one with whom the newly released persons could start a fight. He was, of course, aware of the six-hour rule laid down in the Police Act, but it might be necessary to exceed this maximum period. They had done so deliberately that particular evening. Had there been no violence after the expiry of the six-hour period, there would have been no justification for not releasing the detainees. The purpose had definitely been to avoid confrontations and fights and situations causing uncertainty. They had made a continuous assessment during the period of detention.",

The control room team had included an investigator who had had regular contact with the Bellahøj police station regarding the detentions. The detainees who had been charged with an offence had been released after the match. As regards the persons detained under the Police Act, a comprehensive, general assessment had been made and then those persons had been released one by one when the danger had passed. He had been involved in the general assessment of the length of the detention periods, but not in the assessment of the individual cases. The control room had been closed down shortly after midnight, when the observers around the city had reported that things were quiet and that people were on their way home/back to their hotels. As already mentioned, it had been decided to release detainees on the basis of a general assessment made in the control room, but the actual releases had been effected at the Bellahøj police station.

They had received intelligence that hooligans from Aarhus would meet with other hooligans from Denmark to fight Swedish football fans. The Copenhagen Police had asked for help from the police of other districts in Denmark who were familiar with members of local factions. He and his colleagues had met at around 11 a.m. for a briefing. He and a colleague of his from the Police of Eastern Jutland had then moved around the city to look for any hooligans from Aarhus whom they might recognise. They had been told that people from Brøndby had gathered at a particular bar, and they had gone there. Among the people they had seen were [the first and second applicants]. [The second applicant] had been sitting together with A, the leader of South Side United (SSU), which is a local faction from Brøndby. There had been a good atmosphere, and no violence. The witness had remained standing outside for a short while and had talked to people from Aarhus. It had probably been around 1 p.m. He and his colleague and some other officers had then posted themselves opposite the bar to keep an eye on what was going on. They had received reports that Swedes and Danes were to meet and fight. At some point the Danish hooligans had started leaving the bar, walking down the pedestrian shopping street towards Amagertorv Square [around 700 metres from the bar].",

He had seen them take part in fights and heard them shout ‘White Pride Hooligan’. He and his colleagues had followed the group and reported back to the control room. When they had come closer to Amagertorv Square, police personnel carriers had been parked crosswise to prevent the group from colliding with the Swedish football fans. The Danish hooligans had then been turned around and taken down a side street, where they had been registered and searched.",

The purpose of detaining those two persons had been to create calm and prevent clashes. This had apparently succeeded because he had been present during the international match himself, and it had been obvious that the hooligans from Aarhus had been missing someone to take control. When the group from the bar was being guided into the side street, a couple of people might have tried to disappear into the crowd, but the group had followed directions from the police.",

Ten additional police officers were there to help. One of his tasks had been to make sure that the six-hour rule was observed. They had been faced with the issue that the six-hour period applicable to two of the persons detained under the Police Act expired at 9.50 p.m. He had contacted the control-room supervisor before the expiry of this period. Concurrently, clashes had been starting in the streets, and the control-room supervisor had decided not to let the relevant persons out. They had not wanted to add fuel to the fire. This decision had been made by the supervisors because he himself did not have the power to make such a decision. He had talked to the control room many times during that evening from 9.30 p.m. onwards. Very many detainees had been brought to the police station up until around 11 p.m., reaching a total of 136 detainees. Half of them had been detained under the Police Act. He had regularly asked when they should start releasing the detainees. He had not called and asked about specific names, but a general assessment had been made on an ongoing basis for all detainees from the time when the statutory six-hour periods started to expire. The radio communication had made it possible for him to keep updated about when things started calming down after the arrests of people in the Boltens Gård courtyard, and finally it had been confirmed that he could start releasing the persons detained under the Police Act. He did not keep a log of all telephone calls and was therefore unable to give the exact time. As far as he recalled, there had probably been one detainee under 18 years old who had been fetched by his parents before the end of the six-hour period, but otherwise no one else had been let out before the two initial detainees. It could very well have happened that some of his colleagues had started taking people out of the cells before the end of the six-hour period when they had received the information from the control room, because everybody was highly aware of the six-hour rule. If the persons concerned had subsequently been returned to their cells, the reason was an order from the control room saying that they should continue to be detained.”"

The court finds, in the circumstances of the present case, that there is no basis for invalidating the assessment made by the police, according to which the release of the detainees before the city centre had become quiet would have entailed a concrete and imminent risk of further unrest, including clashes with spectators who had been let out of the national stadium after the end of the match and who were still in the streets in large numbers.",

It also appears from the preparatory notes on the same provision that normally the six-hour period can only be exceeded in connection with actions involving the detention of a considerable number of people, in which situations the time spent on transfer to the police station and registration and identification of detainees would render it impossible, in practice, to observe the six-hour rule.",

A detention based on section 5(3) of the Police Act is outside the context of criminal proceedings (as opposed to an arrest under section 755 of the Administration of Justice Act, see paragraph 35 below). The purpose of a detention under section 5(3) is not to bring the person before a judge, neither to assess the lawfulness of a continued detention. The lawfulness may, however, subsequently be subject to judicial review. According to the preparatory notes on the Police Act, detention based on section 5(3) of the Police Act may not take place for the purpose of investigating or initiating criminal measures. The condition that the person must be causing a “risk or danger” implies that a concrete and imminent risk of disturbance of public order or of danger to the safety of individuals or public security must have been ascertained. What is crucial is the probability that the risk or danger will occur if the police do not intervene. The fact that a person is a well-known troublemaker does not as such justify such measures. Prior knowledge of a person or a group of persons may, however, be taken into account, together with the current circumstances. Whether the risk or danger is sufficient to justify a measure depends on an assessment made by the police of the individual situation. As to the wording “should not extend beyond six hours where possible”, the preparatory notes point out that the period should be reckoned from the time when the detention is effected. Any time spent on transfer to a police station must therefore be included in the calculation of the detention period. The six ‑ hour period would normally only be exceeded in connection with actions involving the detention of a large number of persons, when the time spent on transfer to the police station and registration and identification of detainees would render it impossible, in practice, to observe the six-hour rule."

                "46. For the purposes of its examination of the present case, the Court deems it useful to refer to the judgment of 15 February 2017 of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in R v The Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis, in which the Court’s case-law on Article 5 § 1 (b) was found to be inconclusive. The four applicants in that case had been detained for up to five and a half hours to prevent an imminent breach of the peace during the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on 29 April 2011. The police had argued that the detention was justified under both Article 5 § 1 (b) and Article 5 § 1 (c).",
                "The Administrative Court found that the detention had complied with Article 5 § 1 (c).",
                "The Court of Appeal agreed, but for other reasons. It concluded that the purpose of the applicants’ detention had been to bring them before the competent legal authority if that were to become necessary, so as to prolong their detention on a lawful basis. It declined to follow the majority view in Ostendorf v. Germany (no. 15598/08, 7 March 2013) that Article 5 § 1 (c) was incapable of authorising purely preventive detention, notwithstanding the existence of good grounds to believe an offence to be imminent, and that the person concerned must be suspected of having already committed a criminal offence.",
                "Finally, the Supreme Court, having analysed the Court’s case-law, and notably the divergent views expressed in the concurring opinion in Ostendorf (cited above), concluded that the detention was lawful under Article 5 § 1 (c). Lord Toulson (with whom Lord Mance, Lord Dyson, Lord Reed and Lord Carnwath agreed) stated, in particular:",
                "“31. In this case there was nothing arbitrary about the decisions to arrest, detain and release the appellants. They were taken in good faith and were proportionate to the situation. If the police cannot lawfully arrest and detain a person for a relatively short time (too short for it to be practical to take the person before a court) in circumstances where this is reasonably considered to be necessary for the purpose of preventing imminent violence, the practical consequence would be to hamper severely their ability to carry out the difficult task of maintaining public order and safety at mass public events. This would run counter to the fundamental principles previously identified.",
                "32. There is, however, a difficult question of law as to how such preventive power can be accommodated within article 5. The Strasbourg case law on the point is not clear and settled, as is evident from the division of opinions within the Fifth Section in Ostendorf. Moreover, while this court must take into account the Strasbourg case law, in the final analysis it has a judicial choice to make.",
                "33. The view of the minority in Ostendorf, that article 5.1(c) is capable of applying in a case of detention for preventive purposes followed by early release (that is, before the person could practicably be brought before a court), is in my opinion correct for a number of reasons.",
                "34. In the first place I agree with the Administrative Court that the situation fits more naturally within the language of article 5.1(c) than 5.1(b). On its plain wording article 5.1(c) covers three types of case, the second being when the arrest or detention of a person ‘is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence.’",
                "35. There is force in the argument that the interpretation adopted by the majority in Ostendorf collapses the second into the first (‘reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence’) and is inconsistent with Lawless [ Lawless v. Ireland (no. 3), 1 July 1961, Series A no. 3].",
                "36. It is accepted by the police that English courts should treat Lawless as authoritative, but in that case the court was not concerned with a situation in which the police had every reason to anticipate that the risk necessitating the person’s arrest would pass in a relatively short time and there was every likelihood of it ending before the person could as a matter of practicality be brought before a court. It would be perverse if it were the law that in such circumstances, in order to be lawfully able to detain the person so as to prevent their imminently committing an offence, the police must harbour a purpose of continuing the detention, after the risk had passed, until such time as the person could be brought before a court with a view to being bound over to keep the peace in future. This would lengthen the period of detention and place an unnecessary burden on court time and police resources.",
                "37. Some analogy may be drawn with Brogan, in which the court rejected the argument that at the time of the arrest the police must intend to take the arrested person before the court willy nilly, regardless of whether on investigation there was cause to do so.",
                "38. In order to make coherent sense and achieve the fundamental purpose of article 5, I would read the qualification on the power of arrest or detention under article 5.1(c), contained in the words ‘for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority’, as implicitly dependent on the cause for detention continuing long enough for the person to be brought before the court. I agree therefore with Judges Lemmens and Jäderblom in para 5 of their judgment in Ostendorf (cited at para 25 above) that in the case of an early release from detention for preventive purposes, it is enough for guaranteeing the rights inherent in article 5 if the lawfulness of the detention can subsequently be challenged and decided by a court.",
                "39. I prefer to put the matter that way, rather than as the Court of Appeal did by inferring the existence of a conditional purpose ab initio to take the appellants before the court, although it makes no difference to the result. I have no disagreement with the Court of Appeal that the appellants would have been brought before a court to determine the legality of their continued detention, if it had been considered necessary to detain them long enough for this to happen. The case would then have been materially similar to Nicol and Selvanayagam, where the applicants’ initial detention was preventive and they were later kept in custody and brought before the court to be bound over. It would be contrary to the spirit and underlying objective of article 5 if the appellants’ early release placed them in a stronger position to complain of a breach of article 5 than if it had been decided to detain them for longer in order to take them before magistrates to be bound over.",
                "40. As to article 5.1(b), I am inclined to the same view as the minority in Ostendorf that the obligation has to be much more specific than a general obligation not to commit a criminal offence (or, in this case, a breach of the peace), and that such a general obligation does not acquire the necessary degree of specificity by focusing narrowly on the particular facts or by the person concerned being given a reminder of it in specific circumstances. There are also practical considerations. The police may find it necessary to take action to prevent an imminent breach of the peace in circumstances where there is not sufficient time to give a warning. An example might be a football match where two unruly groups collide and the police see no alternative but to detain them, or the ringleaders on both sides, immediately for what may be quite a short time. In summary, I would be concerned that in stretching article 5.1(b) beyond its previously recognised ambit the majority found it necessary to impose limitations which in another case might leave the police effectively powerless to step in for the protection of the public.”"

The applicants had been subject to an obligation to refrain from committing criminal offences, including the obligation not to instigate fights or exhibit any other form of violent behaviour likely to disturb public order. This obligation followed from a number of provisions on punishable acts, including section 3 of the Executive Order on Police Measures to Maintain Law and Order (which is considered to define a criminal offence), and sections 134a, 244, 245 and 291 of the Penal Code. The obligation was specific and concrete, and the time and place of the imminent commission of the offence had been sufficiently specified, as well as its potential victims. The applicants had been aware of the large police presence in the city and it must have been clear to them that the police were there to prevent violence and disturbance in connection with the football match, notably as all three applicants had previously been detained in connection with similar events. In the Government’s view, it would have been futile for the police to have given the applicants explicit orders to disperse and refrain from arranging/taking part in brawls, as the applicants could simply have walked away from the police and engaged in hooligan brawls elsewhere. Likewise, it would have made little sense to escort them to the stadium and warn them of detention if they left the groups of hooligans, as the police had done in Ostendorf (cited above), since many of them, including the third applicant, had not even had a ticket for the match."

Its key purpose is to prevent arbitrary or unjustified deprivations of liberty. Three strands of reasoning in particular may be identified as running through the Court’s case-law: the exhaustive nature of the exceptions, which must be interpreted strictly, and which do not allow for the broad range of justifications under other provisions (Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention in particular); the repeated emphasis on the lawfulness of the detention, both procedural and substantive, requiring scrupulous adherence to the rule of law; and the importance of the promptness or speediness of the requisite judicial controls (see Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova [GC], no. 23755/07, § 84, ECHR 2016 (extracts), with further references)."

As regards the requirement to justify pre-trial detention under paragraph 3 of Article 5 in such cases, the Court has held that there must be relevant and sufficient reasons, and that the national authorities must display “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings. The Court has also held that justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities. When deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities are obliged to consider alternative means of ensuring his or her appearance at trial (ibid.).

This ground of detention does no more than afford the Contracting States a means of preventing a concrete and specific offence (see, for example, Guzzardi v.

In respect of the first limb of sub-paragraph (c) the Court has found that the absence of any grounds in the judicial authorities’ decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time was incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 § 1 (see Urtāns v. Latvia, no. 16858/11, § 28, 28 October 2014). Conversely, it has found that an applicant’s detention on remand could not be said to have been arbitrary if the domestic court gave certain grounds justifying the continued detention, unless the reasons given were extremely laconic and did not refer to any legal provision which would have permitted the applicant’s detention (ibid.; see also Mooren, cited above, § 79, with further references).",

The Court answered the question in the negative (ibid., §§ 77-89), whilst expressing its awareness of the importance, in the German legal system, of preventive police custody in order to avert dangers to the life and limb of potential victims or significant material damage, in particular in situations involving the policing of large groups of people during mass events (ibid., § 88)."

From the Ostendorf judgment it appears that a decisive consideration for finding sub-paragraph (c) inapplicable was that it permitted deprivation of liberty only in connection with criminal proceedings and governed pre-trial detention (ibid., §§ 66-68). This interpretation was restated in different ways in the judgment, for instance in paragraph 82: “the second alternative of Article 5 § 1 (c) ... only governs pre-trial detention and not custody for preventive purposes without the person concerned being suspected of having already committed a criminal offence”. In paragraph 86 the Court held that “detention under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1 may be ordered, in particular, against a person having carried out punishable preparatory acts to an offence in order to prevent his committing that latter offence”. This interpretation was given with reference to the requirements under paragraphs 1 (c) and 3 respectively that the person’s detention was to be effected “for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority” and that the person was to “be brought promptly before a judge” and was “entitled to a trial within a reasonable time” under paragraph 3 (ibid., §§ 68, 82, 85 and 86), and also with reference to previous case-law (ibid., §§ 67-69) to the effect that sub-paragraph (c) permitted deprivation of liberty only in connection with criminal proceedings.

In the first place, starting with the aforementioned Lawless case, the first to come before the Court raising questions of interpretation of the provisions at issue, this concerned the Irish authorities’ internment of IRA members without trial. The applicant was detained for five months, without being brought before a judge, under legislation which gave ministers special powers of detention without trial, whenever the government published a proclamation that such powers were necessary to secure the preservation of peace and order. The Government argued that the applicant’s detention could be justified as being “necessary to prevent his committing an offence”, which did not also require “the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority”. The Court, however, rejected this argument, on the following grounds (emphasis added):",
                "“13. Whereas, in this connection, the question referred to the judgment of the Court is whether or not the provisions of Article 5, paragraphs 1 (c) and 3, prescribe that a person arrested or detained ‘when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence’ shall be brought before a judge, in other words whether, in Article 5, paragraph 1 (c), the expression ‘effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent judicial (sic) authority [ devant l’autorité judiciaire compétente ]’ qualifies only the words ‘on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence’ or also the words ‘when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence’;",
                "14. Whereas the wording of Article 5, paragraph 1 (c), is sufficiently clear to give an answer to this question; whereas it is evident that the expression ‘effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority’ qualifies every category of cases of arrest or detention referred to in that sub-paragraph; whereas it follows that the said clause permits deprivation of liberty only when such deprivation is effected for the purpose of bringing the person arrested or detained before the competent judicial authority, irrespective of whether such person is a person who is reasonably suspected of having committed an offence, or a person whom it is reasonably considered necessary to restrain from committing an offence, or a person whom it reasonably considered necessary to restrain from absconding after having committed an offence;",
                "Whereas, further, paragraph 1 (c) of Article 5 can be construed only if read in conjunction with paragraph 3 of the same Article, with which it forms a whole; whereas paragraph 3 stipulates categorically that ‘everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge ...’ and ‘shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time’; whereas it plainly entails the obligation to bring everyone arrested or detained in any of the circumstances contemplated by the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) before a judge for the purpose of examining the question of deprivation of liberty or for the purpose of deciding on the merits; whereas such is the plain and natural meaning of the wording of both paragraph 1 (c) and paragraph 3 of Article 5;",
                "Whereas the meaning thus arrived at by grammatical analysis is fully in harmony with the purpose of the Convention which is to protect the freedom and security of the individual against arbitrary detention or arrest; whereas it must be pointed out in this connexion that, if the construction placed by the Court on the aforementioned provisions were not correct, anyone suspected of harbouring an intent to commit an offence could be arrested and detained for an unlimited period on the strength merely of an executive decision without its being possible to regard his arrest or detention as a breach of the Convention; whereas such an assumption, with all its implications of arbitrary power, would lead to conclusions repugnant to the fundamental principles of the Convention;"

Moreover, the requirement that the detention “be effected for the purpose of bringing [the person] before the competent [judicial] authority” applied in respect of each ground, as did the obligation to bring the person before a judge either for the purpose of examining the question of deprivation of liberty or for the purpose of deciding on the merits of a criminal charge, under paragraphs 1 (c) and 3 of Article 5."

The Court neither explained the contradiction with Lawless, nor was any inconsistency hinted at, let alone rectified, in any of the follow-up rulings thereafter.

It is particularly noteworthy that the Court, relying heavily on the approach adopted in Steel and Others (cited above), examined the matter under both limbs of Article 5 § 1 (c) and, in doing so, reached separate partial conclusions in respect of each of those limbs (emphasis added):",

Nor does it seem consistent with the additional statement in Ostendorf (cited above, § 82) that “the second alternative of Article 5 § 1 (c) ... only governs pre-trial detention and not custody for preventive purposes without the person concerned being suspected of having already committed a criminal offence”. On the contrary, in the first and third of the above-mentioned British cases, the Court left open what part of the measures fell under the one or the other ground, and in the second case it clearly distinguished between them, specifying that the initial detention fell under the preventive ground. On the basis of this analysis, the line taken in the three British cases is in a sense reminiscent of that taken in Ireland v. the United Kingdom and Guzzardi (both cited above). The former left open to what extent the respective limbs applied to the case before the Court, whereas the latter identified more clearly the application of the second limb (see paragraph 107 above) in a manner that can be traced back to the clear distinction made between the two limbs in Lawless, consistent with the Report of the Conference of Senior Officials on Human Rights to the Committee of Ministers in relation to Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 of the second draft Convention (see paragraph 42 above)."

Bulgaria, no. 39272/98, §§ 149-50, ECHR 2003 ‑ XII; and Opuz v. Turkey, no. 33401/02, § 159, ECHR 2009). These measures should provide effective protection and include reasonable steps to prevent ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge (see, inter alia, Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, § 73, ECHR 2001 ‑ V, and D.P. and J.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 38719/97, § 109, 10 October 2002; see also, in the context of Article 2, Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, § 115, Reports 1998 ‑ VIII and Mastromatteo v.

It can therefore be argued, as the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom did (see § 38 of the judgment referred to in paragraph 46 above), that in respect of short-term preventive detention the requirement “for the purpose of bringing [the detainee] before the competent legal authority” implicitly depends on the cause of detention continuing long enough for the person to be brought before a court. In this regard, the Court considers that the question whether the purpose requirement has been complied with should depend on an objective assessment of the authorities’ conduct, in particular whether the detainee, as required by Article 5 § 3, is brought promptly before a judge to have the lawfulness of his or her detention reviewed or is released before such time. Furthermore, in the event of failure to comply with the latter requirement, the person concerned should have an enforceable right to compensation in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 5."

Against this background, and subject to the availability under national law of the additional safeguards in paragraphs 3 and 5 of Article 5 – to be elaborated on in greater detail below – the Court considers that when a person is released from preventive detention after a short period of time, either because the risk has passed or, for example, because a prescribed short time-limit has expired, the purpose requirement of bringing the detainee before the competent legal authority should not as such constitute an obstacle to short-term preventive detention falling under the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (c). As illustrated by the flexible approach adopted in Brogan and Others (described in paragraph 118 above), the Convention should be interpreted and applied in recognition of the need to deal specially with such serious challenges as are at issue in this case (see paragraph 94 above)."

At the same time, it should be stressed that any flexibility in this area is limited by important safeguards embodied in Article 5 § 1, notably the requirements that the deprivation of liberty be lawful (see paragraph 74 above), in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see paragraphs 74-76 above), that the offence be concrete and specific as regards, in particular, the place and time of its commission and its victims (see paragraph 89 above) and that the authorities must furnish some facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned would in all likelihood have been involved in the concrete and specific offence had its commission not been prevented by the detention (see paragraph 91 above). Such flexibility is further circumscribed by the requirement that the arrest and detention be “reasonably considered necessary” (see paragraph 77 above and the further elaboration of this criterion affirmed in paragraph 161 below). Moreover, in assessing the scope of that requirement, regard may be had to the extent to which the measures affect interests protected by other rights guaranteed by the Convention.",

Article 5 § 3 includes a procedural requirement for the “judge or other officer authorised by law” to hear the individual brought before him or her in person, and a substantive requirement for the same officer to review the circumstances militating for or against detention – that is, whether there are reasons to justify detention – and to order release if there are no such reasons (see, for example, Buzadji, cited above, § 98, with further references). The initial automatic review of arrest and detention must be capable of examining lawfulness issues and whether or not the reasonable suspicion that the arrested person has committed an offence persists, or in other words, ascertaining that the detention falls within the permitted exception set out in Article 5 § 1 (c) (ibid., § 99)."

It follows directly from the wording of Article 5 § 3 that if the person is not “arrested or detained” but has been released, there is no obligation to bring him or her promptly before a judge. This understanding is supported by the reference in Lawless (cited above, § 14, quoted in paragraph 104 above) to two options when bringing a person before a judge: either for the purpose of examining the question of deprivation of liberty or for the purpose of deciding on the merits of a criminal charge. Moreover, as the Court pointed out in Brogan and Others (cited above, § 58):",
                "“the fact that a detained person is not charged or brought before a court does not in itself amount to a violation of the first part of Article 5 § 3. No violation of Article 5 § 3 can arise if the arrested person is released ‘promptly’ before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible (see the de Jong, Baljet and van den Brink judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, p. 25, § 52).

In order to determine whether release has taken place at a time before such prompt judicial control, the starting point should be the manner in which the requirement of “promptness” in Article 5 § 3 has been applied in the Court’s case-law. While promptness has to be assessed according to the special features of each case (see, among other authorities, Aquilina v. Malta [GC], no. 25642/94, § 48, ECHR 1999 ‑ III), the strict time constraint imposed by this requirement leaves little flexibility in interpretation; otherwise there would be a serious weakening of a procedural guarantee to the detriment of the individual and a risk of impairing the very essence of the right protected by this provision (see, for example, McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 33, ECHR 2006 ‑ X)."

Thus, for example, in İpek and Others v. Turkey (nos. 17019/02 and 30070/02, §§ 36-37, 3 February 2009) and Kandzhov v. Bulgaria (no. 68294/01, §§ 66-67, 6 November 2008) the Court found that periods of three days and nine hours and three days and twenty-three hours respectively could not be considered “prompt”."

It is also relevant for the assessment of “promptness” to bear in mind that when bringing a detainee before the judge under the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (c), the Court has held that the object of questioning during detention under this sub-paragraph is to further the criminal investigation by confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicion grounding the arrest (see, for example, John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, § 55, Reports 1996 ‑ I). This implies that a certain period between the arrest and the prompt appearance before the judge may be necessary for the investigating authorities to obtain evidence to substantiate that there are reasons to justify the detention."

Such considerations do not come into play for a detainee under the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (c) where there is no criminal investigation and no suspicion to confirm or dispel. The facts constituting the risk of committing an offence must already be established at the time when the person is detained in order to prevent his or her committing this offence. It therefore appears that the period needed between a person’s detention for preventive purposes and the person’s prompt appearance before a judge or judicial officer should be shorter than in the case of pre-trial detention in criminal proceedings. Whereas for a person deprived of his or her liberty “on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence” under the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (c), any period in excess of four days is prima facie too long (see paragraph 131 above) a significantly shorter period might be required in order to be viewed as “prompt” in the case of a person deprived of his or her liberty outside the context of criminal proceedings “when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence”."

It does not follow from the fact of resorting to preventive detention that the authorities have any intention of charging the person in question or carrying out further investigations in order to verify whether a charge can be brought. Where no criminal proceedings are initiated and no trial is to be held, the requirement in question cannot apply to preventive detention."

The Court reiterates that in order to find a violation of Article 5 § 5, it must be established that the finding of a violation of one of the other paragraphs of Article 5 could not give rise to an enforceable claim for compensation before the domestic courts (see Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, § 184, ECHR 2012). In a number of cases the Court has found a violation of this provision where a victim of deprivation of liberty effected in conditions contrary to paragraphs 1, 2, 3 or 4 of Article 5 did not have an enforceable claim for compensation in the domestic courts (see, among many other examples, Brogan and Others, cited above, § 67; Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, § 46, Series A no. 182; Stanev, cited above, §§ 184-91).

Although the “purpose” requirement under Article 5 § 1 (c) applies also to deprivation of liberty under the second limb of this provision, this requirement should be applied with a degree of flexibility so that the question of compliance depends on whether the detainee, as required by Article 5 § 3, is intended to be brought promptly before a judge to have the lawfulness of his or her detention reviewed or to be released before such time.

In order to prevent hooligan clashes, the police had made a plan to engage in proactive dialogue with the spectators from 12 noon, when they started to arrive in the city centre. The police had planned that, in the event of any clashes, they would charge the instigators of fights with criminal offences and arrest them under section 755 of the Administration of Justice Act or, should that not be possible, they would detain the instigators by virtue of section 5(3) of the Police Act. In view of the time-limit, they sought to avoid resorting to detention early in the day because any person so detained would otherwise have had to be released during or immediately after the match and would then have been able to head for the city centre again and resume their involvement in brawls (see paragraph 20 above). Moreover, from Chief Inspector B.O.’s statement before the City Court it appears that in their implementation of the plan the police continuously assessed the situation.

The Court considers that the findings of fact reached by the domestic courts in the present case (see paragraphs 150-153 above) should be able to satisfy an objective observer that, at the time when the applicants were detained, the police had every reason to believe that they were organising a brawl between football hooligans in the centre of Copenhagen in the hours before, during or after the football match on 10 October 2009, which could have caused considerable danger to the safety of the many peaceful football supporters and uninvolved third parties present at the relevant time. Indeed, as it was considered that the second and third applicants and the first applicant respectively had been prevented from instigating or continuing to instigate a brawl between football hooligans at Amagertorv Square at 3.50 p.m. and in front of Tivoli Gardens at 4.45 p.m. on the relevant day, the place and time could be very precisely described.

The necessity criterion that applies in respect of certain provisions of Article 5 § 1, including the first limb of sub-paragraph (c), has been mentioned in paragraph 77 above, notably the authorities’ obligation to consider “alternative means”. With a view to its examination of the preventive detention at issue in the present case, the Court considers it useful to elaborate on this criterion in respect of the second limb. In its view, less severe measures have to be considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained. Preventive detention cannot reasonably be considered necessary unless a proper balance is struck between the importance in a democratic society of preventing an imminent risk of an offence being committed and the importance of the right to liberty. In order to be proportionate to such a serious measure as deprivation of liberty, the concrete and specific “offence” referred to under the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (c) must also be of a serious nature, entailing danger to life and limb or significant material damage. It follows in addition that the detention should cease as soon as the risk has passed, which requires monitoring, the duration of the detention being also a relevant factor (on the latter point, see, for example, Schwabe and M.G., cited above, § 78)."

The Court further observes that according to the evidence given by Chief Inspector B.O., the strategic commander of the police operation, to the City Court (see paragraph 21 above) the manoeuvre tactics to prevent such clashes had been to engage in proactive dialogue with the fans/spectators from 12 noon, when they started to arrive, and in the event of any clashes, to detain only the instigators. Moreover, although there were several fights up until the start of the match, the manoeuvre tactics continued to be a dialogue to ensure that the large number of spectators behaved and made their way to the stadium to watch the match. In his statement (see paragraph 22 above) Police Constable P.W. confirmed that at the beginning there had been a good atmosphere and no violence. He and a colleague had simply “kept an eye” on the Danish football fans in the bar. When they had received reports that Swedish and Danish fans were to meet and fight and the group had started leaving the bar, walking down the pedestrian shopping street towards Amagertorv Square, approximately 700 metres away, where the first fight had broken out at 3.41 p.m., the police had followed the Danish group and had reported back to the control room. Chief Inspector B.O. stated that he did not know the number of persons involved directly in the fight, but had understood from local reports that there were about fifty to sixty persons on either side."

Moreover, even when faced with the situation arising when a group of approximately fifty Danish football fans left the pub and went directly towards the fight at Amagertorv Square, the police initially attempted to apply less stringent measures to avoid a confrontation. They parked their personnel carriers crosswise to prevent the Danish group of football fans from colliding with the Swedish group. Thereafter, they turned the group of Danish football fans around and took them down a side street to register and search them."

As established by the national courts, it was at that moment of intense action, in the immediate vicinity of the on-going fight at Amagertorv Square, that the second and third applicants were considered inciting others to take part in the fighting. Those two applicants were therefore detained at 3.50 p.m., in full compliance with the manoeuvre tactics aimed at detaining only the instigators (see paragraph 163 above). According to Police Constable P.W. (see paragraph 22 above) the purpose of detaining those two applicants was to ensure calm and prevent clashes, an approach which apparently succeeded because it became obvious that the hooligans from Aarhus were missing someone to take control."

In the Court’s view, this shows that the police did not resort to excessive detentions, but took care to detain only those who, in their assessment, posed a risk of disturbance of public order and a danger to the safety of individuals and public security."

The court finds, in the circumstances of the present case, that there is no basis for invalidating the correctness of the assessment made by the police, according to which the release of the detainees before the city centre had become quiet would have entailed a concrete and imminent risk of further unrest, including clashes with spectators who had been let out of the national stadium after the end of the match and who were still in the streets in large numbers.”"

                "\"In this connection, the Federal Court has held that the District Attorney of the Canton of Zürich exercises judicial power (ATF 102 Ia 180, confirmed by the European Court of Human Rights, Publications of the European Court of Human Rights, Series A no. 34, ...; see also ATF 107 Ia 254). However, the appellant considers ... that reference to these precedents is not relevant as in the instant case the District Attorney who had drawn up the indictment was the same as the one who had ordered the arrest.",

What is decisive is whether at the time of the arrest the decision was taken by an official who satisfied the requirements of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) of the European Convention on Human Rights in other words by an officer who exercised judicial power. This question has been answered in the affirmative by the eminent courts referred to above. This finding that the functions discharged by that officer are compatible with the provisions of the Convention cannot subsequently be called in question on the sole ground that, once the investigation has been completed, the District Attorney assumes the role of prosecuting authority. The status of this officer at the time of and in relation to the decision to arrest remains the same, and the arrest, initially regarded as being lawful, cannot subsequently become unlawful on this sole ground. Furthermore, it is only natural that the District Attorney, as the investigating authority and acting within his powers, should draw up an indictment after the investigation has been completed if he considers that he possesses sufficient evidence of the accused ’ s guilt. Nor can it readily be seen what the accused would gain if the indictment had to be drawn up by an officer other than the District Attorney who, at the beginning of the investigation, had ordered his arrest. In other words, as far as Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention is concerned, the fact that the officer who ordered the arrest is the same as the officer who drew up the indictment is not decisive.\""

The mere fact that this possibility exists is not, however, decisive in this respect. Firstly, the eventuality cannot put in question or negate the Attorney ’ s independence from the parties at the time of an arrest. As has been shown, it is far more a matter of looking at the position as it stands at the time when the detention is ordered. Secondly, the possibility in question was held not to be decisive by the European Court in its judgment in the Schiesser case. In that case it could also have happened that the District Attorney subsequently had to draw up the indictment, since the jurisdiction of the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office at the stage of beginning the investigation or at the time of the arrest had not been established. This eventuality did not, however, prevent the European Court from finding that there had been no breach of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention in the Schiesser case. That fact likewise shows that the relevant officer ’ s independence and impartiality must be considered exclusively at the time of the arrest and not in the light of the mere possibility that he may play a role later in the proceedings and draw up the indictment.\""

If it had then appeared to the magistrate that the arrest had been unlawful, the magistrate would have been obliged to order release under Article 137 of the Criminal Code read in conjunction with the Convention and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. Although the applicant had produced some decisions which seemed to indicate that the powers of the magistrate before whom the accused first appeared were more limited than the Government maintained, these decisions emanated from lower courts and, in any event, the accused in these cases had not contended that the law did not allow arrest in their case or that there was no reasonable suspicion to justify arrest."

Moreover, there was no instance of an arrested person being released on being brought before a magistrate on the ground that the magistrate had decided that the arrest was unlawful. Additional arguments could be drawn a contrario from Articles353 (see paragraph 24 above) and 397(5) of the Criminal Code. The latter provision provided that the court could also order the arrest of an accused person who was not already in custody. In any event, even assuming that the applicant could have made an application under Article 137 of the Criminal Code, this would not have ensured compliance with Article 5 § 3 of the Convention which required an automatic review. Finally, the applicant’s arrest and detention could not have been considered unlawful because in the Ellul case the Constitutional Court had found that the limitations imposed by the system in force on the magistrate’s power of release did not raise any issues under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 25 above)."

However, domestic law did not require the police to substantiate the grounds militating in favour of his arrest and the magistrate could release him only if he submitted a bail application. Since the offence for which the applicant had been arrested carried a penalty exceeding three years’ imprisonment, the bail application had to be communicated to the Attorney-General, who should normally have had one working day in which to decide whether he would oppose it or not. During that period the magistrate was not competent to decide on the the applicant’s release. According to standard practice, after the accused’s first appearance before a magistrate the case went to the registrar who chose by lot the magistrate who would hear the evidence. This system was introduced to eliminate the possibility of forum-shopping by the police. The magistrate who heard the evidence also examined the bail application after the Attorney-General had had the opportunity of expressing his view. As a result, the bail application was often examined by a different magistrate from the one before whom the accused had first appeared."

Moreover, the applicant could have invoked Article 137 of the Criminal Code to raise any other complaints he might have had concerning the lawfulness of his arrest.",
                "Quite apart from this consideration, the Government submitted that, in cases where the court had found an arrest to be lawful, it was open to the arrested person to request provisional release on bail. In this connection, the Government argued that although Article 5 § 3 required that the accused be brought promptly before a judge it did not require that the decision on the bail application be taken immediately. The reason why certain bail applications were communicated to the Attorney-General was to ensure that the principles of audi alteram partem and equality of arms were respected. In any event, the Attorney-General replied expeditiously and, as a result, the review of the accused’s detention could be concluded within the time-frame of Article 5 § 3. If the Attorney-General did not reply within the time-limit set by the magistrate, the latter could give a ruling on the bail application without hearing the Attorney-General’s views, which were not in any event binding. The period of eleven days which had elapsed between the applicant’s arrest (20 July 1992) and the decision on his bail application (31 July 1992) could not be considered a breach of Article 5 § 3. Furthermore, the Government stressed that the applicant had had ample opportunity to present his case in writing and could have made oral submissions. The Convention did not require that the magistrate who decided on an arrested person’s bail application should be the same as the magistrate before whom the arrested person initially appeared. Although the second magistrate had not heard the applicant in person, he had had at his disposal all the information required and was totally independent of the executive. In any event, the applicant could have asked the second magistrate to hear him in person."

As the Court has pointed out on many occasions, Article 5 § 3 of the Convention provides persons arrested or detained on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence with a guarantee against any arbitrary or unjustified deprivation of liberty (see, inter alia, the Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, p. 3298, § 146). It is essentially the object of Article 5 § 3, which forms a whole with paragraph 1 (c), to require provisional release once detention ceases to be reasonable. The fact that an arrested person had access to a judicial authority is not sufficient to constitute compliance with the opening part of Article 5 § 3. This provision enjoins the judicial officer before whom the arrested person appears to review the circumstances militating for or against detention, to decide by reference to legal criteria whether there are reasons to justify detention, and to order release if there are no such reasons (see the De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, pp. 21-24, §§ 44, 47 and 51). In other words, Article 5 § 3 requires the judicial officer to consider the merits of the detention."

Promptness has to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see the De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink judgment cited above, pp. 24 and 25, §§ 51 and 52). However, the scope of flexibility in interpreting and applying the notion of promptness is very limited (see the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, pp. 33-34, § 62)."

It cannot be made to depend on a previous application by the detained person. Such a requirement would not only change the nature of the safeguard provided for under Article 5 § 3, a safeguard distinct from that in Article 5 § 4, which guarantees the right to institute proceedings to have the lawfulness of detention reviewed by a court (see the De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink judgment cited above, pp. 25-26, § 57). It might even defeat the purpose of the safeguard under Article 5 § 3 which is to protect the individual from arbitrary detention by ensuring that the act of deprivation of liberty is subject to independent judicial scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, the Kurt v. Turkey judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1185, § 123). Prompt judicial review of detention is also an important safeguard against ill-treatment of the individual taken into custody (see the Aksoy v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2282, § 76). Furthermore, arrested persons who have been subjected to such treatment might be incapable of lodging an application asking the judge to review their detention.

Even assuming the Government’s interpretation of national law to be correct, the Court considers that Article 5 § 3 would not be complied with. The matters which, by virtue of Article 5 § 3, the judicial officer must examine go beyond the one ground of lawfulness cited by the Government. The review required under Article 5 § 3, being intended to establish whether the deprivation of the individual’s liberty is justified, must be sufficiently wide to encompass the various circumstances militating for or against detention (see paragraph 47 above). However, the evidence before the Court does not disclose that the magistrate before whom the applicant appeared on 22 July 1992 or any other judicial officer had the power to conduct such a review of his or her own motion."

However, compliance with Article 5 § 3 cannot be ensured by making an Article 5 § 4 remedy available. The review must be automatic (see paragraph 49 above). Furthermore, even in the context of an application by an individual under Article 137 and having regard to Article 353, the scope of the review has not been established to be such as to allow a review of the merits of the detention. Apart from the cases where the forty-eight-hour time-limit was exceeded, the Government have not referred to any instances in which Article 137 of the Criminal Code has been successfully invoked to challenge either the lawfulness of or the justification for an arrest on suspicion of a criminal offence. Moreover, from what the Court can deduce from the domestic cases cited before it, the absence of a reasonable suspicion or of reasons militating in favour of the applicant’s continued detention would not necessarily have rendered the applicant’s arrest and detention unlawful under Maltese law (see paragraphs 22, 25 and 26 above). It follows that the Government have not substantiated their preliminary objection that the applicant has not exhausted domestic remedies because he did not seek to rely on Article 137 of the Criminal Code read together with Article 353.

Before an “officer” can be said to exercise “judicial power” within the meaning of this provision, he or she must satisfy certain conditions providing a guarantee to the person detained against any arbitrary or unjustified deprivation of liberty (see the Schiesser v. Switzerland judgment of 4 December 1979, Series A no. 34, pp. 13-14, § 31).",

The Court recalls that arrested or detained persons are entitled to a review bearing upon the procedural and substantive conditions which are essential for the “lawfulness”, in the sense of the Convention, of their deprivation of liberty. This means that the competent court has to examine “not only compliance with the procedural requirements set out in [domestic law] but also the reasonableness of the suspicion grounding the arrest and the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by the arrest and the ensuing detention” (see the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, pp. 34-35, § 65).",
                "A court examining an appeal against detention must provide guarantees of a judicial procedure. The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure “equality of arms” between the parties, the prosecutor and the detained person (see the Sanchez-Reisse v. Switzerland judgment of 21 October 1986, Series A no. 107, p. 19, § 51; the Toth v. Austria judgment of 12 December 1991, Series A no. 224, p. 23, § 84; and the Kampanis v. Greece judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 318-B, p. 45, § 47). Equality of arms is not ensured if counsel is denied access to those documents in the investigation file which are essential in order effectively to challenge the lawfulness of his client’s detention (see the Lamy v. Belgium judgment of 30 March 1989, Series A no. 151, pp. 16-17, § 29). In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 § 1 (c), a hearing is required (see the Assenov and Others judgment cited above, p. 3302, § 162)."

Turning to the facts of the present case the Court notes that, according to Article 152 §§ 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Supreme Court’s practice at the relevant time, a person charged with a “serious wilful crime” was detained on remand unless he or she demonstrated beyond doubt, the burden of proof being borne by him or her, that there did not exist even a hypothetical danger of absconding, re-offending or obstructing justice. The presumption that such danger existed could be overturned only in exceptional circumstances, such as where the detained person was immobilised by illness (see paragraph 31 above). In the applicant’s submission the above approach, which is rooted in the wording of Article 152 §§ 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, continues to be the practice of the Bulgarian courts despite some recent Supreme Court decisions (see paragraphs 32 and 55 above).",

The Plovdiv Regional Court when examining the applicant’s appeal against her detention on remand apparently followed the case-law of the Supreme Court at that time and thus limited its consideration of the case to a verification of whether the investigator and the prosecutor had charged the applicant with a “serious wilful crime” within the meaning of the Criminal Code and whether her medical condition required release (see paragraphs 19 and 30-31 above).",
                "In her appeal of 14 November 1995, however, the applicant had advanced substantial arguments questioning the soundness of the charges against her and the grounds for her detention. She had referred to concrete facts, such as that she had not attempted to abscond or obstruct the investigation during the months since she had become aware of the criminal proceedings against her, and that she had a family and a stable way of life. The applicant had also asserted that the evidence against her was weak as the charges were based only on the auditors’ report. In her submission there was nothing to support the accusation that she, and not any of the other six persons in possession of keys to the cashier’s office, had actually misappropriated the missing funds. In its decision of 11 December 1995 the Regional Court devoted no consideration to any of these arguments, apparently treating them as irrelevant to the question of the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention on remand (see paragraphs 16 and 19 above).",

The submissions of the applicant in her appeal of 14 November 1995 contained such concrete facts and did not appear implausible or frivolous.

However, in more recent cases concerning violations of either or both paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 5, the Court has declined to accept such claims (see the Pauwels v.

In some of these judgments the Court noted that just satisfaction can be awarded only in respect of damage resulting from a deprivation of liberty that the applicant would not have suffered if he or she had had the benefit of the guarantees of Article 5 § 3 and concluded, according to the circumstances, that the finding of a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction in respect of any non-pecuniary damage suffered.",

In particular, it had heard the parties ’ submissions regarding the lawfulness of the arrest and it had not been satisfied that the arrest was unlawful.

It followed that the reasonable suspicion did not have to be shared by the magistrate. The applicant noted that in the cases of Aquilina v. Malta (see GC judgment of 29 April 1999, Reports 1999-III) and T.W. v Malta (see GC judgment of 29 April 1999, Reports 1999-III) the Court found a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention on the ground that the Court of Magistrates had no power to establish whether the deprivation of the individual ’ s liberty was justified and to order release. The Maltese law had consequently been amended, but the practice before the Court of Magistrates as a Court of Criminal Inquiry had remained substantially the same, as shown by the events in his own case. Appearing before a duty magistrate was a ritual and a mere formality. Indeed, the applicant failed to see how such a fundamental issue as jurisdiction could be considered as having no impact on the lawfulness of the arrest, given that an arrest not justified by jurisdiction was clearly unlawful. If there was no jurisdiction, then the courts lacked competence, and if the issue of jurisdiction was postponed then the element of promptness required by Article 5 § 3 would be disrespected."

According to the Government, the Court of Magistrates had both the competence and a legal obligation to deal with such matters. Indeed, it entered into all the issues raised except for the question of jurisdiction, which in fact resulted at a later stage in a finding of a breach of Article 5 § 4 by the domestic court.

As transpires from the minutes of the proceedings, the court took its decision after hearing both parties, whose views regarding the warrant were subsidiary to their main arguments regarding the justification of the arrest.

It is structurally concerned with two separate matters: the early stages following an arrest when an individual is taken into the power of the authorities and the period pending eventual trial before a criminal court during which the suspect may be detained or released with or without conditions. These two limbs confer distinct rights and are not on their face logically or temporally linked (see T.W. v. Malta [GC], no. 25644/94, § 49, 29 April 1999 ).

It had understandable regard in this latter connection to the fact that the validity of the arrest warrant had already been confirmed on multiple occasions (see paragraph 14 above). The fact that the Court of Magistrates did not go into further details, a point which is criticised by the applicant (see paragraph 46 above), cannot be taken to mean that it had not analysed all the circumstances and that it had not satisfied itself that the prosecution had made out a case for the existence of a reasonable suspicion against the applicant (see paragraph 13 above).

In the present case the applicant ’ s request for the court to declare his arrest and continued detention unlawful proceeded on the basis and as a consequence of his claim that there had been a violation of Article 5 §§ 3- 4. The Constitutional Court did not think that, as a consequence of the finding of a violation, his arrest and detention were unlawful, which is precisely why they annulled the decision committing the applicant to stand trial and remitted the case to the first court to take cognisance of the plea of jurisdiction. In this way the Constitutional Court fully addressed the issue it was requested to address by the applicant within the terms set out by him in his application.

The remedies must be made available during a person ’ s detention with a view to that person obtaining speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of the detention capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release.

It remitted the case to the Court of Magistrates to be decided afresh and awarded the applicant approximately 960 euros for just satisfaction (see paragraph 24 above) for the breach of Article 5 § 4.

                "1. The object of the Commission ’ s request is to submit the case of Karl-Heinz Wemhoff to the Court so that the Court may decide whether or not the facts reveal any violation by the Federal Republic of Germany of its obligations under Articles 5 (3) and 6 (1) (art. 5-3, art. 6-1) of the Convention.",
                "2. The facts of the case, as they appear from the Commission ’ s Report, the memorials, documents and evidence submitted to the Court and the oral statements made by the Commission and the Government, are essentially as follows:",
                "3. K. H. Wemhoff, a German national born at Berlin in 1927, is habitually resident there. At the time of his arrest he was a broker by profession.",
                "4. Being under suspicion of being involved in offences of breach of trust, the Applicant was arrested on 9 November 1961. A warrant of arrest ( Haftbefehl ) issued the next day by the District Court ( Amtsgericht ) of Berlin- Tiergarten ordered his detention on remand.",
                "The warrant stated that Wemhoff was under grave suspicion of having incited breach of trust ( Anstiftung zur Untreue ) contrary to Sections 266 and 48 of the German Criminal Code: as a customer of the August-Thyssen Bank in Berlin he was said to have incited certain of the Bank ’ s officials to misappropriate very large sums of money. It was also stated in the warrant that it was to be feared that, if left at liberty, the Applicant would abscond and attempt to suppress evidence (Section 112 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure), for:",
                "- he was likely to receive a considerable sentence;",
                "- persons implicated in the offences but not yet known to the authorities might receive warning; and",
                "- there was a danger that the Applicant would destroy those business documents that it had not yet been possible to seize.",
                "During the investigation the warrant was superseded successively by two detention orders dated 28 December 1961 and 8 January 1962, both issued by the District Court. These stated that Wemhoff was under grave suspicion of continuing acts of fraud ( fortgesetzter Betrug ) contrary to Section 263 of the Criminal Code, of prolonged abetment to fraud ( fortgesetzte Beihilfe zum Betrug ) contrary to Sections 263 and 49 of the Code and of prolonged abetment to breach of trust ( fortgesetzte Beihilfe zur Untreue ) contrary to Sections 266 and 49 of the Code.",
                "5. In the course of 1961 and 1962 the Applicant asked at several times to be released but all his requests were rejected by the Berlin courts which referred to the reasons given in the warrants of arrest mentioned above. In particular, in May 1962, he made an unspecified offer of bail, which was rejected by the Court of Appeal ( Kammergericht ) on 25 June 1962, on the grounds of a danger of suppression of evidence ( Verdunkelungsgefahr ) and moreover because bail could not dispel or diminish the danger of flight in the present case. On 8 August 1962, he offered bail of 200,000 DM, but he withdrew the offer two days later.",
                "6. On the occasion of an ex-officio examination of the lawfulness of the detention by the District Court, Wemhoff ’ s lawyer asked on 20 March 1963 for conditional release of the Applicant, offering in particular the deposit of identity papers. On the same day, however, the court ordered the further detention of the Applicant on the grounds given in the warrant of arrest.",
                "The Applicant contested this decision on 16 April 1963, when he invoked the provisions of the Convention for the first time. Asking for release on any condition which might be thought to be necessary, he held in particular that there was neither a danger of suppression of evidence nor a danger of flight, for he had done all he could do to clear up the transactions involved. He added that all his roots were in West Berlin where he lived with his wife and child and where his family had for one hundred and twenty years owned a jeweller ’ s shop, and which his father intended to convey to him very soon. He further stressed that he had brought civil actions against his debtors and therefore had to appear as plaintiff before several District Courts at least five times a week. On the other hand, he pointed out that it was not possible for him to flee from West Berlin: by reason of his numerous previous journeys he was so well known at the Berlin airport that he could not take an aeroplane there; having been detained for several years in the Soviet Occupied Zone he could enter neither this territory nor East Berlin. Finally the fact that he stayed at Berlin after the discovery of his transactions by the Thyssen Bank on 27 October 1961 showed clearly that he never had any intention of fleeing.",
                "This appeal was rejected by the Regional Court ( Landgericht ) of Berlin on 3 May 1963, on the following grounds:",
                "- the Applicant was under suspicion of having committed the alleged offences;",
                "- the facts had not been fully investigated and were particularly involved;",
                "- he appeared to have played a particularly significant part in all the transactions under consideration so that he was likely to receive a particularly severe sentence and might therefore be suspected of intending to flee;",
                "- he had important connections abroad and it was impossible, at the present stage of the preliminary investigation, to deny the possibility that he had assets there;",
                "- the threat of his financial collapse increased the danger of flight which was not diminished by the existence of his family links in Berlin;",
                "- while it was doubtful whether the danger of suppression of evidence was sufficient to justify continued detention, certain reasons still suggested that there was still such danger.",
                "In a second appeal ( weitere Beschwerde ) of 16 May 1963, the Applicant specified that he had been sentenced in 1953 by a tribunal in East Germany to ten years penal servitude and had been released in November 1957. Adding that he had declared his opposition to communism on many occasions, the Applicant declared that it was also impossible for him to flee by passing through the Soviet Occupied Zone by train or by road.",
                "From the judgment of the Regional Court of 7 April 1965 (paragraph 12, infra), it appears that the conviction mentioned by the Applicant had been in respect of the illegal transport of goods belonging to refugees and of timber to West Berlin; this conviction was dated 7 March 1953.",
                "The Appeal of 16 May 1963 was rejected by the Court of Appeal on 5 August 1963. While admitting that at this stage there might be some doubt as to whether there was still a danger of suppression of evidence, the Court, taking up the grounds of the decision against which the appeal was lodged, pointed out that there was still a danger that the Applicant would abscond; and that his continued detention did not conflict with the requirements of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) of the Convention. The Court added that it was to be feared that Wemhoff would refuse to comply with the summons to appear before the judicial authorities on account of his character on which a medical expert had given an unfavourable opinion, which had been confirmed by his conduct while in detention pending trial.",
                "7. Several applications for conditional release filed by the Applicant in 1963 and 1964 were also rejected by the Berlin courts on grounds similar to those stated by the Court of Appeal on 5 August 1963. In particular, this court found, in a decision of 22 June 1964, that the risk that the Applicant would abscond was even greater than in August 1963. As a matter of fact, he was likely to receive an appreciably higher sentence than had formerly been thought, as in the meantime the Public Prosecution had extended the accusation against the Applicant to certain offences under the Bankruptcy Code some of which he was said to have committed while in detention. On the other hand, the court considered that it was not yet possible to forecast whether the Applicant, in the event of a conviction, would be conditionally released in accordance with Section 26 of the Criminal Code after serving two-thirds of his detention and whether, in the event of such conviction, the time he had spent in detention pending trial would be counted as part of the sentence.",
                "Between 13 November 1961 and 3 November 1964 the Applicant submitted 41 petitions concerning the conditions of his detention on remand, 16 of which were accepted by the responsible authorities while the other 25 were refused.",
                "During his detention, he was subjected to disciplinary punishment five times.",

                "One of the subjects of the investigation was extremely complex cheque manipulations of which the defendants were suspected (paragraph 57 of the Commission ’ s Report). It involved the examination of 169 accounts at 13 banks in Berlin, 35 banks in West Germany and 8 banks in Switzerland; the transactions checked totalled 776 million DM. In the case of the Applicant alone, transactions amounting to 284.2 million DM were involved between 1 August 1960 and 27 October 1961, affecting 53 accounts at 26 banks.",
                "Several dozen witnesses were questioned, both in the Federal Republic and abroad. In addition some 15 expert opinions were obtained from a number of auditing firms and accountants and from a retired President of the Deutsche Bundesbank. The number of workdays amounted to 6,000. The reports of the financial experts alone comprised 1,500 pages.",

On the basis of the indictment, the Regional Criminal Court, on 7 July 1964, replaced the existing detention order by a new one which stated that Wemhoff was under grave suspicion of having committed the same acts of incitement to breach of trust and complicity in breach of trust as well as fraud and two of the seven offences against the Bankruptcy Act mentioned above.",
                "In connection with the last-named offences the detention order stated that there were grounds for thinking that in the autumn of 1961 Wemhoff had withdrawn 100,000 DM from an account in his wife ’ s name at the Banque Commerciale SA, Geneva, and secreted this amount somewhere. It added that the same was true, at least in part, of a sum of 140,000 DM paid in by Wemhoff in the spring of 1962 to an account kept by his agent with the\" Papenberg -Bank\", Berlin.",

He stated that detention on remand was a \"special sacrifice\" imposed upon persons, whether guilty or not, for the maintenance of an effective administration of justice. As, according to the Applicant, this involves a derogation from the principle of the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 (2) (art. 6-2), the State has not the right to continue such detention until the social position, the livelihood, the health, the professional and family life of the individual concerned were destroyed, consequences which his detention had brought about.

The Report sets out four individual opinions – one concurring, and the other three dissenting.",
                "Arguments of the Commission and the Government",
                "1. In the Commission ’ s view Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) of the Convention lays down the right of a person detained in accordance with Article 5 (1) (c) (art. 5-1-c) either to be released pending trial or to be brought to trial within a reasonable time. If the person is being held in detention on remand it must not exceed a reasonable period. The most important problem, therefore, is to determine the exact meaning of the words \"reasonable time\". The Commission finds this expression vague and lacking in precision, with the result that it is not possible to determine abstractly its exact meaning, which can be evaluated solely in the light of the particular circumstances of each case.",
                "2. In order to facilitate such evaluation the Commission believes that it is in general necessary to examine an individual case according to the seven following \"criteria\" or \"elements\":",
                "(i) The actual length of detention.",
                "In this respect, the Commission does not indicate in its Report when it considers the \"reasonable time\" mentioned in Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) to begin and to end in abstracto. During the oral proceedings before the Court, however, the Principal Delegate of the Commission stated the problems which the Commission thinks arise in this matter. Whereas the English version (\"entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to be released pending trial\") would permit the interpretation that the period referred to ends with the opening of the case before the trial court, the French version (\" être jugée dans un délai raisonnable, ou libérée pendant la procédure \") would cover a longer period, ending at the date on which judgment is pronounced. The Commission has not stated any definite opinion on this question, but at the hearing its Principal Delegate expressed a clear preference in favour of the interpretation based on the French text, the meaning of which is, unlike the English version, clear and unequivocal and also more favourable to the individual. In particular, the delegate of the Commission rejected the argument of the German Government that the English version should be accepted for the simple reason that it limits the sovereignty of States to a lesser degree.",
                "The Commission emphasised the importance which it attaches to the Court ’ s settling this question of interpretation.",
                "(ii) The length of detention on remand in relation to the nature of the offence, the penalty prescribed and to be expected in the case of conviction and any legal provisions making allowance for such a period of detention in the execution of the penalty which may be imposed. On this point the Commission remarked that the length of detention on remand may vary according to the nature of the offence concerned and the penalty prescribed and to be expected. However, in determining the relation between the penalty and the length of detention, it is necessary to take into account the presumption of innocence as guaranteed by Article 6 (2) (art. 6-2) of the Convention. If the length of detention should approach too closely the length of the sentence to be expected in case of conviction, the principle of presumption of innocence would not be fully observed;",
                "(iii) material, moral or other effects on the detained person.",
                "(iv) the conduct of the accused:",
                "(a) Did he contribute to the delay or expedition of the investigation or trial?",
                "(b) Was the procedure delayed as a result of applications for release pending trial, appeals or other remedies resorted to by him?",
                "(c) Did he request release on bail or offer other guarantees to appear for trial?",
                "(v) difficulties in the investigation of the case (its complexity in respect of facts or number of witnesses or co-accused, need to obtain evidence abroad, etc.).",
                "(vi) the manner in which the investigation was conducted:",
                "(a) the system of investigation applicable;",
                "(b) the conduct by the authorities of the investigation (the diligence shown by them in dealing with the case and the manner in which they organised the investigation).",
                "(vii) the conduct of the judicial authorities concerned:",
                "(a) in dealing with the applications for release pending trial;",
                "3. The Commission argues that a rational scheme of this kind makes possible in each case a \"coherent interpretation without any appearance of arbitrariness\". The Commission remarks, however, that the conclusion in any particular case will be the outcome of an overall evaluation of all the elements. Even if examination of some of the criteria leads to the conclusion that the length of detention is reasonable, the application of other criteria may lead to a contrary conclusion. The final and determining conclusion will therefore depend on the relative weight and importance of the criteria, but this in no way precludes one single criterion from having decisive importance in some cases.",
                "The Commission adds that it has endeavoured to cover, through the aforementioned criteria, all the situations of fact which it is usually possible to find in cases of detention on remand, but that the list should not be considered exhaustive, there being exceptional situations, other than those submitted to the Court for decision in the case in question, which might justify the examination of other criteria.",
                "4. In this case the Commission ascertained the facts in the light of the said criteria and proceeded to their legal evaluation by the same method of interpretation.",
                "Certain of the facts established by the Commission seemed to it important in the light of several criteria. There will be found below a summary of the Commission ’ s opinion on these various points.",
                "5. With regard to application of the first criterion, that is to say the length of Wemhoff ’ s detention on remand, the Commission takes into account the period from 9 November 1961 (the date of his arrest) to 9 November 1964 (the date of the opening of the trial before the Regional Court ). According to the Commission the actual length of this detention (three years) seems to warrant the conclusion that it exceeded a \"reasonable\" period.",
                "6. As regards the second criterion mentioned above, the Commission is of the opinion that its application in the present case seems to justify the same conclusion. It remarks that here it has taken into consideration both the possibility of the Applicant ’ s provisional release under Section 26 of the Criminal Code, and the fact that the length of detention has been counted as part of the sentence imposed. The Commission accepts that this last measure constitutes an element comparable to an \"extenuating circumstance\", but states that it in no way changes the distinctive nature of detention on remand which, not being in accordance with Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3), remains a violation of the Convention, even if in the execution of the sentence finally imposed, account has been taken of the period of detention.",
                "7. Application of the third criterion, in the opinion of the Commission, likewise leads to the conclusion that the length of detention was excessive, in view of the prejudicial effects of the detention on the Applicant ’ s family life; his long detention is said to have destroyed his marriage and injured his close relations with his parents.",
                "8. The Commission does not think, as regards the fourth criterion, that the Applicant ’ s conduct contributed substantially to the length of his detention.",
                "9. In evaluating the fifth criterion the Commission considers that the case in question was of very great complexity, not only on account of the nature and number of the financial transactions involved but also because of the number of accused and witnesses who had to be heard and the ramifications of the case both in Germany and abroad. According to the Commission these circumstances support and conclusion that the length of detention was reasonable.",
                "10. The examination of the sixth and seventh criteria does not, in the opinion of the Commission, lead to the conclusion that the criminal proceedings against the Applicant were substantially prolonged through any fault of the authorities.",
                "11. In the light of the overall evaluation of these various criteria, and in consideration of the peculiar circumstances of the case, the Commission attaches particular importance to the actual length of detention and concludes that the Applicant was not brought to trial within a \"reasonable\" time or released pending trial, and that consequently he has been a victim of a violation of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3).",
                "12. It should be added that in the Commission ’ s view the continued detention on remand of the Applicant, ordered by the competent courts because of the danger of flight and suppression of evidence, was lawful within the meaning of Article 5 (1) (c) (art. 5-1-c).",
                "13. The Commission maintains that Article 6 (1) (art. 6-1) poses questions of interpretation similar to those raised by Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3), in particular as regards the \"time\" mentioned in Article 6 (1) (art. 6-1). However, in the opinion of the Commission, the question whether the time was \"reasonable\" for the purposes of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) or of Article 6 (1) (art. 6-1) must be judged differently in the two cases; the former, being intended to safeguard the physical freedom of the individual, requires stricter application than the latter, the object of which is to protect the individual against abnormally long judicial proceedings, irrespective of the question of the actual detention. In the present case, the criminal procedure related to extremely complex facts; it was not unduly prolonged by the German judicial authorities. Therefore, the Commission arrives at the conclusion that even if the period concerned were considered to run from 9 November 1961 until 17 December 1965, Article 6 (1) (art. 6-1) has not been violated in the criminal proceedings against the Applicant.",
                "14. At the hearing of 9 January 1968, the Commission made the the following submissions:",
                "\"May it please the Court to decide:",
                "(1) whether or not Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) of the Convention has been violated by the detention of Wemhoff from 9 November 1961 to 9 November 1964 or any later date;",
                "(2) whether or not Article 6 (1) (art. 6-1) of the Convention has been violated by the duration of the criminal proceedings against Wemhoff between his arrest on 9 November 1961 or any later date and the judgment of the Regional Court of Berlin on 7 April 1965 or any other date.\"",
                "15. The German Government, for its part, remarks that it shares the Commission ’ s opinion as to the absence of any violation of Article 6 (1) (art. 6-1) of the Convention.",
                "16. With regard to the interpretation of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) of the Convention and its application to the present case, the Government believes that the period to be considered is that which the Commission takes into account in its Report, from arrest (9 November 1961) to the opening of the case before the trial court, the Regional Court of Berlin (9 November 1964).",
                "According to the Government it is essential, at least in the present case, not to rely on the French text (\"le droit d ’ être jugée dans un délai raisonnable ou libérée pendant la procédure \"), which could signify a longer period (up to the date of the judgment) than one terminating on the date of the opening of the trial, as suggested by the English version (\"entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial\"). It could therefore lead to a further limitation of the sovereignty of the Contracting States. Moreover, application of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) in the French version would allow the accused to prolong the protection accorded by that provision by making excessive use of procedural devices. The result would be an undue prolongation of proceedings, with the danger that by the time release was possible, the period would no longer be \"reasonable\".",
                "17. In general terms the Government expresses considerable reservations as to the method adopted by the Commission - that of laying down seven \"criteria\" - while admitting that the answer depends on the circumstances of the case. In its opinion, the Commission was not objective, on its strict allocation of the facts to the same criteria, as indeed some of the facts mentioned in relation to one of the criteria would be equally relevant to others.",
                "18. The Government also sets against the Commission ’ s reasoning the following considerations which, in its opinion, demonstrate the absence of any violation of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) in the case of the Applicant.",
                "19. To the first criterion advanced by the Commission, namely, the actual length of detention, the Government raises objections of principle. In its opinion, the adjective \"reasonable\", qualifying the noun \"time\", introduces a relative element; the absolute factor which the actual length of detention represents cannot therefore serve as a criterion for determining whether such a length of time is \"reasonable\". Furthermore, the Government remarks that, in the Commission ’ s view, the Applicant ’ s detention was \"lawful\" for the whole of its length within the meaning of Article 5 (1) (c) (art. 5-1-c) of the Convention; it adds that the Commission, in evaluating the fifth criterion, admits that the complexity of the investigation tends to justify the length of detention. The Government therefore does not see how it is possible to consider as \"unreasonable\" the length of the detention on remand in toto. Moreover, the Commission has not indicated at what moment the detention ceased, in its opinion, to be \"reasonable\".",
                "20. Neither does the Government share the evaluation of the Commission with respect to the second criterion. It emphasises that the opinion of the Commission is based primarily on the possibility, provided in Section 26 of the Criminal Code, of the conditional release of a detained person. However, according to the Government, that Section, whose application depends on the Court ’ s discretion, can operate only when the sentence has become final and, more precisely, from the moment when the convicted person has already served two-thirds of his sentence; it cannot therefore justify the conclusion that the length of detention on remand has been \"unreasonable\". Moreover, the German judicial authorities granted the Applicant conditional freedom when he had served two-thirds of his sentence. This decision, which dates from 20 October 1966, was able to be taken so early because the length of detention on remand had been counted as part of the sentence.",
                "With regard to the Commission ’ s argument that detention on remand represents a distinct situation even where it has been counted in part or in whole against the sentence, the Government stresses the advantages - which are not disputed - of such detention compared with a sentence of imprisonment. It is inferred from this that the length of the detention operated in favour of the Applicant : had it been shorter, Wemhoff would have had to spend longer in penal servitude, which would have made the conditions of his detention appreciably worse."
            ],
            [
                "21. In evaluating the third criterion, the Commission has omitted, in the Government ’ s view, to verify the existence of a causal relation between Wemhoff ’ s detention and the deterioration of his family life. The Government maintains that if Wemhoff had been convicted earlier and thus subjected to a longer period of imprisonment, the effects would have been equally prejudicial - indeed, even graver - for his financial and family position than would those of detention on remand. It is deduced from this that the evaluation of the third criterion by the Commission is not convincing."
            ],
            [
                "22. In the opinion of the Government, the statements of fact arrived at by the Commission in the light of the fourth criterion contain certain lacunae. Certainly, it may be acknowledged that the numerous requests, appeals and other approaches, set out in detail in Appendices VIII and IX of the Commission ’ s Report, do not allow it to be affirmed that Wemhoff generally intended to slow down the course of the proceedings. According to the Government, there can, however, be no doubt that the examination of the case was thereby prolonged. On this point, the Government likewise remarks that the Regional Court of Berlin decided on 19 August 1965, i.e. after conviction, to suspend the detention order subject to the deposit of bail of 100,000 DM. The Court had, in the light of the documents in its possession, discovered that the Applicant had deposited the sum of 100,000 DM in an account opened in the name of his wife in a Swiss bank, and that he had withdrawn this sum when his offences came to light. In the course of the proceedings, the Applicant had given highly contradictory explanations of this transaction; the judicial authorities have not been in a position to discover what Wemhoff had done with the sum of money in question. Whatever the position may be, the Applicant did not take up the offer of bail of the Court.",
                "According to the Government, it should be concluded that the application of the fourth criterion does not authorise the Commission to consider as unreasonable the length of detention on remand."
            ],
            [
                "23. As regards the application of the fifth, sixth and seventh criteria, the Government states that it shares the opinion expressed by the Commission."
            ],
            [
                "24. In dealing with a criminal case as enormous and as complex, both as to the facts and to the law, as is the Wemhoff case, the Government considers that the Commission ’ s method of evaluation does not allow objective determination of whether the length of detention on remand was reasonable or not within the meaning of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) of the Convention or of where in time the line should be drawn between what is \"reasonable\" and what is \"unreasonable\".",
                "In particular, the Government expresses its regret that in following the system of \"criteria\" the Commission has lost sight of the reasons which, in the view of the judicial authorities, made continued detention necessary. The danger that the Applicant would abscond is said to have been a real one throughout his detention, by reason not only of the gravity of the likely sentence and its effect on his civil responsibility but also of his financial malpractices and particularly the unexplained withdrawal of 100,000 DM from an account in his wife ’ s name with a Swiss bank."
            ],
            [
                "25. At the hearing of 9 January 1968, the Government made the following submission:",
                "that the decisions and measures taken by German authorities and courts in the Wemhoff case are compatible with the commitments entered into by the Federal Republic under Articles 5 (3) and 6 (1) (art. 5-3, art. 6-1) of the Convention\".",
                "1. In his Application to the Commission of 9 January 1964, Wemhoff complained, inter alia, that he had been kept in detention since his arrest on 9 November 1961. As this part of the Application was declared admissible by the Commission, the Court is now called upon to decide whether Wemhoff has been the victim of a violation of the Convention in respect of the facts complained of by him.",
                "2. The Court finds that Wemhoff was arrested and detained in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 (1) (c) (art. 5-1-c) for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority, there being a reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence and reasonable grounds for believing that it was necessary to prevent his fleeing after having done so. Nor is it denied that he was informed promptly of the reasons for his arrest or that he was brought promptly before a judge. Consequently, it is evident that there has been no violation in the present case of Article 5 (1) (c) (art. 5-1-c) or the first part of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) of the Convention.",
                "3. The question arises however whether there has been a contravention by the German judicial authorities of two other provisions of the Convention, to wit, the second part of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3), according to which everyone who is arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 (1) (c) (art. 5-1-c) is \"entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial\", it being understood that \"release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial\", and Article 6 (1) (art. 6-1)in so far as it states that \"in the determination of ... any criminal charge against him\", everyone is entitled to a hearing \"... within a reasonable time by a ... tribunal ...\"",
                "A. As regards Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) of the Convention",
                "4. The Court considers that it is of the greatest importance that the scope of this provision should be clearly established. As the word \"reasonable\" applies to the time within which a person is entitled to trial, a purely grammatical interpretation would leave the judicial authorities with a choice between two obligations, that of conducting the proceedings until judgment within a reasonable time or that of releasing the accused pending trial, if necessary against certain guarantees.",
                "5. The Court is quite certain that such an interpretation would not conform to the intention of the High Contracting Parties. It is inconceivable that they should have intended to permit their judicial authorities, at the price of release of the accused, to protract proceedings beyond a reasonable time. This would, moreover, be flatly contrary to the provision in Article 6 (1) (art. 6-1) cited above.",
                "To understand the precise scope of the provision in question, it must be set in its context.",
                "Article 5 (art. 5), which begins with an affirmation of the right of everyone to liberty and security of person, goes on to specify the situations and conditions in which derogations from this principle may be made, in particular with a view to the maintenance of public order, which requires that offences shall be punished. It is thus mainly in the light of the fact of the detention of the person being prosecuted that national courts, possibly followed by the European Court, must determine whether the time that has elapsed, for whatever reason, before judgment is passed on the accused has at some stage exceeded a reasonable limit, that is to say imposed a greater sacrifice than could, in the circumstances of the case, reasonably be expected of a person presumed to be innocent.",
                "In other words, it is the provisional detention of accused persons which must not, according to Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3), be prolonged beyond a reasonable time. This is, moreover, the interpretation given to the text by both the German Government and the Commission.",
                "6. Another question relating to the interpretation of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) raised in the course of the hearing before the Court is that of the period of detention covered by the requirement of a \"reasonable time\". While the Commission had expressed the opinion in its Report that the appearance of the accused before the trial court, which in this case took place on 9 November 1964, should be considered as the end of the detention, the length of which was to be appreciated by it, the President of the Commission, recalling that Wemhoff ’ s detention on remand had continued after his appearance before the Regional Court of Berlin and referring also to the dissenting opinion of a minority within the Commission, requested the Court during the oral proceedings to pronounce upon the lawfulness of the detention from 9 November 1961 until 9 November 1964 or a later date.",
                "The representative of the German Government expounded the reasons which led him to maintain the interpretation, accepted in the Commission ’ s Report, that it is the time of appearance before the trial court that marks the end of the period with which Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) is concerned.",
                "7. The Court cannot accept this restrictive interpretation. It is true that the English text of the Convention allows such an interpretation. The word \"trial\", which appears there on two occasions, refers to the whole of the proceedings before the court, not just their beginning; the words \"entitled to trial\" are not necessarily to be equated with \"entitled to be brought to trial\", although in the context \"pending trial\" seems to require release before the trial considered as a whole, that is, before its opening.",
                "But while the English text permits two interpretations the French version, which is of equal authority, allows only one. According to it the obligation to release an accused person within a reasonable time continues until that person has been\" jugée \", that is, until the day of the judgment that terminates the trial. Moreover, he must be released \"pendant la procédure \", a very broad expression which indubitably covers both the trial and the investigation.",
                "8. Thus confronted with two versions of a treaty which are equally authentic but not exactly the same, the Court must, following established international law precedents, interpret them in a way that will reconcile them as far as possible. Given that it is a law-making treaty, it is also necessary to seek the interpretation that is most appropriate in order to realise the aim and achieve the object of the treaty, not that which would restrict to the greatest possible degree the obligations undertaken by the Parties. It is impossible to see why the protection against unduly long detention on remand which Article 5 (art. 5) seeks to ensure for persons suspected of offences should not continue up to delivery of judgment rather than cease at the moment the trial opens.",
                "9. It remains to ascertain whether the end of the period of detention with which Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) is concerned is the day on which a conviction becomes final or simply that on which the charge is determined, even if only by a court of first instance.",
                "The Court finds for the latter interpretation.",
                "One consideration has appeared to it as decisive, namely that a person convicted at first instance, whether or not he has been detained up to this moment, is in the position provided for by Article 5 (1) (a) (art. 5-1-a) which authorises deprivation of liberty \"after conviction\". This last phrase cannot be interpreted as being restricted to the case of a final conviction, for this would exclude the arrest at the hearing of convicted persons who appeared for trial while still at liberty, whatever remedies are still open to them. Now, such a practice is frequently followed in many Contracting States and it cannot be believed that they intended to renounce it. It cannot be overlooked moreover that the guilt of a person who is detained during the appeal or review proceedings, has been established in the course of a trial conducted in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6). It is immaterial, in this respect, whether detention after conviction took place on the basis of the judgment or - as in the Federal Republic of Germany - by reason of a special decision confirming the order of detention on remand. A person who has cause to complain of the continuation of his detention after conviction because of delay in determining his appeal, cannot avail himself of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) but could possibly allege a disregard of the \"reasonable time\" provided for by Article 6 (1) (art. 6-1).",
                "In this case, therefore, the period whose reasonableness the Court is called upon to consider lasts from 9 November 1961 to 7 April 1965.",
                "10. The reasonableness of an accused person ’ s continued detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. The factors which may be taken into consideration are extremely diverse. Hence, the possibility of wide differences in opinion in the assessment of the reasonableness of a given detention.",
                "11. With a view to reducing the risk and the extent of such differences and as a measure of intellectual discipline, as the President of the Commission put it in his address to the Court, the Commission has devised an approach which consists in defining a set of seven criteria whose application is said to be suitable for arriving at an assessment, whether favourable or otherwise, of the length of the detention imposed. The examination of the various aspects of the case in the light of these criteria is supposed to produce an evaluation of its features as a whole; the relative importance of each criterion may vary according to the circumstances of the case.",
                "12. The Court does not feel able to adopt this method. Before being referred to the organs set up under the Convention to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken therein by the High Contracting Parties, cases of alleged violation of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) must have been the subject of domestic remedies and therefore of reasoned decisions by national judicial authorities. It is for them to mention the circumstances which led them, in the general interest, to consider it necessary to detain a person suspected of an offence but not convicted. Likewise, such a person must, when exercising his remedies, have invoked the reasons which tend to refute the conclusions drawn by the authorities from the facts established by them, as well as other circumstances which told in favour of his release.",
                "It is in the light of these pointers that the Court must judge whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify continued detention are relevant and sufficient to show that detention was not unreasonably prolonged and contrary to Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) of the Convention.",
                "13. The arrest warrant taken out in Wemhoff ’ s name on 9 November 1961 was based on the fear that if he were left at liberty, he would abscond and destroy the evidence against him, in particular by communicating with persons who might be involved (statement of the facts, para. 4). Both of these reasons continued to be invoked until 5 August 1963 in the decisions of the courts rejecting Wemhoff ’ s many applications for release pending trial.",
                "On that date, however, although the investigation had yet to be concluded, the Court of Appeal accepted that there was some doubt as to whether any danger of suppression of evidence still existed, but it considered that the other reason was still operative (statement of the facts, para. 6), and the same reasoning was repeated in later decisions dismissing the Applicant ’ s appeals.",
                "14. With regard to the existence of a danger of suppression of evidence, the Court regards this anxiety of the German courts to be justified in view of the character of the offences of which Wemhoff was suspected and the extreme complexity of the case.",
                "As to the danger of flight, the Court is of opinion that, while the severity of the sentence which the accused may expect in the event of conviction may legitimately be regarded as a factor encouraging him to abscond - though the effect of such fear diminishes as detention continues and, consequently, the balance of the sentence which the accused may expect to have to serve is reduced, nevertheless the possibility of a severe sentence is not sufficient in this respect. The German courts have moreover been careful to support their affirmations that a danger of flight existed by referring at an early stage in the proceedings to certain circumstances relating to the material position and the conduct of the accused (statement of the facts, paras. 6 and 7).",
                "15. The Court wishes however, to emphasise that the concluding words of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) of the Convention show that, when the only remaining reasons for continued detention is the fear that the accused will abscond and thereby subsequently avoid appearing for trial, his release pending trial must be ordered if it is possible to obtain from him guarantees that will ensure such appearance.",
                "It is beyond doubt that, in a financial case such as that in which Wemhoff was involved, an essential factor in such guarantees should have been the deposit by him of bail or the provision of security for a large amount. The positions successively taken up by him on this matter (statement of the facts, paras. 5 and 14) are not such as to suggest that he would have been prepared to furnish such guarantees.",
                "16. In these circumstances the Court could not conclude that there had been any breach of the obligations imposed by Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) unless the length of Wemhoff ’ s provisional detention between 9 November 1961 and 7 April 1965 had been due either (a) to the slowness of the investigation, which was only completed at the end of February 1964, or (b) to the lapse of time which occurred either between the closing of the investigation and the preferment of the indictment (April 1964) or between then and the opening of the trial (9 November 1964) or finally (c) to the length of the trial (which lasted until 7 April 1965). It cannot be doubted that, even when an accused person is reasonably detained during these various periods for reasons of the public interest, there may be a violation of Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3) if, for whatever cause, the proceedings continue for a considerable length of time.",
                "17. On this point, the Court shares the opinion of the Commission that no criticism can be made of the conduct of the case by the judicial authorities. The exceptional length of the investigation and of the trial are justified by the exceptional complexity of the case and by further unavoidable reasons for delay. It should not be overlooked that, while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the efforts of the judges to clarify fully the facts in issue, to give both the defence and the prosecution all facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their cases and to pronounce judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence.",
                "B. As regards Article 6 (1) (art. 6 -1) which gives to everyone the right to have his case heard within a reasonable time",
                "18. The Court is of opinion that the precise aim of this provision in criminal matters is to ensure that accused persons do not have to lie under a charge for too long and that the charge is determined.",
                "There is therefore no doubt that the period to be taken into consideration in applying this provision lasts at least until acquittal or conviction, even if this decision is reached on appeal. There is furthermore no reason why the protection given to the persons concerned against the delays of the court should end at the first hearing in a trial: unwarranted adjournments or excessive delays on the part of trial courts are also to be feared.",
                "19. As regards the beginning of the period to be taken into consideration, the Court is of opinion that it must run from 9 November 1961, the date on which the first charges were levelled against Wemhoff and his arrest was ordered.",
                "It was on that date that his right to a hearing within a reasonable time came into being so that the criminal charges could be determined.",
                "20. The period to be taken into consideration in order to check whether Article 6 (1) (art. 6-1) has been observed thus coincides in Wemhoff ’ s case, for the greater part, with the period of his detention as covered by Article 5 (3) (art. 5-3). The Court therefore, having found no failure on the part of the judicial authorities in their duty of particular diligence under that provision, must a fortiori accept that there has been no contravention of the obligation contained in Article 6 (1) (art. 6-1) of the Convention. Even if the length of the review proceedings (Revision) is to be taken into account, it certainly did not exceed the reasonable limit.",

                "222. The persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the detainee has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the validity of his or her continued detention. But when the national judicial authorities first examine, “promptly” after the arrest, whether to place the arrestee in pre-trial detention, that suspicion no longer suffices, and the authorities must also give other relevant and sufficient grounds to justify the detention. Those other grounds may be a risk of flight, a risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses or of evidence being tampered with, a risk of collusion, a risk of reoffending, or a risk of public disorder and the related need to protect the detainee (see Buzadji, cited above, §§ 87-88 and 101-02, with further references). Those risks must be duly substantiated, and the authorities’ reasoning on those points cannot be abstract, general or stereotyped (see, among other authorities, Letellier v. France, 26 June 1991, § 51, Series A no. 207; Clooth v. Belgium, 12 December 1991, § 44, Series A no. 225; Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, § 63, ECHR 2003-IX (extracts); and Giorgi Nikolaishvili v. Georgia, no. 37048/04, §§ 73 and 76, 13 January 2009)."

                "234. In its subsequent decision, of 7 October 2013, the Kutaisi City Court briefly noted that the applicant had not pointed to any new facts or evidence, but had merely referred to the reasons set out in the initial decision to place the applicant in pre-trial detention. It thus entirely disregarded the passage of time and made it clear that it was for the applicant to show that his detention was no longer justified (see paragraph 51 above). However, under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention it is incumbent on the authorities, rather than the detainee, to establish the persistence of reasons justifying continued pre-trial detention (see Ilijkov, cited above, § 85, and Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, § 64 in fine, 10 March 2009). As already noted, even if such reasons exist when that detention is first imposed, they can by their very nature change over time. The reasons given by the Kutaisi City Court on 7 October 2013 did not therefore suffice to justify the continuation of the applicant’s detention."

In its judgment, delivered on 14 June 2016, the Chamber found that there had been no breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention and no breach of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention with respect to the initial decision to place the applicant in pre-trial detention, but a breach of Article 5 § 3 on account of the lack of any reasons for a decision of 25 September 2013 rejecting a request for release by the applicant.

Secondly, the applicant’s wife had left the country on 21 May 2013, immediately after the applicant had been served with the summons to appear for his interview with the investigator in Kutaisi.

In their written submissions to the Kutaisi City Court they argued that since the applicant had been a member of the Government, by law only the Minister of Justice could institute criminal proceedings against him. Yet he had been arrested by an investigator from the district prosecutor’s office of Western Georgia, and charged by a prosecutor from the same office. His arrest and the criminal proceedings against him were therefore unlawful. Moreover, his arrest had been in breach of Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 144 below). The alleged risk that he would flee was not supported by concrete evidence, and was belied by his repeated appearances before the investigating authorities and his public pledge that he would cooperate with them. Also, he had been out of Georgia many times and had not once tried to flee, including after the opening of the investigation. On the day of his arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning. There had therefore been no need to detain him without a judicial warrant. The alleged risk of his obstructing the investigation was also not specifically borne out. Moreover, the investigation had already lasted several months without any instances of his having interfered with it being reported. Counsel for the applicant also invited the court to take into account the applicant’s achievements in combating crime and police reform during his time in office."

It briefly noted that, according to the materials in the case file, there had been no serious procedural breaches in the applicant’s arrest or the bringing of charges against him. In particular, by law only acting, not former, members of the Government had to be prosecuted by the Minister of Justice rather than a regular prosecutor. The court went on to say that there was enough information to show that there was a reasonable suspicion against the applicant and Mr Z.T. The other pre-requisites for placing the applicant in pre-trial detention were also in place. A number of investigative steps were yet to be carried out, and as was apparent from the prosecution’s request, there was a risk that the applicant would tamper with the evidence or put pressure on witnesses. That was borne out, in particular, by the applicant’s having already tried to put pressure on a witness against him. Another factor which suggested such a risk was that the applicant had for many years held high public office and was still an influential figure in some circles of Georgian society, especially bearing in mind that the charges against him related to his time in office. Many witnesses were former subordinates of his or people under his professional or personal influence. The court also agreed with the prosecution that there was a risk that the applicant would flee. That was borne out, in particular, by his facing serious charges and the possibility of a severe sentence. Lastly, the court found that those two risks could not be averted by a less restrictive measure."

He argued that on a proper reading of the relevant statutory provisions the Minister of Justice alone was competent to prosecute offences committed by anyone in their capacity as member of the Government, not only someone who was such a member at the time when the prosecution was being brought. He also argued that the Kutaisi City Court had erred by not examining in detail the lawfulness of his arrest. That arrest had been in breach of Article 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in particular because on the day of the arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning. It was also hard to believe that the Kutaisi City Court, which had ruled on the prosecution’s request just three or four hours after it had been made, had really studied the evidence said to give rise to a reasonable suspicion against the applicant. There were no facts or information in the case file to suggest that he had committed the offences. The lower court had also expected him to disprove the risks of flight and obstruction of justice alleged by the prosecution rather than require the prosecution to establish those risks. Its finding that the applicant had put pressure on a witness ran counter to the presumption of innocence. He had never called or threatened the head of the Border Police. The Kutaisi City Court had also disregarded the fact that in the months before his arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning several times. Neither that court nor the prosecution had pointed to evidence showing that he would flee abroad. He had travelled out of Georgia many times since the investigation had been opened. The argument that his being an influential figure in some circles suggested that he could influence witnesses made it clear that he was a victim of political persecution. His character showed that there was not even a minimal risk of his fleeing, putting pressure on witnesses or destroying evidence."

Another issue was comments by public officials about ongoing criminal proceedings made in a manner implying that they had some control over the prosecuting authorities (see paragraph 7 of the executive summary). Public officials had also expressed their views on the guilt of some defendants before they had been convicted, which raised an issue with regard to the presumption of innocence (see paragraph 9 of the executive summary). The report also expressed concern about the courts’ failure in some cases to give reasons for their decisions to order pre-trial detention or to reject requests for release, and about the lack of provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure for periodic review of pre-trial detention.

IV, 1977, pp. 190, 226 and 280). In its report to the Committee of Ministers, that Conference described that early version – Article 13 § 2 of its draft – as an application of the theory of “ détournement de pouvoir ”, expressed in English as “misapplication of power” (ibid., pp. 258-59). On 16 August 1950, during the first part of the Consultative Assembly’s second session, when speaking about the ways in which States could restrict the rights enshrined in the Convention, the French delegate, Mr P.-H. Teitgen, referred to the restrictions’ “ légalité interne ”, and drew a parallel with abuses of power by the administration in France, noting that they could be annulled by the Conseil d’État (see Collected edition of the “Travaux Préparatoires” of the European Convention on Human Rights, Martinus Nijhoff, vol.

However, the court went on to examine whether that had been the real aim of the decisions. It took as its starting point the presumption that the authorities had acted in good faith. But it noted four strongly worded public statements by the then president, Mr Hugo Chávez, made shortly before the decisions, that the licence would not be renewed because the television station was hostile to the government. Analysing those statements jointly, the court concluded that the refusal to renew the licence had in reality been meant to silence criticism of the government.

The Georgian courts’ practice of not fixing time-limits for pre-trial detention was in breach of the requirement of legal certainty.

The only one relied on by the authorities in this case was point (e), according to which a warrant can be dispensed with if there is a risk of flight. Article 171 § 3 lays down a further requirement: that the risk cannot be prevented by an alternative measure that is proportionate to the circumstances of the alleged offence and to the characteristics of the accused (see paragraphs 26 and 144 above).

Its power in that respect is, however, subject to inherent limits, because even where the Convention refers to domestic law, it is in the first place for the national authorities to interpret and apply that law (see Winterwerp, § 46; Kemmache (no. 3), § 37; and Lukanov, § 41, all cited above)."

Accordingly, she answered the first question directly and the second one implicitly. The Court does not find that her findings on those two points, which should not be revisited with the benefit of hindsight, were arbitrary or patently in breach of Article 171 §§ 2 and 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Ukraine, no. 6759/11, § 36, 16 April 2015). But that was not the case here. Georgian law provided a clear basis for the applicant’s pre-trial detention and itself limited its duration. Admittedly, in three judgments the Court has said that if a national court does not fix the duration of pre-trial detention, that gives rise to uncertainty even if its maximum is clear from domestic law (see Lutsenko v. Ukraine, no. 6492/11, § 73, 3 July 2012; Gal, cited above, § 37; and Kleutin v. Ukraine, no. 5911/05, § 105, 23 June 2016). But those rulings must be understood in context. In all three cases the national courts had also failed to give even minimally cogent reasons for ordering pre-trial detention. They are similar to several cases in which the Court found a breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention owing to the combination of a lack of any reasons for ordering pre-trial detention and a failure to fix its duration (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, §§ 136-37, ECHR 2005-X (extracts); Vladimir Solovyev v. Russia, no. 2708/02, §§ 95-98, 24 May 2007; Gubkin v. Russia, no. 36941/02, §§ 111-14, 23 April 2009; Arutyunyan v.

Those judgments should not therefore be read as laying down a requirement under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention for the national courts to fix the duration of pre-trial detention in their decisions regardless of how the matter is regulated in domestic law. All that this provision requires is rules that are foreseeable in their application."

Those charges, though leading to a separate decision on 30 May 2013 by the Tbilisi City Court to place him in pre-trial detention (ibid.), did not serve as a basis for keeping him in such detention for longer than nine months, as he was convicted in the criminal case under consideration here less than nine months after his arrest. The second time was on 24 June 2013, one month and five days after he was first placed in pre-trial detention (see paragraph 57 above). Those charges did not, however, become a basis for keeping the applicant in pre-trial detention, as the Tbilisi City Court turned down the prosecution’s request to that effect (ibid.). All those factors, and in particular the relatively short interval between bringing the initial and the subsequent charges, make it hard to see those subsequent charges as an expedient on the part of the prosecuting authorities to circumvent the statutory rule capping the amount of time that the applicant could be kept in pre-trial detention."

The only concrete incident cited in support of that proposition – the applicant’s alleged attempt to intimidate the head of the Border Police on 30 November 2012 – even assuming that it was true, which the applicant denied – had taken place before the case had been opened, and had no connection with the charges in respect of which the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention."

The only new arguments by the prosecution appear to have been that the applicant might have other unidentified fake passports and that such passports had already been used by other former officials to flee abroad, and that the risk of influencing witnesses remained, as the witnesses, though already interviewed, were still due to testify at trial, which was by law the only way of adducing their evidence.

Neither Mr O.P. nor Mr D.D., the main protagonists, had been interviewed in the course of that inquiry.

The need to respect and redress the rights of those complainants had been underlined by the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly and by the European Union Special Adviser on Constitutional and Legal Reform and Human Rights in Georgia. An International Prosecution Advisory Panel, set up in 2014 at the initiative of Georgia’s Chief Public Prosecutor to review the materials in high-profile cases processed by the Georgian prosecuting authorities and consisting of three foreign criminal-justice professionals, had found the evidence in those cases sufficient to justify prosecution. This showed that the applicant’s arrest and pre-trial detention had only been intended to bring him before a competent legal authority on a reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence. Since there had been no breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, as confirmed by the Chamber, there was no room for a breach of Article 18 either. In fact, this was the only case in which the Court had found a violation of Article 18 in conjunction with Article 5 § 1 without having first found a violation of the latter – a possibility which had previously only been envisaged theoretically. In all previous cases, if the Court had found no breach of the Article in conjunction with which Article 18 had been pleaded, it had either not examined the complaint under Article 18 on the merits or had found no violation of that provision. The case at hand was also the only one in which the underlying facts continued to be disputed between the parties."

All the facts to which the applicant referred in support of that assertion were disputed rather than clearly established, and hence could not form the basis of inferences. Apart from the statement of Ms L.M. in May 2014, there was no evidence corroborating the allegation that the applicant had been covertly taken to the Chief Public Prosecutor. That allegation, first voiced three days after the alleged incident, was not proof of its reality. It had been examined twice, first during the inquiry by the Ministry of Prisons’ General Inspectorate and again in the course of the investigation by the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office. The ample evidence gathered in those procedures – witness statements, video footage and prison records – had shown the applicant’s allegation to be false.",

Mr Kamma had been detained on extortion charges, and the police had used his period in custody to question him about his alleged involvement in a murder. The Commission established two points which the Court has since confirmed (see paragraph 271 below): (a) although Article 18 cannot apply alone, it can be breached even if there is no violation of the Article in conjunction with which it is applied, and (b) it can only be contravened if the Convention right which has been interfered with is subject to restrictions – that is, is qualified rather than absolute. The Commission found no breach, saying that the police had been entitled to proceed as they had, and that the detention had not prejudiced Mr Kamma’s position in the murder case (ibid., pp. 10 ‑ 12)."

First, it did not explain what proof would be required to sustain an allegation that a restriction had been applied for an ulterior purpose. In Gusinskiy itself, direct proof flowed from a written agreement, endorsed by a government minister, linking the dropping of the charges against Mr Gusinskiy to the sale of his company, and from the terms of the decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against him, which referred to that agreement; also, the respondent Government had not sought to deny that link (ibid., § 75). Secondly, the judgment did not clearly explain what the position was when, as had happened in that case, and as often happens in practice, there was a plurality of purposes, that is, when a restriction pursued both a purpose prescribed by the Convention and an ulterior one; it merely stated that since Mr Gusinskiy’s right to liberty had been restricted not only for the purpose prescribed under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention but also for other reasons, there had been a breach of Article 18 (ibid., §§ 77-78)."

The Court based that finding on the fact that the materials in the case could not lead an objective observer reasonably to believe that Mr Cebotari could have committed the offence in relation to which he had been detained, although it was also influenced by the context of the case (ibid., §§ 52-53)."

Mr Khodorkovskiy, a wealthy businessman who was also active in politics, complained that the real aims of a criminal case against him and his related pre-trial detention were to take him out of the public arena and enable the State to appropriate the assets of his company, Yukos, one of the biggest oil producers in Russia (ibid., §§ 249 and 251). The Court found no breach of Article 18. It started from the general assumption that the High Contracting States’ authorities acted in good faith, and held that it could only be rebutted if applicants “convincingly show[ed] that the real aim of the authorities [had] not [been] the same as that proclaimed (or as [could] be reasonably inferred from the context)” (ibid., § 255). In relation to such allegations, the Court “applie[d] a very exacting standard of proof”, and the burden of proof remained on the applicant throughout the proceedings (ibid., § 256). The Court then found that the authorities’ perception of Mr Khodorkovskiy as a serious political opponent and the benefit accruing to a State-owned company as a result of Yukos’s demise were not enough to establish a breach of Article 18 because the criminal prosecution of anyone with such a high profile would benefit his opponents, and because the charges against Mr Khodorkovskiy had been genuine (ibid., §§ 257-58). The opinions of others – political institutions, non-governmental organisations or public figures – regarding the political motivation behind the case against him were not evidence in the legal sense (ibid., § 259). The rulings of courts which had refused to extradite associates of his to Russia, or had denied legal assistance to, issued injunctions against, or made awards against the Russian authorities in Yukos-related cases, although a strong argument, were not sufficient because the evidence and arguments before those courts could have differed from those before the Court, and because, in any event, the standard of proof applied by the Court in cases under Article 18 was very high and could be different from those applied domestically. The claim that the authorities had acted in bad faith throughout the entire criminal proceedings required “incontrovertible and direct proof”, which, in contrast to Gusinskiy, was lacking (ibid., § 260)."

It again held that such finding could only be based on “incontrovertible and direct proof” adduced by the applicant (ibid., § 663). With reference to its conclusions regarding Yukos’s substantive complaints, it found that the authorities had legitimately acted to counter tax evasion and that it was for the applicant company to show that in doing so they had had an improper purpose (ibid., § 664). As in Khodorkovskiy, the Court held that the opinions of others on the political reasons behind the case against Yukos were of little evidentiary value for the purposes of Article 18. Since there was no evidence of further defects in the tax proceedings, it could not conclude that the authorities had misused them to destroy Yukos and take control of its assets (ibid., § 665)."

It focused instead on specific aspects of those proceedings (see Lutsenko, §§ 104 and 108, and Tymoshenko, § 298, both cited above). In Lutsenko this was the arguments in the investigator’s request to place Mr Lutsenko in pre-trial detention that, by talking to the media, he was trying to distort public opinion, discredit the prosecuting authorities and influence his upcoming trial. For the Court, that showed that the detention had pursued a reason not envisaged by Article 5 § 1 (c) – to punish Mr Lutsenko for publicly disputing the charges against him (see Lutsenko, cited above, §§ 26 and 108-09). In Tymoshenko this was statements in the prosecution’s request to place Ms Tymoshenko in pre-trial detention and in the corresponding court order which showed that the purpose had been to punish her for disrespect towards the court and perceived obstructive conduct during hearings (see Tymoshenko, cited above, §§ 30, 31 and 299)."

It did not accept that the whole criminal case against the applicants had been for an ulterior purpose, an allegation which the Court described as “sweeping” and contrasted with allegations about specific episodes in such proceedings. Even if there had been a mixed intent behind that case, the ulterior purpose was not fundamental or decisive, as the case concerned serious accusations relating to common criminal offences unrelated to the applicants’ political activities and had a “healthy core” (ibid., §§ 904-08)."

The cases concerned the pre-trial detention of, respectively, an opposition politician and blogger critical of the Government, and that of a well-known human-rights activist.

In itself, that was not enough to find a breach of Article 18, but proof of ulterior purpose – to silence or punish the applicant in the first case for criticising the authorities and spreading information that they were trying to suppress, and the applicant in the second case for his human-rights activities – derived from a juxtaposition of the lack of suspicion with contextual factors. In the first case, these were a close chronological correlation between the applicant’s blog entries, the authorities’ public statement denouncing them, the charges, and the arrest (see Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, §§ 141-43). In the second case, they were the increasingly harsh regulation of non-governmental organisations and their funding in Azerbaijan, allegations by officials and the pro-government media that activists such as the applicant were a “fifth column”, and the contemporaneous detention of other such activists (see Rasul Jafarov, cited above, §§ 156-62).",

Moreover, an approach that simply focuses on proof of bad faith does not sit well with that taken by the Court with respect to the restriction clauses in the Convention, which Article 18 is intended to complement. For example, in examining whether an interference with the rights guaranteed by Articles 8 to 11 is “necessary in a democratic society” for the pursuit of a legitimate aim, the Court always insists that its supervision is not limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State’s authorities have exercised their discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith (see, for example, The Sunday Times (no. 1), cited above, § 59; Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, § 68, Series A no. 130; and Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 196 (iii), ECHR 2015 (extracts)).

This rule derives both from its wording, which complements that of clauses such as, for example, the second sentence of Article 5 § 1 and the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, which permit restrictions to those rights and freedoms, and from its place in the Convention at the end of Section I, which contains the Articles that define and qualify those rights and freedoms."

As already noted, it complements the clauses which provide for restrictions of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention. Its wording (“shall not be applied for any purpose other than”) matches closely the wording of those clauses (for example, Article 5 § 1, second sentence: “save in the following cases”; Article 8 § 2: “no interference ... except such as ... is necessary in the interests of”; Article 9 § 2: “be subject only to such limitations as ... are necessary ... in the interests of”; and Article 11 § 2: “No restrictions ... other than such as ... are necessary ... in the interests of”). The similarity is even clearer in the French text (Article 18: “ que dans le but ”; Article 5 § 1: “ sauf dans les cas suivants ”; Article 8 § 2: “ Il ne peut y avoir ingérence ... que pour autant que ”; Article 9 § 2: “ d’autres restrictions que celle qui ”; and Article 11 § 2: “ ne peut faire l’objet d’autres restrictions que celles qui ”). Since the Convention must be interpreted in a way which promotes harmony between its provisions (see, among other authorities, Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, § 68, Series A no. 28; Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 48, ECHR 2005-X; and A and B v. Norway [GC], nos. 24130/11 and 29758/11, § 133, ECHR 2016), and since, when using the same terms, its different provisions must normally be taken to refer to the same concept (see Perinçek, cited above, §§ 134 and 146, with further references), in interpreting Article 18 the Court must thus take into account its usual approach to those restriction clauses."

In such situations, the mere presence of a purpose which does not fall within the respective restriction clause cannot of itself give rise to a breach of Article 18. There is a considerable difference between cases in which the prescribed purpose was the one that truly actuated the authorities, though they also wanted to gain some other advantage, and cases in which the prescribed purpose, while present, was in reality simply a cover enabling the authorities to attain an extraneous purpose, which was the overriding focus of their efforts. Holding that the presence of any other purpose by itself contravenes Article 18 would not do justice to that fundamental difference, and would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of Article 18, which is to prohibit the misuse of power. Indeed, it could mean that each time the Court excludes an aim or a ground pleaded by the Government under a substantive provision of the Convention, it must find a breach of Article 18, because the Government’s pleadings would be proof that the authorities pursued not only the purpose that the Court accepted as legitimate, but also another one."

As early as in Artico v. Italy (13 May 1980, § 30, Series A no. 37) the Court stated that that was the general position not only in inter-State cases but also in cases deriving from individual applications. It has since then relied on the concept of burden of proof in certain particular contexts. On a number of occasions, it has recognised that a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio, that is that the burden of proof in relation to an allegation lies on the party which makes it, is not possible, notably in instances when this has been justified by the specific evidentiary difficulties faced by the applicants (see, for example, Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 68, in relation to the exhaustion of domestic remedies; Baka, cited above, §§ 143 in fine and 149, and the examples cited therein, in relation to various substantive Articles of the Convention; and J.K. and Others v.

Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, § 202, ECHR 2013, with further references). It can also combine such inferences with contextual factors.

In Nachova and Others (cited above, § 147), the Court further clarified that point, saying that when assessing evidence it is not bound by formulae and adopts the conclusions supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties’ submissions. It has also stated that it is sensitive to any potential evidentiary difficulties encountered by a party. The Court has consistently adhered to that position, applying it to complaints under various Articles of the Convention (see Baka, cited above, § 143, with further references)."

Reports or statements by international observers, non-governmental organisations or the media, or the decisions of other national or international courts are often taken into account to, in particular, shed light on the facts, or to corroborate findings made by the Court (see Baka, cited above, § 148).",

It is also true that, when it comes to allegations of ulterior purpose behind a criminal prosecution, it is hard to divorce the pre-trial detention from the criminal proceedings (see Lutsenko, § 108; Tymoshenko, § 298; and Tchankotadze, § 114, all cited above). Yet, there is no right as such under the Convention not to be criminally prosecuted (see I.J.L. and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 29522/95 and 2 others, § 101, ECHR 2000-IX; Patsuria v.

The mere fact that a politician is criminally prosecuted, even during an electoral campaign, is not automatically in breach of his or her right to run for office (see Uspaskich v. Lithuania, no. 14737/08, §§ 90-100, 20 December 2016).

No such evidence has been put forward in this case. On the contrary, it appears that in many cases against former UNM officials – including the case against the applicant’s co ‑ accused, Mr Z.T. – the courts turned down the prosecution’s requests to impose pre-trial detention, and that, as of September 2013, fourteen out of the thirty-five former high officials from UNM who had been charged with criminal offences were in pre-trial detention and fourteen others had been released on bail (see paragraphs 39, 131 and 134 above).

First, although it placed the applicant in pre-trial detention, the Kutaisi City Court ordered the release on bail of his co-accused, Mr Z.T., who was also a prominent UNM figure.

It is sensitive to its subsidiary role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a primary finder of fact. Yet, when faced with allegations of such a serious nature as those made by the applicant, who at the relevant time was in the authorities’ custody, it must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny, even if – as here – domestic investigations have taken place.

The fact that the applicant only voiced his allegations three days after the said meeting does not weaken their credibility.

It is true that Mr G.Ts.’s and Mr I.P.’s statements are hearsay and that their reliability may be open to question in view, in particular, of the positions of subordination to the applicant that the two of them had previously held (see paragraph 96 above). But in Mr G.Ts.’s case that factor was somewhat offset by the fact that the applicant had dismissed him from his post and had caused him to be detained (see paragraph 108 in fine above).

The authorities do not appear to have attempted to verify those statements by objective means, for example by obtaining the video recording from the pre-trial hearing during which Mr G.G. was said to have spoken about his role in the events of 14 December 2013, or third-party evidence about Mr G.G.’s whereabouts in the early hours of 14 December 2013.

Its reliability is somewhat weakened by Mr K.T.’s previous position of subordination to the applicant, and much further still by the fact that a physical examination carried out by the investigators showed that the prison corridor could not be observed from Mr K.T.’s cell because there was no gap in the door, by Mr K.T.’s reluctance to take part in the ensuing experiment which was supposed to test that point, and by the conflicting statements of all Mr K.T.’s cellmates (see paragraphs 113-115 above)."

Then, at that time, December 2013, Mr Saakashvili, who has since then become the target of several criminal investigations, had just left Georgia following the end of his term of office as President (see paragraphs 13 and 126 above). For its part, the investigation into Mr Zhvania’s death, which had been renewed in late 2012, had apparently not made significant progress (see paragraph 61 above). It is clear that both topics were of considerable importance for the authorities. The Government’s statement at the hearing before the Grand Chamber that there was still a “huge question” for the applicant to answer in relation to Mr Zhvania’s death is particularly telling in that regard (see paragraph 61 above). At the same time, the prosecuting authorities had the power to drop all charges against the applicant at any point without judicial control, with the consequence that the courts would have had to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him (see paragraph 153 above), and thus cause him to be released from pre-trial detention, as promised to him by the Chief Public Prosecutor, Mr O.P., if he provided the requested information. The weight which the authorities attached to the matter is also apparent from the way in which the entire incident on 14 December 2013 unfolded and was later commented upon and investigated. The applicant was taken to meet with Mr O.P., who had been appointed to the post three weeks previously (see paragraph 60 above), in a covert and apparently irregular manner, in a clandestine operation carried out in the middle of the night. The authorities’ initial reaction to the applicant’s allegations in that respect was to issue firm denials (see paragraphs 68 and 70 above), and the ensuing inquiry and investigation were, as already noted, marred by a series of omissions from which it can be inferred that the authorities were eager that the matter should not come to light. Thus, the main protagonists, Mr O.P. and Mr D.D., were not interviewed during the inquiry but only in the course of the investigation, in September 2016, nearly three years after the events, and the crucial evidence in the case – the footage from the prison surveillance cameras – was not recovered."

It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, § 43). In the present case the decisions of the domestic authorities give no reasons why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicant in support of his applications for release, they considered the risk of his absconding to be decisive. In this connection the Court cannot overlook the applicant ’ s submission that he was granted permission to visit his parents – not just in another town but in another state – barely three months after the district court had held for the last time that holding him in custody had been the only certain means to prevent him from absconding. A further permit was granted to him in August 2000, a mere six months after his release. The granting of such permits demonstrates that the domestic authorities considered the flight risk to be negligible. As no new factors reducing such risk appear to have come into being between the applicant ’ s release and the issuing of the permits, the Court considers that during the final phase of the applicant ’ s detention the authorities cannot have had reasonable grounds to keep him in custody in order to prevent his absconding."

In this sense, the reasons given in the decisions of the Smolninskiy District Court of 26 July and 30 December 1999, cited by way of example, were “general and abstract”. The district court did not take notice of the fact that the applicant had had a permanent residence and family ties, and no criminal record. Moreover, on 29 February 2000 the St. Petersburg City Court ordered the applicant ’ s release from custody, having found that there was no reason to believe that the applicant would abscond or interfere with the establishment of the truth. The applicant pointed out that this decision had been grounded on the very same circumstances which the district court had previously relied upon to reach the opposite conclusions. Furthermore, only one month after his release against the undertaking not to leave the town, the investigator granted him permission to visit his parents in the Ukraine, which showed that the authorities had no reasons to fear his absconding.

This must be assessed in each case according to its special features, the reasons given in the domestic decisions and the well-documented facts mentioned by the applicant in his applications for release. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], cited above, § 152)."

                "99. It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must, paying due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of the above-mentioned requirement of public interest justifying a departure from the rule in Article 5, and must set them out in their decisions on the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the well-documented facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3 (see Muller v. France, judgment of 17 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, p. 388, § 35). The arguments for and against release must not be “general and abstract” (see Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, § 63, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX). Furthermore, where the law provides for a presumption in respect of factors relevant to the grounds for continued detention, the existence of the concrete facts outweighing the rule of respect for individual liberty must be convincingly demonstrated (see Ilijkov v.

In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were “relevant” and “sufficient”, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings (see, among others, I.A. v.

However, even though the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending, the Court recalls that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v.

However, he remained in custody even after his conviction had been quashed on appeal. On 3 June 1999 the St. Petersburg City Court admitted that the proceedings had been excessively long, but nevertheless it prolonged the applicant ’ s detention for an indefinite period pending new trial ( see paragraph 31 above)."

In fact, whilst in the first trial only nine witnesses had been heard, in the second round of proceedings which began almost a year after the applicant ’ s release, the district court took evidence from 33 witnesses. It is not alleged that the applicant attempted to exercise pressure on those called to the witness stand in the course of the renewed proceedings and, in any event, these proceedings were eventually discontinued, in part due to the prosecution ’ s abandoning of the charges and, as to the rest, as being time-barred."

It falls to them to examine all the facts arguing for or against detention and set them out in their decisions (see Nikolov v. Bulgaria, no. 38884/97, § 74, 30 January 2003; Labita v. Italy, cited above, § 152).

                "106. As regards the existence of the risk of absconding, the Court recalls that such a danger cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the sentence faced. It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, § 43). In the present case the decisions of the domestic authorities give no reasons why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicant in support of his applications for release, they considered the risk of his absconding to be decisive. In this connection the Court cannot overlook the applicant ’ s submission that he was granted permission to visit his parents – not just in another town but in another state – barely three months after the district court had held for the last time that holding him in custody had been the only certain means to prevent him from absconding. A further permit was granted to him in August 2000, a mere six months after his release. The granting of such permits demonstrates that the domestic authorities considered the flight risk to be negligible. As no new factors reducing such risk appear to have come into being between the applicant ’ s release and the issuing of the permits, the Court considers that during the final phase of the applicant ’ s detention the authorities cannot have had reasonable grounds to keep him in custody in order to prevent his absconding."

They did not describe in detail the applicant ’ s personal situation beyond a mere reference to his “personality” and were not accompanied with any explanation as to what his personality actually was and why it made his detention necessary. In fact, it was not until 29 February 2000 that the city court, when ordering the applicant ’ s release from custody, took stock of the applicant ’ s personal circumstances, such as his permanent residence and family ties, positive work references and the absence of a criminal record, which mitigated, if not removed, the risk of his absconding or interfering with the administration of justice. The Court notes that this decision appears to be the first one in the four years of the applicant ’ s detention when the domestic courts addressed the arguments concerning his personal situation, which he repeatedly – and unsuccessfully – raised in his appeals against the prolonged detention. This is all the more remarkable, taking into account that these arguments referred to facts of which the domestic authorities had had full knowledge from the first days of the proceedings."

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to the detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance ( Navarra v.

Even though the applicant can be criticised for his difficult behaviour towards the presiding judge and witnesses at the hearings in September and December 1997, these events occurred before the beginning of the period in question. It does not appear that during the second trial the applicant went beyond the limits of legitimate defence or lodged any frivolous petitions with the courts.",

The repeated failures of the domestic authorities to respect the rights of the defence and, in particular, the applicant ’ s right to study the case-file lay at the origin of the longest delays in the proceedings. On 11 November 1998, 26 July and 30 December 1999, 10 January 2001 the courts determined that they could not proceed with examination of the case because the applicant had not been given sufficient time to access the file or because other procedural violations had been established. As a consequence, the proceedings were adjourned for periods ranging from three to nine months. The Court considers that it is unimportant whether the procedural defect that prompted the adjournment had been identified by the prosecution, by the applicant or by the court itself and whether the applicant consented to the adjournment, it being incumbent on the State authorities to organise the investigation in such a way so as to comply with time-limits, without prejudicing the rights of defence."

Although a criminal case had been opened barely a year after the offences imputed to the applicant had been last committed, ten years later the prosecution became time-barred in respect of most charges and, as to the remainder, the prosecutor dropped the charges because evidence sufficient for securing a conviction had not been collected. It is also remarkable that, in dismissing the applicant ’ s complaint about a violation of the “reasonable time” requirement, on 18 May 2002 the district court explained the reasonableness of the overall duration of the investigation by reference to, in particular, “the remoteness [in time] of the criminal offence”, disregarding the fact that the investigation had been pending throughout all that time."

As regards the risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses or of the obstruction of the proceedings by other unlawful means, the Court cannot accept that they constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the entire period of the applicant's detention. Firstly, it notes that the judicial authorities appeared to presume the risk of pressure on witnesses or the obstruction of the proceedings based on the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on the applicant and on the nature of the offences in question. It notes however that the relevant decisions did not put forward any argument capable of showing that these fears were well-founded. The Court considers that such a generally formulated risk flowing from the nature of the offences with which the applicant had been charged may possibly be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings. Nevertheless, in the absence of any other factor capable of showing that the risk relied on actually existed, the Court cannot accept those grounds as a justification for holding the applicant in custody for the entire relevant period."

The persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. The Court must then establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were “relevant” and “sufficient”, the Court must also be satisfied that the national authorities displayed “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings. The complexity and special characteristics of the investigation are factors to be considered in this respect (see, for example, Scott v. Spain, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2399-2400, § 74, and I.A. v. France, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, p. 2978, § 102).",

                "40. The Court accepts that the reasonable suspicion against the applicant of having committed the serious offences may initially have warranted his detention. In addition, it considers that the authorities were faced with a difficult task of determining the facts and the degree of alleged responsibility of each of the defendants, who had been charged with acting in an organised criminal group. In these circumstances, the Court also accepts that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources together with the complexity of the investigation, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the applicant's detention during the time necessary to terminate the investigation, to draw the bill of indictment and to hear evidence from the accused."

In particular, even if the Court were to accept that the defendants, including the applicant, had contributed to certain delays during the trial by making use of their procedural rights, the Court considers that those grounds could not justify the entire period of the applicant's detention. In that connection, the Court underlines that the Government did not refer to any particular act of obstruction of the trial by the applicant. It must then establish whether the other grounds advanced by the judicial authorities were “relevant” and “sufficient” to continue to justify the deprivation of liberty."

The Court notes that the judicial authorities also relied on the likelihood that a severe sentence might have been imposed on the applicant given the serious nature of the offences at issue (see paragraphs 5 and 11 above ). In this respect, the Court recalls that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such an initial risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, §§ 80-81, 26 July 2001 ). In the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that the severity of the anticipated penalty alone, or in conjunction with the other grounds relied on by the authorities, cannot constitute a “relevant and sufficient ground” for holding the applicant in detention for an extremely long period of over 6 years and 3 months."

As regards the risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses or of the obstruction of the proceedings by other unlawful means, the Court cannot accept that they constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the entire period of the applicant's detention. Firstly, it notes that the judicial authorities appeared to presume the risk of pressure on witnesses or the obstruction of the proceedings based on the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on the applicant and on the nature of the offences in question. It notes however that the relevant decisions did not put forward any argument capable of showing that these fears were well-founded. The Court considers that such a generally formulated risk flowing from the nature of the offences with which the applicant had been charged may possibly be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings. Nevertheless, in the absence of any other factor capable of showing that the risk relied on actually existed, the Court cannot accept those grounds as a justification for holding the applicant in custody for the entire relevant period."

In that regard the Court would also point out that, although such a potential danger may exist where an accused is charged with a serious offence and where the sentence faced is a long term of imprisonment, the degree of that risk cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the offence and anticipated sentence (see Muller v.

This was because the burglaries and thefts had been committed by the same persons or the joinder of the cases had been considered necessary for the better conduct of the preliminary investigation and for speeding up the investigation. The charges against the applicant had been investigated within a criminal case which had included 39 counts of burglary and theft from different kiosks and numerous other episodes of burglaries and thefts.

When the investigator had come to the conclusion that it had been possible to deal with the charges against the applicant separately, his case had been separated on 12 February 1999. Even if the applicant's case on its own had not been particularly complex, it had to be assessed in the context of the complex criminal case of which it was a part in the beginning of the investigation. The complexity of the whole criminal case and the different steps taken by the investigator, especially the separation of the applicant's case from the voluminous one, demonstrated that the authorities had taken all necessary steps in order to speed up the proceedings. The Government also pointed out that, even assuming that certain delays in the preliminary investigation could have occurred for the above reasons, the proceedings after the separation of the cases had been conducted with exceptional speed. On the whole, the Government were of the opinion that the authorities had displayed special diligence as required in the handling of criminal proceedings against remand persons and, therefore, Article 5 § 3 had not been violated."

The reasonableness of the detention of an accused has to be assessed in each individual case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty laid down in Article 5 of the Convention.",

It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions, and any well-documented facts stated by the applicant in his appeals, that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3 (see, for example, Labita v.

The Court must then establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were “relevant” and “sufficient”, the Court must also be satisfied that the national authorities displayed “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings. The complexity and special characteristics of the investigation are factors to be considered in this respect (see, for example, Scott v. Spain, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2399-2400, § 74, and I.A. v. France, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, p. 2978, § 102)."

No more elaborate reasons were put forward to justify the need for the protracted detention of the applicant.",
                "The Court finds that the mere absence of a fixed residence does not give rise to a danger of flight. Nor can it be concluded from the lack of a job or a family that a person is inclined to commit new offences. The Court has doubts as to whether the grounds for the applicant's detention, as reflected in the perfunctorily reasoned court orders, retained their sufficiency for the whole period of the pre-trial detention.",

Austria, judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, p. 3, § 3, and Iłowiecki v. Poland, no. 27504/95, § 63, 4 October 2001). In the present case the authorities did not envisage any other guarantees that the applicant would appear for trial, although he repeatedly objected to his continued detention, requesting that it be replaced by another preventive measure – a prohibition on leaving a place of residence where he asserted that he could live with his brother."

The charges against the applicant were not so complex and voluminous as to justify the length of the pre-trial investigation. Indeed, the Government conceded that the applicant's case was not necessarily particularly complex and that certain delays could have occurred during the preliminary investigation (see paragraph 60 above). The Court recalls that the applicant was charged with five counts of burglary and inducement of minors to commit criminal offences.

It should also be noted that as regards two of the counts of burglary the applicant was caught in the act by witnesses who then took him to the police.

Finally, she sought a declaration that section 29(4) of the 1983 Act was incompatible with Article 5 § 1 of the Convention as it authorised the indefinite detention of a patient admitted under section 2 of the Act where an application had been made to displace the patient ’ s nearest relative under section 29(1) for the purposes of making a guardianship application."

On the first declaration sought, the trial judge found that the right “to take proceedings” in Article 5 § 4 had to be contrasted with the right to be “brought” before a judicial authority under Article 5 § 3. He concluded:",
                "“[A] right ‘ to take proceedings ’ does not mean a right of automatic review or right to be brought before a judicial authority, irrespective of whether an application is made.",
                "27. The claimant [the applicant] has been unable to point to any cases to support the view that article 5(4) called for an automatic review. Indeed, in X v. United Kingdom (1981) 4 EHRR 188, it was decided by the Strasbourg Court that where a patient does not have a right of automatic [re]view, article 5(4) then only requires the State to ensure that the detained person is entitled ‘ to take proceedings at reasonable intervals before a court to put in issue the “ lawfulness ” [within the meaning of the Convention] of his detention whether that detention was ordered by a civil or criminal court or by some other authority ’ [at paragraph 52]. This passage indicates that a State need not provide automatic periodic reviews so long as the detained person is entitled himself to take proceedings to review the lawfulness of his detention at reasonable intervals. This reinforces my view that article 5(4) does not require there to be an automatic review of the lawfulness of a patient ’ s detention but it will be satisfied if the detainee can institute proceedings to challenge the lawfulness of his detention.",
                "28. More recently, it was explained by the Strasbourg Court that the court ’ s case law on Article 5 (4) establishes that this right that:-",
                "‘ a person of unsound mind who is compulsorily confined for an indefinite or a lengthy period is in principle entitled, at any rate where there is no automatic periodic review of a judicial character, to take proceedings “at reasonable intervals” before a court to put in issue the “lawfulness”- within the meaning of the Convention - of his detention ’ ( Megyeri v. Germany (1992) 15 EHRR 584, 592 [22(a)].",
                "29. This shows that there are two answers to the claimant ’ s complaint apart from the fact that the claimant has no right to an automatic reference to a Tribunal. First, the deprivation of liberty in this case was neither ‘ indefinite or lengthy ’ as it arose under section 2 of the 1983 Act, which meant that it was for the relatively short period of 28 days so as to enable an assessment to be made. Significantly, unless by the end of that period, the patient had become liable to be detained under some other provision of the 1983 Act, section 2(4) of the 1983 Act requires that he must be discharged. Second, in any event, within that period, as I have explained, the patient is entitled to apply for a discharge to the Mental Health Review Tribunal and this would constitute a right ‘ to take proceedings ’. Thus, the claimant is not entitled to her first declaration.”"
            ],
            [
                "22. In respect of the second declaration sought, the trial judge first considered whether Article 5 § 4 required automatic review of the lawfulness of a patient ’ s detention where the patient lacked capacity to make her own application for a review of the lawfulness of her detention. He considered this Court ’ s decision in Megyeri v. Germany, judgment of 12 May 1992, Series A no. 237 ‑ A, § 22, in particular the need for special procedural safeguards to protect the interests of persons who, on account of their mental disabilities, are not fully capable of acting for themselves and accepted that section 67 of the 1983 Act (providing for the Secretary of State to refer cases to the Mental Health Review Tribunal) did not itself provide adequate safeguards. First, the Secretary of State could only exercise his power after a request had been made to him to exercise such a power. Where a patient lacked capacity and had nobody to make the request for him or her, the power would not be exercised. Second, relying on Benjamin and Wilson v. the United Kingdom, no. 28212/95, §§ 33 and 36, 26 September 2002, he found the right of a patient under Article 5 § 4 could not be dependent upon the exercise of another power by a member of the Executive which might or might not be exercised in the patient ’ s favour. However, the trial judge was satisfied that there were adequate procedural safeguards in place for the protection of patients detained under section 2 of the 1983 Act. He ruled that it was:",
                "“[O]f critical importance that in this case the claimant was subject to section 2 detention, which for two reasons by its nature is of an inherently short duration. First, as I have explained, the patient could apply to the Tribunal within the first 14 days of his or her detention pursuant to section 66(1) (a) and (2) (a) of the 1983 Act. Second, it is more important that section 2 (4) of the 1983 Act requires that the patient be released at the end of the 28 day period, regardless of whether any application has been made to the Tribunal in the meantime unless a different legal basis for the patient ’ s continuing detention has since emerged.",
                "36. I therefore agree with [counsel for the Secretary of State] that this complaint is flawed by the procedural safeguard of automatic release at the end of the period, which is a better safeguard for a patient subject to a section 2 detention than ‘ an automatic review ’. Therefore, I am unable to accept [Counsel for the applicant ’ s] complaint that Article 5(4) requires that there should be an automatic review for a patient, who lacks the capacity to make his own application.”"
            ],
            [
                "23. The trial judge also considered whether Article 5 § 4 required that a patient should have a right for the lawfulness of her detention to be reviewed where she was admitted to hospital under section 2 of the 1983 Act; her nearest relative had exercised her power of discharge under section 23 of the 1983 Act; a barring order had been issued under section 25 of the Act; and Social Services had applied to displace the relative under section 29 with a view to making a guardianship order. The judge found that the issue was whether section 29 (4) – which authorises the indefinite detention of a patient admitted and detained under section 2 of the Act while the County Court considered an application to displace a nearest relative – infringed Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. The trial judge found as follows:",
                "“Section 29(1) of the 1983 Act is the procedure by which the nearest relative is displaced but it is important to stress that it requires an application to the County Court. The duty of the County Court, in common with any other public body involved in a section 29 application, is to ensure that the application respects the article 5 rights of the patient. Section 3(1) of the HRA states that ‘ so far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with Convention rights ’. The rights in article 5 are Convention rights and so the County Court is obliged to deal with section 29 applications speedily. Indeed, section 6 of the HRA specifically states that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with the Convention. It therefore follows that the County Court is obliged to control the proceedings so as to ensure that a patient is not detained for a period which is indefinite or lengthy... If delay does occur in the County Court proceedings so that a patient ’ s article 5(4) rights were infringed, this would be a result of a breach by the County Court in its duties under sections 6(1) and 3(1) of the 1998 Act and not because of any incompatibility between the 1983 Act and the Convention.”"
            ],
            [
                "24. In respect of the third declaration sought – that section 29(4) of the 1983 Act was incompatible with Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, insofar as it authorised the indefinite detention of a patient admitted under section 2 of the Act where an application had been made to displace the patient ’ s nearest relative under section 29(1) for the purposes of making a guardianship application – the trial judge found the essence of the applicant ’ s complaint was that the indefinite detention of an individual for the purpose of making a guardianship application was not consonant with the purpose of Article 5 § 1(e), namely “the lawful detention...of persons of unsound mind .” He went on to find that detention in such circumstances would only arise after a responsible medical officer had made a “barring order” under section 25 of the Act preventing discharge and such an order would only be made when, in the terms of section 25, a patient was “likely to act in a manner dangerous to other persons or to himself .” Thus the second criteria for detention laid down in Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, judgment of 24 October 1979, Series A no. 33, § 73 (that “the mental disorder must be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement”) was fulfilled. The trial judge further relied on the Court ’ s observations in Johnson v. the United Kingdom, (judgment of 24 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VII, § 61) in support of the proposition that the responsible authorities were entitled to exercise their judgment to determine in particular cases and on the basis of all relevant circumstances when the interests of the patient and the community into which he was to be released would in fact be served by immediate and unconditional release. He concluded:",
                "“57. I agree with [Counsel for the Secretary of State] that any application under section 29 of the 1983 Act which is made in order to pave the way for a guardianship application must by its nature involve an exercise of judgment by the social services authority that it would not be in the best interests of the patient and the community that the patient be immediately and unconditionally released. Indeed it follows that a patient ’ s continuing detention pending a section 29 application with a view to guardianship is consistent with the principle enunciated in Johnson so long as the patient ’ s discharge does not become unduly delayed. As I have explained, the County Court has a specific duty to dispose of the section 29 applications expeditiously.",
                "58. Furthermore, once a section 29 application has been finally disposed of, the section 2 detention can only thereafter continue for a maximum of a further seven days: section 29(4) (b). In addition, if the patient is admitted for treatment, an appeal to the Mental Health Review Tribunal becomes available under section 66(1) (b) of the 1983 Act with automatic reviews provided for under section 68(1) of the 1983 Act. Furthermore, if the patient is placed into guardianship, there is a further right of appeal under section 66(1)(c) which provides that ‘ where (c) a patient is received into guardianship in pursuance of a guardianship application....an application may be made to a Mental Health Review Tribunal within the relevant period (i) by the patient ’. The relevant period for such an application is ‘ six months beginning with the day on which the application is accepted ’ (section 66(2) (c) of the 1983 Act).",
                "59. Thus, where a section 29 application is made with a view to a guardianship application rather than for the purpose of an admission for treatment, the existence of the duty of the County Court to exercise its powers under section 29 of the 1983 Act in accordance with its duties as a public body under section 6 of the HRA is of critical importance. Those duties, which require the County Court not ‘ to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right ’, would and should prevent the section 29(4) procedure from becoming so protracted so as to require a new and fresh right to another article 5(4) review. This answers the claimant ’ s complaints about the lack of sufficiency of the grounds of appeal to the Tribunal under section 66 of the 1983 Act or as a consequence of the section 29(4) procedure. Thus, this claim also fails. ”"

                "26. In respect of section 2 of the 1983 Act Lord Justice Buxton, with whom Lord Justice Wall and Mr Justice Lindsay concurred, first addressed the fact that it provided for automatic release after twenty-eight days in the absence of an application under section 29. He stated:",
                "“8. The [High Court] judge, at his paragraph 36, accepted the argument of the Secretary of State that automatic discharge at the end of the 28 day period (absent, of course, a section 29 application) was a better safeguard for the patient than an ‘ automatic review ’. The latter expression reverts to the jurisprudence of article 5, and I shall have to come back to it. The problem about the argument at this stage is, however, that it does not address the imbalance between the competent patient, who can apply to the [Mental Health Review Tribunal] under section 66 within 14 days of his detention, and the incompetent patient who, because he is not mentally able to make or promote such an application, has no recourse to an outside body: except through the agency of the nearest relative, who can be, and in this case was, barred under section 25. If the 28 day limit is a sufficient safeguard in the case of incompetent patient, why is it not so in the case of the competent? Why in his case is recourse to the MHRT given at all? And, further, even a 28 day period of detention without review by a judicial body at least raises questions under the ECHR. Whilst I would agree that no rule of thumb can be laid down either in respect of detention generally or in respect of particular categories of detention, nevertheless it is impossible to say that the ECHR organs neither could have nor should have any concern about a 28 day detention without judicial review.”"

[The trial judge] suggested that any undue delay by the County Court would involve a breach of its obligations under article 6 of the ECHR. But that is of no help to the patient. The standard of promptitude in such an application will be that appropriate to the condition of the nearest relative, not that appropriate to the condition of the patient. Moreover, the patient is not party to the proceedings: as Hale LJ pointed out in paragraph 24 of her judgment in the City of Plymouth case, he is the one person whom the County Court rules do not permit to be joined. Thus, the proceedings are not and cannot be concerned with the determination of his civil rights and obligations, so it is difficult to see how he can complain under article 6 of delay in pursuing them. ”"

                "“ 18. As we have seen, there are undoubted, and as the judge thought conclusive, difficulties in applying article 5.4 to oblige the state to act on the incompetent patient ’ s behalf. We also have to remember that the ECHR provides the court with a set of guiding principles, and not with a palm tree. Nevertheless, I cannot think that the scheme of protection for persons detained in cases of suspected unsound mind can have been intended to exclude, simply because of their mental inability, persons who find themselves in the position of MH. The matter may perhaps be tested by asking what reply the authors of the ECHR would have given had they been asked whether the particular language that they adopted in article 5.4 was intended to exclude from the protection of article 5 a person who, solely because of lack of capacity to do so, was unable to take proceedings. At least if they were English lawyers I suspect that they would have replied with a testy ‘ of course not ’ worthy of the hypothetical parties in Shirlaw v. Southern Foundaries [1939] 2 KB 206 at p227.",

[Counsel for the Secretary of State] took us to the judgment of the [European Court of Human Rights] in TW v. Malta (1999) 29 EHRR 185[43], where the court pointed to the difference of wording between article 5.3 and article 5.4, already observed. But that was a case of detention on a criminal charge, where the court was at pains to stress that recourse in an article 5.1.c case cannot be dependent on any initiative by the prisoner. That is far from concluding that in the converse case, where relief is in the first instance in the hands of the subject, but the subject is unable to obtain that relief, the court would hold that assistance to the subject in asserting the right was excluded.",

The patient detained under section 2, whether competent or incompetent, is detained beyond the 28 day limit without adequate judicial supervision. When that occurs, the justification for his original detention, whether or not it has been approved by the MHRT, has expired, and he is detained just because of the existence of proceedings in respect of which he is a spectator. That will be so even if the County Court judge finds in favour of the nearest relative if the approved social worker appeals...I have no doubt that in those circumstances he should have the right to return to the MHRT to obtain a judicial decision on his continued detention.”"

Lord Justice Wall and Mr Justice Lindsay in their concurring judgments both added that, in contrast to the trial judge, they could not regard the twenty-eight day period of detention provided for by section 2 as being of an “inherently short duration ”. On the distinction between Article 5 § 3 and Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, Mr Justice Lindsay added:",
                "“That distinction led [Counsel for the Secretary of State] to argue that under Article 5.4 it was only he or she who was deprived of his or her liberty that was to be entitled, him – or herself, to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of the detention was to be decided. Were a rigorously literal approach to be appropriate some force could be attributed to such an argument but it has to be remembered that the Convention of which 5.4 forms part is intended to cope with the whole range of those deprived of their liberty by arrest or detention throughout the numerous jurisdictions which have subscribed to the Convention, many deploying a more purposive approach than was traditionally used here. Within those jurisdictions there will doubtless be many different circumstances in which one person is entitled or required to bring proceedings in the name of or on behalf of another. If one restricts Article 5.4 so that only the very person detained or deprived of liberty can “take proceedings” to determine the lawfulness of the detention then one would have arrived at a construction as if the Convention had read ‘ Everyone who has capacity himself to bring such proceedings ... shall be entitled to take proceedings ’. That is not what 5.4 says and, in its context, the word ‘ Everyone ’ is plainly shorthand intended to enable not only the very person who is deprived of liberty to take proceedings but, where some other is, by the relevant domestic law, authorised or required to proceed in that person ’ s name or on that person ’ s behalf, to ensure that he, too, should be entitled to take the proceedings. The Crown ’ s construction would or might preclude Article 5.4 applications in all sorts of cases, including the detention of persons under 18, well beyond those with mental disorder. I cannot think that that was intended either by those subscribing to the Convention or by Parliament in its enacting of the Human Rights Act 1998. ”"

                "32. The Secretary of State appealed to the House of Lords, which, on 20 October 2005, unanimously allowed the appeal. Baroness Hale of Richmond (with whom the other four law lords concurred) first considered the compatibility of section 2 of the 1983 Act with Article 5 § 4. She found as follows:",
                "“22. The short answer to this question is that article 5(4) does not require that every case be considered by a court. It requires that the person detained should have the right to ‘ take proceedings ’. The wording is different from article 5(3), which deals with the rights of a person who has been arrested on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence or to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so...The difference between a right to ‘ take proceedings ’ and a right to ‘ be brought promptly before a [court] ’ must be deliberate. It stops short of requiring judicial authorisation in every case. It leaves to the person detained the choice of whether or not to put the matter before a court. Understandably, therefore, the respondent abandoned the argument that article 5(4) required that all section 2 admissions should be referred to a tribunal and concentrated only on those patients who lack the capacity to exercise their article 5(4) rights. Logically, of course, this argument would also apply to a patient detained under section 3, for the automatic reference after six months under section 68(1) would not be regarded as ‘ speedy ’.",
                "23. For [the applicant], the argument is that a right ‘ to take proceedings ’ is ineffective if the patient lacks the ability to do so. Given that the Convention is there to secure rights that are ‘ practical and effective ’ rather than ‘ theoretical and illusory ’ this is a powerful argument. But it does not lead to the conclusion that section 2 is in itself incompatible with the Convention or that the solution is to require a reference in every case. Rather, it leads to the conclusion that every sensible effort should be made to enable the patient to exercise that right if there is reason to think that she would wish to do so.",
                "24. There is no Strasbourg case which implies into article 5(4) the requirement of a judicial review in every case where the patient is unable to make her own application, nor is this suggested in authoritative texts such as Karen Reid, A Practitioner ’ s Guide to the European Convention on Human Rights (2nd ed 2004). Indeed, in Rakevich v. Russia (Application No 58973/00), 28 October 2003, it was held that even the judicial review of every admission on the initiative of the detaining authorities is not enough if the patient does not herself have the direct right to apply for her release. In the recent case of Storck v. Germany (Application No 61603/00), 16 June 2005, there was in principle a procedure available to protect the patient ’ s interests, but the applicant had been unable to secure outside help during her confinement in a private clinic to enable her to institute such proceedings, so it was ‘ questionable whether there had been sufficient safeguards to guarantee the applicant ’ s effective access to court ’ : see para 118. This was not because of lack of capacity but because of the lack of practical machinery for contacting the court. This illustrates only too well how there may be many other obstacles than lack of capacity to the effective exercise of the right to take proceedings. Singling out lack of capacity for special treatment would raise a host of problems of definition and assessment for which there is no warrant either in the Convention or in the Act.",
                "25. That is why our system tries hard to give patients and their relatives easy access to the tribunal which is itself designed to meet their needs. The managers of the hospital have a statutory duty, under section 132 of the Act, to take such steps as are practicable to ensure that the patient understands the effect of the provisions under which she is detained and the rights of applying to a mental health review tribunal which are available to her. This has to be done as soon as practicable after the patient is detained. Unless the patient wishes otherwise, this information is also to be given to the patient ’ s nearest relative. Under the Code of Practice (published March 1999 pursuant to section 118 of the Act by the Department of Health and Welsh Office), section 14, information should be given to the patient ‘ in a suitable manner and at a suitable time ’ by a person who ‘ has received sufficient training and guidance ’. Patients and nearest relatives have to be told how to apply to a tribunal, how to contact a suitably qualified solicitor, that free legal aid may be available, and how to contact any other organisation which may be able to help them make an application. In other words, the hospital managers have to do the best they can to make the patient ’ s rights practical and effective.",
                "26. Mental health review tribunals were also designed with that object in mind. Before they were created, in the Mental Health Act 1959, compulsory detentions were authorised by a judicial officer, who was widely regarded as a ‘ rubber stamp ’ of little practical value in challenging the decision to detain. Tribunals are composed of a legally qualified presider, a medical member with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorder, and a third member with other suitable experience, for example in the social services. Although the procedures have become more formal since the advent of legal assistance for patients, they are designed to be user-friendly and to enable the patient and her relative to communicate directly with the tribunal. A reference to the tribunal must be considered in the same way as if there had been an application by the patient: see r 29. Hence although the initiative is taken by someone else, the patient ’ s rights are the same. Although an application has to be made in writing, it can be signed by any person authorised by the patient to do so on her behalf: see r 3(1). This could be any relative, a social worker, an advocate, or a nurse, provided of course that the patient has sufficient capacity to authorise that person to act for her. The common law presumes that every person has capacity until the contrary is shown and the threshold for capacity is not a demanding one. These principles have recently been confirmed by Parliament in the Mental Capacity Act 2005.",
                "27. Even if the patient ’ s nearest relative has no independent right of application, there is much that she, or other concerned members of the family, friends or professionals, can do to help put the patient ’ s case before a judicial authority. The history of this case is a good illustration. The [applicant ’ s] mother was able to challenge every important decision affecting her daughter. Most helpfully, she stimulated the Secretary of State ’ s reference to the tribunal very quickly after it became clear that her daughter was to be kept in hospital longer than 28 days. Had MH been discharged once the 28 days were up there would, in my view, have been no violation of her rights under article 5(4). It follows that section 2 of the Act is not incompatible with article 5(4).”"

                "33. Baroness Hale then considered the compatibility of section 29 (4) with Article 5 § 4 of the Convention:",
                "“28. Section 29(4) raises a very different question, which applies to all patients affected by it, irrespective of their mental capacity. The system is obviously capable of being operated compatibly. The patient is entitled to make an application during the initial 14 days of the section 2 admission, thus complying with her right, should she choose to exercise it, to a speedy initial judicial determination of the lawfulness of her detention. The county court proceedings may produce a swift displacement order, whether interim or final, after which the patient is admitted under section 3. The patient then has a fresh right to apply to a tribunal, which will arise at a ‘ reasonable interval ’ after the first. Alternatively, a displacement order may be refused, in which case the patient can no longer be detained unless the relative has been persuaded to withdraw her objection to the section 3 admission. But in that event a fresh right to apply to a tribunal will also arise.",
                "29. The problem arises when the county court proceedings drag on and the patient is detained indefinitely without recourse to a tribunal. Indeed, it may be difficult for the county court to proceed too quickly, without endangering the rights of the parties under article 6 and the rights of both the patient and her relative under article 8. Hence there may well come a time when her article 5(4) rights will be violated unless some means of taking proceedings is available to her. That time may come earlier if she has not made an initial application, so that the lawfulness of her detention has never been subject to judicial determination, than it would do if there had been an early tribunal hearing. But here again the means are available, within the existing law, of securing that she does have that right.",
                "30. The preferable means is what happened in this case: that the Secretary of State uses her power under section 67(1) to refer the case to a tribunal. This is preferable because mental health review tribunals are much better suited to determining the merits of a patient ’ s detention and doing so in a way which is convenient to the patient, readily accessible, and comparatively speedy. As already seen, a reference is treated as if the patient had made an application, so that the patient has the same rights within it as she would if she herself had initiated the proceedings. It can, of course, be objected that this solution depends upon the Secretary of State being willing to exercise her discretion to refer. But the Secretary of State is under a duty to act compatibly with the patient ’ s Convention rights and would be well advised to make such a reference as soon as the position is drawn to her attention. In this case this happened at the request of the patient ’ s own lawyers. Should the Secretary of State decline to exercise this power, judicial review would be swiftly available to oblige her to do so. It would also be possible for the hospital managers or the local social services authority to notify the Secretary of State whenever an application is made under section 29 so that she can consider the position.”"

                "34. Her Ladyship finally considered the availability of judicial review or habeas corpus to challenge the lawfulness of a patient ’ s detention. In finding that they were available she added:",
                "“Any person with sufficient standing could invoke them. Before the Human Rights Act 1998, the European Court of Human Rights held that these were not a sufficiently rigorous review of the merits, as opposed to the formal legality, of the patient ’ s detention to comply with article 5(4): see X v. United Kingdom (1981) 4 EHRR 188. It may well be that, as the Administrative Court responsible for hearing judicial review and habeas corpus petition must now itself act compatibly with the patient ’ s rights, it would be obliged to conduct a sufficient review of the merits to satisfy itself that the requirements of article 5(1)(e) were indeed made out. But it is not well equipped to do so. First, it is not used to hearing oral evidence and cross examination. It will therefore take some persuading that this is necessary: cf R (Wilkinson) v. Broadmoor Special Hospital Authority [2002] 1 WLR 419 and R (N) v. M [2003] 1 WLR 562. Second, it is not readily accessible to the patient, who is the one person whose participation in the proceedings must be assured. It sits in London, whereas tribunals sit in the hospital. How would the patient ’ s transport to London be arranged? Third, it is not itself an expert tribunal and will therefore need more argument and evidence than a mental health review tribunal will need to decide exactly the same case. All of this takes time, thus increasing the risk that the determination will not be as speedy as article 5(4) requires.",
                "32. Hence, while judicial review and/or habeas corpus may be one way of securing compliance with the patient ’ s article 5(4) rights, this would be much more satisfactorily achieved either by a speedy determination of the county court proceedings or by a Secretary of State ’ s reference under section 67. Either way, however, the means exist of operating section 29(4) in a way which is compatible with the patient ’ s rights. It follows that the section itself cannot be incompatible, although the action or inaction of the authorities under it may be so.”"

Although the applicant accepted that mechanisms were available for bringing her case to court, they depended upon the initiative of third parties, namely her mother (who brought the judicial review proceedings) and the Secretary of State (who referred her case to the Tribunal following a request from her mother ’ s lawyers). It was clear from the Court ’ s case law that the right of access to a court under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention should not depend upon the goodwill or initiative of a third party, and that “important safeguards against arbitrary detention” did not eliminate the need for an automatic referral in cases where the patient lacked capacity to apply to a court of her own motion ( Gorshkov v.

Moreover, both procedures could not, in practice, satisfy Article 5 § 4 because they were unsuitable for the resolution of complex factual issues and the relevant courts lacked specialist medical expertise and were not, therefore, well-adapted to determining the lawfulness of the detention of persons of unsound mind. There was also no guarantee that a nearest relative, if there was one, would be eligible for public funding and the cost of privately instructing a solicitor could be a very real barrier to accessing the legal advice necessary to make such an application.",

The Government submitted that Article 5 § 4 of the Convention provided for the right of a detained person to take proceedings and not for an obligation on the part of Contracting States to bring such persons before a court. In this regard they noted that there was an important distinction between the wording of Article 5 § 4 and Article 5 § 3 and submitted that the Court had consistently drawn a firm distinction between the automatic judicial control required under Article 5 § 3 and the right to institute proceedings conferred by Article 5 § 4. According to the Court ’ s case-law, what was required was that a review be available at reasonable intervals, and not that a review take place in every case (see, for example, Winterwerp, cited above, § 55, X v. the United Kingdom, Appl. no. 7215/75, 24 October 1981)."

Poland [GC], no. 24557/94, § 43, ECHR 1999-II and Tám v. Slovakia, no. 50213/99, §§ 65 – 66, 22 June 2004). In fact, the Court has held that it would be a contravention of Article 5 § 4 for the State to substitute a system of automatic appeals for one which the applicant could himself initiate ( Rakevich v. Russia, no. 58973/00, § 39, 28 October 2003 and Gorshkov v. Ukraine, cited above, § 39 )."

If the detaining authorities were required to form a view about which patients were incapacitated and thus entitled to automatic review, and those who were not, the problem would merely be removed to a different stage of the analysis. This was because the truly incapacitated patient would be no more able to challenge a misdiagnosis or misjudgement by the relevant authorities about whether or not he was incapacitated than he would be able to challenge the lawfulness of his detention outright."

Moreover, the Government submitted that any ruling that court scrutiny was required automatically in all cases covered by section 2 of the 1983 Act would inevitably create considerable pressure on the Mental Health Review Tribunal system, which in turn could jeopardise the State ’ s ability to comply with the express speediness requirement in Article 5 § 4 and would divert the time and energy of doctors from the provision of front ‑ line care."

In addition, they indicated that judicial review or an application for a remedy in the form of a writ of habeas corpus was also available to patients during the initial twenty-eight day period of detention under section 2 of the 1983 Act. The Government submitted that judicial review was an adequate remedy as the House of Lords had accepted in the present case that the Administrative Court had to act compatibly with a patient ’ s rights and would therefore be obliged to conduct a sufficient review of the merits to satisfy itself that the requirements of Article 5 § 1 (e) were made out. Even though the applicant lacked capacity, her mother had been able to bring proceedings on her behalf and could also have done so in her own name."

The Government also emphasised that that right to apply to the Tribunal for discharge had to be read together with safeguards seeking to facilitate access to the Tribunal, including the statutory duty of hospital managers to take such steps as are practicable to ensure that the patient and her nearest relative understood the provisions under which she was detained, her right to apply to a Tribunal, and how to obtain legal assistance; the requirement that information be given to the patient in a suitable manner, at a suitable time, by a person who had received sufficient training and guidance; the creation of a “user-friendly” procedure before the Tribunal to enable the patient and her nearest relative to communicate directly with it; the fact that the patient ’ s application to the Tribunal might be signed by a relative, social worker, advocate or nurse, provided that the applicant had capacity to authorise that person to act for her; the fact that the Secretary of State or a hospital manager might refer a case to the Tribunal and the patient would be entitled to participate in any subsequent proceedings; and finally, even where the patient ’ s nearest relative had no independent right of application to a Tribunal, he or she could still help put the patient ’ s case before a judicial authority."

On the contrary, in a case of an emergency Article 5 § 4 could be satisfied by the availability of a traditional, highly limited habeas corpus review provided that the detention was for a short period of time (see, for example, X v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§56 – 58 and Winterwerp, cited above, § 42)."

At the end of that period the patient had to either be released or admitted for treatment under section 3 and, if the latter occurred, the patient would have an immediate right of application to the Tribunal under section 66(1)(b) of the 1983 Act. The Government therefore submitted that the shortness of the period justified the conclusion that Article 5 § 4 of the Convention would not be breached even if there were no means at all of challenging the detention during the initial period of assessment. In this regard, the Government submitted that a period of twenty-eight days was neither “indefinite nor lengthy” ( Winterwerp, cited above, §42; X v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 57 – 58; and Herczegfalvy v.

As Baroness Hale said in her judgment (paragraph 33 above), section 29(4) is plainly capable of being operated so as to produce a result compatible with Article 5 § 4 of the Convention and the Government maintained that the domestic courts and other state authorities were both obliged and ordinarily capable of ensuring this was done.

Both of these remedies were in fact invoked in the present case and, as a consequence, the Government maintained that there had been no breach of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention."

The Court reiterates that Article 5 § 4 entitles detained persons to institute proceedings for a review of compliance with the procedural and substantive conditions which are essential for the “lawfulness”, in Convention terms, of their deprivation of liberty. The notion of “lawfulness” under paragraph 4 of Article 5 has the same meaning as in paragraph 1, so that a detained person is entitled to a review of the “lawfulness” of his detention in the light not only of the requirements of domestic law but also of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 § 1. Article 5 § 4 does not guarantee a right to judicial review of such a scope as to empower the court, on all aspects of the case including questions of pure expediency, to substitute its own discretion for that of the decision-making authority. The review should, however, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the “lawful” detention of a person according to Article 5 § 1 (see Winterwerp, cited above, § 55; for more recent authorities, see also X v. Finland, no. 34806/04, §§ 148 – 149, ECHR 2012 (extracts) and E. v. Norway, 29 August 1990, § 50, Series A no. 181-A). The reviewing “court” must not have merely advisory functions but must have the competence to “decide” the “lawfulness” of the detention and to order release if the detention is unlawful (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 200, Series A no. 25; Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 61, Series A no. 114; Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, § 130, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V; and A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, § 202, 19 February 2009)."

The Convention requirement for an act of deprivation of liberty to be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny is of fundamental importance in the context of the underlying purpose of Article 5 of the Convention to provide safeguards against arbitrariness.

Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, § 171, ECHR 2012 );",
                "( c ) Article 5 § 4 requires the procedure followed to have a judicial character and to afford the individual concerned guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question; in order to determine whether proceedings provide adequate guarantees, regard must be had to the particular nature of the circumstances in which they take place ( Stanev, cited above, § 171);",

In the case of Winterwerp, cited above, § 60, the Court held that it was essential for the patient to have access to a court and the opportunity to be heard either in person or, where necessary, through some form of representation; that mental illness could entail restricting or modifying the manner of exercising that right, but could not justify impairing its very essence; and that special procedural safeguards might be called for in order to protect the interests of persons who, on account of their mental disabilities, were not fully capable of acting for themselves."

As the right set forth in Article 5 § 4 of the Convention is guaranteed to everyone, it is clear that special safeguards are called for in the case of detained mental patients who lack legal capacity to institute proceedings before judicial bodies. However, it is not for this Court to dictate what form those special safeguards should take, provided that they make the right guaranteed by Article 5 § 4 as nearly as possible as practical and effective for this particular category of detainees as it is for other detainees. While automatic judicial review might be one means of providing the requisite safeguard, it is not necessarily the only means. As Burton LJ expressed it in the Court of Appeal,",
                "“the State is obliged by the general principles of protection that inform Article 5 to place the incompetent patient in the same position as the competent patient, as nearly as it is possible to do so, with regard to access to the [Tribunal] .”"

That being said, a special feature of this first period of the applicant ’ s detention is that it can be characterised as one ordered on the basis of the urgency of the situation. This Court has already ruled that in relation to such emergency detentions, the remedy of habeas corpus under English law, although limited in scope with regard to the kind of review of “lawfulness” it can offer, is capable of constituting the “proceedings” guaranteed to detained persons by Article 5 § 4 of the Convention ( X v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 58). This opinion was echoed by Lady Hale, who in the present case considered that “judicial review and habeas corpus may be one way of securing compliance with the patient ’ s Article 5 § 4 rights .” Indeed, she even speculated that",
                "“it may well be that, as the Administrative Court responsible for hearing judicial review and habeas corpus petitions must now itself act compatibly with the patient ’ s rights, it would be obliged to conduct a sufficient review of the merits to satisfy itself that the requirements of Article 5 § 1(e) were indeed made out ” (see paragraph 34 above)."

Be that as it may, the Court does not consider it necessary to explore the theoretical protection, for the purposes of Article 5 § 4, that the petition of habeas corpus might offer in the context of patients detained by virtue of section 2 of the 1983 Act. In the specific circumstances of the present case, it would be wholly unreasonable to expect the applicant, or indeed her mother acting on her behalf as her litigation friend, to have attempted during the first twenty-seven days of detention to have brought a habeas corpus petition. The scheme established by the 1983 Act makes an application to the Tribunal for discharge the natural and obvious way of taking Article 5 § 4-type proceedings in order to contest the justification – and “lawfulness” – of the compulsory confinement of a mental patient ordered under section 2 of the 1983 Act. An incompetent patient such as the applicant could not make a section 66(2)(a) application to the Tribunal for discharge because she lacked legal capacity, but her nearest relative could make an order for her discharge from the assessment detention under section 2 of the 1983 Act. The applicant ’ s mother attempted to do this, but she was met with a “barring order” under section 25(1) of the 1983 Act, as a consequence of which her order for discharge had no effect and she was prevented from making any further discharge order for a period of six months (see paragraphs 8 and 39 above)."

Neither the applicant nor her mother acting as her nearest relative was able in practice to avail themselves of the normal remedy granted by the 1983 Act to patients detained under section 2 for assessment. That being so, in relation to the initial measure taken by social services depriving her of her liberty, the applicant did not, at the relevant time, before the elucidation of the legal framework by the House of Lords in her case, have the benefit of effective access to a mechanism enabling her to “take proceedings” of the kind guaranteed to her by Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. The special safeguards required under Article 5 § 4 for incompetent mental patients in a position such as hers were lacking in relation to the means available to her to challenge the lawfulness of her “assessment detention” in hospital for a period of up to twenty-eight days."

It was no answer that there might not be a violation of Article 5 § 4 if the domestic authorities exercised their functions speedily. She further contends that the availability of judicial review and/or habeas corpus could not meet the difficulty raised by patients who lacked capacity to institute legal proceedings themselves. Neither procedure could, in practice, satisfy Article 5 § 4 because they were unsuitable for the resolution of complex factual issues and the relevant courts lacked specialist medical expertise and were not, therefore, well ‑ adapted to determining the lawfulness of the detention of persons of unsound mind. There was also no guarantee that a nearest relative, if there was one, would be eligible for public funding and the cost of privately instructing a solicitor could be a very real barrier to accessing the legal advice necessary to make such an application."

In particular, it noted that the patient could not be joined as a party to the proceedings before the County Court. As a consequence, the patient could not complain under Article 6 of the Convention about any delay in pursuing them.

In Shtukaturov and Stanev (both cited above, at § 124 and § 174 respectively) the Court found that an entitlement of a close relative to initiate proceedings was not a remedy “directly accessible to the applicant .” Likewise, in Rakevich, where the initiative to apply to a court lay solely with the medical staff, the Court held that “the detainee ’ s access to the judge should not depend on the good will of the detaining authority” (cited above, § 44; see also Gorshkov, cited above, § 44 and X v.

When a mental patient is not fully capable of acting for herself on account of her mental disabilities, by definition the compensatory safeguards to which the State might have recourse in order to remove the legal or practical obstacles barring such a person from being able to benefit from the procedural guarantee afforded by Article 5 § 4 may well include empowering or even requiring some other person or authority to act on the patient ’ s behalf in that regard."

This means that once a request is made for a referral, rather than enjoying a discretionary power to refer the case to the Tribunal, he is under a duty to do so if not to do so would involve an infringement of the patient ’ s rights under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention to obtain speedy judicial review of the detention. In such circumstances, the referral to a judicial body cannot be said to be dependent on the goodwill or initiative of the Secretary of State, but rather is a legal consequence flowing from his statutory obligation to act compatibly with the patient ’ s rights under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. In this regard the present case can be distinguished from those of Stanev and Rakevich (cited above), where the third parties were not under any duty to intervene on the applicants ’ behalf."

It is of course true that incorporation of the Article 5 § 4 proceedings into a judicial decision authorising detention as a mental patient does not endure eternally, and that a mental patient detained for an indefinite or lengthy period is subsequently entitled by Article 5 § 4 to take proceedings at reasonable intervals to challenge the justification for her continuing detention.

In order to determine whether the requirement that a decision be given “speedily” has been complied with, it is necessary to effect an overall assessment where the proceedings were conducted at more than one level of jurisdiction ( see Navarra v. France, 23 November 1993, § 28, Series A no. 273-B, and Mooren, cited above, § 106). Where the original detention order or subsequent decisions on continued detention were given by a court (that is to say, by an independent and impartial judicial body) in a procedure offering appropriate guarantees of due process, and where the domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the Court is prepared to tolerate longer periods of review in proceedings before a second-instance court ( see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, § 96, 25 October 2007, and Shcherbina, cited above, § 65). These considerations apply a fortiori to complaints under Article 5 § 4 concerning proceedings before constitutional courts which were separate from proceedings before ordinary courts ( see Žúbor, cited above, § 89). In this context, the Court notes that the proceedings before constitutional courts such as the Turkish Constitutional Court are of a specific nature.

In reply, the applicant stated that he did not know any Turkish army officers and had no links to the attempted coup. The comments he had made during the television programme in question had been intended as warnings to prevent future military coups. Regarding the bank account, some years previously he had taught for three months at a private university, which had asked him to open an account at the bank in question for payment of his wages. He added that he had not been aware of having avoided a criminal investigation through the assistance of certain suspected members of an illegal organisation, and that this was a matter to be taken up with the police officers allegedly responsible. Furthermore, he had visited Fetullah Gülen as a member of a group of journalists, for purely professional reasons linked to his role as a journalist, and had never kissed anyone ’ s hand. Lastly, the one-dollar bill was of no special significance."

At the end of the hearing, the magistrate ordered the applicant ’ s pre-trial detention, having taken the following factors into consideration : the strong suspicions against him; the nature of the alleged offences and the fact that they were among the offences listed in Article 100 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( “the CCP ” ) – the so-called “ catalogue offences”, for which a suspect ’ s pre-trial detention was deemed justified in the event of strong suspicion; the risk of absconding; and the risk that alternative measures to detention might be insufficient to ensure the applicant ’ s participation in the criminal proceedings. In the reasons for his decision, the magistrate noted the following : during the attempted military coup, members of FETÖ/PDY had used heavy weapons; since February 2012 the organisation in question had been explicitly waging a campaign against the political authorities; the members of FETÖ/PDY had attempted to force the government ’ s resignation by discrediting it in public opinion, especially through judicial operations carried out between 17 and 25 December 2013; and the organisation had taken control of several media outlets with a view to achieving its aim. The magistrate further noted that during the television broadcast on 14 July 2016, the applicant had said : “ Within the State of the Republic of Turkey, there is probably another structure, whose components outside Turkey are closely observing and documenting all these events. It is not clear exactly when [it] will pull its hand out of the bag or how [it] will do so ” ( “ Türkiye Devleti içinde de muhtemelen bütün bu gelişmeleri dış dünyada daha fazla belgeleyen, izleyen bir başka da yapı var. Onun ne zaman torbadan elini çıkaracağı, nasıl elini çıkaracağı belli değil ” ). The magistrate concluded that there were suspicions that the contents of the applicant ’ s statements about the political authorities had been intended to prepare the ground for a military coup and were not covered by freedom of the press."

            [
                "36. With regard to the applicant ’ s complaint that his pre-trial detention was unlawful, the Constitutional Court noted firstly that the evidence forming the basis for his detention had included: ( i ) an article entitled “ The meaning of Sledgehammer” ( “ Balyoz ’ un Anlamı ” ), published in the Star newspaper in 2010; (ii) his statements during the television programme broadcast on Can Erzincan TV on 14 July 2016; and ( iii) an article entitled “ Turbulence ” ( “ Türbülans ” ), published on his own website on 20 July 2016. After examining the substance of these items of evidence, the Constitutional Court held that the investigating authorities had been unable to demonstrate any factual basis that might indicate that the applicant had been acting in accordance with the aims of FETÖ/PDY or with the purpose of preparing the ground for a possible military coup. The Constitutional Court observed that, as well as having published the above-mentioned articles and made the statements in question, the applicant was accused of holding an account with Bank Asya, having avoided a criminal investigation through the connivance of members of the national police suspected of belonging to FETÖ/PDY, and having in his possession a United States one-dollar bill with an “ F” serial number. Addressing those allegations, the Constitutional Court held, having regard to the applicant ’ s testimony and line of defence, that no specific facts had been established that could refute his explanations, which were “ consistent with the normal course of life”. Similarly, regarding the contents of the messages exchanged by other individuals via ByLock, the Constitutional Court held that the messages could not in themselves be regarded as significant indications that the applicant had committed an offence. Accordingly, it concluded that “ strong evidence that an offence had been committed” had not been sufficiently established in the applicant ’ s case. Next, the Constitutional Court examined whether there had been a violation of the right to liberty and security in the light of Article 15 of the Constitution ( providing for the suspension of the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms in the event of war, general mobilisation, a state of siege or a state of emergency ). On this point, it noted firstly that in a state of emergency, the Constitution provided for the possibility of taking measures derogating from the guarantees set forth in Article 19, to the extent required by the situation. It observed, however, that if it were accepted that people could be placed in pre-trial detention without any strong evidence that they had committed an offence, the guarantees of the right to liberty and security would be meaningless. Accordingly, it held that the applicant ’ s pre-trial detention was disproportionate to the strict exigencies of the situation and that his right to liberty and security, as safeguarded by Article 19 § 3 of the Constitution, had been breached."

With regard to the complaint concerning freedom of expression and of the press, the Constitutional Court observed that the applicant ’ s initial and continued pre-trial detention on account of his articles and statements amounted to interference with the exercise of that right. Taking into account his arguments regarding the lawfulness of his pre-trial detention, the Constitutional Court held that such a measure, which had serious consequences since it resulted in deprivation of liberty, could not be regarded as a necessary and proportionate interference in a democratic society. It further noted that it could not be clearly established from the reasons given for ordering and extending the applicant ’ s pre-trial detention whether the measure met a pressing social need or why it was necessary. Lastly, it found that it was clear that the applicant ’ s pre-trial detention could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and of the press, in so far as it had not been based on any concrete evidence other than his articles and statements ( see paragraph 235 of the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment ). Regarding the application of Article 15 of the Constitution, it referred to its findings concerning the lawfulness of his pre-trial detention ( as set out in paragraphs 155-57 of its judgment – see paragraph 36 above ) and held that there had also been a violation of freedom of expression and freedom of the press as enshrined in Articles 26 and 28 of the Constitution."

The Constitutional Court noted that the applicant and his lawyer had been present at the hearing on 22 September 2016, following which the applicant had been placed in pre-trial detention. It observed that he had lodged an objection against his detention on 28 September 2016, that the objection had been dismissed on 10 October 2016 and that eighteen days had thus elapsed between his previous appearance in court and the dismissal of his objection.

                "80. In its decision of 4 August 2016 (no. 2016/12) concerning the dismissal of two members of the Constitutional Court and its decision of 20 June 2017 ( Aydın Yavuz and Others, no. 2016/22169) concerning a person ’ s pre-trial detention, the Constitutional Court provided information and assessments on matters including the attempted military coup and its consequences. It carried out a detailed examination, from a constitutional perspective, of the facts leading to the declaration of the state of emergency. As a result of this examination, it found that the attempted military coup had been a clear and serious attack both on the constitutional principles that sovereignty was unconditionally and unreservedly vested in the people, who exercised it through authorised organs, and that no individual or body could exercise any State authority not emanating from the Constitution, and also on the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. According to the Constitutional Court, the attempted military coup had been a practical illustration of the severity of the threats posed to the democratic constitutional order and human rights. After summarising the attacks carried out during the night of 15 to 16 July 2016, it emphasised that in order to assess the severity of the threat posed by a military coup, it was also necessary to consider the risks that might have arisen had the coup attempt not been thwarted. It found that the fact that the attempted coup had taken place at a time when Turkey had been under violent attack from numerous terrorist organisations had made the country even more vulnerable and considerably increased the severity of the threat to the life and existence of the nation. The Constitutional Court noted that in some cases, it might not be possible for a State to eliminate threats to its democratic constitutional order, fundamental rights and national security through ordinary administrative procedures. It might therefore be necessary to impose extraordinary administrative procedures, such as a state of emergency, until such threats were eliminated. Bearing in mind the threats resulting from the attempted military coup of 15 July 2016, the Constitutional Court accepted the power of the Council of Ministers, chaired by the President, to issue legislative decrees on matters necessitating the state of emergency. In that context, it also emphasised that the state of emergency was a temporary legal regime, in which any interference with fundamental rights had to be foreseeable and the aim was to restore the normal regime in order to safeguard fundamental rights.",

Firstly, as regards the complaint concerning the lawfulness and duration of the applicant ’ s detention in police custody, the Court observes that the Turkish legal system provides applicants with two remedies in this respect, namely an objection aimed at securing release from custody (Article 91 § 5 of the CCP ) and a compensation claim against the State (Article 141 § 1 (a) of the CCP ) ( see Mustafa Avci v. Turkey, no. 39322/12, § 63, 23 May 2017). The Court notes that one of the reasons why the Constitutional Court declared this complaint inadmissible was that there was no information in the case file as to whether the applicant had lodged an objection under Article 91 § 5 of the CCP against his detention in police custody ( see paragraph 39 above ). However, the Court observes that on 10 September 2016 the applicant did lodge an objection seeking his release from police custody, which was dismissed by the Istanbul magistrate ’ s court on 12 September 2016 ( see paragraph 21 above ). He therefore availed himself of the remedy provided for in Article 91 § 5 of the CCP. Next, as regards the possibility of bringing a compensation claim under Article 141 § 1 (a) of the CCP, the Court notes that Emergency Legislative Decree no. 667, adopted following the declaration of a state of emergency, allowed individuals to be held in police custody for up to thirty days, not including the time needed to convey them to a court. In those circumstances, having regard to the wording of the relevant provisions, the Court has doubts as to the effectiveness of the remedy provided for in Article 141 § 1 (a), given that the applicant ’ s period in police custody does not appear to have exceeded the statutory maximum duration prescribed by Article 6 § 1 (a) of Emergency Legislative Decree no. 667 as in force at the material time."

One of the underlying reasons for the high numbers of journalists being detained was the practice of judges, who often tended to disregard the exceptional nature of detention as a measure of last resort that should only be applied when all other options were deemed insufficient. In the majority of cases where journalists had been placed in pre-trial detention, they had been charged with terrorism-related offences without any evidence corroborating their involvement in terrorist activities.

The list of exceptions set out in Article 5 § 1 is an exhaustive one ( see Labita v.

Lithuania, no. 34578/97, § 50, ECHR 2000 ‑ IX; Włoch v. Poland, no. 27785/95, § 108, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI; and Poyraz v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 21235/11, § 53, 17 February 2015). The “reasonableness” of the suspicion on which an arrest must be based forms an essential part of the safeguard laid down in Article 5 § 1 (c).

In that case, after examining the remedy in question, it found that none of the material in its possession suggested that an individual application to the Constitutional Court was not capable of affording appropriate redress for the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 5 of the Convention, or that it did not offer reasonable prospects of success. In reaching that finding, it noted in particular that the Constitutional Court had jurisdiction to find violations of Convention provisions and was vested with appropriate powers to secure redress for violations, by granting compensation and/or indicating the means of redress; on that account the Constitutional Court could and should be able, if necessary, to prohibit the authority concerned from continuing to breach the right in question and to order it to restore, as far as possible, the status quo ante ( see Koçintar, cited above, § 41 ). The Court observed that where the Constitutional Court found a violation of the right to liberty as guaranteed by Article 19 of the Constitution and the applicant remained in detention, it decided to transmit its judgment containing that finding to the appropriate court so that it could take “the necessary action”. Taking into account the binding nature of the Constitutional Court ’ s decisions in accordance with Article 153 § 6 of the Constitution ( by which such decisions are binding on all State authorities and on all natural and legal persons ), the Court found that the question of compliance in practice with that court ’ s decisions on individual applications should not in principle arise in Turkey and that there was no cause to doubt that the judgments in which the Constitutional Court found a violation would be effectively implemented ( ibid., § 43 )."

Firstly, it found that the Constitutional Court did not have jurisdiction to assess the evidence in the case file and that that court ’ s judgment was therefore not in compliance with the law. Secondly, it found that ordering the applicant ’ s immediate release on the basis of the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment would run counter to the general principles of law, the independence of the judiciary, the principle that no authority could give instructions to the courts, and the right to a court. The 26th Assize Court, having regard to the evidence before it, the large scale of the attempted military coup, the risk of the applicant ’ s absconding, the current state of the case file and the severity of the potential sentence in the event of a conviction, ordered the continuation of the applicant ’ s pre-trial detention."

It thus observes that the reasons given in the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment and in the decision delivered by the 26th Assize Court suggest that the criteria applied by the two courts coexist, particularly as regards the discretion to assess the evidence in the case file. In this context, the Court cannot accept the 26th Assize Court ’ s argument that the Constitutional Court should not have assessed the evidence in the case file.

Next, the Court observes that in the present case, prior to the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 11 January 2018, the Government had explicitly urged the Court to reject the applicant ’ s application for failure to exhaust domestic remedies, on the grounds that his individual application to the Constitutional Court was still pending ( see paragraph 105 above ). This argument reinforced the Government ’ s view that an individual application to the Constitutional Court was an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 5 of the Convention. Such a position is, moreover, consistent with the Court ’ s findings in the case of Koçintar ( cited above ). To put it briefly, the Court considers that this argument by the Government can only be interpreted as meaning that under Turkish law, if the Constitutional Court has ruled that the applicant ’ s pre-trial detention is in breach of the Constitution, the response by the courts with jurisdiction to rule on the issue of pre-trial detention must necessarily entail releasing him, unless new grounds and evidence justifying his continued detention are put forward. However, in the event, the 26th Assize Court rejected the application for the applicant ’ s release following the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 11 January 2018 by interpreting and applying domestic law in a manner departing from the approach indicated by the Government before the Court."

As the Court has regularly confirmed, although it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, under Article 5 § 1 failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention and the Court can and should therefore review whether the domestic law has been complied with ( see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, § 73, 9 July 2009). The Court must, moreover, ascertain whether the domestic law itself is in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied therein. On this last point, the Court emphasises that where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty should be satisfied ( ibid., § 76). In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be “lawful” and be effected “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law”, Article 5 § 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions “in accordance with the law” and “prescribed by law” in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. Lastly and above all, no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 § 1, the notion of “arbitrariness” in this context extending beyond the lack of conformity with national law. In the context of sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1, the reasoning of the decision ordering a person ’ s detention is a relevant factor in determining whether the detention should be regarded as arbitrary ( ibid., § 77 and 79)."

The Court observes that it has already found in the Uzun decision (cited above ) that the Turkish legislature has demonstrated its intention to entrust the Constitutional Court with jurisdiction to find violations of Convention provisions and with appropriate powers to provide redress for such violations ( see Uzun, cited above, §§ 62-64). Furthermore, with regard to complaints under Article 5 of the Convention, in Koçintar ( cited above ) the Court considered the nature and effects of decisions delivered by the Constitutional Court in accordance with the Turkish Constitution. Article 153 § 1 of the Constitution provides that the Constitutional Court ’ s judgments are “final”. Moreover, as the Court noted in Koçintar, Article 153 § 6 provides that decisions of the Constitutional Court are binding on the legislative, executive and judicial organs ( see, to similar effect, Uzun, cited above, § 66). In the Court ’ s view, therefore, it is clear that the Constitutional Court forms an integral part of the judiciary within the constitutional structure of Turkey and that – as the Court has previously noted in Koçintar, and as the Government explicitly submitted before the Court in the present case – it plays an important role in protecting the right to liberty and security under Article 19 of the Constitution and Article 5 of the Convention by offering an effective remedy to individuals detained during criminal proceedings ( see also Mercan, cited above, §§ 17-30)."

On that basis, and having regard in particular to the Government ’ s arguments before it as to the effectiveness of an individual application to the Constitutional Court for the purposes of Article 5 of the Convention, the Court observes that the reasons given by the Istanbul 26th Assize Court in rejecting the application for the applicant ’ s release, following a “final” and “binding” judgment delivered by the supreme constitutional judicial authority, cannot be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. For another court to call into question the powers conferred on a constitutional court to give final and binding judgments on individual applications runs counter to the fundamental principles of the rule of law and legal certainty. The Court reiterates that these principles, inherent in the protection afforded by Article 5 of the Convention, are the cornerstones of the guarantees against arbitrariness ( see paragraph 13 7 above ). Although the Constitutional Court transmitted its judgment to the Assize Court so that it could take “ the necessary action ”, the Assize Court resisted the Constitutional Court by refusing to release the applicant, with the result that the violation found by the Constitutional Court was not redressed. The Court has already stated (see paragraph 129 above ) that it endorses the findings reached by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 11 January 2018 regarding the period of pre-trial detention up to the date of that judgment. It observes that the case file discloses no new grounds or evidence showing that the basis for the detention has changed following the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment. In that connection, it notes in particular that the Government have not demonstrated that the evidence purportedly available to the 26th Istanbul Assize Court justifying the strong suspicion against the applicant was in fact any different from the evidence examined by the Constitutional Court. That being so, the Court considers that the applicant ’ s continued pre-trial detention, after the Constitutional Court had given its clear and unambiguous judgment finding a violation of Article 19 § 3 of the Constitution, cannot be regarded as “lawful” and “ in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law” as required by the right to liberty and security."

Accordingly, it found that the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty was disproportionate to the strict exigencies of the situation. This conclusion is also valid for the Court ’ s examination. Having regard to Article 15 of the Convention and the derogation by Turkey, the Court considers, as the Constitutional Court did in its judgment, that a measure of pre-trial detention that is not “lawful” and has not been effected “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law” on account of the lack of reasonable suspicion cannot be said to have been strictly required by the exigencies of the situation ( see, mutatis mutandis, A. and Others, cited above, §§ 182-90).

In order to determine whether the requirement that a decision be given “speedily” has been complied with, it is necessary to effect an overall assessment where the proceedings were conducted at more than one level of jurisdiction ( see Navarra v. France, 23 November 1993, § 28, Series A no. 273-B, and Mooren, cited above, § 106). Where the original detention order or subsequent decisions on continued detention were given by a court (that is to say, by an independent and impartial judicial body) in a procedure offering appropriate guarantees of due process, and where the domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the Court is prepared to tolerate longer periods of review in proceedings before a second-instance court ( see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, § 96, 25 October 2007, and Shcherbina, cited above, § 65). These considerations apply a fortiori to complaints under Article 5 § 4 concerning proceedings before constitutional courts which were separate from proceedings before ordinary courts ( see Žúbor, cited above, § 89). In this context, the Court notes that the proceedings before constitutional courts such as the Turkish Constitutional Court are of a specific nature. Admittedly, the Constitutional Court does review the lawfulness of an applicant ’ s initial and continued pre-trial detention. However, in doing so it does not act as a “fourth-instance” body but determines solely whether the decisions ordering the initial and continued detention complied with the Constitution."

It notes that in the present case the applicant made several such applications for release, which were examined in conformity with the “speediness” requirement ( see paragraphs 27-29 above ). The Court observes in addition that the question of a suspect ’ s detention is automatically reviewed at regular intervals of no more than thirty days ( see paragraph 7 3 above ). In a system of that kind, the Court can tolerate longer periods of review by the Constitutional Court. Where an initial or further detention order was imposed by a court in a procedure offering appropriate guarantees of due process, the subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees based primarily on an evaluation of the appropriateness of continued detention. Nevertheless, the Court considers that even in the light of those principles, in normal circumstances a period of fourteen months and three days cannot be regarded as “speedy” ( see G.B. v. Switzerland, no. 27426/95, §§ 28-39, 30 November 2000; Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, §§ 115- 24, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII ( extracts ); and Shcherbina, cited above, § § 62 ‑ 71).

Finding that the judges concerned had not shown that depriving the applicant of his liberty met a pressing social need, the Constitutional Court held that in so far as his detention was not based on any concrete evidence other than his articles and comments, it could have had a chilling effect on freedom of expression and of the press ( see paragraph 38 above )."

The Court notes in this connection that it has consistently held that where the views expressed do not constitute incitement to violence – in other words, unless they advocate recourse to violent actions or bloody revenge, justify the commission of terrorist acts in pursuit of their supporters ’ goals and can be interpreted as likely to encourage violence by instilling deep-seated and irrational hatred towards specified individuals – the Contracting States cannot restrict the right of the public to be informed of them, even with reference to the aims set out in Article 10 § 2, namely the protection of territorial integrity or national security or the prevention of disorder or crime ( see Sürek v.

                "210. The Court is prepared to take into account the circumstances surrounding the cases brought before it, in particular the difficulties facing Turkey in the aftermath of the attempted military coup. The coup attempt and other terrorist acts have clearly posed a major threat to democracy in Turkey. In this connection, the Court attaches considerable weight to the conclusions of the Constitutional Court, which noted, among other things, that the fact that the attempt had taken place at a time when Turkey had been under violent attack from numerous terrorist organisations had made the country even more vulnerable ( see paragraph 80 above ). However, the Court considers that one of the principal characteristics of democracy is the possibility it offers of resolving problems through public debate. It has emphasised on many occasions that democracy thrives on freedom of expression ( see, among other authorities, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 57, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I; Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 129, ECHR 2012; and Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) and Others v. Turkey, nos. 3840/10 and 6 others, § 74, 12 January 2016). In this context, the existence of a “ public emergency threatening the life of the nation ” must not serve as a pretext for limiting freedom of political debate, which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society. In the Court ’ s view, even in a state of emergency – which is, as the Constitutional Court noted, a legal regime whose aim is to restore the normal regime by guaranteeing fundamental rights ( see paragraph 80 above ) – the Contracting States must bear in mind that any measures taken should seek to protect the democratic order from the threats to it, and every effort must be made to safeguard the values of a democratic society, such as pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness."

In this context, the Court considers that criticism of governments and publication of information regarded by a country ’ s leaders as endangering national interests should not attract criminal charges for particularly serious offences such as belonging to or assisting a terrorist organisation, attempting to overthrow the government or the constitutional order or disseminating terrorist propaganda. Moreover, even where such serious charges have been brought, pre-trial detention should only be used as an exceptional measure of last resort when all other measures have proved incapable of fully guaranteeing the proper conduct of proceedings. Should this not be the case, the national courts ’ interpretation cannot be regarded as acceptable."

The Court further notes that the pre-trial detention of anyone expressing critical views produces a range of adverse effects, both for the detainees themselves and for society as a whole, since the imposition of a measure entailing deprivation of liberty, as in the present case, will inevitably have a chilling effect on freedom of expression by intimidating civil society and silencing dissenting voices ( see, to similar effect, paragraph 235 of the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment ). The Court further notes that a chilling effect of this kind may be produced even when the detainee is subsequently acquitted ( see Şık, cited above, § 83)."

On 30 January 2015 the applicants applied to the Gaziantep Magistrates ’ Court, challenging the lawfulness of their administrative detention at the Gaziantep Removal Centre and requesting their release. They largely repeated the arguments that they had previously made before the Istanbul Magistrates ’ Court and stressed the unsuitability of the physical conditions at the Gaziantep Removal Centre, especially for small children. They also drew the court ’ s attention to the fact that they were being detained despite the absence of any immediate prospect of expulsion, because the cases that they had lodged against the deportation decision and the decision refusing their asylum request were still pending before the administrative courts."

                "21. On 5 February 2015 the Gaziantep Magistrates ’ Court accepted the applicants ’ arguments and found that their administrative detention did not comply with the law. The court noted at the outset that the applicants had been detained for over three months in circumstances which were particularly unsuitable for small children. Moreover, although their deportation and detention were based on sections 54(1)(d) and 57(2) of Law no. 6458, no concrete evidence had been provided to support the allegation that they posed a threat to public order, safety or health, particularly bearing in mind that three of the applicants were children aged 2, 3 and 7. Similarly, no explanation had been given as to why their detention was called for under section 57(2) of Law no. 6458. The court also noted that the proceedings brought by the applicants against the decisions ordering their deportation and refusing their asylum request were still pending before the administrative courts. On the basis of those findings, the court declared the applicants ’ detention to be unlawful and ordered the applicants ’ release from the Gaziantep Removal Centre, unless their deportation could be carried out immediately."

                "24. The applicants claimed that the Kumkapı Removal Centre had been severely overcrowded at the time of their detention there between 22 October 2014 and 22 January 2015. The centre had had an overall official capacity of 300 people at the relevant time, but had accommodated around 600 people. As proof of that claim, the applicants submitted a note prepared by their lawyer on 23 January 2015, recounting an exchange that he had had with an officer on duty, who had allegedly told him that some 600 people were being held at the removal centre at the material time."
            ],
            [
                "25. The applicants argued that the overcrowding at the centre had led to problems of hygiene, which had been further exacerbated by the lack of regular cleaning of the rooms, toilets and showers, and by the fact that the bedding provided at the centre was never changed. The building was infested with insects. The first applicant claimed that her children had been bitten by insects and bedbugs, and two of them had suffered allergic reactions to those bites. On an unspecified date the applicants ’ room had been disinfected, yet they had not been permitted to leave the room during the disinfection process."

                "26. The applicants further submitted that the centre had not been sufficiently lit, heated and ventilated, and that they had been exposed to tobacco smoke at all times of the day. There had been no regular provision for outdoor exercise, not even for children. There were no light switches in the rooms and the lights were kept on during the night, which had disturbed the applicants ’ sleep."

            [
                "27. The applicants emphasised that the material conditions of detention at the Kumkapı Removal Centre were particularly unsuitable for the mental and physical health of children. Children were not provided with a play area or with age-appropriate activities, nor did they have regular access to fresh air. The quality and quantity of the food provided was also poor. In particular, they did not meet the nutritional requirements of children. The applicants ’ needs, such as baby food, milk and fruit, as well as nappies, baby cream, clothes and toys, had been met by their lawyers or next of kin, to the extent that their visits had been allowed. The applicants ’ lawyers ’ oral and written requests for the provision of the three children ’ s basic needs, including their requests for urgent medical care, had been ignored by the authorities. In addition to their oral requests, on 14 November 2014 and 13 January 2015 the applicants ’ lawyer had written twice to the Istanbul Security Directorate to complain of the material conditions at the Kumkapı Removal Centre, and to request medical assistance and basic provisions required by the applicants, in particular the three children. In the letter of 13 January 2015 the lawyer had stressed that one of the children suffered from bronchitis and another one from allergies, and that they were in need of urgent medical care. It appears that the authorities did not respond to any of those requests. On 21 January 2015 the lawyer wrote to the DGMM to draw its attention to the hardships faced by the applicants on account of the material conditions of detention at the Kumkapı Removal Centre, and to request urgent medical assistance for the children, who had been suffering from a high fever for the past six days. The lawyer stressed that the authorities had taken no action to provide the children with the necessary medical care, despite the first applicant ’ s numerous pleas. According to the information provided by the applicants, the children were not taken to a doctor until 27 January 2015."

According to their account, the conditions at that centre were even worse than those at Kumkapı: they were held in a room measuring 10 sq. m, which did not receive enough sunlight, together with three other women and one child. There were people who slept in the corridors. The problems concerning the quality and the appropriateness of the food for children, the hygiene, the lack of outdoor exercise and the absence of a play area also existed at that centre. The applicants were given milk, fruit and winter clothes by their lawyers."

                "29. The Government submitted that the Kumkapı Removal Centre where the applicants had initially been detained had a capacity of 300 persons. The detainees were accommodated on three floors: the first two floors were reserved for male detainees, and the third floor for females. There were four dormitories on the first floor, measuring 50, 58, 76 and 84 sq. m, and five dormitories on each of the second and third floors, measuring 50, 58, 69, 76 and 84 sq. m respectively. There were forty-four bunk beds on the first floor, seventy-six bunk beds on the second floor and seventy bunk beds on the third floor, and all the rooms were sufficiently lit and ventilated. There were also five showers and six toilets per floor, as well as a cafeteria measuring 69 sq. m on all floors, where breakfast, lunch and dinner were served daily. Children were given 500 ml of milk each day, and there was also a canteen in the centre where personal supplies were sold. The detainees had the right to outdoor exercise in suitable weather conditions, and the applicants had enjoyed that right during their stay in Kumkapı. An indoor and an outdoor play area were moreover provided for children, and facilities for resting, watching television, exercising and religious observance were also made available to all detainees. A doctor was present on the premises weekly and the detainees also had access to medical care in cases of emergency. Detainees were also allowed to meet with their first ‑ degree relatives, lawyers and legal representatives. As for the hygiene in the facility, there were six cleaning staff working full time at the removal centre, and the building was disinfected whenever necessary. Hot and cold water was available around-the-clock, along with hygiene products such as liquid and bath soap."

Rather, she had been housed in a separate area on the same floor, called the “victims ’ ward”, where there were no iron bars or locks on the doors, where the detainees were allowed to use the telephones at will and had access to hot and cold water at all times. The so-called victims ’ ward consisted of two rooms measuring 23.5 and 23 sq. m respectively and also included a 24 sq. m hallway and an 11 sq. m play area for children. The children were allowed to spend time in the play area with their parents or the sociologists and psychologists on duty at the removal centre, and they were never separated from their mothers."

As for the conditions at the Gaziantep Removal Centre, the Government informed the Court that the applicants had been accommodated in a separate room measuring 12 sq. m as a family. They had been provided with three meals per day as well as with milk for the children. There was heating and twenty-four-hour access to hot water at the removal centre. Those held at the removal centre were allowed to go out to the yard at certain times of the day, and they were provided with medical care as necessary."

In support of their claims, the Government submitted some photographs taken at the Kumkapı and Gaziantep removal centres, showing a number of dormitories from the Gaziantep removal centre and the yards of both centres. Unlike in Kumkapı, there does not seem to be a play area in the Gaziantep Removal Centre ’ s small concrete court yard. As for the conditions in the dormitory rooms, the rooms in the photographs are well lit and fairly clean, although some of them appear to be cramped. All of the rooms are equipped with iron-frame bunk-beds for adults, and there appear to be no other furniture – such as tables, chairs and closets – present in most of the rooms. The Government have provided no information as to which one of the rooms shown in the photographs the applicants had actually stayed in. The Government also submitted photographs of two common rooms with sofas and tables, and of one kitchen, one shower and one toilet at the Gaziantep Removal Centre, all of which also appear clean. In addition, they submitted video footage from the Kumkapı Removal Centre. One video shows an unidentified woman walking down the stairs of the centre with one baby and two older children and going outside to the car park where swings and a slide had been put in place, and another shows a woman making a phone call with an older boy by her side. The Government lastly sent three photographs taken at the Kumkapı Removal Centre, in which a small – unidentified – girl is seen holding a puzzle with a woman who, according to the note on the photograph, was a psychologist. There is no indication on the photographs as to when they were taken, but the videos indicate that they were taken on 18 and 22 January 2015.",

                "33. On 15 December 2014 the applicants lodged an individual application with the Constitutional Court and brought all the complaints noted in paragraphs 24-27 above regarding the material conditions of their detention at the Kumkapı Removal Centre to that court ’ s attention. They stressed that the conditions of detention in which they had been held for two months at that centre, which were unsuitable even for adults, were particularly unacceptable in the case of small children. The second, third and fourth applicants ’ special needs were not being met at the centre, despite numerous appeals to the authorities. They added that although there was a play room and a yard at the centre, they were not allowed to benefit from those facilities. In particular, they were deprived of basic human needs, such as access to outdoor exercise. Arguing that the conditions of their detention had constituted ill-treatment, as well as violating their right to private and family life, the applicants requested that the Constitutional Court order their release from the Kumkapı Removal Centre by way of an interim measure. In support of their arguments, the applicants relied on the Court ’ s judgments in the cases of Yarashonen ( cited above ) and Musaev v. Turkey, (no. 72754/11, 21 October 2014), as well as on the reports of the Human Rights Inquiry Committee of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”), the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants, the European Commission and the Human Rights Institution of Turkey, where the adverse conditions of detention at the Kumkapı Removal Centre had been noted and criticised. The applicants also alleged that, apart from the unsuitable physical conditions at the Kumkapı Removal Centre, they had been deprived of their liberty in an unlawful manner and that they had not had an effective remedy to complain about the unlawfulness and the conditions of their detention. They emphasised in this connection that the numerous cases that they had brought before the Istanbul Magistrates ’ Court to challenge the lawfulness of their detention had been dismissed by that court on stereotypical grounds without any real assessment of the lawfulness issue."

            [

On 29 December 2014 the applicants sent a letter to the Constitutional Court complaining about the failure of that court to deliver a decision on their interim measure request, despite the fact that two weeks had passed since they had made the request. The applicants pleaded in particular that the physical conditions of detention at the Kumkapı Removal Centre, where they had now been held for over two months, were putting the three small children ’ s physical integrity in danger and damaging their health."

            [
                "35. On 9 January 2015 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicants ’ request for an interim measure. It found that the applicants had failed to lay the basis of an arguable claim that there was an immediate and serious risk to their lives or their physical or mental integrity on account of the conditions of detention at the Kumkapı Removal Centre. The court considered that the applicants ’ allegations concerning the problems of hygiene and the lack of adequate food and fresh air at the centre, and their argument that such conditions constituted an actual and personal risk for them, were not sufficient to justify an interim measure. The Constitutional Court noted, however, that the State authorities were responsible for providing basic and urgent health services to persons held in removal centres."
            ],
            [
                "36. On 24 May 2018 the Constitutional Court delivered its judgment on the applicants ’ case. After setting out the facts – where it noted, inter alia, that there had been no official order for the minor applicants ’ detention prior to their transfer to Gaziantep – it moved on to assess the admissibility of the case. It reiterated at the outset the requirement to exhaust all administrative and legal remedies before lodging an application with the Constitutional Court. Referring to its decision in the case of K.A. (no. 2014/13044, 11 November 2015, see paragraphs 53-58 below), it stated that it had held in the past that there had been no effective remedies available in Turkish law to complain about the conditions of detention at foreigners ’ removal centres or the unlawfulness of foreigners ’ administrative detention. It then stressed, however, that it had recently changed that jurisprudence in the case of B.T. (no. 2014/15769, 30 November 2017, see paragraphs 59-62 below), where it had held that an action for a full remedy ( tam yargı davası ) before the administrative courts could provide an effective remedy in respect of complaints concerning both the conditions and the unlawfulness of the administrative detention of foreigners, provided, respectively, that (i) the individual was no longer being held in the conditions complained of, and (ii) the unlawfulness of the detention had already been established by a magistrates ’ court. The Constitutional Court held that there was no reason to depart from the findings in the B.T. case in the present circumstances, and therefore declared the applicants ’ complaints inadmissible for failure to lodge an action for a full remedy before the administrative courts. The Constitutional Court stressed, in respect of the applicants ’ complaint under Article 5, that their detention had already been declared unlawful by the Gaziantep Magistrates ’ Court on 5 February 2015."
            ],
            [
                "37. The Constitutional Court also emphasised that although the aforementioned change of jurisprudence in the case of B.T. had been published in the Official Gazette on 16 February 2018, any such complaints lodged with the Constitutional Court before that date, without having first seized the administrative courts, would still be declared inadmissible on the grounds of non-exhaustion. That said, in the event that such applicants sought to have recourse to the administrative ‑ law remedy at issue after the inadmissibility decisions delivered by the Constitutional Court in respect of them, the administrative courts would be required to assess compliance with the time-limit rules for bringing an administrative action in a manner that would not prejudice the right of access to a court."

The Government were further requested to inform the Court whether the conditions of the applicants ’ detention at the Kumkapı Removal Centre were compatible with Article 3 of the Convention and, in particular, whether those conditions could be considered appropriate for the second, third and fourth applicants in view of their young age.

A medical doctor was available at the premises every Thursday, in addition to a nurse, who was present daily. In seasons when the weather allowed, the detainees were permitted to go out to the yard for fresh air after 5 p.m., but during winter months they were not allowed to go out, to prevent them from getting sick.

Smoking was allowed in all of the dormitories, including those where babies were present, whereas, under section 59(1)( ç ) of Law no. 6458, families with children had to be kept in a separate area.

It further stated that the applicant, K.A., had not brought his complaints concerning the material conditions of his detention to the attention of the relevant administrative authorities.

The Constitutional Court first examined whether there had been effective remedies at K.A. ’ s disposal to complain about his conditions of detention. Referring mainly to the principles cited in the case of Ananyev and Others v. Russia (nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, §§ 93-119, 10 January 2012), and noting that K.A. had lodged his first two applications while still detained in the impugned conditions, the Constitutional Court held at the outset that in order to be considered effective, the domestic remedy in question had to be capable of ameliorating the conditions complained of, as well as providing the victim with an enforceable right to compensation for the damage that he or she had suffered because of those conditions. It then went on to note that the newly enacted Law no. 6458 did not set out any standards of detention at foreigners ’ removal centres. Nor did it envisage any administrative or legal appeal mechanisms capable of assessing the conditions at removal centres and ordering the amelioration of those conditions or release from the centre, as appropriate. The Ministry of Justice had not mentioned the existence of any such remedies in their observations, either. Moreover, the magistrates ’ court had not examined K.A. ’ s complaints regarding the conditions of detention, despite the fact he had raised those complaints along with his allegations concerning the unlawfulness of his detention. In these circumstances, the Constitutional Court found that K.A. had not had an effective remedy at his disposal by which to raise his grievances concerning the conditions of detention at the Kumkapı Removal Centre, in breach of the right to an effective remedy under Article 40 of the Constitution."

The Constitutional Court further held that the material conditions of detention that K.A. had been subjected to at the Kumkapı Removal Centre (between 26 April 2014 and 6 January 2015) had constituted treatment incompatible with human dignity. It found, in particular, that the overcrowding at the Kumkapı Removal Centre, coupled with K.A. ’ s inability to go outdoors on a regular basis and the inadequacy of the communal indoor areas, had been in breach of Article 17 of the Constitution. In making that finding, the Constitutional Court mainly relied on (i) the Court ’ s case-law, and in particular the judgment in Yarashonen (cited above, §§ 70-81); (ii) the standards of the CPT concerning the conditions of detention of foreign nationals; and (iii) the aforementioned report of the National Human Rights Institution of Turkey of 6 November 2014 on the conditions at the Kumkapı Removal Centre (see paragraphs 47-52 above)."

As regards the latter complaint, the Constitutional Court noted that the magistrates ’ court had failed to carry out an adequate examination of K.A. ’ s application, even though Law no. 6458 contained provisions protecting detainees against arbitrariness.

Therefore, a legal remedy which offered reasonable prospects of compensating him for the damage he had suffered as a result of the adverse material conditions of detention would be considered effective for the purposes of Article 40 of the Constitution. The Constitutional Court noted in this connection that section 2 of the Administrative Procedure Act provided a remedy whereby compensation for all damage arising from the acts and omissions of the administration could be claimed before the administrative courts – namely by lodging an action for a full remedy. The fact that that remedy had never been tried and tested by any foreigners in B.T. ’ s position did not mean that it did not offer reasonable prospects of success. Bearing in mind that the decisions ordering the detention of foreigners were administrative in nature, and the removal centres where they were held were operated and inspected by the Ministry of the Interior, there was no reason why B.T. could not bring an action for compensation against the Ministry on account of the conditions in which he had been kept at the Kumkapı Removal Centre. According to the Constitutional Court, there was no doubt that administrative courts had the capacity to determine whether the conditions of detention had been adequate or not and to compensate B.T. as necessary. The Constitutional Court further noted that administrative courts were better placed than it was to assess the conditions of detention at removal centres within their jurisdiction as, unlike the Constitutional Court, they could perform on-site inspections and obtain expert reports."

Since, on the instant facts, B.T. ’ s detention had been considered lawful by the Istanbul Magistrates ’ Court, B.T. could not be expected to bring an action before the administrative courts to claim compensation for damage sustained prior to lodging an individual application with the Constitutional Court. After laying out this ground rule as regards the exhaustion requirements in the context of claims concerning the unlawfulness of administrative detention, the Constitutional Court went on to find a violation in respect of all the complaints raised by B.T. concerning his right to liberty and security.",

Most of the dormitories in these centres were severely overcrowded and, as a result, inmates had to share beds or sleep on (often filthy) mattresses on the floor. Further, the general state of hygiene and cleanliness at İzmir and Kumkapı was rather poor; in particular, the communal sanitary facilities were invariably dirty [footnote: As regards Kumkapı Removal Centre, this was in sharp contrast with the situation observed by the CPT in this establishment in 2009 (cf. paragraph 45 of CPT/Inf (2011) 13)].

Clearly, the commitments subsequently given by the Turkish authorities to remedy the situation have not been followed up [footnote: The lack of outdoor exercise for male adult detainees at Kumkapı Removal Centre was the subject of an immediate observation during the CPT ’ s 2009 visit to this establishment.

Migrant children are sometimes detained together with their parents when the latter are found to be in an irregular situation, justified on the basis of maintaining family unity. Not only may this violate the principle of the best interests of the child and the right of the child to be detained only as a measure of last resort, but it may also violate their right not be punished for the acts of their parents (art. 2, para. 2). This does not mean that the best interests of the child are served through splitting up the family by detaining the parents and transferring their children to the alternative ‑ care system. The detention of their parents has a detrimental effect on children, and may violate children ’ s right not to be separated from their parents against their will, as well as the right to protection of the family set forward in article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 10 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. A decision to detain migrants who are accompanied by their children should therefore only be taken in very exceptional circumstances.

The relevant parts of the joint general comment read as follows (footnotes omitted):",
                "5. Every child, at all times, has a fundamental right to liberty and freedom from immigration detention. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has asserted that the detention of any child because of their or their parents ’ migration status constitutes a child rights violation and contravenes the principle of the best interests of the child. In this light, both Committees have repeatedly affirmed that children should never be detained for reasons related to their or their parents ’ migration status and States should expeditiously and completely cease or eradicate the immigration detention of children. Any kind of child immigration detention should be forbidden by law and such prohibition should be fully implemented in practice.",
                "9. The Committees emphasize the harm inherent in any deprivation of liberty and the negative impact that immigration detention can have on children ’ s physical and mental health and on their development, even when they are detained for a short period of time or with their families. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has stated that “within the context of administrative immigration enforcement ... the deprivation of liberty of children based on their or their parents ’ migration status is never in the best interests of the child, exceeds the requirement of necessity, becomes grossly disproportionate and may constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of migrant children”.",
                "10. Article 37 (b) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child establishes the general principle that a child may be deprived of liberty only as a last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. However, offences concerning irregular entry or stay cannot under any circumstances have consequences similar to those derived from the commission of a crime. Therefore, the possibility of detaining children as a measure of last resort, which may apply in other contexts such as juvenile criminal justice, is not applicable in immigration proceedings as it would conflict with the principle of the best interests of the child and the right to development.",
                "11. Instead, States should adopt solutions that fulfil the best interests of the child, along with their rights to liberty and family life, through legislation, policy and practices that allow children to remain with their family members and/or guardians in non-custodial, community-based contexts while their immigration status is being resolved and the children ’ s best interests are assessed, as well as before return. ... When children are accompanied, the need to keep the family together is not a valid reason to justify the deprivation of liberty of a child. When the child ’ s best interests require keeping the family together, the imperative requirement not to deprive the child of liberty extends to the child ’ s parents and requires the authorities to choose non-custodial solutions for the entire family (emphasis added).",
                "12. Consequently, child and family immigration detention should be prohibited by law and its abolishment ensured in policy and practice. Resources dedicated to detention should be diverted to non-custodial solutions carried out by competent child protection actors engaging with the child and, where applicable, his or her family. The measures offered to the child and the family should not imply any kind of child or family deprivation of liberty and should be based on an ethic of care and protection, not enforcement. ... Children and families should have access to effective remedies in case any kind of immigration detention is enforced.",

They should have access to administrative and judicial remedies against decisions affecting their own situation or that of their parents, to guarantee that all decisions are taken in their best interests. ...Unless it is contrary to the child ’ s best interests, speedy proceedings should be encouraged, provided that this does not restrict any due process guarantees.”",

When assessing conditions of detention, account must be taken of the cumulative effects of these conditions, as well as of specific allegations made by the applicant (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, § 46, ECHR 2001 ‑ II). The length of the period during which a person is detained in the particular conditions must also be considered (see, among other authorities, Alver v.

The Court has already had occasion to rule on the detention of children in custodial facilities in an immigration context in cases such as Mubilanzila Mayeka and Kaniki Mitunga v Belgium (no. 13178/03, §§ 50-59, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI), Muskhadzhiyeva and Others v.

The Council of Europe Special Representative of the Secretary General on migration and refugees, Mr Tomáš Boček, noted the presence of a separate living area with two rooms for families, as well as a separate internal courtyard with a playground for children, at the Kumkapı Removal Centre during his visit in the summer of 2016 (see paragraph 66 above). However, there was no mention of such a separate area reserved for families or any playground in the aforementioned reports of the National Human Rights Institution of Turkey or the CPT. Indeed, the NHRI was critical of the fact that families with children were not being kept in a separate area, despite the requirement to that effect in section 59(1)( ç ) of Law no. 6458, and the CPT expressly indicated in its report that there was no play area for children at the Kumkapı Removal Centre at the material time.

In particular, while the Government claimed that the detainees were allowed to go outdoors “in appropriate weather conditions”, they did not state whether the applicants had benefited from that right or how often such authorisation had been granted. In any event, as the Court has stressed in many cases, access to outdoor exercise is a fundamental component of the protection afforded to persons deprived of their liberty under Article 3 and as such it cannot be left to the discretion of the authorities (see, for instance, Yarashonen, cited above, § 78).

The Court would stress that the manifestly adverse conditions of detention at the Kumkapı Removal Centre, which have led to findings of violation even in respect of adult applicants, were particularly unsuitable for the applicant children in view of their extreme vulnerability and were completely at odds with the widely recognised international principles on the protection of children (see, mutatis mutandis, Popov, cited above, § 96 and the international texts noted in paragraphs 67-79 above). In these circumstances, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine the applicants ’ remaining complaints under Article 3 regarding their detention at the Kumkapı Removal Centre, such as the failure of the authorities to provide the minor applicants with the necessary medical assistance in a timely manner (see Alimov, cited above, § 84, and Boudraa v.

Although they sent photographs of some of the rooms from the Gaziantep Removal Centre, it is not at all clear in which one of those rooms the applicants had actually stayed and with how many other people.

Importantly, the Government have also not explained if and how the Gaziantep Removal Centre had been equipped with the essential infrastructure required for the detention of young children with their parents. To the contrary, the photographs they have submitted suggest that the minor applicants were made to sleep on iron-frame bunk ‑ beds with sharp edges, which could be dangerous for children their age (see Popov, cited above, § 95 for a critique on this particular point), and that they were not provided with any indoor or outdoor play areas.

However, in its subsequent decision in the case of Z.K. and Others v. Turkey, the Court acknowledged for the first time that an individual application before the Constitutional Court had the capacity to provide an effective remedy for grievances under Article 3 concerning conditions of detention at a foreigners ’ removal centre, and held that that remedy therefore had to be exhausted before lodging an application with the Court ((dec.), no. 60831/15, §§ 41-49, 7 November 2017)."

However, according to the information available to the Court, neither Law no. 6458 nor the regulations implementing it designated any specific remedies for complaints concerning conditions of detention at foreigners ’ removal centres. Indeed, Law no. 6458 limited the jurisdiction of the magistrates ’ courts to an assessment of the lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty alone.

The Court reiterates that the assessment of the effectiveness of any domestic remedy for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention depends on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint under the Convention. In the area of complaints about inhuman or degrading conditions of detention, the Court has already observed that two types of relief are possible: (i) an improvement in the material conditions of detention, and (ii) compensation for the damage or loss sustained on account of such conditions. If an applicant has been held in conditions that are in breach of Article 3, a domestic remedy capable of putting an end to the ongoing violation of his or her right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment is of the greatest value. However, once the applicant has left the facility in which he or she endured the inadequate conditions, he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for the violation that has already occurred (see Sergey Babushkin v. Russia, no. 5993/08, § 40, 28 November 2013)."

The timing and the content of their applications before both instances leave no doubt that the applicants sought immediate relief from the unacceptable conditions in which they were being held, as opposed to a purely compensatory award, and that they complained of the absence of any effective remedies in domestic law that could deliver that result. The Court will, therefore, assess whether – apart from a remedy providing compensation – the applicants had available to them a preventive remedy capable of putting an end to the ongoing violation of their right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment (see, mutatis mutandis, Shahanov v. Bulgaria, no. 16391/05, § 55, 10 January 2012; Gorbulya v. Russia, no. 31535/09, §§ 38 and 56, 6 March 2014; Vasilescu v.

Having regard to the scope of its jurisdiction and the powers entrusted to it – including the power to order interim measures in the event of an imminent risk of irreparable harm and to secure redress for violations – and the binding nature of its decisions, the Court considers that the individual-application procedure before the Constitutional Court had, in principle, the capacity to offer the applicants effective redress (see Z.K. and Others, cited above, §§ 43-49 for a similar finding).

On 9 January 2015 the Constitutional Court dismissed their request for an interim measure, holding that the material conditions of their detention did not constitute an immediate and serious risk to their lives or their physical or mental integrity. The applicants continued to be detained for almost another month after that decision, during which period the Constitutional Court did not rule on the admissibility or the merits of their case."

The Court notes that after lodging their application with the Constitutional Court, the applicants continued to be detained in highly unsuitable conditions for a not insignificant period. Having particular regard to the apparent vulnerability of the three minor applicants and to the well-known problems at the Kumkapı Removal Centre – which had been flagged up not only by international bodies but also by domestic authorities (see paragraphs 46-52 above) – and to the fact that the Constitutional Court was apparently acting as a first-instance court in the circumstances, that court could have been expected to show the necessary diligence in reviewing the applicants ’ complaints under Article 3. The Court stresses in this connection that the detention of children in adverse conditions for even very short periods of time, and even where they had been accompanied by an adult, has been found to amount to a violation of Article 3 (see, for instance, Muskhadzhiyeva and Others, cited above, § 63; Popov, cited above, 103; and A.B. and Others, cited above, § 115 ).

The Constitutional Court opted for the latter option: in a decision it delivered on 24 May 2018, the Constitutional Court held – relying on its findings in the recent case of B.T. – that “in the event of the release of the foreigner, the effective legal mechanism was that of the action for a full remedy” before the administrative courts, which had the capacity to compensate the victims as necessary (see paragraphs 36 and 60 above).

Therefore, a purely compensatory remedy available after release, whether before the Constitutional Court or elsewhere, could not have provided them with an effective remedy in respect of their specific complaints under Article 3 (see, mutatis mutandis, Vasilescu, cited above). The Court reiterates that the special importance attached by the Convention to Article 3 requires that the States Parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to the kind of treatment prohibited by Article 3 rapidly. Otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would legitimise particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention and unacceptably weaken the legal obligation on the State to bring its standards of detention into line with the Convention requirements (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 98)."

Under sections 57(6) and 68(7) of Law no. 6458, foreign nationals who have been placed in administrative detention under the relevant provisions may challenge the lawfulness of their detention before the magistrates ’ courts, which should rule on the lawfulness of the detention within five days by way of a final decision."

The Advisory Opinion of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the joint general comment of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on Migrant Workers have both stated that “when the child ’ s best interests require keeping the family together, the imperative requirement not to deprive the child of liberty extends to the child ’ s parents and requires the authorities to choose non-custodial solutions for the entire family” (see paragraphs 79 and 70 above, respectively). The PACE in its Resolution 2020 has similarly called on Member States to adopt alternatives to detention that meet the best interests of the child and allow children to remain with their family members in non-custodial, community-based contexts while their immigration status is being resolved. In addition, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants emphasised that States must carefully evaluate the need to detain migrants who are accompanied by their children (see paragraphs 72 and 69 above, respectively). The Court itself has acknowledged, albeit as part of discussions under Article 8, that the child ’ s best interests cannot be confined to keeping the family together and that the authorities have to take all the necessary steps to limit, as far as possible, the detention of families accompanied by children (see Popov, cited above, § 147)."

A literal reading of the relevant provision suggests that magistrates ’ courts only have jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of administrative decisions ordering the detention of a foreign national, thereby leaving individuals who are being detained without such a decision outside of their reach. Indeed, the reaction of the Istanbul Magistrates ’ Court vis- à -vis the persistent appeals of the applicants in the present case would appear to support that literal reading."

In its first decision dated 21 November 2014, although the Istanbul Magistrates ’ Court acknowledged the absence of a detention order in respect of the minor applicants, it did not rule on the lawfulness of their detention at the removal centre, apparently precisely because there had been no decision ordering their placement there in the first place (see paragraph 17 above). In its subsequent decisions, the court confined its examination to the lawfulness of the first applicant ’ s detention, without acknowledging in any way the distinct circumstances of the minor applicants. In these circumstances, the Court cannot but find that the judicial review mechanism provided for by Law no. 6458 does not appear to be capable of remedying situations of unlawful deprivation of liberty such as that in which the second, third and fourth applicants found themselves."

The review should, however, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the “lawful” detention of a person in accordance with Article 5 § 1 (see, for instance, Khlaifia and Others, cited above, § 128). It is, therefore, not enough for a court to confine itself to the existence of formal grounds for detention, without assessing the underlying lawfulness of the detention on the basis of those grounds (see, mutatis mutandis, Jėčius v.

The Istanbul Magistrate ’ s Court, which was the first ‑ instance court tasked with reviewing the lawfulness of the administrative detention for the initial period of three months while the applicants were detained in Istanbul, had either not undertaken such a review at all – in the case of the second, third and fourth applicants – or its review had been devoid of any effect.

In these circumstances, it goes without saying that in exceptional circumstances where the national authorities nevertheless decide to detain a child and his or her parents for immigration-related purposes, the lawfulness of such detention should be examined with particular expedition at all levels. In the absence of any information in the case file to explain why the Constitutional Court could not have examined the lawfulness of the applicants ’ detention while they remained in detention – which was a not insignificant period – the Court cannot hold that that court displayed the necessary diligence called for by the circumstances of the case.

This effectively meant that the question of the lawfulness of the applicants ’ detention during their initial three months in Istanbul was never subject to an effective judicial review as required under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, which could also undermine their prospects of receiving any compensation for that initial period."

Section 17 provided that where the mental disorder from which the person suffered was a persistent one manifested only by abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct (that is, a psychopathic or anti-social personality disorder), he could only be detained where medical treatment was likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of his condition. This reflected general medical pessimism as to the benefits of medical treatment for psychopaths. The sheriff was required to release a restricted patient where the patient was not suffering from a mental disorder making it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment, or it was not necessary for the health and safety of the patient or the protection of other persons that he receive such treatment (section 64 of the 1984 Act)."

While he was not convinced that the applicant’s period of treatment in the open hospital had improved his behaviour in any consistent fashion, the only possible reason to continue his detention in hospital was to attempt to modify his aggressive and seriously irresponsible conduct. In his view the only appropriate type of hospital management would be the more secure and structured organisation within the State hospital.

The national authorities had found that the applicant was suffering from a mental disorder warranting confinement. Where the medical experts had expressed conflicting opinions and the patient posed a risk to public safety, they considered that the Court should be slow to disturb their conclusions. Article 5 § 1 (e) was in any event not concerned with suitable treatment or conditions and it was not a precondition of the lawful detention of a person of unsound mind that treatment was available to him or that available treatment was to any extent beneficial. A person could be detained in conformity with the Convention where this was necessary in his own interests, or for the protection of the public or on both medical and social grounds.

Since 1967, he had continued to suffer from a persisting mental disorder established by objective medical expertise and warranting his compulsory confinement in the State hospital. Although by 1980 his problems no longer included mental deficiency, his medical history showed that he continued to suffer from a persisting mental disorder, namely a psychopathic personality disorder. He also remained a risk to the public and the treatment available to him in the structured environment of the State hospital prevented deterioration in his condition. Even if there was disagreement in 1994 amongst the experts as to his treatability, there was sufficient evidence that the care under medical supervision in the hospital prevented deterioration and constituted medical treatment."

These proceedings have not resulted in any findings of unlawfulness, procedural or substantive. While the Court exercises a certain power of review, it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, amongst many authorities, Kemmache v.

The applicant’s argument, essentially, is that he is now recognised as suffering from a psychopathic personality disorder that cannot be treated in hospital and that accordingly his detention in hospital is inappropriate and therefore arbitrary. He supports this argument with reference, inter alia, to the reports of the doctors considered at the hearing before the sheriff in June and July 1994, the finding of the Inner House of the Court of Session that the sheriff had erred in considering that he was treatable on the basis of the medical evidence, and the fact that when he was convicted for a new offence in 1986 he was not found to be suffering from a mental disorder making it appropriate for him to receive hospital treatment."

There is no such requirement imposed by Article 5 § 1 (e) of the Convention (see Koniarska v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 33670/96, 12 October 2000 ). The Court’s case-law refers rather to the applicant being properly established as suffering from a mental disorder of a degree warranting compulsory confinement. Such confinement may be necessary not only where a person needs therapy, medication or other clinical treatment to cure or alleviate his condition, but also where the person needs control and supervision to prevent him, for example, causing harm to himself or other persons (see, for example, Witold Litwa v.

Since he was first detained in 1967, considerable time has elapsed and medical, psychiatric and legal developments have, inevitably, occurred. Most recently, the Court notes that the law has been amended to make it clear in cases such as the applicant’s that the fact that the mental disorder is not treatable in clinical terms does not render release compulsory where a risk to the public remains (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” above, paragraph 35)."

It would note that, even if the applicant’s condition is not currently perceived as curable or amenable to treatment, the sheriff found on the basis of the evidence before him that the applicant derived benefit from the hospital environment and that his symptoms became worse outside its supportive structure.

The House of Lords, which did not itself decide whether he was treatable, recognised that the Inner House would have been entitled to form the view it did on an appeal but that on judicial-review principles the sheriff’s decision could not be challenged as unlawfully perverse.

As regarded the adjournment before the House of Lords, this had been requested by the Secretary of State and he had been advised to agree as one such adjournment would generally be allowed. Although he retained the annual right to appeal to the sheriff, this right was meaningless given the view of the law which prevailed at the time.

In that case the Secretary of State had conceded that the burden of proof should not be on the patient to prove that his detention no longer complied with the legal requirements. In similar cases in Scotland (for example, Lyons, cited at paragraph 39 above), the Scottish ministers had also accepted that the Convention required them to bear the burden of proof and had argued that section 64 should be read to give this effect. The applicant rejected the Government’s argument that in the circumstances the burden of proof was irrelevant. The authorities in his case should have had to prove to the sheriff that the applicant was treatable on a balance of probabilities. Instead the applicant had had to prove that he was not treatable.

This review was wide enough to bear on all the conditions essential for the lawful detention of a person of unsound mind. They submitted that Article 5 § 4 did not require that an appeal against the sheriff’s decision also be available. Judicial review of the decision, although not an appeal system allowing the higher courts to substitute their view on the merits, was a useful supplement to the sheriff’s proceedings, as it permitted a close scrutiny by more senior judges of the decision taken, in line with the principles of judicial review which included scrutiny of the nature and sufficiency of the evidence.

The burden of proof was not a determining factor of the case unless the court was ultimately unable to come to a definite conclusion on the evidence or some part of it. In practice, both the patient and the State led evidence on the issue of whether the lawful criteria for detention were met and it was normal practice in Scotland for the State to lead evidence that the patient was continuing to suffer from a mental disorder. In the present case, the sheriff, who had had the inestimable advantage of hearing the witnesses, found it to be established that he suffered from a mental disorder and that there was a high probability that he would reoffend. He thus came to a definite conclusion on the evidence and no question of onus arose. The Government agreed that section 64 was broadly analogous to sections 72 and 73 in issue in Ex parte H. (cited at paragraph 39 above), since which the law had been changed by a remedial order. The Scottish Ministers in Lyons (cited at paragraph 39 above) had accepted that the burden of proof lay on them in appeals brought by a patient and the Government also accepted that the State was required to satisfy the court of the positive facts which warranted the continuing detention of a patient. This accorded with what had been the previous practice.

However, there was another issue before the sheriff concerning the domestic-law requirement that the applicant’s mental illness was amenable to treatment. On that point, the medical experts differed, the sheriff noting that the majority of the opinions were to the effect that the applicant’s condition was not curable and that the medical treatment provided by the State hospital had not alleviated and would not alleviate his condition. Of the seven consultant psychiatrists who had given evidence, he referred to two doctors’ assessments that the applicant had improved or benefited from the care and stability provided in the hospital environment. In reaching his decision to reject his appeal, the sheriff stated, in terms referring to the onus of proof placed on the applicant by section 64 of the 1984 Act, that he had not been satisfied that the applicant was not now suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or degree which made it appropriate for him to be liable to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment.

However, even taking those delays into account, the Court observes that there was a lapse of time of three months and eight days between the applicant’s application to the Outer House of the Court of Session and the decision dismissing his appeal; of nine months and ten days between the lifting by the Inner House of the Court of Session of the adjournment (granted for the applicant to obtain legal aid) on 12 November 1996 and its judgment on 22 August 1997; and of seven months and three days between the setting down of the case for hearing by the House of Lords and the delivery of its judgment on 3 December 1998."

                "78. While it is true that Article 5 § 4 guarantees no right, as such, to an appeal against decisions ordering or extending detention, it follows from the aim and purpose of this provision that its requirements must be respected by appeal courts if an appeal lies against a decision (see Rutten v. the Netherlands, no. 32605/96, § 53, 24 July 2001, and Navarra v. France, judgment of 23 November 1993, Series A no. 273-B, p. 28, § 28). The applicant’s applications challenging the sheriff’s decision were not, in the domestic sense, full appeals on fact and law but involved judicial review, principally, of lawfulness and propriety of procedure. As the appellate instances were nonetheless involved in ruling on issues concerning the lawfulness of his continued detention and this could have potentially led to his release, the Court sees no reason why they should not be taken into account as part of the proceedings. The fact that in Scotland there is a four-tier system of review cannot serve to justify the applicant being deprived of his rights under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. It is for the State to organise its judicial system in such a way as to enable its courts to comply with the requirements of that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, R.M.D. v. Switzerland, judgment of 26 September 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2015, § 54, and G.B. v. Switzerland, no. 27426/95, § 38, 30 November 2000 )."

The Court observes that in Rutten (cited above) it found a breach of the speed requirement of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention where the first-instance court took two months and seventeen days to issue its decision and the appellate court took a further three months to give judgment concerning the applicant’s application for release from the secure institution where he was receiving treatment. The longer delays which appear in this case cannot be justified either by the complexity of the case or the exigencies of internal procedure. While one year per instance may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 § 1 cases, Article 5 § 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition."

However after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty.

Examining the lawfulness of, and justification for, the applicant ’ s continued detention the district and regional courts persistently relied on the gravity of the charges as the main factor for the assessment of the applicant ’ s potential to abscond, obstruct the course of justice or re-offend. However, the Court has repeatedly held that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, § 51; also see Panchenko v.

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina, cited above, § 67; Ilijkov, cited above, §§ 84-85)."

Such assessment should be based on personal circumstances of the detainee. In the present case, the domestic courts did not point to any aspects of the applicant ’ s character or behaviour that would justify their conclusion that she presented a persistent flight risk. The applicant, on the other hand, constantly invoked the facts mitigating the risk of her absconding. However, the domestic courts devoted no attention to discussion of the applicant ’ s arguments that she had no criminal record, had a permanent place of residence and employment in Vladimir, a stable way of life, two minor children, and that her father had been seriously ill.

Nor did the domestic courts explain in their decisions why alternatives to the deprivation of liberty would not have ensured that the trial would follow its proper course. This failure is made all the more inexplicable by the fact that the new Code of Criminal Procedure expressly requires the domestic courts to consider less restrictive domestic measures as an alternative to custody (see paragraph 47 above)."

However, after the evidence had been collected, that ground became irrelevant. Moreover, the domestic authorities gave no reasons why they believed that there was such a risk. The Government referred to the records of the applicant ’ s telephone conversations and submitted that she could intimidate witnesses or forge evidence.

In most decisions the domestic courts used the same summary formula and stereotyped wording. The District Court ’ s decisions of 19 July and 2 August 2005 gave no grounds whatsoever for the applicant ’ s continued detention. It only noted that “the applicant should remain in custody”. It is even more striking that by that time the applicant had already spent a year in custody, the investigation had completed and the case had been referred for trial."

It is also peculiar that in the decision of 22 February 2005 the Regional Court held that it was not required to hear the parties ’ opinion concerning the materials submitted by the prosecutor in support of the request for an extension. In this connection the Court recalls that Article 5 § 3 obliges the “officer” to hear himself the accused, to examine all the facts militating for and against pre-trial detention and to set out in the decision on detention the facts upon which that decision is based (see Hood v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27267/95, § 60, ECHR 1999 ‑ I; Schiesser v. Switzerland, judgment of 4 December 1979, Series A no. 34, § 31). Therefore, the extension of the applicant ’ s detention without hearing her opinion, giving her an opportunity to comment on the materials submitted by the prosecutor and having proper regard to her arguments in favour of the release is incompatible with the guarantees enshrined in Article 5 § 3 of the Convention."

Finally, the Court observes that at no point in the proceedings did the domestic authorities consider whether the length of the applicant ’ s detention had exceeded a “reasonable time”. Such an analysis should have been particularly prominent in the domestic decisions after the applicant had spent many months in custody, however the reasonable-time test has never been applied."

                "83. Having regard to the above, the Court considers that by failing to address concrete facts or consider alternative “preventive measures” and by relying essentially on the gravity of the charges, the authorities prolonged the applicant ’ s detention on grounds which cannot be regarded as “relevant and sufficient”. In those circumstances it is not necessary to examine whether the case was complex and whether the proceedings were conducted with “special diligence”. However, in the present case the Court cannot but disagree with the Government ’ s assertion that the applicant ’ s refusal to testify slowed the proceedings down and generated delays which were attributable to her. The applicant was not obliged to co-operate with the authorities and she cannot be blamed for having taken full advantage of her right to silence (see, mutadis mutandis, Yağcı and Sargın v. Turkey, judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319 ‑ A, § 66; W. v. Switzerland, judgment of 26 January 1993, Series A no. 254 ‑ A, § 42). It was incumbent on the prosecutors to collect evidence and conduct the investigation in such a way that ensures the applicant ’ s trial within a reasonable time. The Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that the delays in the investigation were attributable to the applicant."

Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 § 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see Reinprecht v. Austria, no. 67175/01, § 31, ECHR 2005 ‑ ... ., with further references). The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties. In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 § 1 (c), a hearing is required (see Trzaska v. Poland, no. 25792/94, § 74, 11 July 2000 ). The possibility for a detainee to be heard either in person or through some form of representation features among the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty (see Kampanis v. Greece, judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 318 ‑ B, § 47)."

Only the applicant herself could describe the conditions and answer the judges ’ questions, if any. Moreover, it was her first opportunity to bring this matter to the attention of the domestic courts, for she could not have advance knowledge of the conditions of detention at the hearing of 24 July 2004 when she had been remanded in custody. Secondly, it appears that the appeal court founded its reasoning on its assessment of the applicant ’ s “character”. It did so on the basis of written documents without questioning the applicant in person and affording her an opportunity to describe her personal situation. The Court finally notes that it was for the first time that the appeal court examined the facts arguing for and against her placement in custody. Given the importance of the first appeal hearing, the appeal court ’ s reliance on the applicant ’ s character, and her intention to plead release on account of the particular conditions of her detention, her attendance was required to give satisfactory information and instructions to her counsel (see Graužinis v.

Moreover, when the applicant requested the disqualification of the experts, his request was denied twice by the investigation authorities (see paragraphs 19 and 24 above).

In particular, the prosecution had referred the case back to the investigation three times. In one of those instances there had ensued a dispute as to whether some of the charges against the applicant should be dropped, which had taken additional time to resolve. Also, the authorities had generally failed to display great diligence in dealing with the case. The Government’s argument that the preparation of the expert reports had been time ‑ consuming was not very convincing because the investigator in charge of the case could have performed all other investigative steps while awaiting their preparation."

However, even assuming that these appeal procedures were not an effective remedy, the applicant should have then applied to the Court within six months of the date of the investigator ’ s decision, which he had failed to do. As regards the civil claims lodged by the applicant on 11 September 2007 and 26 February 2009, taking into account the fact that the applicant had failed to contest the investigator ’ s decision of 21 June 2005, whereby the police officers ’ actions had been considered to be justified, the fact of the applicant ’ s alleged ill-treatment had never been established. He had not been recognised as a victim and lost the right to compensation under Armenian law. Consequently, the applicant ’ s civil claims had had no prospects of success and had therefore not been an effective remedy."

In particular, following the investigator ’ s decision of 21 June 2005 the fact of his ill-treatment had been established by final and binding judgments adopted in his criminal case which in effect had annulled that decision. In such circumstances, he had not been required to lodge an appeal and the prosecutor had been obliged to institute a criminal case against the police officers pursuant to Articles 175 and 176 of the CCP. Thereafter, because of the inaction of the investigative authorities, he had lodged a complaint with the courts on 27 November 2007, seeking to institute a criminal case on the basis of the final judgments and to bring the perpetrators to justice. The final decision in those proceedings had been taken by the Court of Cassation on 8 April 2009. Thus, he had complied with the requirements of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. As regards his civil claims, Armenian law at the material time had not envisaged compensation for non-pecuniary damage under any circumstances. It was therefore wrong to link his entitlement to compensation to the fact that no further investigation had been conducted into his allegations of ill-treatment, because he would not have been entitled to such compensation in any event."

The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged (see Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.) [GC], nos. 46113/99 et al., ECHR 2010). The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Paksas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 34932/04, § 75, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non ‑ exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Kennedy v. the United Kingdom, no. 26839/05, § 109, 18 May 2010). Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 76, ECHR 1999 ‑ V )."

The Court also reiterates that where it is clear from the outset that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the six ‑ month period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see, among other authorities, Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, § 157, ECHR 2009 ). Where an applicant avails himself or herself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (ibid., § 158 )."

His allegations were dismissed by the investigator examining his criminal case in a decision adopted on 21 June 2005 and entitled “ a decision to discontinue a part of a criminal case and not to carry out criminal prosecution” (see paragraph 17 above). The Government argued that the applicant could have contested the investigator ’ s decision under Articles 263 and 290 of the CCP, which he had failed to do.

This could be seen as a first step towards launching a fresh investigation into the applicant ’ s allegations of ill-treatment. The Court notes, however, that that decision was quashed upon appeal by the Criminal Court of Appeal on 12 November 2006, which, while accepting the fact of the applicant ’ s ill ‑ treatment, nevertheless refused to request an investigation into that fact and instead applied the provisions concerning the reopening of a criminal case and found the possibility of reopening to be prohibited under Article 21 of the CCP (see paragraph 20 above). The applicant neither lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment, nor – assuming that such an appeal was not an effective remedy – applied to the Court within six months from the date of that judgment, and instead tried to raise that issue once again before the courts, using a procedure which had no prospects of success (see paragraphs 22 - 28 above). However, it ought to have become clear to the applicant at that stage, at the latest as from 12 November 2006, that there would be no further investigation into his allegations of ill-treatment and any new attempts to apply to the courts with the same issue would be futile. The Court is therefore prevented of taking the proceedings instituted by the applicant on 27 November 2007 into account for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention."

It reiterates that in the area of unlawful use of force by State agents – and not mere fault, omission or negligence – civil or administrative proceedings aimed solely at awarding damages, rather than ensuring the identification and punishment of those responsible, are not considered adequate and effective remedies capable of providing redress for complaints based on the substantive aspect of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (see Mocanu and Others v.

Thus, even if the investigator had decided not to prosecute the police officers by his decision of 21 June 2005, the fact of his ill-treatment and the unlawfulness of the police actions had been unequivocally established by the judgment of the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan of 16 February 2006 and the higher courts. He therefore had had an arguable claim before the civil courts of having been subjected to treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention.

The applicant, however, had failed to avail himself of this opportunity by not lodging a timely appeal against the investigator ’ s decision of 21 June 2005. Thus, the final domestic decision concerning the applicant ’ s alleged ill-treatment had been the decision of 21 June 2005, according to which the actions of the police officers had been found to be lawful, and consequently his civil claims had had no prospects of success. Accordingly, in the absence of a finding by a relevant authority of a violation of the applicant ’ s rights guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention, he had no “arguable claim” under Article 13 in relation to his allegations of ill-treatment."

In the present case, the Government argued that the applicant had been precluded from seeking compensation for damages and had had no arguable claim since the fact of his ill-treatment had not been established by the investigator ’ s decision of 21 June 2005, which was the final decision on that matter. The Court notes, in this connection, that there is nothing in the domestic law that appears to have automatically deprived the applicant ’ s civil claims of any prospects of success in the absence of a criminal prosecution of the police officers. Moreover, the Government ’ s argument contradicts the circumstances of the case and the findings of the domestic courts. In particular, as already noted above, even if the police officers ’ actions were never a subject of criminal prosecution and the domestic courts consequently never established the fact of the applicant ’ s ill ‑ treatment in a criminal case against them, the courts in the applicant ’ s trial found it established that the police officers had acted violently against the applicant and had beaten him, causing him serious injuries and damage. The applicant was found to have acted in self-defence and the investigator ’ s decision, characterising the police officers ’ actions as lawful, was found to have been unfounded (see paragraph 18 above). Pursuant to Article 52 of the Code of Civil Procedures, those findings were binding on the civil courts (see paragraph 48 above), while Article 1063 of the Civil Code provided that the State was liable for any “unlawful actions” of the public authorities and their officials (see paragraph 52 above). It is notable that none of the applicant ’ s civil claims were dismissed by the courts for the reasons specified by the Government. His claim for compensation in respect of non ‑ pecuniary damage was dismissed on the grounds that that type of compensation was not provided for by the domestic law, while his claim for pecuniary damages was dismissed because the courts found no causal link between the ill-treatment and the specific medical costs claimed by the applicant (see paragraphs 30, 32 and 35 above). Moreover, in the latter proceedings the trial court explicitly stated that the applicant had a case for damages under Article 1063 of the Civil Code, taking into account the unlawfulness of the police officers ’ actions (see paragraph 35 above)."

He should therefore have had an effective remedy before the domestic courts. The applicant ’ s main grievance in this connection is the fact that no compensation for damage of a non-pecuniary nature was available to him at the material time under Armenian law in respect of his allegations of ill-treatment. The Court notes that it has already found, in similar circumstances, the unavailability of compensation for non-pecuniary damage under Armenian law to be in violation of the guarantees of Article 13 of the Convention (ibid. , §§ 45-48). There are no reasons to depart from that conclusion in the present case."

The Court reiterates that Article 5 § 5 is complied with where it is possible to apply for compensation in respect of a deprivation of liberty effected in conditions contrary to paragraphs 1, 2, 3 or 4. The right to compensation set forth in paragraph 5 therefore presupposes that a violation of one of the other paragraphs has been established, either by a domestic authority or by the Court (see, among other authorities, N.C. v. Italy [GC], no. 24952/94, § 49, ECHR 2002 ‑ X). Furthermore, Article 5 § 5 should not be construed as affording a right to compensation of purely pecuniary nature, but should also afford such right for any distress, anxiety and frustration that a person may suffer as a result of a violation of other provisions of Article 5 (see Khachatryan and Others v. Armenia, no. 23978/06, § 157, 27 November 2012, and Sahakyan v. Armenia, no. 66256/11, § 29, 10 November 2015)."

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that in acquitting the applicant the trial court found his arrest to have been effected unlawfully and his detention to have been unfounded (see paragraph 18 above). Thus, it can be said that the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty was in substance found to be in violation of the provisions of Article 5 and therefore Article 5 § 5 is applicable to the applicant ’ s case. His civil claim for non ‑ pecuniary damage, however, was rejected by the domestic courts on the grounds that Armenian law did not envisage “ compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage ” as a type of compensation."

Accordingly, the applicant ’ s convictions were not quashed with regard to a “new or newly discovered fact”, but due to reassessment by the Court of Cassation of the evidence that had been used in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. The applicant did not argue either that his convictions had been reversed on the grounds of a “new or newly discovered fact”.

The remainder of the applicant ’ s claim is therefore not supported by any proof and must be dismissed. As regards the EUR 3,000 payable under the contract, the Court has previously dismissed a similar objection by the Government (see Saghatelyan v. Armenia, no. 7984/06, §§ 61-63, 20 October 2015). On the other hand, legal costs are only recoverable in so far as they relate to the violation found (see Beyeler v. Italy (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 33202/96, § 27, 28 May 2002). The Court notes that the majority of the applicant ’ s complaints have been declared inadmissible. Hence, the legal costs claimed by the applicant cannot be awarded in full. Regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 500 to cover the costs under this head."
