A trial of a dead person inevitably runs counter to the above principles, because by its very nature it is incompatible with the principle of the equality of arms and all the guarantees of a fair trial. Moreover, it is self- evident that it is not possible to punish an individual who has died, and to that extent at least the criminal justice process is stymied. Any punishment imposed on a dead person would violate his or her dignity. Lastly, a trial of a dead person runs counter to the object and purpose of Article 6 of the Convention, as well as to the principle of good faith and the principle of effectiveness inherent in that Article."

A bruise on the right ankle had appeared three to six days before the death and had been the result of “ domestic trauma ”. The injuries were minor and had not led to Mr Magnitskiy ’ s death. He had died from acute cardiac failure and cerebral and pulmonary oedema induced by secondary dysmetabolic cardiomyopathy developed on account of diabetes and chronic hepatitis in its active form.

The expert listed a variety of tests that should have been performed during the acute stages of cholelithiasis and pancreatitis, and found it particularly significant that the first applicant ’ s medical records contained no indication that even most simple tests, such as clinical blood or urine analyses, had been carried out. The expert stressed that Mr Magnitskiy had not received the most effective treatment for cholelithiasis, a planned cholecystectomy, which should have been performed as it was generally accepted treatment for acute destructive pancreatitis. In the expert ’ s opinion, the evidential material presented gave no impression that the first applicant had any serious heart problems. The expert noted that cardiomyopathy could cause death as a result of an intensive overload, and that Mr Magnitskiy, by all appearances, had not experienced any such signs.

On 14 July 2011 the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation examined a complaint lodged by two individuals challenging the constitutionality of sub-paragraph 4 of the first paragraph of Article 24 and the first paragraph of Article 254 of the CCrP. The court concluded that the above-mentioned statutory provisions were unconstitutional, in so far as they provided for the possibility of terminating a criminal case owing to the death of a suspect, or an accused, without obtaining the consent of close relatives of the late suspect or accused. The Constitutional Court held, in particular, as follows:",
                "“ 2.1 ... respect for fundamental procedural guarantees of individual rights, including presumption of innocence, must also be secured while resolving a question concerning the termination of a criminal case with reference to non-rehabilitating circumstances. When taking a decision refusing to open a criminal case or deciding to terminate it at the pre-trial stage of the criminal proceedings, the competent bodies should accept as a starting- point that persons in respect of whom the criminal proceedings have been discontinued ... [ have not been found guilty of an offence] and cannot be viewed as such; in the constitutional sense these persons can only be viewed as having been involved in the criminal proceedings ... owing to the relevant suspicions or accusations ...",
                "At the same time, by discontinuing a criminal case owing to the death of a suspect (or an accused) [the authority] also stops the process of proving his or her guilt, but with this the accusation or suspicion is not being lifted, quite the contrary; in reality [the authority] reaches a conclusion as to the commission of the criminal act by ... a specific person and the impossibility of criminal prosecution owing to that person ’ s death. By that logic, the person in question, without the adoption or entry into force of any verdict, is declared guilty, and this constitutes a breach by the State of its duty to secure judicial protection of the person ’ s honour, dignity and good name guaranteed by [various provisions of] ... the Constitution, and – ... it constitutes a breach of the right of access to a court of persons whose interests may be affected by that decision ...",
                "2.2. Turning to the legal nature of the discontinuation of the case on non-rehabilitating grounds ... the Constitutional Court has concluded that a decision to discontinue criminal proceedings does not amount to a criminal sentence, and, consequently, it cannot be regarded as a legal act establishing the guilt of a person within the meaning of Article 49 of the Constitution of Russia [which reads: ‘ Everyone accused of committing a crime shall be considered innocent until his guilt is proven according to the rules fixed by federal law and confirmed by the sentence of a court which has come into legal force ’ ] (see Constitutional Court ’ s Ruling no. 18-P of 28 October 1996) ...",
                ". .. [in other words,] it is only possible to discontinue a criminal case with a general reference to non ‑ rehabilitating circumstances if the rights of the participants in the criminal proceedings are respected, which means, in particular, that there is a need to secure the consent of a suspect (or of an accused person) to take [such a decision] ...",

                "3. ... [ Having analysed the applicable domestic provisions, the Constitutional Court concludes that] the [ CCrP ] does not permit [relatives of the deceased person in respect of whom the criminal case was discontinued] to protect the rights of their deceased formerly accused relative. Since the interested persons, and first and foremost the close relatives of the deceased, are not allowed to take part in the proceedings, the [relevant] procedural decisions ... are taken by an investigator or a court – without the participation of the defence ...",
                "4. ... Such limitations do not have an objective or reasonable justification and entail a breach of [the constitutional rights of the persons in question ] ...",
                "5. ... [The Constitutional Court further decides that] the protection of the rights and legal interests of close relatives of the deceased person ... aimed at his or her rehabilitation should be secured by assigning them the necessary legal status and providing them with the ensuing legal rights within the framework of the criminal proceedings ...",
                "... [The Constitutional Court concludes that the rights provided for by Article 125 of the [ CCrP ] were insufficient to guarantee an adequate level of judicial protection to the persons concerned ...]",
                "6. ... [Thus, in cases where] close relatives object to the discontinuance of the proceedings as a result of the death of the formerly suspected or accused person, a competent investigative body or a court should proceed with the examination of the case. At the same time, the interested persons should have the same rights as the deceased person [himself or herself] would have enjoyed. ...”",
                "If the continued examination of the case reveals grounds for rehabilitation, the case is to be closed. If not, it is to be sent to a court for examination on the merits in compliance with the general rules of the criminal procedure. In that case, close relatives who insisted on the continuation of the proceedings with a view to obtaining rehabilitation, or their representative, must be summoned to protect the honour and good name of the deceased in court. During the examination of the case the court must establish the circumstances of the case, carry out a legal assessment of them, and also establish whether the accused was guilty, or not, of the alleged offence. Having examined the case in accordance with the general rules of the criminal procedure (with certain exceptions determined by the absence of the accused), the court must either ... acquit the person, or discontinue the proceedings under sub-paragraph 4 of paragraph 1 of Article 24 taken together with paragraph 1 of Article 254 of the CCrP ...",
                "With that in mind the federal legislature should amend the law to take account of the requirements of the Constitution and the present ruling. In particular, a list of persons who, along with close relatives [of the deceased], could ... seek the continuation of the criminal proceedings after the death of a suspect (accused) to have him rehabilitated must be specified. The amendments should set out a special procedure for inviting [the interested persons] to take part in the posthumous criminal proceedings and should describe their status in those proceedings. Lastly, they should set out the special features of the [posthumous ] investigation and trial, as well as the requirements for the court decision to discontinue the proceedings on relevant grounds. ”"

A failure on their part to submit convincing evidence on material conditions of detention may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well- foundedness of the applicant ’ s allegations (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 123; Gubin v. Russia, no. 8217/04, § 56, 17 June 2010; and Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, § 113, ECHR 2005 ‑ X (extracts))."

The decision to arrest him was only made after the investigating authority had learned of his application for an entry visa to the United Kingdom, and of his having booked tickets to Kyiv, and after it had been unable to find him at his place of residence (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). On the day following his arrest the first applicant was brought before a competent court, which had to decide on the preventive measure to be applied.

At the same time, the Court entertains doubts as to the validity of that argument to justify the first applicant ’ s continued detention. For the domestic courts to demonstrate that a substantial risk of collusion existed and continued to exist during the entire period of the first applicant ’ s detention, it did not suffice merely to refer to his official position.

Both investigative actions revealed injuries on the first applicant ’ s body. The recording of those injuries, as well as of possible head trauma, in the death confirmation certificate (see paragraph 93 above), together with the reference in the records to the use of a rubber truncheon, should have raised concerns as to the use of force against the first applicant."

For example, eyeball fluid and urine were not collected for toxicological examination, no such examination was performed in respect of the gallbladder and a puncture wound on the tongue, and the examination of the heart, brain and lungs was insufficiently thorough. Thus, important questions were unresolved (compare with Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 106, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII, and Jaloud v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 47708/08, §§ 212- 16, ECHR 2014).

The Court has already found in a number of cases where the authorities ’ failure to show diligence resulted in the prosecution becoming time-barred that the effectiveness of the investigation was irreparably damaged and the purpose of effective protection against acts of ill-treatment was frustrated (see, among many other authorities, V.K. v. Russia, no. 68059/13, § 189, 7 March 2017; İzci v. Turkey, no. 42606/05, § 72, 23 July 2013; Yazıcı and Others v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 45046/05, § 27, 23 April 2013; Ablyazov v.

The denial of justice was particularly flagrant because Mr Magnitskiy had died while the criminal proceedings against him had still been at the early stages of the investigation. The applicants referred to Ruling no. 16-P of the Russian Constitutional Court, which only allowed posthumous proceedings at the request of a suspect ’ s family for the purpose of rehabilitation.

The Court has also held that the next - of - kin might exceptionally have standing to lodge a complaint under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention if it is connected to a complaint under Article 2 of the Convention relating to the victim ’ s death or disappearance engaging the State ’ s liability (see Lykova v.

It is a fundamental aspect of the right to a fair trial that criminal proceedings should be adversarial and that there should be equality of arms between the prosecution and defence. The Court has held that in the interests of a fair and just criminal process it is of capital importance that the accused should appear at his trial (see Kashlev v. Estonia, no. 22574/08, § 37, 26 April 2016; Lala v. the Netherlands, 22 September 1994, § 33, Series A no. 297 ‑ A; and Poitrimol v. France, 23 November 1993, § 35, Series A no. 277 ‑ A ), and that the duty to guarantee the right of a criminal defendant to be present in the courtroom – either during the original proceedings or in a retrial – ranks as one of the essential requirements of Article 6 (see Stoichkov v. Bulgaria, no. 9808/02, § 56, 24 March 2005). Although this is not expressly mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 6, the object and purpose of the Article taken as a whole show that a person “charged with a criminal offence” is entitled to take part in the hearing (see Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 59, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII). The refusal to reopen proceedings conducted in the accused ’ s absence, without any indication that the accused has waived his or her right to be present during the trial, has been found to be a “flagrant denial of justice” rendering the proceedings “manifestly contrary to the provisions of Article 6 or the principles embodied therein” (see Sejdovic v.

Moreover, it is self- evident that it is not possible to punish an individual who has died, and to that extent at least the criminal justice process is stymied. Any punishment imposed on a dead person would violate his or her dignity. Lastly, a trial of a dead person runs counter to the object and purpose of Article 6 of the Convention, as well as to the principle of good faith and the principle of effectiveness inherent in that Article."

Turning to the arguments put forward by the Government, the Court accepts that there may be a need for judicial examination of criminal charges even in respect of a deceased person, in particular in the case of rehabilitation proceedings, the purpose of which is to correct a wrongful conviction. The Court reiterates the second and third applicants ’ arguments that they had never consented to the continuation of the criminal proceedings against the late Mr Magnitskiy and that therefore the authorities ’ decision to continue with his criminal case had run counter to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure as interpreted by the Constitutional Court in its Ruling no. 16-P (see paragraph 167 above). While acknowledging the important role of the Russian Constitutional Court in laying down rules governing posthumous criminal proceedings, as well as not losing sight of the Constitutional Court ’ s reliance on rehabilitation as the purpose of the continuation of the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 169 above), the Court does not consider it necessary to address the applicants ’ argument. It is of the view that judicial examination must be free of any risks of posthumous conviction of a person whose guilt had not been established by a court when he or she was alive."

Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, § 79, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV; and Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, § 165, ECHR 2011). This is so because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful ill-treatment by, inter alia, State agents to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough to prosecute and punish those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the legal prohibition on taking life, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Salman v.

In the first place, it should be observed that the incident which led to the death of Cihan Tunç occurred on 13 February 2004, that the prosecutor’s office was immediately informed and that the initial investigative measures were taken on the same day. On 30 June 2004 the prosecution service completed the investigations and issued a decision not to prosecute. On 14 October 2004 the military court allowed the applicants’ objections and ordered an additional investigation. The prosecution service issued its report on 8 December 2004, after having carried out the supplementary investigative measures. On 17 December 2004 the military court dismissed the applicants’ appeal. A copy of that decision was sent to the applicants’ lawyer a few days later. In those circumstances, the Court considers that the investigations in question were conducted with the requisite diligence and that there was no unjustified delay in the investigation."

In so far as the applicants complained about the fact that the autopsy report and the record listing the personal effects found on the deceased had been combined in one and the same document, the Court considers that no convincing arguments have been presented which would justify the conclusion that this could have been detrimental to the quality of the autopsy and, consequently, of the investigation."

With regard to the fact that the deceased’s clothing had been removed before the forensic medical expert arrived, the Court notes that this circumstance did not prevent those items from being examined to determine the firing distance. On the contrary, they were removed for the precise purpose of being sent to a forensic laboratory for tests, on the prosecutor’s instructions and under his supervision."

On this point, the Court specifies that any conclusions it might have reached with regard to the manner in which an autopsy was conducted in a given case concern that case alone, and certainly cannot be interpreted as implying that all of the autopsies carried out by that particular forensic doctor necessarily have significant shortcomings and that no credit can be given to his or her conclusions. In this respect, the Court reiterates that the adequacy of an autopsy must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of each case."

The dead man’s clothing was sent for technical tests, which provided scientific confirmation of the medical conclusions concerning the distance from which the shot had been fired and the entry and exit points of the bullet. The weapons and the spent cartridge found on the scene were also sent for scientific analysis."

Nonetheless, the Court considers that this shortcoming was not decisive. Even supposing that it had been possible, on completion of such testing, to obtain useable fingerprints, and specifically those of M.S., it is not certain that this would have had any important implications for the course of the investigation, given that M.S. had admitted touching the weapon in order to move it out of the way and assist his fellow serviceman (see paragraph 37 above). Furthermore, the case file shows that the applicants did not request any such testing as part of their appeal to the military court (see paragraph 62 above)."

With regard to the work carried out on the site of the incident, the Court notes that it was done long after the scene had been examined by the investigators and after the investigations had been closed for the first time. No negative impact of this work, which consisted in cementing over the earthen floor, on the quality of the reconstruction of events has been demonstrated. The ceiling height had been measured when the scene of the incident was originally secured, and in any event the floor levels had not been raised during the renovation work (see paragraph 67 above)."

The first of the posts in use was at the entrance to the site. The second was a sentry post located in the northern part of the site, which was referred to as the “low tower”, “tower no. 2”, or even “guard post no. 4”, on the ground that it was the fourth guard post from the entrance, given that the two posts located after the initial entrance post were not in use.

When his statement is taken in its entirety, however, it is clear that he is confusing the numerous names for the guard posts, since the sergeant specifies in the same statement, explicitly and on two occasions, that Cihan Tunç was on duty in the watchtower (“tower no. 3”, or the “high tower”)."

Moreover, it could be considered that M.S.’s statements contained inconsistencies, in that a quick reading of his statement to the internal investigator might give the impression that he had been standing seven or eight metres away from Cihan Tunç before leaving the sentry post (see paragraph 40 above), whilst the post in question measured 2 m x 2 m (see paragraph 27 above). However, if both of the statements are taken into account (see paragraphs 37 and 40 above), it is clear that M.S. indicated that he was standing several metres away from the sentry post."

It appears that the theory of suicide was discarded on account of the position of the body and the gun at the moment when the shot was fired (see paragraphs 63, 72 and 73 above). While the possibility of unlawful killing was ultimately dismissed by the prosecutor on the basis of insufficient evidence, it was certainly envisaged at the beginning of the investigation."

In addition, samples had been immediately taken from M.S.’s hands and his rifle had been submitted for analysis in order to ascertain the credibility of his version. The investigators had also questioned Cihan Tunç’s colleagues, in order to ascertain whether he had been involved in a dispute with anyone and, if necessary, to establish whether a motive existed for murder. It is clear that none of these measures would have been taken if the criminal hypothesis was not being seriously considered."

Romania, no. 3990/04, § 52, 20 October 2009; and Velcea and Mazăre, cited above, § 114), on the ground that such a situation was likely to prevent any effective challenge."

France [GC], no. 47287/99, § 67, ECHR 2004-I). With regard to the criminal head of Article 6, the Court reiterates that the wording itself of Article 6 (“against him”) makes it clear that in criminal cases the guarantees of that provision protect the person who faces a criminal charge (see, to similar effect, Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, § 359, ECHR 2007 ‑ II).

Having regard to the Chamber’s findings, the reasons given in the Government’s request for referral and the parties’ submissions, the Court nevertheless considers it useful to provide some clarification concerning the requirement that the investigation be independent for the purposes of Article 2, and particularly as to whether the investigative authorities in the broad sense must meet similar criteria of independence as those which prevail under Article 6 of the Convention."

Compliance with this requirement is assessed, in particular, on the basis of statutory criteria, such as the manner of appointment of its members and the duration of their term of office, or the existence of sufficient safeguards against the risk of outside pressures.

Georgia, no. 25091/07, §§ 247 et seq., 26 April 2011) or that the specific conduct of the investigative bodies indicated a lack of independence, such as the failure to carry out certain measures that were called for in order to elucidate the case and, if appropriate, punish those responsible (see Sergey Shevchenko, cited above, §§ 72 and 73), the excessive weight given to the suspects’ statements (see Kaya v. Turkey, 19 February 1998, § 89, Reports 1998 ‑ I; and Grimailovs v. Latvia, no. 6087/03, § 114, 25 June 2013), the failure to explore certain lines of inquiry which were clearly required (see Oğur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, §§ 90-91, ECHR 1999 ‑ III), or excessive inertia (see Rupa v. Romania (no. 1), no. 58478/00, §§123 and 124, 16 December 2008)."

These elements are inter-related and each of them, taken separately, does not amount to an end in itself, as is the case in respect of the independence requirement of Article 6.

Romania, no. 46430/99, 5 October 2004; and Soare and Others, cited above, § 71), refusing to open criminal proceedings in spite of an order that this be done (see Dumitru Popescu v.

In so doing, it took into account, in particular, of the fact that no link existed between the military prosecutor and the persons likely to be investigated, the in-depth nature of the investigations and the fact that the prosecutor in question had reopened the proceedings at the applicant’s request. It also took into consideration the fact that the investigation in issue had not concerned acts of unlawful killing or ill ‑ treatment committed by State agents in the performance of their duties.

Turkey, 27 July 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ IV) concerning a death during a demonstration, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 2 on the ground that not only did the investigation – supervised by the provincial administrative council in the context of proceedings against civil servants – raise serious doubts and the investigating body was not independent from the executive, but also the investigation had been neither thorough nor adversarial. Subsequently, in the case of Tanrıbilir v. Turkey (no. 21422/93, §§ 54 ‑ 85, 16 November 2000), which concerned a death by hanging during police custody in a gendarmerie station, the Court, after referring to its conclusion in the Güleç case on the independence of the provincial administrative council, concluded that in this particular case the investigation in issue, although supervised by a provincial administrative council whose independence from the executive was open to doubt, had met the procedural requirements of Article 2 of the Convention. In this connection, it based its finding on the detailed nature of the preliminary investigation carried out to determine whether there had been any liability on the part of the gendarmes."

In that case, which concerned the death of an air-force lieutenant who was found dead in his guardroom with two gunshot wounds to his head, and in which the authorities had concluded that he had committed suicide, the Court found that there had been a violation of the procedural limb of Article 2. In reaching that conclusion, the Court took into consideration that the person who had initially been in charge of the investigation, the commanding officer of the unit, was a representative of the authorities concerned, that subsequent investigators did not have guarantees against pressure from their hierarchy and that from the outset they seemed keen to accept the suicide theory preferred by the military authorities. In addition, the investigators had failed to carry out a reconstruction of the events, although this was not only essential but had also been ordered by the military court of appeal. Other essential investigative acts had been overlooked (tests for gunpowder on the hands of the dead man, or a second expert opinion from a graphologist) and the applicant had been excluded from the case, contrary to the usual practice. In other words, the absence of regulatory safeguards was not in itself a decisive ground. It had been accompanied by numerous shortcomings and deficiencies in the investigation, which were tangible manifestations of the lack of independence."

Where there has been no unlawfulness or flagrant shortcoming which could lead the Court to find that the investigation was flawed, the Court would exceed the limits of its jurisdiction were it to interpret Article 2 as imposing a requirement on the authorities to put in place a judicial remedy (see Gürtekin and Others and two other applications v.

This sheet was used in the context of promotions. Admittedly, it was not the only element which was taken into consideration, as promotion also depended on the professional appraisal sheet. In addition, the prosecutors were protected by a number of significant safeguards, such as a specific appointment system requiring, in particular, the involvement of the President of the Republic (see paragraph 88 above), a specific reference to their independence in the Constitution and in the law (see paragraphs 86 and 87 above), and the prohibition on giving them instructions not to bring proceedings (see paragraphs 89 to 91 above).

It recalls in this context that it has held that presumed general knowledge is not sufficiently certain to put the defence on notice of a potential issue of lack of impartiality of a judge (ibid., § 50). In such circumstances, it is the responsibility of the individual judge to identify any impediments to his or her participation and either to withdraw or, when faced with a situation in which it is arguable that he or she should be disqualified, although not unequivocally excluded by law, to bring the matter to the attention of the parties in order to allow them to challenge the participation of the judge.

The news coverage was in broad terms focused on two main issues. First, attention was given to the fact that these shareholdings had, at least in some cases, not been disclosed to the Committee on Judicial Functions ( Nefnd um dómarastörf ). Secondly, there was discussion about the possible conflict of interests of the Justices arising from their investments in Icelandic stocks and funds and whether the Justices in question had adjudicated cases despite such possible conflicts.

Relying on section 228 (1 )( d) of the Criminal Procedures Act and citing the applicant ’ s right under the Constitution and the Convention to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal, as interpreted by the Court in its jurisprudence, the Committee stated that V.M.M. ’ s financial interests in Landsbanki had been such as to reasonably justify fears that the panel in the applicant ’ s case lacked the requisite impartiality. At the outset, the Committee noted that it was undisputed that Justices E.T. and V.M.M. had owned shares in Landsbanki, both during the time of the events which the applicant ’ s prosecution concerned and during the time when the bank was taken over by the Icelandic State, and that they had suffered financial losses as a result. In this respect, the Committee noted in particular that V.M.M. ’ s interests had been substantial, the purchase price of his shares amounting to ISK 14,753,256 at the time of purchase and their last registered estimated value amounting to ISK 8,518,692, all of which had become worthless when Landsbanki had been taken over by the Icelandic State. Such a financial loss had to be considered significant, despite it having occurred several years before the judge sat on the panel. The Committee attached significance to the fact that in its conclusions in the applicant ’ s case, the Supreme Court had stated that “[The applicant ’ s] imprudent decisions on the granting of loans could thus have caused shareholders in Landsbanki Islands, large and minor, as well as the public at large, financial loss.” The Committee furthermore noted that the information on V.M.M. ’ s holdings had not been available at the time of the trial, and had thus been unknown to the applicant.

Iceland, no. 39757/15, § 45, 4 June 2019), it would impose an unreasonable burden on an accused person to require that he or she make enquiries as to potential impediments to a judge ’ s participation in his or her trial of which the accused cannot reasonably be aware of, be it on account of family relations, links with persons involved in the trial, or, as in this case, the judge ’ s financial interests. It recalls in this context that it has held that presumed general knowledge is not sufficiently certain to put the defence on notice of a potential issue of lack of impartiality of a judge (ibid., § 50). In such circumstances, it is the responsibility of the individual judge to identify any impediments to his or her participation and either to withdraw or, when faced with a situation in which it is arguable that he or she should be disqualified, although not unequivocally excluded by law, to bring the matter to the attention of the parties in order to allow them to challenge the participation of the judge.

This conclusion is not altered by the fact that she made such a request once she became aware of a possible issue following media reports published after she had been convicted. As regards Justices V.M.M. and E.T., they became Supreme Court Justices only in 2010 and 2011 respectively and, according to the domestic law, they were not obliged to notify any shareholdings they may have had previously, in particular at the time of the collapse of the banks.

Moreover, as found above, the applicant was not under any obligation to enquire about their financial situation. Consequently, the applicant only became aware of a possible issue on 5 December 2016 when the matter was reported in the media.

The amount lost constituted more than 1.5 times the annual salary of a Supreme Court Justice or 73 per cent of Justice V.M.M. ’ s annual income in 2008, meaning that the loss had had a substantial impact on his personal finances, yet he had not disclosed this fact to any party to the proceedings.

He should have withdrawn from the applicant ’ s case or at least informed the parties of his financial interests. Finally, Justice M.S. had owned shares in Glitnir at the nominal value of ISK 13,832 which had had a market value of about ISK 350,000 when the bank had collapsed. In addition, he had had substantial investments in Icelandic financial markets, amounting to ISK 61,450,000, of which he had lost ISK 7,607,000 during the financial crisis. His losses were equivalent to 9.4 times his monthly salary as a Supreme Court Justice at the time. Also, his minor children had most likely suffered extensive losses as a result of the collapse of Landsbanki. There was thus a significant and legitimate doubt as to his impartiality.

They had also presided over another, similar case against the applicant a few months later in which they had acquitted her. Concerning the objective approach, seven years had passed since the Justices ’ shareholdings had become worthless. Their loss was thus not recent. Moreover, their financial position as law professors before the collapse had been good and therefore their loss of shares had had little, if any, bearing on their finances. Owning shares had been a very common thing before the collapse and everyone knew that purchasing shares was a risk investment. The Supreme Court ’ s conclusions had entailed no resentment or partiality towards the applicant."

When the Justices had been examining the applicant ’ s case, none of them had had any connection to Landsbanki. There were no indications of the three Justices not having been impartial. They had rendered a unanimous judgment, including those Justices who had owned no shares in the collapsed banks. Moreover, upon a request by the Government, Justice M.S. had provided information on 11 January 2019 about the financial losses of his relatives. It appeared that only his minor children at the time had suffered minor losses and that none of his other close relatives even owned any shares. There had thus been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

These shares had become worthless on 7 October 2008. Moreover, he had placed ISK 61,450,000 under asset management to be used for trading in shares in local and foreign investment funds. In 2007 he had withdrawn ISK 6,165,000 and in 2008 ISK 3,800,000 from the asset management, the remaining principal amount thus being ISK 51,485,000. By the end of 2008, this capital had shrunk by ISK 7,607,000. His loss in the wake of the collapse of the banks had thus amounted to ISK 7,950,000 in total. As to Justice V.M.M., he had owned shares with a nominal value of ISK 428,075 in Landsbanki, which had been lost on 8 October 2008, thus before his appointment as a Supreme Court Justice in 2010. His loss was thus ISK 8,518,692 (approximately EUR 62,860) in total.

According to the Court ’ s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to ( i ) a subjective test, where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge – that is to say whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case, and (ii) according to an objective test – that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see Morice v.

Turning to their objective impartiality, the Court is called upon in the present case to determine whether the shareholdings of the Justices in Landsbanki – the bank by which the applicant was employed – and their corresponding losses at the time of its collapse were of such a nature and degree as to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the Supreme Court in the applicant ’ s case. In its assessment, the Court must in particular take account of the fact that the Supreme Court was called upon to decide on the guilt or innocence of the applicant, inter alia, of the charge of aiding and abetting in market manipulation in relation to the shares in Landsbanki, a charge she had been acquitted of at first instance (see paragraph 11 above)."

                "53. The Court observes firstly that according to the information provided by the parties (see paragraphs 41 and 44 above), Justice M.S. did not at any time own shares in Landsbanki. In the Court ’ s view, in order for a judge ’ s impartiality to be called into question in this context, the financial interests of the judge concerned must be directly related to the subject matter of the dispute at the domestic level. As in the present case the subject matter of the proceedings was the criminal conduct with which the applicant was charged, which related to her position as director of corporate banking and a member of the credit committee of Landsbanki, and M.S. did not have any shareholdings in that bank, the latter had no direct interest in the outcome of the trial and there were therefore no grounds for calling his impartiality into question. The fact that he had shareholdings in another bank, Glitnir, as well as other investments which he lost as a result of the banking crisis in general does not alter this conclusion. Finally, the applicant ’ s submission that M.S. ’ s children had most likely suffered extensive losses as a result of the collapse of Landsbanki is a speculative assertion which, without any substantiation whatsoever, cannot be taken into account. It may be noted in this connection that Justice M.S. himself submitted to the Government that his childrens ’ losses had been minor (see paragraph 43 above) and that there is no indication that those losses related to Landsbanki. Consequently, the Court concludes that the applicant ’ s fears as to M.S. ’ s lack of impartiality were not justified."

According to Icelandic law, the threshold triggering the authorisation by the Committee on Judicial Functions is a shareholding of a value of ISK 3,000,000 in a given company (see paragraph 26 above). The value of Justice E.T. ’ s shares in Landsbanki at the moment of its collapse did not reach that threshold, which the Court does not find to be an unreasonable one."

Moreover, according to domestic law, Justice E.T. was not obliged to notify to the Committee on Judicial Functions any of his shareholdings he had had before he was appointed as a Supreme Court Justice in 2011. Taking into account the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that Justice E.T. ’ s shareholdings in Landsbanki and their loss in October 2008 does not rise to a level which would give the applicant an objectively justified fear of a lack of impartiality. Furthermore, as with Justice M.S., the fact that Justice E.T. also owned shares in another bank, Glitnir, is not relevant to the assessment of his impartiality in the present case. It follows that the applicant could not reasonably call into question E.T. ’ s lack of impartiality when deciding her case."

According to the Government, his loss was ISK 8,518,692 (approximately EUR 62,860) in total. His loss, the amount of which the Court cannot call into question, was almost three times the amount which would have triggered the need for an authorisation by the Committee on Judicial Functions (see paragraph 26 above). His loss was thus substantial in absolute terms. His loss was also substantial vis-à-vis his annual earnings as a law professor in 2008 and 2009. Moreover, it has to be kept in mind that the applicant ’ s case directly concerned the behaviour of the management of Landsbanki immediately before the collapse of the bank in October 2008. In that respect, it is the loss at the time of the collapse which is relevant and not the judge ’ s financial position at the time of the trial. The matter at stake was thus such that the applicant could justifiably consider that it was of great significance for those shareholders who had suffered losses at the material time, including Justice V.M.M. In this regard, the Court recalls that the Committee on Reopening of Judicial Proceedings indeed considered that Justice V.M.M. ’ s financial interests in Landsbanki had been such as to reasonably justify fears that the panel in the applicant ’ s case lacked the requisite impartiality due to the losses sustained by Justice V.M.M. and that reopening of the proceedings against the applicant was therefore justified."

In view of the secrecy of the deliberations, it is impossible to ascertain V.M.M. ’ s actual influence on that occasion (see Morice, cited above, § 89).

K-124/04 concerning the criminal proceedings against the accused Zajko Zahirović, charged with the offences under Article 90 in conjunction with Article 33 of the Criminal Code, which was forwarded [to the State Attorney ’ s Office of the Republic of Croatia] after the [Zagreb] State Attorney ’ s Office and the accused ’ s lawyer had submitted their appeals ...",

It was correctly pointed out that certain aggravating factors had been significantly underestimated, namely the grave consequences for [the health of] K.G. and the other victims. Furthermore, the [first-instance] court failed to take into account the accused ’ s attitude towards the victims and the damage caused by the offences, as well as his lack of any remorse for or apology to the victims. This all should be taken into account in the sentencing procedure and should eventually lead to a more severe sentence as requested by the [ Zagreb ] State Attorney ’ s Office.",

In his submission the appellant refers to the case-law of the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights concerning the exclusion of a judge who presides over a trial panel, having already decided on the accused ’ s detention at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings. The case-law of the Constitutional Court referred to [by the appellant] concerns the particular circumstances of the case at hand and not the [general] circumstances contemplated in Article 36 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, it is to be noted, regardless of the case-law referred to [by the appellant], that a judge ’ s impartiality is presumed until there is proof to the contrary and since in the case at issue there are no objective circumstances which could raise doubts as to the impartiality of the judge who presided over the trial panel, such case-law is not applicable to the present case.",

The [first-instance court] based its findings on the report drawn up by the ballistics expert V.M. and, after the assessment of the relevant witness statements, it set out in detail its conclusion that the accused had caused the conflict. Therefore, the argument of self-defence raised in the appeal is not correct because, under the relevant case-law, the person who first drew a gun cannot invoke the defence of self-defence. We also find that sufficient reasons have been given as to the existence of all the elements of the offence, as regards the victims A.P. and M.V., as the accused ’ s mens rea. The exact place from which he shot the gun was also established without any doubt.",

This is because no bullets fired from the [victim ’ s] gun were found in the nightclub, but only one unfired bullet. Therefore, the appellant ’ s argument that the victim fired his gun is unsupported by the personal and physical evidence.

The [appellant ’ s ] behaviour after the commission of the criminal offences, as rightly pointed out in the appeal lodged by the State Attorney ’ s Office, namely that he escaped to another country, together with the lack of any remorse or apology to the victims, amount to additional aggravating circumstances which indicate that the rules on imposing a more lenient penalty should not have been applied in respect of that criminal offence.”"

It is undisputed between the parties that during the period of more than one year in which the applicant ’ s trial was conducted before the panel presided over by Judge M.G., he never lodged any complaints alleging a lack of impartiality on the part of that judge or otherwise concerning the composition of the trial court, even though he and his defence lawyer, as noted above, were aware of Judge M.G. ’ s previous involvement in his case.

Moreover, the applicant never argued that he had been prevented from making such a request or from otherwise complaining about the composition of the trial panel during the period of more than one year while the proceedings were pending before the trial panel presided over by Judge M.G.

In this connection the Court has held that the existence of national procedures for ensuring impartiality, namely rules regulating the withdrawal of judges, are a relevant factor. Such rules manifest the national legislature ’ s concern to remove all reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the judge or court concerned and constitute an attempt to ensure impartiality by eliminating the causes for such concerns (see Mežnarić v. Croatia, no. 71615/01, § 27, 15 July 2005 ). Therefore, the Court considers that when the domestic law offers a possibility of eliminating the causes for concerns regarding the impartiality of the court or a judge (see paragraph 25; Articles 36 and 38 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), it would be expected (and in terms of the national law required) of an applicant who truly believes that there are arguable concerns on that account to raise them at the first opportunity. This would above all allow the domestic authorities to examine the applicant ’ s complaints at the relevant time and ensure that his rights are respected."

The applicant also stressed that it was necessary to make a distinction between the issue of whether he had replied to the appeal lodged by the Zagreb County State Attorney ’ s Office or not, and the issue of whether he had had the opportunity to have knowledge of and to reply to the opinion of the State Attorney ’ s Office of the Republic of Croatia, since they concerned two separate procedural situations."

In the Government ’ s view, the fact that the Code of Criminal Procedure had required that, during appeal proceedings, the case file be forwarded to the State Attorney ’ s Office at the level immediately above the one representing the prosecution in the proceedings at issue had essentially benefited the accused since this had allowed the higher State Attorney ’ s Office to supervise the work of the lower office and, if necessary, to withdraw the appeal. Nothing in domestic law had obliged the State Attorney ’ s Office to submit an opinion at all, but it was normally expected that the case file would be returned to the court accompanied by a letter. In the present case, the letter from the State Attorney ’ s Office of the Republic of Croatia had simply endorsed the arguments set out in the appeal lodged by the Zagreb County State Attorney ’ s Office and had proposed that the appeal lodged by the defence be dismissed. Therefore, there had been no reason to communicate the submissions in question to the defence. Moreover, domestic law had not provided for such an obligation. In this connection the Government pointed out that the main arguments for the prosecution had been raised in the appeal lodged by the Zagreb County State Attorney ’ s Office and that the applicant had not replied to that appeal."

The Court reiterates that the principle of equality of arms is one feature of the wider concept of a fair trial, which also includes the fundamental right that criminal proceedings should be adversarial. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment on them ( see Brandstetter v. Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66 - 67, Series A no. 211; Milatová and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 61811/00, § 65, ECHR 2005 ‑ V; and, a fortiori, Krčmář and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 35376/97, § § 41-45, 3 March 2000; and OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia, no. 14902/04, § 538, 20 September 2011 ). Therefore, it is even possible that a procedural situation which does not place a party at any disadvantage vis-à-vis his or her opponent still represents a violation of the right to adversarial proceedings if the party concerned did not have an opportunity to have knowledge of, and comment on, all evidence adduced or observations filed, with a view to influencing the court ’ s decision (see Krčmář and Others, cited above, §§ 38-46; and Gregačević v.

The Court is aware that under the relevant domestic law there was no obligation to forward the opinion of the State Attorney ’ s Office of the Republic of Croatia to the applicant, but it cannot see the justification for such restrictions on the rights of the defence. Once the submissions unfavourable to the applicant had been made, the latter had a clear interest in being able to submit his observations on them before argument was closed. This is particularly so since the Supreme Court ’ s jurisdiction embraced both questions of fact and questions of law (see Borgers v. Belgium, 30 October 1991, § 27, Series A no. 214 ‑ B )."

Austria, 26 March 1982, § 37, Series A no. 49, and Milatová and Others, cited above, § 65). That being so, it is equally irrelevant whether or not the applicant replied to an earlier submission, namely the appeal of the Zagreb County State Attorney ’ s Office.

According to the Court ’ s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. As to the proceedings instituted by the applicant before the national authorities, the Court agrees that, as they were in part aimed at remedying the violation of the Convention alleged before the Court, the domestic legal costs may be taken into account in assessing the claim for costs (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 284, ECHR 2006 ‑ V). However, the Court notes that part of the applicant ’ s complaints, concerning the alleged lack of impartiality of the trial court, was declared inadmissible (see paragraph 37). Therefore, no award can be made in respect of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with that complaint. Accordingly, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court awards the applicant the sum of EUR 1,200 for costs and expenses in the proceedings before the national authorities, plus any tax that may be chargeable to him on that amount. As to the Convention proceedings, making its assessment on an equitable basis and in the light of its practice in comparable cases, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant, who was represented by counsel, the sum of EUR 1,873, plus any tax that may be chargeable to him on that amount."

If the taking of evidence had made it possible to establish the alleged facts, the Assize Court could have replaced the juror in question by one of the additional jurors. If the Assize Court had refused to allow the application for evidence to be taken, Mr Remli could have applied to the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation for a transfer of the trial on the ground of reasonable suspicion of bias in order to secure the immediate removal of the case from the Rhône Assize Court. Such a procedure could be used only in respect of a whole court and not against one or more members of a collegiate court who were suspected of bias. However, the Government continued, seeing that the juror in question had not been challenged, the impartiality of the Assize Court as a whole might be affected and the procedure of an application for transfer of the trial on the ground of reasonable suspicion of bias was therefore the appropriate one.

It had been the Assize Court ’ s duty to order evidence to be taken of its own motion if it considered the evidence filed by Mr Remli - Mrs M. ’ s written statements - to be insufficient. Nor could an application for evidence to be taken be regarded as a remedy for the purposes of Article 26 (art. 26). As to making an application to have the trial transferred on the ground of reasonable suspicion of bias, this was a wholly exceptional procedure and could only be used in respect of a court as a whole and not in respect of a single juror.

If the conduct in question did not reach that threshold, the correct response was to first reprimand the person and to impose the penalty only after the alternative responses had been exhausted to no avail. Making reference to Article 31 of the Polish Constitution, the court observed that the punishment, as the reaction of a judge to the behaviour of a person subjected to judicial assessment, should be moderately used and considered necessary in the democratic society for its security and public order, freedom and right of others or for the protection of other public interests. In the circumstances of that particular case, in which a fine was imposed on the applicant, who had been subject to a court decision to enforce his previously conditionally stayed sentence, the court considered that his ironic statement made in a loud voice: “That ’ s the kind of law we have” ( takie mamy prawo ), constituted an unacceptable comment about the Polish legal order.

The Government referred to the Rule 80 (B) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence common for the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda and to Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the International Criminal Court, which authorise the court to order the removal of a person for his or her disruptive conduct and to continue the proceedings in the person ’ s absence."

To that end, they maintained that the court had been composed of three professional judges who had not been put under any outside pressure; had not shown prejudice against the applicant; or had they had any particular interest in punishing him. The Government also stressed that, unlike in the case of Mariusz Lewandowski v. Poland (no. 66484/09, 3 July 2012), the judges had not been called to assess the applicant ’ s statements in so far as they might have insulted them personally but only in so far as they concerned the court as an institution.

While it cannot be contended that the Convention absolutely excludes the jurisdiction of military courts to try cases in which civilians are implicated, the existence of such jurisdiction should be subjected to particularly careful scrutiny, since only in very exceptional circumstances could the determination of criminal charges against civilians in such courts be held to be compatible with Article 6 ( op. cit., § § 42 and 44 ). The power of military criminal justice should not extend to civilians unless there are compelling reasons justifying such a situation, and if so only on a clear and foreseeable legal basis. The existence of such reasons must be substantiated in each specific case.

It would in our view have been preferable if this young appellant, whose subjection to military law was purely vicarious and involuntary, had been tried here with all the procedural safeguards which procedure in the ordinary criminal courts affords. We cannot, however, stigmatise these proceedings as abusive. They were strictly in accordance with a procedure prescribed by Parliament to apply in such cases. There was not, as is accepted, any attempt to over reach or oppress or prejudice the appellant. He had all the safeguards which a defendant in any court-martial is entitled to enjoy. Steps were taken to ensure that all members of the tribunal save one were not under the command of the convening officer, and also to ensure that the convening officer and the confirming officer were not the same person. Had the appellant been held in Germany to await trial, as he could have been, his claim to trial in England would have appeared weaker.

It cannot be assumed that the Director would have been willing to take proceedings in England without knowing more about the factors which he would have wished to take into account. One obvious factor, I would have thought, was the availability of witnesses. In his letter of 14 June 1994 to the Attorney General the Director of Army Legal Services had stated that many of the witnesses were German and that they could not be forced to attend a trial in England. Further details were provided at the request of the Attorney General in a letter by the Director of Army Legal Services dated 25 November 1994. In this letter it is stated that there were 13 German witnesses who could be divided into three categories—those who saw the appellant in the woods near the scene of the murder, those concerned with the finding of the body and police and forensic experts. The defence had not yet indicated what evidence would be agreed. The Director thought that, while some of their evidence might be agreed, it was unlikely that this would include the police and forensic experts. He believed that they were the witnesses who would be most unlikely to cause difficulties if asked to travel to England to give evidence. He added that one of the forensic scientists who was responsible for examining secretions and bloodstains—a matter which was of crucial importance in this case as there were no eyewitnesses—was being difficult to deal with and would only attend meetings if they were arranged through the German public prosecutor in the nearest large town. He explained that these witnesses were German because the police investigation was commenced by the German civil police as it was initially assumed that a German civilian had committed the crime. ...",
                "I have not forgotten that Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ [ see paragraph 18 above ] said in his judgment that it was clear, with the benefit of hindsight, that the trial could have been conducted in England without due difficulty. But the Director of Public Prosecutions would have had to have taken his decision well before the trial, in view of the arrangements which would have had to have been made for the appellant to be transferred into the hands of the civil authorities in England and for the attendance of the witnesses. In the event, as the respondent has recorded in his written case, no agreement was reached, despite several written requests and reminders, about any of the evidence until the commencement of the trial when the evidence of the witnesses was agreed piecemeal during the opening days. This account of what happened strongly suggests that at the stage when the Director of Public Prosecutions would have had to have taken his decision he would have had to assume that the important evidence of the German witnesses would not be agreed before the trial and that the attendance of the German witnesses would be necessary. ...",
                "... The proceedings were conducted within the rules laid down by Parliament. There is no sound basis for thinking that, at the time when a decision about this would have had to have been taken, a prosecution in the English courts within a reasonable time would have been seen to be practicable. The alternatives lay between taking proceedings by way of court-martial in Germany, leaving the matter in the hands of the German public prosecutor or taking no proceedings at all. ... ”",

The applicant ’ s case should be distinguished from Incal v. Turkey, (judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ IV ), where the applicant had been charged with an offence directly concerning a threat to the security of the country, and was tried by a national security court specifically set up to deal with cases affecting Turkey ’ s territorial integrity. In the present applicant ’ s case the charge was an ordinary offence of murder, not an offence specially created to combat a threat to the Government, nor one which affected the military any more than the civilian population. The offence did not contain any special characteristics which might encourage the military members of the court-martial to take into account irrelevant considerations."

A court-martial avoided the possibility that the applicant would have to undergo trial in the German domestic courts with proceedings in a foreign language and with only German legal counsel to assist him, in addition to having to serve his sentence in a foreign jail. The applicant was tried by court-martial pursuant to the 1951 NATO Agreement (see paragraph 21 above). Moreover, the applicant was familiar with the military system, its structure and its terminology, having spent his life in the military community."

Only one of the military personnel on the board was directly under the Convening Officer ’ s command. Steps were taken to ensure that the Convening Officer was not the same individual as the Confirming Officer. Although the Convening Officer had power to dissolve the court-martial, as in Findlay, he could do so only in prescribed circumstances. The applicant did not complain that his conviction was unsafe or that the court-martial had conducted itself unfairly in any way. The applicant ’ s plea of abuse of process had been addressed to the Vice-Judge Advocate General alone, in public but in the absence of the court-martial members. The Vice-Judge Advocate General was a senior judge appointed by the Lord Chancellor with the same guarantees of independence as any judge in a civilian British court. The abuse of process argument was, moreover, reviewed and dismissed by the Courts-Martial Appeal Court and the House of Lords.",

The first instance tribunal was an ad hoc court. The Convening Officer played a central role, which included deciding the charge, selecting the members of the court and appointing the prosecutor. All the military members of the court-martial board were subordinate in rank to the Convening Officer and the two civilians were civil servants who were subordinate in rank to the Convening Officer and, having been posted to the Convening Officer ’ s jurisdiction, were subject to military discipline and under his command while in Germany. Although the Confirming Officer was not the same person as the Convening Officer, it was significant that the role of “Confirming Officer” was abolished by the Army Act 1995 because it was not a judicial body. The Vice - Judge Advocate General was not a member of the tribunal. All submissions of law were made to him alone and he gave his advice on sentencing to the board in private. Rather than providing an adequate guarantee of impartiality, he effectively prevented the court-martial from considering the abuse issue at all. The Court of Appeal and House of Lords were bound by domestic law and could not stigmatise the court-martial proceedings because they were conducted in accordance with that law."

In order to establish whether a tribunal can be considered “independent”, regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, to the existence of guarantees against outside pressures and to the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence. In this latter respect, what is at stake is the confidence which such tribunals in a democratic society must inspire in the public and, above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused. In deciding whether there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular court lacked independence or impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important without being decisive. What is decisive is whether his doubts can be held to be objectively justified ( Cooper, § 104; Grieves, § 69)."

Turkey (No. 6), no. 47533/99, § 41, 5 May 2006 ). While it cannot be contended that the Convention absolutely excludes the jurisdiction of military courts to try cases in which civilians are implicated, the existence of such jurisdiction should be subjected to particularly careful scrutiny, since only in very exceptional circumstances could the determination of criminal charges against civilians in such courts be held to be compatible with Article 6 ( op. cit., § § 42 and 44 ). The power of military criminal justice should not extend to civilians unless there are compelling reasons justifying such a situation, and if so only on a clear and foreseeable legal basis. The existence of such reasons must be substantiated in each specific case. It is not sufficient for the national legislation to allocate certain categories of offence to military courts in abstracto ( op. cit., § 47)."

Together with the Judge Advocate at first instance and the Court Martial Appeal Court, the House of Lords examined in detail whether such proceedings would be fair and appropriate, and found, generally, that the law permitting for the civilian members of a military entourage stationed abroad to be tried by court-martial was of utility. Moreover, the House of Lords found that in the applicant ’ s particular case there were sound practical reasons militating, at the time the Director of Public Prosecutions made his decision, in favour of his trial by court-martial in Germany (see paragraphs 19-20 above ). While the Court has considerable doubts whether such considerations were sufficiently “compelling” to justify the trial of a civilian before a military tribunal, it is not necessary for it finally to decide the point since it considers, for the reasons set out below, that the composition, structure and procedure of the applicant ’ s court-martial were in themselves sufficient to raise in him a legitimate fear as to its lack of independence and impartiality."

In Findlay, the Court held that Mr Findlay ’ s fears about the independence and impartiality of a court-martial established under the provisions of the Army Act 1955 were objectively justified. The Court considered that the members of the court-martial were not sufficiently independent of the Convening Officer, who was central to the prosecution and closely linked to the prosecuting authorities. In particular, the Court referred to the Convening Officer ’ s powers to decide the charge, convene the court-martial and appoint the members and the prosecuting and defending officers as well as to provide abstracts of evidence, procure the attendance of witnesses and dissolve the court-martial before or during the trial when required in the interests of the administration of justice (see Findlay, § 74).

The Court does not accept this submission. It notes that in Cooper, none of the ordinary members was serving under the command of the convening authority, prosecuting authority or higher authority (these three authorities had been created by the Army Act 1996 to replace the role of Convening Officer and separate the convening, prosecuting and referral functions of the court-martial). The Grand Chamber nonetheless considered the junior rank of the ordinary members (who were subordinate to the permanent president and may have been subordinate to other participants in the court-martial including the prosecuting authority) and the ad hoc nature of their appointment, might give rise to concern as to their independence and required “particularly convincing safeguards against outside pressures being brought to bear on those officers” ( Cooper, § 120)."

The Court notes that two out of the six ordinary members sitting on the applicant ’ s tribunal were civilians and recalls the opinion expressed in previous judgments that the involvement of civilians in the court-martial process contributes to its independence and impartiality (see Grieves § 78 and Cooper § 117). However, the mere presence of civilians during the proceedings will not of itself provide adequate guarantees of independence and impartiality; the role that the civilians play in the court-martial process must also be taken into account. Thus, in Grieves, the presence of a civilian Court Administration Officer was found to contribute to the independence and impartiality of the tribunal ( Grieves § 78), but was not sufficient in itself to ensure that the court-martial process as a whole conformed with Article 6. Conversely, in Cooper the Court considered that the civilian post of Judge Advocate provided “one of the most significant guarantees of the independence of the court-martial proceedings”. In reaching this conclusion, significant emphasis was placed on the pivotal role played by the Judge Advocate, including his ability to give binding rulings and directions on points of law to the ordinary members of the court-martial ( Cooper § 117). In the present case, while the participation of civilians as ordinary members of the court-martial may have contributed somewhat to its independence, they did not have sufficient influence over the proceedings as a whole, including over the military members of the court-martial, to satisfy the independence and impartiality requirements of Article 6."

Furthermore, the Court rejects the Government ’ s submission that the presence of the civilian Vice-Judge Advocate General offered an adequate guarantee of impartiality in this case. As previously mentioned, the Court in Cooper accepted that the presence of a Judge Advocate offered a significant safeguard of independence and impartiality. In addition to his civilian status and legal training, emphasis was placed on the Judge Advocate ’ s influence over the proceedings, including his status as a member of the tribunal, his ability to give binding directions and his participation in the deliberations on sentencing. By contrast, the role of Judge Advocate in Findlay did not constitute such a valuable safeguard and could not remedy the “fundamental flaws” in the court-martial system prior to the coming into force of the Army Act 1996. In particular, the Court noted that the Judge Advocate was not a member of the tribunal and his advice on sentencing was not made public. The Government do not present any evidence that the Vice-Judge Advocate General ’ s role in the proceedings was different from or more extensive than that of the Judge Advocate in Findlay.

Concerns about the fact that the court-martial ’ s verdict was not final and binding, but was instead subject to review by a non-judicial body, were expressed Findlay ( § 78) and also in Cooper (§ § 130–131). However, given that the present applicant ’ s case was in fact reviewed by the Courts -Martial Appeal Court, the Court considers that the role of Confirming Officer, although an unfortunate and unnecessary feature of the proceedings, did not have a prejudicial effect on the independence of the court-martial in this case."

It could reasonably be understood as having some sort of positive connotations in regard to Ms A, susceptible of having a bearing on J ’ s evaluation and/or influencing that of other members of the jury to the defendant ’ s disadvantage. This possibility was reinforced by the fact that J had expressed her value judgment at a time when it could be perceived as a comment or reaction to the oral evidence given by Ms A, on the one hand, and by the applicant, on the other hand.

The applicant had not stopped, but had moved himself over to her seat and held her arms behind the neck support. Ms A tried to defend herself and after a while the situation involved into a fight between them, in which she had been physically inferior and had to come to terms with the situation. The applicant had had such control over Ms A that he was also able to call Mr B again and the fact that Mr B was on his way had not hindered the applicant from continuing, until the moment when the lights from Mr B ’ s car appeared."

Her reaction had been expressed vis-à-vis others only when she and the applicant had returned to Mr C ’ s home, where Ms A cried and was in great despair.

This was a neutral value judgment; an observation about the child ’ s inconspicuous conduct. It could possibly be maintained that one could draw the conclusion that a calm girl would hardly make a fuss without any justifications for doing so, which suggested that Ms A ’ s crying and despair after she returned after the drive was a sign that she had actually been exposed to an attempted rape. However, there was no basis for such a conclusion and there was in any event no reason for attaching weight to such a possibility. J ’ s information about Ms A had emerged after she had given evidence to the High Court for one hour. At that point, the jury, including J, had a good opportunity to form an independent and updated picture of the victim as a person.

The minority shared the majority ’ s view (see paragraph 16 above) that previous contacts between the victim and J could not, of their own, disqualify the latter. What was decisive was whether J ’ s statement made after she had heard the evidence given by the accused and the witness describing the latter as a “ quiet and calm person” would lead to a different conclusion. In this regard, the minority took as a starting point that the credibility of the victim was the decisive evidence in this case.

That J had expressed a view on how she had perceived her “at the time”, was of secondary importance.

                "52. Turning to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that J had had prior knowledge of Ms A and had uttered that she “ had formed a picture [ bilde ] of the victim from many years ago where she at the time had experienced her as a quiet and calm person” (see paragraph 12 above). The minority of the Supreme Court agreed with the majority ’ s view that previous contacts between the victim and J could not, on their own, disqualify the latter (see paragraphs 16 and 19 above). On this point the majority did not consider that J ’ s knowledge of the victim from her attendance at birthday parties and class outings with the victim of itself indicated an identification with the victim or weakened in any other way the confidence in J ’ s impartiality. It had involved sporadic contacts, not a personal knowledge, and the contacts had dated several years back in time. Neither had counsel for the defence alleged before the Supreme Court that this was a sufficient ground for disqualification (see paragraph 16 above). The Court sees no reason to hold otherwise."

            [
                "53. More problematic is the fact that J depicted Ms A as being “a quiet and calm person”. This was not, as it appears from her own words, merely a superficial impression but was “a picture” that she had “formed” on the basis of her “experience” of Ms A “at the time” (see paragraph 12 above). It has not been suggested that J ’ s statement could be understood to mean that that “ picture ” had changed into something negative after having heard oral evidence from the applicant and Ms A. On the contrary, it is common ground between the parties that J ’ s characterisation of A conveyed nothing negative, although the views differ as to its contents and significance for the assessment of the question of impartiality."
            ],
            [
                "54. In this regard the Court notes the view of the Supreme Court ’ s majority that J ’ s statement could hardly be perceived as an expression of an assessment of the person ’ s credibility or give the impression of identification with, or particular sympathies, for her. In the majority ’ s view, this was a neutral value judgment, an observation about the child ’ s inconspicuous conduct. It could possibly be maintained that one could draw the conclusion that a calm girl would hardly make a fuss without any justifications for doing so, which suggested that A ’ s crying and despair after she returned after the drive was a sign that she had actually been exposed to an attempted rape. However, still according to the majority, there was no basis for such a conclusion and there was in any event no reason for attaching weight to such a possibility (see paragraph 18 above)."

            [
                "55. The minority considered that, although a literal interpretation of “quiet and calm person” was not directly related to the credibility assessment, the affirmation was positively loaded and, when expressed just after the victim had given evidence, could at least easily have been perceived as if, according to J, one had to do with a person who would not make a fuss and thus would not make a false accusation about an attempt of rape. That J had expressed a view on how she had perceived her “at the time”, was of secondary importance. This was a nuance that could easily be overlooked by a person overhearing her statement and which, having regard to the timing, could hardly be perceived as a reservation with regard to A ’ s current character (see paragraph 21 above)."

                "57. What matters in particular is that (unlike in Pullar, cited above, § 15) she uttered a value judgment (see Gregory, cited above, § 9, “jury showing racial overtones” ) reflecting a preconceived view on Ms A personal character. Although the contents of her statement and its significance for the question of impartiality were open to different assessments, it clearly was not negative ( as in Remli v. France, 23 April 1996, § 11 (jury member: “I ’ m a racist”, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ II; Gregory, ibidem; and Sander v. the United Kingdom, no. 34129/96, § 26 (racist remarks and jokes), ECHR 2000 ‑ V ). It could reasonably be understood as having some sort of positive connotations in regard to Ms A, susceptible of having a bearing on J ’ s evaluation and/or influencing that of other members of the jury to the defendant ’ s disadvantage. This possibility was reinforced by the fact that J had expressed her value judgment at a time when it could be perceived as a comment or reaction to the oral evidence given by Ms A, on the one hand, and by the applicant, on the other hand. It is further significant that whether the High Court would rely on his version or on her version of the impugned event was decisive for the question of guilt."

It is moreover relevant that not only did counsel for the defence request that J be disqualified on grounds of lack of impartiality, but also A ’ s assistant advocate supported the motion and the public prosecutor expressed understanding for the motion, albeit without taking a stance (see paragraph 10 above). In the Court ’ s view, whilst none of these objections and comments was by itself decisive, when considered together they did provide a strong indication of the importance of appearances in the present case."

Norway, no. 3338/05, § § 64 ‑ 72, 24 September 2009 ). As a result she continued to sit in the case without the matter being reverted to again, first as a member of the jury. There is no information, and it has not been argued, that the presiding judge sought to redirect the jury, for instance by impressing on the jurors to rely on evidence presented in court alone and that they must not allow any other factor to influence their decision (compare Ekeberg and Others, cited above, § 48; and Gregory, cited above, §§ 47-49). Thereafter, following the jury ’ s affirmative answer to the rape charge (and other charges), J took part in the formation, composed of professional judges and jurors (drawn by lots), which determined the question of sentencing."

The special investigative measures ... applied in the case at issue are not provided for under the [ OSCOC Act ] and therefore the [investigating judge ’ s] orders could have been based only on the Code of Criminal Procedure. Had the investigating judge authorised any of the measures provided for in section 41 ( 1 ) of the [ OSCOC Act ], he would have been obliged to rely on that Act.",

U-III-857/ 2 008] to the effect that the orders must be sufficiently reasoned, are also ill- founded ...",
                "This court considers that mere flaws in the reasoning of the secret surveillance orders do not make the results of such measures unlawfully obtained evidence. This is because Article 9 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that unlawfully obtained evidence is evidence which has been obtained in breach of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and is expressly provided for by the [Code of Criminal Procedure].",

That is to say, evidence which is obtained without a warrant issued by the investigating judge, or if the [police] acted contrary to Articles 180 and 182 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but [this does not concern] the evidence obtained contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that the order [authorising special investigative measures ] should, inter alia, refer to the facts which warrant the application of such measures, specifically that there is a reasonable suspicion that an individual has committed a criminal offence and that the investigation could not have been carried out by other means or that [to do so] would have been extremely difficult.",
                "Article 182 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is compatible with the legal nature of [ special investigation ] orders. Such orders [made by the investigating judge] are transmitted to the State Attorney, who is authorised to request them, and they are executed by the police. There is no legal avenue [to challenge] such orders since the [State Attorney] has no legal interest in challenging them. The police were therefore, moreover, not allowed to challenge the orders. If the argument of the appellants that secret surveillance orders would be unlawful when they are not sufficiently reasoned were to be accepted, it would call into doubt the [use of] secret surveillance measures, particularly in situations where all other legal conditions had been met but the order was merely not sufficiently reasoned, which would be absolutely unacceptable.”"

It is further undisputed that the recordings were reviewed at a hearing, that the accused and their lawyers were present, and that they made their objections concerning the transcripts and not concerning the recordings.

In deciding whether the investigation was “essentially passive” the Court will examine the reasons underlying the covert operation, in particular, whether there were objective suspicions that the applicant had been involved in criminal activity or had been predisposed to commit a criminal offence (see Furcht v. Germany, no. 54648/09, § 51, 23 October 2014) and the conduct of the authorities carrying it out, specifically whether the authorities exerted such an influence on the applicant as to incite the commission of an offence that would otherwise not have been committed, in order to make it possible to establish the offence, that is, to provide evidence and institute a prosecution (ibid., § 52; see also Morari v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 65311/09, § 32, 8 March 2016)."

Moreover, the execution of the simulated purchases performed by an undercover officer or informant must be particularly well justified, be subject to a stringent authorisation procedure, and be documented in a way that allows a subsequent independent scrutiny of the actors ’ conduct (see Veselov and Others, cited above, § 102). Indeed, a lack of procedural safeguards in the ordering of an undercover operation generates a risk of arbitrariness and police entrapment (see Nosko and Nefedov v.

All this had been examined and adequately explained to the defence by the competent domestic courts. In these circumstances, the Government considered that the criminal proceedings against the applicant, taken as a whole, had been fair."

For this reason, it finds it unnecessary to examine the applicant ’ s allegations separately from the standpoint of paragraph 3 (b), since they amount to a complaint that he did not receive a fair trial. The Court will therefore confine its examination to the question of whether the proceedings in their entirety were fair (see Leas v. Estonia, no. 59577/08, § 76, 6 March 2012, with further references; see also Schatschaschwili v.

It must be examined in particular whether the applicant was given the opportunity of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see, amongst many other authorities, Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, § 90, 10 March 2009; Beraru v. Romania, no. 40107/04, § 75, 18 March 2014; Dragojević, cited above, § 129; and Niţulescu v. Romania, no. 16184/06, § 46, 22 September 2015)."

Furthermore, the Court reiterates that a fundamental aspect of the right to a fair trial is that criminal proceedings, including the elements of such proceedings which relate to procedure, should be adversarial and that there should be equality of arms between the prosecution and defence. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party ( see Brandstetter v. Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66-67, Series A no. 211). In addition, Article 6 § 1 requires that the prosecution authorities disclose to the defence all material evidence in their possession for or against the accused (see Natunen v.

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 § 1 (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 58, Reports 1997 ‑ III ).

The Court noted that the judge had been aware of both the contents of the withheld evidence and the nature of the applicant ’ s case, and had thus been able to weigh the applicant ’ s interest in disclosure against the public interest in concealment (see, by contrast, Edwards and Lewis, cited above, § 46)."

The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the possibility to put all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings. Furthermore, the facilities which should be enjoyed by everyone charged with a criminal offence include the opportunity to acquaint him - or herself, for the purposes of preparing his defence, with the results of investigations carried out throughout the proceedings.

The Court has already found that unrestricted access to the case file and unrestricted use of any notes, including, if necessary, the possibility of obtaining copies of relevant documents, are important guarantees of a fair trial. The failure to afford such access has weighed, in the Court ’ s assessment, in favour of the finding that the principle of equality of arms had been breached (see Beraru, cited above, § 70). In this context, importance is attached to appearances as well as to the increased sensitivity to the fair administration of justice. The respect for the rights of the defence requires that limitations on access by an accused or his lawyer to the court file must not prevent the evidence being made available to the accused before the trial and the accused being given an opportunity to comment on it through his lawyer in oral submissions (see Öcalan v.

This in particular concerns eighteen CD and twenty-three DVD recordings.

Just after the conclusion of sexual activities between the two men (Mr Ely and Mr Hurburgh ), two masked men appeared. One carried a knife, the other a gun. Ely was pulled out of the car and 10 pounds sterling (GBP) was taken from him. On orders, he lay face down on the ground while the man with the knife kept guard over him. Ely became aware of a third masked man. The robbers wanted to take the car which belonged to Hurburgh, who objected and was attacked. Ely was made to crawl over to where Hurburgh was lying tied up. He was also tied up and gagged. Petrol was spread around both of them. Ely saw a lit cigarette and passed out. When he recovered consciousness, Hurburgh's Austin Princess car had gone and Hurburgh was dead.

Two of them went into Timothy Napier's room; one had a knife, the other a gun. Meanwhile, Richard Napier (the father) was awakened by the third robber armed with a revolver. He was taken into Timothy's room. Both were told they would be shot if they did not cooperate. They attacked the robbers and forced them downstairs. In the struggle, Timothy Napier's arm was cut and an artery was severed. Richard Napier was forced back upstairs to the bedroom where his wife was waiting. A knife was pointed at her and she was told to remove her rings and jewellery or her fingers would be cut off. The other two robbers ransacked the room before all three fled taking Timothy's Toyota car. Timothy Napier was rushed to hospital. He was found to have a stab wound to his back that had punctured the pleural cavity and required the insertion of a chest drain. Hurburgh's car was found abandoned nearby."

It was argued that if anyone from No. 25 had been responsible for the crimes, it was the Jobbins Group, and that Jobbins, Duncan and Griffin had given a deliberately false account to the police in order to implicate the accused and thus exonerate themselves. Joanne Cassar may have been an accomplice because she knew Duncan and Griffin, and Kate Williamson's evidence may have been motivated by jealousy of Rowe's relationship with another girlfriend and was in any event inconsistent with a letter which she had sent to Rowe whilst he was in prison. The defence sought to impugn Todd's evidence on the grounds that he may have lied in order to obtain parole.

It was argued by the defence that ( i ) defence counsel should have been permitted to hear the application by the Crown without giving an undertaking and (ii) counsel for the Crown should, at the least, have been obliged to disclose the category of material in question so that defence counsel could then have made submissions as to whether or not disclosure of material in that category should be ordered. The Court of Appeal, in its judgment, remarked that the procedure to be followed when the prosecution was in possession of material which it believed should not be disclosed to the defence had been changed by the judgment in R. v. Ward (see paragraph 37 below) in that it was now for the court, and not the prosecution, to decide whether disclosure should be made, and set out a series of procedural guidelines to be followed in such cases (see paragraphs 39-40 below).

As a result of his assistance to the police and the evidence which he gave at the applicants' trial, Duncan had received a reward of GBP 10,300, in addition to police protection between 18 and 22 December 1988 and immunity from prosecution in relation to his admitted participation as an accessory to the offences in question. It appeared from police records of the information supplied by Duncan that the latter had never identified Johnson as one of the offenders. These facts had not previously been disclosed to the defence on grounds of public interest immunity. The CCRC also found that “the police were not keen that the Jobbins Group should be prosecuted and there was a corresponding inertia on the part of the prosecuting authorities”, and commented that “if the jury had been aware of this then the credibility of the Jobbins Group might have been assessed in a more critical manner”. Moreover, Todd had retracted his statement concerning the incriminating comments allegedly made by Johnson.",

It therefore referred the convictions of the applicants and Johnson back to the Court of Appeal, since it considered that there was a real possibility that these convictions would not be upheld if such a reference were made (Criminal Appeal Act 1995, section 13)."

It referred to the important role performed by the trial judge in monitoring the views of the prosecution as to the proper balance to be struck and remarked that even in cases in which the sensitivity of the information required an ex parte hearing, the defence had “as much protection as can be given without pre-empting the issue”. Finally, it emphasised that it was for the trial judge to continue to monitor the position as the trial progressed.

It would be an abdication of the prosecution's duty if, out of an abundance of caution, it were simply “to dump all its unused material in the court's lap and leave it to the judge to sort through it regardless of its materiality to the issues present or potential”. Thus, the prosecution should put before the court only those documents which it regarded as material but wished to withhold. “Material” evidence was that which could, on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution, be seen ( i ) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case; (ii) to raise or possibly raise a new issue the existence of which was not apparent from the evidence the prosecution proposed to use; or (iii) to hold out a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect of providing a lead of evidence going to ( i ) or (ii). Exceptionally, in case of doubt about the materiality of the documents or evidence, the court might be asked to rule on the issue.

For present purposes the point of supreme importance is that there is no hint in the Guidelines of the primacy of the court in deciding on issues of disclosure ... Secondly, the Guidelines are not an exhaustive statement of the Crown's common law duty of disclosure: R. v. Ward at 25 and 681D. To that extent too the Guidelines are out of date. Thirdly, the Guidelines were drafted before major developments in the field of public interest immunity. [I]n paragraph 6 the Guidelines are cast in the form of a prosecutor's discretion ...

Ward ... there has been an increasing tendency for defendants to seek disclosure of informants' names and roles, alleging that those details are essential to the defence. Defences that the accused has been set up, and allegations of duress, which used at one time to be rare, have multiplied. We wish to alert judges to the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about informants with very great care. They will need to be astute to see that assertions of a need to know such details, because they are essential to the running of the defence, are justified. If they are not so justified, then the judge will need to adopt a robust approach in declining to order disclosure. Clearly, there is a distinction between cases in which the circumstances raise no reasonable possibility that information about the informant will bear upon the issues and cases where it will. Again, there will be cases where the informant is an informant and no more; other cases where he may have participated in the events constituting, surrounding, or following the crime. Even when the informant has participated, the judge will need to consider whether his role so impinges on an issue of interest to the defence, present or potential, as to make disclosure necessary ...",
                "It is sufficient for us to say that in this case we are satisfied that the information concerning the informant showed a participation in the events concerning this crime which, coupled with the way in which the defence was raised from the very first moment by the defendant when he said that he was being set up, gave rise to the need for the defence to be aware of the identity of the informant and his role in this matter. We, therefore, conclude that if one applies the principle which has been quoted from R. v. Keane ... to the facts of the present case, there could only be one answer to the question as to whether the details concerning this informer were so important to the issues of interest to the defence, present and potential, that the balance which the judge had to strike came down firmly in favour of disclosure.”",

Any such restriction on the rights of the defence should, however, be strictly proportionate and counterbalanced by procedural safeguards adequate to compensate for the handicap imposed on the defence. Whilst accepting that in certain circumstances it might be necessary in the public interest to exclude the accused and his representatives from the disclosure procedure, the applicants contended that the procedure whereby the prosecution, without consulting the judge, decided not to disclose material evidence during the applicants' trial violated Article 6. This defect was not rectified by the ex parte procedure before the Court of Appeal, which afforded no safeguards against judicial bias or error and no opportunity to put arguments on behalf of the defence."

They pointed to four examples of cases where a “special counsel” procedure had been introduced in the United Kingdom (see paragraphs 46-49 above). These examples, they submitted, demonstrated that an alternative mechanism was available which would ensure that the rights of the defence were respected as far as possible in the course of a hearing to determine whether evidence should be withheld on public interest grounds, whilst safeguarding legitimate concerns about, for example, national security or the protection of witnesses and sources of information, and they reasoned that the onus was on the Government to show why it would not be possible to introduce such a procedure."

In their submission, English law in principle, and in practice in the applicants' case, provided the required level of protection. Thus, the Court of Appeal on two occasions, with the benefit of hindsight and a clear overview of the issues at trial, reviewed the material in question, weighed the interest of the accused in disclosure against the public interest in secrecy, and decided in favour of non-disclosure."

Moreover, the proposed scheme would give rise to significant difficulties in practice, for example, with regard to the duties which would be owed by the special counsel to the accused, the amount of information he or she would be at liberty to pass on to the accused and the defence lawyers and the quality of instructions he or she could expect to receive from the defence. Such difficulties would be particularly acute in cases involving more than one co-accused, where it would be necessary to appoint a special counsel in respect of each defendant to avoid the risk of conflict of interest, and in respect of long trials, with constantly evolving disclosure issues."

In the circumstances of the case it finds it unnecessary to examine the applicants' allegations separately from the standpoint of paragraph 3 (b) and (d), since they amount to a complaint that the applicants did not receive a fair trial. It will therefore confine its examination to the question whether the proceedings in their entirety were fair (ibid., pp. 34-35, § 34)."

It is a fundamental aspect of the right to a fair trial that criminal proceedings, including the elements of such proceedings which relate to procedure, should be adversarial and that there should be equality of arms between the prosecution and defence. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party (see the Brandstetter v. Austria judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 211, pp. 27-28, §§ 66 ‑ 67). In addition Article 6 § 1 requires, as indeed does English law (see paragraph 34 above), that the prosecution authorities disclose to the defence all material evidence in their possession for or against the accused (see the Edwards judgment cited above, p. 35, § 36)."

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 § 1 (see the Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, p. 712, § 58). Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see the Doorson judgment cited above, p. 471, § 72, and the Van Mechelen and Others judgment cited above, p. 712, § 54)."

In addition, the first-instance judge would have been in a position to monitor the need for disclosure throughout the trial, assessing the importance of the undisclosed evidence at a stage when new issues were emerging, when it might have been possible through cross-examination seriously to undermine the credibility of key witnesses and when the defence case was still open to take a number of different directions or emphases.

They alleged that the decision to disjoin the cases and the subsequent use of evidence originating from the accelerated proceedings against X had had a prejudicial effect on their case. The applicants contended that there had been no obligation to disjoin the proceedings, and that it had been done with the aim of compelling X to give false evidence against them. They pointed out that they had not been party to the proceedings against X and could not have challenged the decisions or the evidence relating to that case. Despite this, the judgment against X had formed the basis of their conviction. Moreover, the testimony of X, the key witness in their case, had been unreliable because he had previously entered into plea-bargaining in the same criminal case and had had a vested interest in the outcome of the applicants ’ proceedings. In particular, his sentence could have been reversed in accordance with Article 317 § 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, if it had transpired that he had made false statements during his plea-bargaining. At the applicants ’ trial, in his capacity as a witness, he had had no choice but to reiterate the statements he had previously made as an accused when not under oath.

The applicants submitted that, contrary to the Government ’ s claim, the court which had examined their case had been bound by the earlier judgment in X ’ s case, which, by operation of Article 90 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was res judicata irrespective of whether the court had expressly referred to it as such."

When the cases had been disjoined no list of the material transferred had been drawn up. Accordingly, the applicants had had no knowledge as to what evidence had been attached to X ’ s file. They suggested that some exonerating evidence could have been concealed from them. They specifically referred to the collection of telephone-tapping records that had been incomplete in their own case files but had been fully disclosed in X ’ s file; the trial court had refused to allow them to access or examine the missing records."

The applicants also complained that the trial court had allowed X ’ s and other witness statements given during the investigation to be read out before the defence had had the opportunity to cross-examine them. The applicants submitted that those statements had reflected the investigators ’, not the witnesses ’ own accounts; reading them out during the applicants ’ trial had thus served to “remind” the witnesses of the official interpretation. The applicants had insisted at the trial on having a chance to cross-examine the relevant witnesses before the earlier statements had been read out, but the court had decided otherwise."

They maintained, in particular, that VLK had entered into a lawful transaction with Kirovles, and that the parties had concluded, implemented and terminated the contract freely and in accordance with their discretion and commercial interests. This transaction had not been challenged as invalid, a sham, or irregular. In essence, the second applicant had been prosecuted for carrying out the ordinary activities of a commercial intermediary, and the first applicant for advising the parties to the transaction.

The Court accepts that in complex criminal proceedings involving several persons who cannot be tried together, references by the trial court to the participation of third parties, who may later be tried separately, may be indispensable for the assessment of the guilt of those on trial. Criminal courts are obliged to establish the facts of the case relevant for the assessment of the legal responsibility of the accused as accurately and precisely as possible, and they cannot present established facts as mere allegations or suspicions. This also applies to facts related to the involvement of third parties, though if such facts have to be introduced, the court should avoid giving more information than necessary for the assessment of the legal responsibility of those accused in the trial before it. Even if the law expressly states that no inferences about the guilt of a person can be drawn from criminal proceedings in which he or she has not participated, judicial decisions must be worded so as to avoid any potential pre ‑ judgment about the third party ’ s guilt in order not to jeopardise the fair examination of the charges in the separate proceedings (see Karaman, cited above, §§ 64 ‑ 65 )."

Where the effect of plea ‑ bargaining is that a criminal charge against the accused is determined in an accelerated form of judicial examination, this amounts, in substance, to a waiver of a number of procedural rights. To be effective for Convention purposes, therefore, any waiver of procedural rights must always be established in an unequivocal manner, must be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance and must not run counter to any important public interest (see Scoppola v.

That said, decisions that are “arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable” may be found to be incompatible with the guarantees of a fair hearing (see Khamidov, cited above, § 107; Berhani v. Albania, no. 847/05, §§ 50-56, 27 May 2010; Ajdarić v. Croatia, no. 20883/09, § § 47-52, 13 December 2011; and Anđelković v. Serbia, no. 1401/08, §§ 26-29, 9 April 2013).",

The Court observes that the applicants ’ complaints about the manner in which evidence was admitted and assessed and the way the witnesses were examined converge on the same underlying allegation that the criminal proceedings against X and the two applicants had been structured in a way which rendered the proceedings as a whole unfair. They effectively alleged that X ’ s conviction in separate accelerated proceedings had been instrumental in circumventing important guarantees they would have been entitled to if all three co-accused had been tried together. Likewise, the complaint lodged under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention about the formulae used in the judgment against X and the prejudicial impact which that had on the applicants ’ sentence, essentially refers to the same underlying issue. It follows that even though each of the complaints under Article 6 §§ 1, 2 and 3(d) of the Convention would in principle be capable of raising a separate issue under the Convention, in the present case it is appropriate to treat the specific allegations as elements of general fairness."

                "103. In the present case, the criminal charges against the applicants were based on the same facts as those against X, and the three individuals were accused of conspiring to steal the same assets. It is therefore undeniable that any facts established in the proceedings against X and any legal findings made therein would have been directly relevant to the applicants ’ case. In such circumstances, it was essential for safeguards to be in place to ensure that the procedural steps and decisions taken in the proceedings against X would not undermine the fairness of the hearing in the subsequent proceedings against the applicants. This was particularly so, given that the applicants were legally precluded from any form of participation in the disjoined proceedings as they had not been granted any status which would have allowed them to challenge the decisions and findings made therein."
            ],
            [
                "104. The Court has previously highlighted the first and most obvious guarantee to be secured when co-accused are tried in separate sets of proceedings, notably the courts ’ obligation to refrain from any statements that may have a prejudicial effect on the pending proceedings, even if they are not binding (see Karaman, cited above, §§ 42-43 and 64-56 ). If the nature of the charges makes it unavoidable for the involvement of third parties to be established in one set of proceedings and those findings would be consequential on the assessment of the legal responsibility of the third parties tried separately, this should be considered as a serious obstacle for disjoining the cases. Any decision to examine cases with such strong factual ties in separate criminal proceedings must be based on a careful assessment of all countervailing interests, and the co-accused must be given an opportunity to object to the cases being separated."

                "105. The second requirement for the conduct of concurrent proceedings is that the quality of res judicata would not be attached to facts admitted in a case to which the individuals were not party. The state of the evidence admitted in one case must remain purely relative and its effect strictly limited to that particular set of proceedings. In other words, in the present case no finding of fact made in the proceedings against X could have been admitted in the applicants ’ case without full and proper examination at the applicants ’ trial. Moreover, the procedure followed by the court in X ’ s case had been accelerated, and the establishment of facts had been a result of plea-bargaining, not the judicial examination of evidence. Consequently, the facts relied on in that case had been legally assumed rather than proven. As such, they could not have been transposed to another set of criminal proceedings without their admissibility and credibility being scrutinised and validated in those other proceedings, in an adversarial manner, like all other evidence."

                "106. These two basic requirements have not been complied with in the present case. The Court accepts the applicants ’ argument that the Leninskiy District Court of Kirov had worded its judgment of 24 December 2012 as regards X so that no doubt could remain either about their identities or involvement in the crime of which X had been convicted. Although the said District Court, as the Government rightly pointed out, could not find the applicants guilty in those proceedings, it expressed its findings of fact and opinion about their participation in the offence in such terms which could not be defined as anything but prejudicial."
            ],
            [
                "107. Turning to the question of res judicata, the Court takes cognisance of the Government ’ s argument that the courts adjudicating the applicants ’ criminal case had not been bound by the judgment in X ’ s case. It notes, however, that Article 90 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as worded at the material time, expressly afforded the force of res judicata to judgments even if issued in accelerated proceedings (see paragraph 79 above). Moreover, by stating that “ Circumstances established in a judgment ... shall be accepted by a court ... without additional verification”, it set forth the rule whereby not only a finding of guilt of an accused but also findings of fact would formally have potential prejudicial effect. Even though in accordance with Article 90, a judgment cannot predetermine the guilt of those who have not participated in the criminal case under consideration, the fact that the circumstances established in the judgment against X had the force of res judicata in effect contravened that prohibition."
            ],
            [
                "108. The Government argued that in the applicants ’ case the trial court had been obliged to examine all evidence and witnesses and to base its assessment exclusively on the material and testimony presented at the hearing. Even so, the Court considers that in the circumstances, the courts acting in concurrent proceedings had an obvious incentive to remain concordant, because any conflicting findings made in related cases could undermine the validity of both judgments issued by the same court. The Court considers that in the present case, the risk of issuing contradictory judgments was a factor that discouraged the judges from finding out the truth and diminished their capacity to administer justice, thus causing irreparable damage to the court ’ s independence, impartiality and, more generally, its ability to ensure a fair hearing. In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that the judgment of 24 December 2012 had a prejudicial effect on the criminal proceedings against the applicants, and reference to that judgment in the applicants ’ sentence, even without express reliance on it, accentuated that effect."
            ],
            [
                "109. In the same vein, the Court considers that the separation of the cases, particularly X ’ s conviction with the use of plea-bargaining and accelerated proceedings, compromised his competence as a witness in the applicants ’ case. As noted above, his conviction was based on the version of events formulated by the prosecution and the accused in the plea-bargaining process, and it was not required that that account be verified or corroborated by other evidence. Standing later as a witness, X was compelled to repeat his statements made as an accused during plea-bargaining. Indeed, if during the applicants ’ trial X ’ s earlier statement had been exposed as false, the judgment issued on the basis of his plea-bargaining agreement could have been reversed, thus depriving him of the negotiated reduction of his sentence. Moreover, by allowing X ’ s earlier statements to be read out at the trial before the defence could cross-examine him as a witness, the court could give an independent observer the impression that it had encouraged the witness to maintain a particular version of events. Everything above confirms the applicants ’ argument that the procedure in which evidence had been obtained from X and used in their trial had been suggestive of manipulation incompatible with the notion of a fair hearing."

                "110. Turning to the point of the allegedly arbitrary application of criminal law, the Court observes that the second applicant, Mr Ofitserov, was convicted of facilitating embezzlement committed by X. The acts imputable to him consisted of setting up a timber trading company VLK, concluding on behalf of that company a framework contract with a timber supplier, Kirovles, and buying Kirovles ’ timber and reselling it to customers at 7% commission, in accordance with the framework contract and its annexes containing specific sales contracts based on its heads of terms. The first applicant, Mr Navalnyy, was convicted of introducing the second applicant to X, Kirovles ’ director, and of fostering commercial ties between VLK and Kirovles, acts defined as organising embezzlement."
            ],
            [
                "111. In the original charges, these acts had been defined as deception or abuse of trust, an offence under Article 165 of the Criminal Code, allegedly committed against X, but those charges were dropped for lack of corpus delicti. Subsequently, the prosecution and the courts decided that it had been X who had embezzled Kirovles ’ assets by entering into a loss ‑ making transaction, and the applicants were assigned the roles of his accomplices."
            ],
            [
                "112. The Court observes that under Russian law, limited liability companies such as VLK are defined as commercial entities whose main purpose is deriving profits (Article 50 of the Civil Code). The Court also notes that the domestic courts did not establish, and it was not even argued, that VLK by signing the contract and charging commission had pursued a goal other than deriving profit from timber resale. Moreover, neither the validity of the sales contract between VLK and Kirovles, nor its legal nature, were called into question. It had not been imputed to either X or the applicants that they had concluded a sham transaction or that it had implied a money laundering, tax evasion or kick-back scheme, or that the parties had conspired in advance to turn the proceeds from VLK ’ s commission to some other unlawful or dubious purpose. On the contrary, it transpires from the material in the case file that the two parties to the contract had pursued commercial goals independently of each other and that those goals were precisely those that had been stipulated in the contract. It is also noteworthy that when the court referred to Article 10 § 1 of the Civil Code and found that the transaction had caused damage to Kirovles, it had not established that doing so had been the applicants ’ exclusive goal, or that they had acted in bad faith or in breach of fair competition rules, contrary to that Article."
            ],
            [
                "113. As regards Kirovles ’ losses imputed to VLK and, ultimately, the applicants, the Court observes that neither the nature of the transaction nor the context in which it was concluded imposed or implied a requirement that the buyer, VLK, would have to exercise a special duty of care towards the seller, Kirovles, to ensure that the latter sold the timber at the best possible price. Such a requirement would have indeed been an exception to the principle that each party carries the risks associated with a transaction in accordance with the terms of contract. In the present case, there was no basis for such an exception or legal obstacle for the parties to agree on VLK ’ s commission and set it out in the contract the way they did."
            ],
            [
                "114. It may be derived from X ’ s statements at the applicants ’ trial that he concluded the contract with VLK because he was under the impression that he was obliged to do so by the first applicant because he had associated him with the Governor ’ s team. However, the trial court also found that the first applicant had no mandate to compel X to choose VLK as a commercial partner and had not made any false representations to the contrary. Accordingly, even if X ’ s assertions were true and he had indeed entered into an unprofitable transaction for the wrong reasons, no causal link was established between the applicants ’ conduct and Kirovles ’ losses, if any. Moreover, the losses of Kirovles were not established on the basis of VLK ’ s commission, inter alia, but were found to constitute the total amount payable for the timber under the contract."

                "115. As such, the courts found the second applicant guilty of acts indistinguishable from regular commercial middleman activities, and the first applicant for fostering them. The Court considers that in the present case the questions of interpretation and application of national law go beyond a regular assessment of the applicants ’ individual criminal responsibility or the establishment of corpus delicti, matters which are primarily within the domestic courts ’ domain. It is confronted with a situation where the acts described as criminal fell entirely outside the scope of the provision under which the applicants were convicted and were not concordant with its intended aim. In other words, the criminal law was arbitrarily and unforeseeably construed to the detriment of the applicants, leading to a manifestly unreasonable outcome of the trial."

                "116. The foregoing findings demonstrate that the domestic courts have failed, by a long margin, to ensure a fair hearing in the applicants ’ criminal case, and may be taken as suggesting that they did not even care about appearances. It is noteworthy that the courts dismissed without examination the applicants ’ allegations of political persecution which were at least arguable for the following reasons."

The Court observes that the anti-corruption campaign run by the first applicant gained its momentum in the course of 2010; that year it targeted high-ranking officials, including the President of the Russian Federation, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chief of the Investigative Committee. Mr Navalnyy ’ s investigations attracted the increasing attention of his Internet blog followers, but also a wider audience through other media republishing the blog content and giving him airtime. Irrespective of whether the officials concerned acknowledged the publications, and whether or not they contested the allegations, they undoubtedly found them unwelcome. Furthermore, it was becoming clear that the first applicant would not confine his revelations to the audience of a niche press, but that his aspiration was to become an acting politician at the national level, capable of reaching out to a wider public. Since the conviction came into force he has been ineligible to stand for elections and has been restricted in his freedom of movement. It is also relevant that his criminal record has been relied on to justify his house arrest, the terms of which included, among other restrictions, a ban on making public statements, even those unrelated to the criminal proceedings."

                "118. It appears that the first applicant ’ s publications were a regular feature, and virtually any date on which his prosecution would begin would inevitably coincide with some of his articles appearing in the media. Even so, it is impossible to overlook that the first Kirovles inquiry was opened on 9 December 2010, three weeks after the publication of the big-time financial scandal relating to the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline project and implicating Russia ’ s top officials. Over the next two years the inquiry stopped and restarted several times, but in 2012 it was resolutely reopened under the direct orders of Mr Bastrykin, the Chief of the Investigative Committee. This upsurge came at a period when the first applicant was investigating Mr Bastrykin ’ s own off-duty activities; this investigation resulted in the publication of 26 July 2012 exposing Mr Bastrykin ’ s business and residence status as incompatible with his office (see paragraph 31 above). The criminal case was reopened under Mr Bastrykin ’ s direct orders, and this was reflected in his speech of 5 July 2012 when he deplored its termination and unequivocally pledged to take disciplinary action against any investigator failing to pursue the first applicant."

It is obvious for the Court, as it must also have been for the domestic courts, that there had been a link between the first applicant ’ s public activities and the Investigative Committee ’ s decision to press charges against him. It was therefore the duty of the domestic courts to scrutinise his allegations of political pressure and to decide whether, despite that link, there had been a genuine cause for bringing him to justice. The same goes for the second applicant who had an arguable claim that he was only targeted as a vehicle for also bringing the first applicant into the orbit of the criminal case, a reason equally unrelated to the true purposes of a criminal prosecution. Having omitted to address these allegations the courts have themselves heightened the concerns that the real reason for the applicants ’ prosecution and conviction was a political one."

                "68. The Court further reiterates that in the case of assize courts sitting with a lay jury, any special procedural features must be accommodated, seeing that the jurors are usually not required – or not permitted – to give reasons for their personal convictions (see Taxquet, cited above, § 92). In these circumstances, Article 6 requires an assessment of whether sufficient safeguards were in place to avoid any risk of arbitrariness and to enable the accused to understand the reasons for his or her conviction (ibid., §§ 90 and 92; see also Judge v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 35863/10, 8 February 2011; Shala v. Norway (dec.), no. 1195/10, 10 July 2012; and Agnelet, cited above). Such procedural safeguards may include, for example, directions or guidance provided by the presiding judge to the jurors on the legal issues arising or the evidence adduced, and precise, unequivocal questions put to the jury by the judge, forming a framework on which the verdict is based and sufficiently offsetting the fact that no reasons are given for the jury ’ s answers (see Papon v. France (dec.), no. 54210/00, ECHR 2001-XII; see also Taxquet, cited above). Lastly, regard must be had to any avenues of appeal open to the accused."

                "75. The Court observes at the outset that while the present case concerns the reasons why the applicant was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the premeditated intentional homicide of her five children, the question before it does not relate either to whether and how those acts were committed – both of which matters were established and were admitted by the applicant – or to the legal characterisation of the offences or the severity of the sentence. The issue to be determined in the present case is whether or not the applicant was able to understand the reasons why the jury found that she had been responsible for her actions at the material time, notwithstanding the unanimous findings to the contrary reached by the psychiatric experts, who presented their new report at the end of the trial in the Assize Court (see paragraph 32 above)."

                "76. The Court observes that at the start of the trial the indictment was read out in full and the nature of the offence forming the basis of the charge and any circumstances that might aggravate or mitigate the sentence were likewise indicated. The case against the applicant was then the subject of adversarial argument, each item of evidence being examined and the defendant, assisted by counsel, having the opportunity to call witnesses and respond to the testimony heard. The questions put by the president to the twelve members of the jury at the end of the ten-day hearing were read out and the parties were given a copy."
            ],
            [
                "77. With regard to the combined impact of the indictment and the questions to the jury in the present case, the Court notes firstly that the indictment, which ran to fifty-one pages, gave an account of the precise sequence of events, the steps taken and evidence obtained during the investigation, and the forensic medical reports; a substantial part of it also focused on the applicant ’ s personal history and family life and the motives and reasons that had prompted her to carry out the killings, particularly in the light of the expert assessments of her psychological and mental state (see paragraph 29 above). It observes, however, that the indictment was of limited effect in assisting an understanding of the verdict to be reached by the jury, since it was filed before the trial hearing, which forms the crucial part of proceedings in the Assize Court (see Taxquet, cited above, § 95; and Agnelet, cited above, § 65). Furthermore, as to the findings of fact set out in the indictment and their value in assisting an understanding of the verdict, the Court cannot speculate as to whether such findings influenced the deliberations and the decision ultimately reached by the jury (see, in particular, Agnelet, cited above; Voica, cited above, § 49; and Legillon, cited above, § 61). The provisions of Article 6 require in particular an understanding not of the reasons that prompted the judicial investigating bodies to send the case for trial in the Assize Court, but rather of the reasons that persuaded the members of the jury, after the trial hearing at which they had been present, to reach their decision on the issue of guilt."
            ],
            [
                "78. As regards the five questions put to the jury in the present case, it answered the first two in the affirmative and the fifth in the negative. The first question was the principal question concerning the applicant ’ s guilt, the second concerned the aggravating circumstance of premeditation and the fifth – contrary to what the applicant appears to maintain (see paragraph 52 above) – related to her current mental state; the other questions were subsidiary and ultimately devoid of purpose."
            ],
            [
                "79. The Court notes, firstly, that counsel for the applicant did not raise any objections on learning of the president ’ s questions to the jury, seeking neither to amend them nor to propose others. Furthermore, since the first question concerned the applicant ’ s guilt, a positive answer necessarily implied that the jury found that she had been responsible for her actions at the material time. The applicant cannot therefore maintain that she was unable to understand the jury ’ s position on this matter."
            ],
            [
                "80. Admittedly, the jury did not provide any reasons for its finding in that regard, and this was the subject of the applicant ’ s grievance. The Court reiterates, however, that compliance with the requirements of a fair trial must be assessed on the basis of the proceedings as a whole by examining whether, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, the procedure followed made it possible for the accused to understand why he or she was found guilty (see Taxquet, cited above, § 93). Such an examination in the present case may reveal a number of factors that should have dispelled any doubts on the applicant ’ s part as to the jurors ’ conviction regarding her criminal responsibility at the time of the events. The Court observes that from its preliminary stage, the investigation focused on the applicant ’ s personal history, character and psychological state at the time of the killings, as is shown by the indictment, a substantial part of which was devoted to these matters. Moreover, not only was there an adversarial trial, with the defendant and her counsel present, but above all, the emergence of new evidence, namely the letters disclosed by the applicant ’ s personal psychiatrist, led the president to order a further psychiatric assessment (see paragraph 31 above). The psychiatric experts thereupon changed their opinion and came back to present their new findings (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above). It is clear that while the trial hearing always forms the crucial part of proceedings in the Assize Court, in the present case the question of the applicant ’ s criminal responsibility was indeed a central focus of the hearing."

                "81. The Court further notes that the sentencing judgment adopted by the Assize Court, composed of the twelve members of the jury together with the three professional judges, also includes reasoning that could assist the applicant in understanding why the jury found her criminally responsible. Thus, while noting the applicant ’ s psychological problems and the possible factors causing her to act as she did, the Assize Court explicitly mentioned both her resolve to commit the murders and the cold-blooded manner in which she had carried them out (see paragraph 36 above); this was a logical conclusion in view of the jury ’ s answers to the questions. The Court of Cassation, moreover, did not interpret the sentencing judgment in any other way, since it held that consideration of the applicant ’ s cold-blooded manner and her determination to carry out her crimes had constituted the Assize Court ’ s reason for finding that she had been criminally responsible at the time of the events (see paragraph 39 above)."
            ],
            [
                "82. In the Court ’ s view, the fact that the sentencing judgment was drafted by professional judges who had not attended the deliberations on the issue of guilt cannot call into question the value and impact of the explanations provided to the applicant. It observes firstly that these explanations were provided without delay, at the end of the Assize Court session, since the sentencing judgment was delivered on 19 December 2008. It further notes that although the professional judges formally drafted the judgment in question, they were able to obtain the observations of the twelve members of the jury, who in fact sat alongside them in deliberating on the sentence and whose names appear in the judgment. Lastly, the professional judges were themselves present throughout the trial hearing, and must therefore have been in a position to place those observations in their proper context."
            ],
            [
                "83. The fact remains that the applicant criticised the lack of specific explanations for the difference in opinion between the jury, which had found her criminally responsible, and the three psychiatric experts, who in their last report had stated their unanimous opinion that the applicant had been “suffering at the time of the events from a severe mental disturbance making her incapable of controlling her actions”. However, the Court reiterates that both the admissibility of evidence and its assessment are primarily a matter for regulation by national law and that as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court ’ s duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, its function is not to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1998, § 46, Series A no. 140; Bernard v. France, 23 April 1998, § 37, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II; and Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2), no. 22251/08, ECHR 2015). Besides the fact that the experts themselves played down the impact of their findings by stating that their answers reflected their personal conviction while acknowledging that “[t]hey are only ever an informed opinion, and not an absolute scientific truth” (see paragraph 32 above), the Court has already found that statements made by psychiatric experts at an Assize Court trial form only one part of the evidence submitted to the jury (see Bernard, cited above, § 40). Accordingly, the fact that the jury did not indicate the reasons that prompted it to adopt a view at variance with the psychiatric experts ’ final report in favour of the applicant was not capable of preventing her from understanding, as noted above, the decision to find her criminally responsible."

Dr M.S. certified her unfit for work on account of depression and asthenia. Subsequently, her insurance company ’ s medical adviser confirmed that she was unfit for work on account of depression. In October 1996 a report by a court-appointed psychiatrist, which was later endorsed by the Employment Tribunal, diagnosed her as suffering from “recurrent endogenous anxiety and depression, with a slightly destabilised basic personality”, rendering her more than 66% unfit for work. The expert concluded as follows:",
                "“... social contact feeds a sense of persecution and interpretative paranoia. The patient is socially withdrawn and has a tendency to retreat into herself. When faced with anxiety-inducing situations, the patient regresses emotionally, retreats into herself and takes refuge in passive-receptive and hypochondriac behaviour. On account of her intrinsic sensitivity, her anxiety may be combined with reactive depression. To conclude, we are confronted with a fragile, sensitive and anxious personality, with feelings of abandonment and phobic and obsessional components, who is likely, in situations of anxiety, to regress emotionally, to withdraw into herself and to develop various manifestations of anxiety, persecution and depression.”"

In December 2006 D.V. successively prescribed the applicant two types of sleeping tablets. On 12 January 2007 she linked her exhaustion to the fact that she could not bear Dr M.S. ’ s presence, and on that occasion D.V. noted “a feeling of dependence” on M.S. financially, “a feeling of insecurity” and “a feeling towards that person [M.S.] which was one of intrusion, of having an unwelcome person under her roof, and also a great deal of ambivalence”."

It was not hard to imagine that the analysis set out in the experts ’ report of 30 October 2007 had instilled a firm conviction in the members of the jury and that their minds had already been made up by the time the experts had unanimously reached the opposite conclusion in 2008 after being appointed by the President of the Assize Court to submit a further report.

In these circumstances, Article 6 requires an assessment of whether sufficient safeguards were in place to avoid any risk of arbitrariness and to enable the accused to understand the reasons for his or her conviction (ibid., §§ 90 and 92; see also Judge v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 35863/10, 8 February 2011; Shala v.

Such procedural safeguards may include, for example, directions or guidance provided by the presiding judge to the jurors on the legal issues arising or the evidence adduced, and precise, unequivocal questions put to the jury by the judge, forming a framework on which the verdict is based and sufficiently offsetting the fact that no reasons are given for the jury ’ s answers (see Papon v.

In doing so, it must bear in mind that it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies (see Salduz v.

The issue to be determined in the present case is whether or not the applicant was able to understand the reasons why the jury found that she had been responsible for her actions at the material time, notwithstanding the unanimous findings to the contrary reached by the psychiatric experts, who presented their new report at the end of the trial in the Assize Court (see paragraph 32 above)."

With regard to the combined impact of the indictment and the questions to the jury in the present case, the Court notes firstly that the indictment, which ran to fifty-one pages, gave an account of the precise sequence of events, the steps taken and evidence obtained during the investigation, and the forensic medical reports; a substantial part of it also focused on the applicant ’ s personal history and family life and the motives and reasons that had prompted her to carry out the killings, particularly in the light of the expert assessments of her psychological and mental state (see paragraph 29 above). It observes, however, that the indictment was of limited effect in assisting an understanding of the verdict to be reached by the jury, since it was filed before the trial hearing, which forms the crucial part of proceedings in the Assize Court (see Taxquet, cited above, § 95; and Agnelet, cited above, § 65). Furthermore, as to the findings of fact set out in the indictment and their value in assisting an understanding of the verdict, the Court cannot speculate as to whether such findings influenced the deliberations and the decision ultimately reached by the jury (see, in particular, Agnelet, cited above; Voica, cited above, § 49; and Legillon, cited above, § 61). The provisions of Article 6 require in particular an understanding not of the reasons that prompted the judicial investigating bodies to send the case for trial in the Assize Court, but rather of the reasons that persuaded the members of the jury, after the trial hearing at which they had been present, to reach their decision on the issue of guilt."

The Court reiterates, however, that compliance with the requirements of a fair trial must be assessed on the basis of the proceedings as a whole by examining whether, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, the procedure followed made it possible for the accused to understand why he or she was found guilty (see Taxquet, cited above, § 93). Such an examination in the present case may reveal a number of factors that should have dispelled any doubts on the applicant ’ s part as to the jurors ’ conviction regarding her criminal responsibility at the time of the events. The Court observes that from its preliminary stage, the investigation focused on the applicant ’ s personal history, character and psychological state at the time of the killings, as is shown by the indictment, a substantial part of which was devoted to these matters. Moreover, not only was there an adversarial trial, with the defendant and her counsel present, but above all, the emergence of new evidence, namely the letters disclosed by the applicant ’ s personal psychiatrist, led the president to order a further psychiatric assessment (see paragraph 31 above). The psychiatric experts thereupon changed their opinion and came back to present their new findings (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above). It is clear that while the trial hearing always forms the crucial part of proceedings in the Assize Court, in the present case the question of the applicant ’ s criminal responsibility was indeed a central focus of the hearing."

Thus, while noting the applicant ’ s psychological problems and the possible factors causing her to act as she did, the Assize Court explicitly mentioned both her resolve to commit the murders and the cold-blooded manner in which she had carried them out (see paragraph 36 above); this was a logical conclusion in view of the jury ’ s answers to the questions. The Court of Cassation, moreover, did not interpret the sentencing judgment in any other way, since it held that consideration of the applicant ’ s cold-blooded manner and her determination to carry out her crimes had constituted the Assize Court ’ s reason for finding that she had been criminally responsible at the time of the events (see paragraph 39 above)."

It further notes that although the professional judges formally drafted the judgment in question, they were able to obtain the observations of the twelve members of the jury, who in fact sat alongside them in deliberating on the sentence and whose names appear in the judgment. Lastly, the professional judges were themselves present throughout the trial hearing, and must therefore have been in a position to place those observations in their proper context."

However, the Court reiterates that both the admissibility of evidence and its assessment are primarily a matter for regulation by national law and that as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court ’ s duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, its function is not to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, Schenk v.

Besides the fact that the experts themselves played down the impact of their findings by stating that their answers reflected their personal conviction while acknowledging that “[t]hey are only ever an informed opinion, and not an absolute scientific truth” (see paragraph 32 above), the Court has already found that statements made by psychiatric experts at an Assize Court trial form only one part of the evidence submitted to the jury (see Bernard, cited above, § 40). Accordingly, the fact that the jury did not indicate the reasons that prompted it to adopt a view at variance with the psychiatric experts ’ final report in favour of the applicant was not capable of preventing her from understanding, as noted above, the decision to find her criminally responsible."

This court also refused the request by the defence to examine the case files of the Rijeka County Court no. Kir-Us-1/09 and the Zagreb County Court no.

In any event, as to the request by the defence that the secret surveillance orders be excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence, it should be noted that these are not evidence but court decisions so they cannot be excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence.

                "“It is to be noted that the question of the use of evidence obtained by special investigative measures in criminal proceedings is regulated under Article 182 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This provision expressly excludes the use of such evidence obtained contrary to Articles 180 and 182 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",
                "The submissions of the accused in support of their request for the exclusion of unlawfully obtained evidence on the grounds that the orders issued by the investigating judge (save for the one of 8 March 2008) contained no reasons and was thus ex lege unlawful evidence is not correct.",
                "Specifically, an order (just like judgments and decisions) is an act of the court and in principle (unlike judgments and decisions) contains no reasons. The duty to state reasons in court orders is exceptional where search orders and orders for the use of special investigative measures limiting constitutional rights and freedoms are concerned. The requirement for the court to give reasoned orders for the use of special investigative measures limiting constitutional rights and freedoms flows from the requirement contained in Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The lawmaker did not, however, seek to sanction conduct of the courts contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ..., Article 182 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that “the results [of the use of special investigative measures] cannot be used in criminal proceedings”.",
                "It follows that the lack of reasons for the orders concerning the use of special investigative measures limiting constitutional rights and freedoms does not render the evidence thus obtained unlawful. This also follows from the wording of the part of Article 9 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provides that unlawfully obtained evidence is evidence obtained in breach of the law on criminal procedure where such unlawfulness is expressly envisaged under a legal provision, which is not the case regarding conduct contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",
                "With regard to conduct contrary to Article 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which would provide grounds for a conclusion of unlawfulness of evidence, it is to be noted that this provision is multi-layered.",
                "Without doubt, evidence is ex lege unlawfully obtained if it is the result of the use of special investigative measures limiting constitutional rights and freedoms which have not been ordered by the court based on a request by the State Attorney; if the measures do not relate to an individual concerning one of the offences under Article 181 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; or if a measure other than those provided for by law is ordered.",
                "A further condition, referred to in the decision of the Constitutional Court [ no. U-III-857/2008 of 1 October 2008; see paragraph 57 above] invoked by the appellants is the requirement that the general conditions for the use of such orders have been met, namely, the existence of probable cause to believe that an individual has committed one of the offences listed under the law, with regard to which the order is issued, and that the investigation cannot be carried out by other means or that it would be extremely difficult.",
                "It goes without saying that the investigating judge, when ruling on the request of the State Attorney, must take these general conditions into account. However, since the lack of reasons does not render the evidence obtained unlawful ex lege, the mere fact that an order has been issued based on a request by the State Attorney indicates that the general conditions have been met. However, if the investigating judge disagrees with the request to issue an order for the use of special investigative measures, and finds that the general conditions have not been met, he or she will request the panel under Article 20 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to rule on the matter, ...",
                "Of course, a citizen whose constitutional rights and freedoms are thus limited, which is possible under Article 16 of the Constitution only in accordance with the law and in order to protect the rights and freedoms of others or the legal order, public morals or health, must be able to verify whether the legal conditions, including the general ones, for such limitation have been met, in order to protect his or her constitutional rights from unjustified infringement by the executive, and possibly judicial, authorities. It is therefore understandable that the accused are now challenging the lawfulness of the orders from the perspective of the general conditions for their use, which is certainly relevant for the question of the lawfulness of the evidence thus obtained. ...",
                "Furthermore, in order that the court may issue an order for the use of special investigative measures, the request for their use must contain a statement of reasons to the effect that the investigation cannot be conducted by means other than interfering with the constitutional rights and freedoms, or that this would be extremely difficult. The very fact that the order has been issued, ..., even if, contrary to the law, it does not contain reasons, in itself implies acceptance of the arguments contained in the reasons for the request [for the use of special investigative measures].",
                "However, fully accepting the rights of citizens to question the existence of the general conditions for issuing an order, the court being requested to exclude from the case file evidence obtained by such contested orders for the use of special investigative measures is obliged, where no reasons are stated in the order contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to provide specific reasons with regard to the relevant questions. That court ... must carefully analyse the content of the request of the State attorney [for the use of special investigative measures] and other accompanying material and decide whether it can conclude from the request that, at the relevant time, there existed a suspicion that an individual had committed one of the offences listed under the law, and why it considers that obtaining the evidence by the use of measures interfering with the constitutional rights of citizens is necessary ...",
                "These answers, contrary to the appeal submissions, can be given when ruling on the lawfulness of the orders issued [for the use special investigative measures] given that the orders, contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, do not contain a statement of reasons, and that the lawmaker, having regard to the provisions of Article 282 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, did not sanction it by unlawfulness of evidence obtained by the use of such defective orders. The purpose of the provision concerning unlawful evidence is not to exclude evidence in favour of persons in respect of whom there is a reasonable suspicion that they have committed an offence, but to protect citizens who are presumed innocent (until proven guilty ) from illegal actions by the judicial and executive authorities where such actions are illegal to such an extent that the lawmaker expressly categorised the results as unlawfully obtained evidence.”"

In assessing the existence and extent of such necessity the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation but this margin is subject to European supervision. The Court has to determine whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the “interference” to what is “necessary in a democratic society”. In addition, the values of a democratic society must be followed as faithfully as possible in the supervisory procedures if the bounds of necessity, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2, are not to be exceeded (see Kvasnica, cited above, § 80; and Kennedy, cited above, § 154).",

Such a review necessarily entails some degree of abstraction (see Kruslin, cited above, § 32).

It was true that during the proceedings Judge Z. Č. had asked to withdraw from the case, but he had merely relied on his interpretation of the relevant domestic requirements without providing concrete grounds for the possible appearance of a lack of impartiality on his part. The final decision concerning his request had been given by the Supreme Court, which had examined the request for transfer of the proceedings to another court submitted by the President of the Dubrovnik County Court. The Supreme Court had explained that the fact that a judge had ordered pre-trial detention could not affect his or her impartiality as such a decision did not concern the same issues that the judge had to decide when examining the case on the merits. In the Government ’ s view, this interpretation had followed the relevant practice of the Court and the Constitutional Court. The applicant had thus misconstrued the request of Judge Z.

According to the Court ’ s case-law, there are two tests for assessing whether a tribunal is impartial within the meaning of Article 6 § 1. The first test (subjective) consists in seeking to determine the personal conviction of a particular judge in a given case. The personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary. As to the second test (objective), it means determining whether, quite apart from the personal conduct of a judge, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his/her impartiality (see, for example, Padovani v. Italy, 26 February 1993, § 26, Series A no. 257 ‑ B; Gautrin and Others v. France, 20 May 1998, § 58, Reports 1998 ‑ III )."

Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 119, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ III)."

In cases where a judge presiding over the trial has already dealt with the case at an earlier stage of the proceedings and has given various decisions in respect of the applicant at the pre-trial stage – including decisions on continued detention – the Court has observed that, in general, one of the roles of the trial judge is to manage the proceedings with a view to ensuring the proper administration of justice. It is perfectly normal that a judge may consider and dismiss an application for release lodged by a detained defendant. In doing so the judge is required, under both the Convention and the domestic law, to establish the existence of a “reasonable suspicion” against the defendant. The mere fact that a trial judge has already taken pre-trial decisions in the case, including decisions relating to detention, cannot in itself justify fears as to his impartiality; only special circumstances may warrant a different conclusion (see Hauschildt v. Denmark, 24 May 1989, § 51, Series A no. 154; Sainte-Marie v. France, no. 12981/87, § 32, 16 December 1992; and Romenskiy v. Russia, no. 22875/02, § 27, 13 June 2013).

Indeed, the questions which the judge has to answer when taking decisions on continuing detention are not the same as those which are decisive for his final judgment. When taking a decision on detention on remand and other pre-trial decisions of this kind the judge summarily assesses the available data in order to ascertain whether there are prima facie grounds for the suspicion against an accused of having committed an offence; when giving judgment at the conclusion of the trial he must assess whether the evidence that has been produced and debated in court suffices for finding the accused guilty. Suspicion and formal finding of guilt are not to be treated as being the same (see Jasiński v. Poland, no. 30865/96, § 55, 20 December 2005 ).",

These elements played a role in the assessment of the grounds for ordering pre-trial detention under the relevant domestic law and, as such, had to be reviewed by Judge Z.Č. from the point of view of justification for the applicant ’ s continued detention.

In addition, this panel finds, that, with regard to the recordings which were to be examined at the trial, there was no obstacle to the defence lawyers examining [those recordings] in the court -house before the commencement of the trial.",

The special investigative measures ... applied in the case at issue are not provided for under the [ OSCOC Act ] and therefore the [investigating judge ’ s] orders could have been based only on the Code of Criminal Procedure. Had the investigating judge authorised any of the measures provided for in section 41 ( 1 ) of the [ OSCOC Act ], he would have been obliged to rely on that Act.",
                "The further arguments that the results of the special investigative measures are unlawfully obtained evidence because the investigating judge, when making the orders, around thirty of them, failed to comply with the requirements set out in the case-law of the Constitutional Court [no. U-III-857/ 2 008] to the effect that the orders must be sufficiently reasoned, are also ill- founded ...",
                "This court considers that mere flaws in the reasoning of the secret surveillance orders do not make the results of such measures unlawfully obtained evidence. This is because Article 9 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that unlawfully obtained evidence is evidence which has been obtained in breach of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and is expressly provided for by the [Code of Criminal Procedure].",
                "Article 182 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that evidence obtained by the use of secret surveillance, under Article 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, cannot be used as evidence in criminal proceedings only [in a case where] it is unlawful. That is to say, evidence which is obtained without a warrant issued by the investigating judge, or if the [police] acted contrary to Articles 180 and 182 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but [this does not concern] the evidence obtained contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that the order [authorising special investigative measures ] should, inter alia, refer to the facts which warrant the application of such measures, specifically that there is a reasonable suspicion that an individual has committed a criminal offence and that the investigation could not have been carried out by other means or that [to do so] would have been extremely difficult.",
                "Article 182 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is compatible with the legal nature of [ special investigation ] orders. Such orders [made by the investigating judge] are transmitted to the State Attorney, who is authorised to request them, and they are executed by the police. There is no legal avenue [to challenge] such orders since the [State Attorney] has no legal interest in challenging them. The police were therefore, moreover, not allowed to challenge the orders. If the argument of the appellants that secret surveillance orders would be unlawful when they are not sufficiently reasoned were to be accepted, it would call into doubt the [use of] secret surveillance measures, particularly in situations where all other legal conditions had been met but the order was merely not sufficiently reasoned, which would be absolutely unacceptable.”"

It is also not disputed that the State Attorney asked that eighteen CD and twenty-three DVD recordings be examined as evidence, and that the telecommunications expert made transcripts of these recordings, which were then forwarded to the parties. It is further undisputed that the recordings were reviewed at a hearing, that the accused and their lawyers were present, and that they made their objections concerning the transcripts and not concerning the recordings. It is to be noted that the transcripts are not evidence on which a conviction can be based but are only of auxiliary technical assistance. The only evidence on which a conviction can be based is the recordings, in respect of which no objections were made.",

Accordingly, in the Government ’ s view, the six-month time-limit had started running from that time and there had been no reason for the applicant to wait for the outcome of the criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the Government argued that the applicant had failed to raise his Article 8 complaints in his appeal to the Supreme Court and his constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court, and had therefore failed to properly exhaust the domestic remedies. The Government pointed out that the document, purportedly showing that J.K. had worked as a police officer, which the applicant had submitted with his observations to the Court of 31 December 2013, was a forgery. They provided a letter of the Ministry of the Interior of 27 January 2014 indicating that the document in question had never been issued in respect of J.K. The Government therefore considered that the applicant ’ s representative should be excluded from the proceedings under Rule 44D of the Rules of Court because she had provided falsified documents to the Court and had also provided certain confidential documents from other, unrelated, proceedings at the domestic level.

In other words, the Court must examine whether or not the prosecuting authorities confined themselves to “investigating criminal activity in an essentially passive manner” in the present case (see Ramanauskas, cited above, §§ 66-67; and Milinienė v.

The Court firstly notes that although there was no clear evidence that the applicant had committed any offences beforehand, in particular corruption-related offences, an investigation carried out by the prosecuting authorities into alleged corruption in the Fund suggested that the applicant might have been involved in illegal activities (see paragraphs 7-9 above). The first concrete allegations of the applicant ’ s corruption were made by J.K., who on 3 April 2007 contacted the State Attorney ’ s Office; the same day he was granted informant status concerning the matter (see paragraphs 10-12 above)."

In this connection it should be also noted that the applicant ’ s allegations that J.K. had previously worked as a police agent were based on far-fetched and fabricated evidence (see paragraphs 105 - 106 above). In fact, there is nothing suggesting that at his initial contact with the applicant J.K. was acting as an agent of the State or that he was acting for the prosecuting authorities on their instructions or otherwise under their control. The prosecuting authorities only instructed J.K. to act as an informant after he had reported the applicant ’ s corrupt offers. The Court sees nothing inadequate or arbitrary in that decision (see Gorgievski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 18002/02, § 52, 16 July 2009)."

In this connection the Court also cannot accept the applicant ’ s argument that there were not sufficient safeguards against abuse by informants in the domestic system at the relevant time. The Code of Criminal Procedure provided the relevant procedural and substantive requirements for recourse to informants in the investigation of crime and explicitly prohibited incitement. It also mandated judicial assessment of an arguable plea of entrapment and sanctioned the incitement by the exclusion of evidence so obtained from the proceedings (see paragraph 84 above), which the Court has already accepted as an appropriate remedy with regard to a successful plea of incitement (see Bannikova, cited above, § 56)."

It was he who explained to J.K. the modalities of the illegal activity, including the payments that should be carried out for the realisation of the project. He also insisted that those payments would not represent a significant financial burden for the investor and he explained the reasons why it was justified to ask for a percentage of the investment (see paragraph 68 above)."

Nor does the Court find that the prosecuting authorities ’ role was the determining factor. The determining factor was the conduct of the applicant in his contact with J.K. The Court therefore accepts that, on balance, the prosecuting authorities may be said to have “joined” the criminal activity rather than to have initiated it. Their actions thus remained within the bounds of undercover work rather than that of agents provocateurs in possible breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (compare Milinienė, cited above, § 38)."

In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see, amongst many other authorities, Bykov v.

Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66-67, Series A no. 211). In addition, Article 6 § 1 requires that the prosecution authorities disclose to the defence all material evidence in their possession for or against the accused (see Natunen v.

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 § 1 (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 58, Reports 1997 ‑ III ).

The Court noted that the judge had been aware of both the contents of the withheld evidence and the nature of the applicant ’ s case, and had thus been able to weigh the applicant ’ s interest in disclosure against the public interest in concealment (see, by contrast, Edwards and Lewis, cited above, § 46)."

In this context, importance is attached to appearances as well as to the increased sensitivity to the fair administration of justice.

It cannot be therefore held against the applicant that he did not make a specific application to access to that particular part of the recordings. Indeed, the applicant ’ s application for access to the recordings was not denied because he had failed to substantiate it or because he had failed to provide acceptable reasons for his application.

In this connection the Court notes that the necessity of achieving a balance between an individual ’ s Article 8 rights and a defendant ’ s defence rights may be a relevant consideration in a particular case (see paragraph 15 2 above; see also Y. v. Slovenia, no. 41107/10, § 115, ECHR 2015 (extracts)).

Instead, as already noted above, it dismissed the applicant ’ s application for access to the recordings at issue on the grounds that he had no right of access to those recordings. The Supreme Court thereby held that it was of no relevance whether the State Attorney, when making his selection of the secret surveillance material to be submitted to the court, excluded certain evidence in favour of the accused since the State Attorney had been in a position to make a selection of the evidence to be used in the proceeding (see paragraph 73 above)."

In the case at issue, the decision regarding the undisclosed evidence was made by the prosecuting authorities without providing the defence with the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process (compare Natunen, cited above, § 48).

Although, as already found above, the available material in the case file shows, with a sufficient degree of certainty, that the applicant was not incited to commit the offences at issue (see paragraph 1 46 above), the fact remains that he was prevented from having a procedure whereby it could be established whether the evidence in the possession of the prosecution that had been excluded from the file might have reduced his sentence or put into doubt the scope of his alleged criminal activity."

On 28 January 2011 V.Š., a convicted prisoner, provided a statement to the Special Investigation Service ( Specialiųjų tyrimų tarnyba, hereinafter “the STT”) and stated the following. He had heard from other inmates that the deputy head of Pravieniškės Correctional Facility, L.D., took bribes to transfer inmates to units with lighter security and that L.D. had mentioned to V.Š. that it was possible to be released on probation for money. V.Š. was questioned by the STT and stated that in December 2010 L.D. had asked him to his office and enquired whether he wanted to be released early. L.D. had indicated that he had a friend who could help V. Š. obtain release on probation and promised to organise a meeting with him. V.Š. was asked again that month by L.D. to go to the latter ’ s office, where he met the applicant (see paragraph 7 below). V.Š. asked the applicant what he should do in order to obtain release on probation. The applicant stated that V.Š. would first have to be transferred to a unit with lighter security. V.Š. asked the applicant how much it would cost him and the applicant replied that Kaišiadorys [District Court] would cost him 7,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL, approximately 2,027 euros (EUR)). After that the applicant indicated several judges that would agree to release V.Š. on probation. The applicant also stated that the cost for the same thing in the Kaunas Regional Court would be approximately LTL 10,000 (approximately EUR 2,896) but that that was not the final amount. The applicant also mentioned that V.Š. would have to pay LTL 1,000 (approximately EUR 290) for the transfer to a unit with lower security.

The applicant ’ s statement that he had been going to conclude an agreement on legal services after he had taken LTL 30,000 were refuted by his conversation with G.T., where the applicant had stated that in case of failure he would keep 20 % of the money and return the rest. The video - recordings showed that the applicant had not counted the money and that he had indicated to G.T. to put it in the side pocket of the car door.

The court relied on the practice of the Court, where it had been established that the use of clandestine measures, as such, was not contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights, as long as such measures were based on legislation that was clear and foreseeable in effect and were proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. The Constitutional Court emphasised that the criminal conduct simulation model was only allowed when used to “join” ( prisijungti ) ongoing criminal activities because such activities were happening without any effort from people taking part in undercover operational activities. The undercover agents only simulated acts as part of a criminal activity that was planned or had already commenced. It was prohibited to incite someone to commit a new offence or one that had been commenced but later terminated during the use of the criminal conduct simulation model. The criminal conduct simulation model was unlawful if the limits that had been set for it were exceeded or if someone had been incited to commit an offence. The assessment of those circumstances was a matter for the court. It was for the courts of ordinary jurisdiction dealing with allegations of incitement or other forms of abuse of the model to establish in each particular case whether the investigating authorities had gone beyond the limits of the legal framework within which the model had been authorised."

In an unrelated case, the Supreme Court established rules to be followed to determine whether the use of the criminal conduct simulation model or similar special investigative techniques had involved incitement. It held that actions like the criminal conduct simulation model could only be performed when there was objective evidence suggesting that a person was predisposed to commit an offence (rumours were not enough). Private individuals could only act as undercover agents after they had informed the authorities about a criminal act that was likely to be committed. A conclusion of incitement could be drawn even if the officers ’ act of instigation was not intense or insistent, or if the suspect had been contacted through unsuspecting third persons. It was for the authorities to prove that there had been no incitement. If there had been incitement, all the evidence obtained as a result of such an act had to be excluded from the case (decision of 16 December 2008, no. 2A-P-6/2008)."

The Court has consistently accepted the use of undercover investigative techniques in combatting crime.

Portugal, 9 June 1998, § 38, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ IV). In Vanyan v.

The relevant criteria determining the Court ’ s examination in this context are set out in the case of Bannikova v. Russia (no. 18757/06, §§ 37-65, 4 November 2010).

In deciding whether the investigation was “essentially passive” the Court will examine the reasons underlying the covert operation, in particular, whether there were objective suspicions that the applicant had been involved in criminal activity or had been predisposed to commit a criminal offence until he was approached by the police (see Furcht v. Germany, no. 54648/09, § 51, 23 October 2014 ) and the conduct of the authorities carrying it out, specifically whether the authorities exerted such an influence on the applicant as to incite the commission of an offence that would otherwise not have been committed, in order to make it possible to establish the offence, that is, to provide evidence and institute a prosecution ( see Ramanauskas, cited above, § 55; Furcht, cited above, § 48; Morari v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 65311/09, § 31, 8 March 2016; and Matanović, cited above, § 123 ).

Although the Court will generally leave it to the domestic authorities to decide what procedure must be followed by the judiciary when faced with a plea of incitement, it requires such a procedure to be adversarial, thorough, comprehensive and conclusive on the issue of entrapment (see Matanović, cited above, § 126)."

In this connection, in order to proceed with further assessment, the Court must satisfy itself that the situation under examination falls prima facie within the category of “entrapment cases”.

Even assuming that V.Š. had previously worked as a police agent, that would not change his status as a private individual in the present case or the nature of the applicant ’ s actions from the moment L.D. introduced him to V.Š.

Moreover, if the applicant thought that V.Š. was insisting on him bribing the judges, he did not take any steps to inform the authorities.

In other words, the DCS had not induced the applicant to commit a crime but had rather “joined” the activity by authorising and equipping Ms K. to conduct the secret surveillance. The DCS had never abandoned that “essentially passive” attitude throughout the investigation stage. The Government furthermore submitted that the applicant had been able to effectively raise the issue of entrapment in the domestic proceedings. Indeed, he had extensively argued before the domestic courts that his indictment had been the direct outcome of that entrapment. The Bolnisi District Court had not, according to the Government, left that plea of entrapment unconsidered. Accordingly, it had allowed the applicant ’ s request for the inclusion in the criminal case file of the newspaper article and the recording of the television broadcast containing Ms K. ’ s confession to being a police collaborator.

He had had no criminal record and had never been involved in any corrupt dealings; therefore, it was difficult to comprehend why the law-enforcement authorities had chosen him as a target. According to the official version of the events, the need for that operation had emerged merely from a written complaint lodged with the authority by Ms K. The applicant submitted that, as a matter of fact, Ms K. had not been an ordinary private individual but a paid undercover agent of the DCS who had collaborated with the latter authority in respect of a number of other unrelated criminal cases. He emphasised the fact that Ms K. had already been a police agent by the time she had first approached him. Ms N. , another protagonist in the criminal case against the applicant, had apparently been another undercover agent of the DCS, whom he had had no possibility to question in court. The applicant stated that the domestic courts had not even mentioned the fact that she had been an undercover agent, let alone giving any meaningful answer to his plea of entrapment. The applicant also suggested that Ms K. had herself become the target of pressure from the authorities – in the form of the criminal proceedings instituted against her – after she had partly testified in his favour during the trial (see paragraph 19 above)."

                "44. While the Court has consistently accepted the use of undercover agents as a legitimate investigative technique for combating serious crimes, this technique still requires that clear, adequate and sufficient procedural safeguards set permissible police conduct aside from entrapment, as the public interest cannot justify the use of evidence obtained as a result of police entrapment (see Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, 9 June 1998, § 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ IV, and Nosko and Nefedov v. Russia, nos. 5753/09 and 11789/10, § 50, 30 October 2014 ). In this respect, the Court ’ s examination of complaints of entrapment has developed on the basis of two tests: the substantive test and the procedural test of incitement (see, for instance, Bannikova v. Russia no. 18757/06, §§ 37 and 51, 4 November 2010). Under the substantive test, when examining an applicant ’ s arguable plea of entrapment, the Court will enquire, as a first step, into whether the authorities had good reasons for mounting a covert operation. In particular, they must show that they were in possession of concrete, objective and verifiable evidence showing that initial steps have been taken to commit the acts constituting the offence, and that the criminal act was already underway at the time when the police intervened (see, generally, Shannon v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 67537/01, ECHR 2004-IV; Eurofinacom v. France (dec.), no. 58753/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ VII; and Furcht v. Germany, no. 54648/09, § 51, 23 October 2014 ). This principle rules out, in particular, any conduct that may be interpreted as inciting the applicant to commit an offence that would otherwise not have been committed, such as taking the initiative in contacting the applicant, repeating an offer despite having received an initial refusal, insistent prompting, the promise of financial gain, or appealing to the applicant ’ s sense of compassion ( compare, among other cases, Ramanauskas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 74420/01, § 67, ECHR 2008; Malininas v. Lithuania, no. 10071/04, § 37, 1 July 2008; and Vanyan v. Russia, no. 53203/99, § § 11 and 49, 15 December 2005 )."

            [
                "45. Where the authorities claim that they acted upon information received from a private individual, the Court draws a distinction between an individual complaint and information coming from a police collaborator or informant (see, among many others, Shannon, cited above; Gorgievski v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, no. 18002/02, §§ 52 and 53, 16 July 2009; and Milinienė v. Lithuania, no. 74 355/01, §§ 37-38, 24 June 2008 ). A collaborator or informant would run a significant risk of extending their role to that of agents provocateurs, in possible breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, if they were to take part in a police ‑ supervised operation. It is therefore crucial in each case to establish if the criminal act was already under way at the time when the source began collaboration with the police ( compare Eurofinacom and Vanyan, both cited above, §§ 4 7-49 ). In assessing a plea of entrapment, it is also important to analyse whether the private individual who informed the authorities of the applicant ’ s allegedly unlawful conduct might have had any ulterior motives (see Milinienė, cited above, § 39 ). The Court has found that the line between legitimate infiltration by an undercover agent and the instigation of a crime is more likely to be crossed if no clear and foreseeable procedure was set up under the domestic law for authorising and implementing undercover operations – all the more so if they were also not properly supervised. It has considered judicial supervision as the most appropriate means in cases involving covert operations (see Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, § 135, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII (extracts); Furcht, cited above, § 53; and Bannikova, also cited above, §§ 49 and 50). A lack of procedural safeguards in the ordering of an undercover operation generates a risk of arbitrariness and police entrapment (see Nosko and Nefedov, cited above, § 64 )."

                "46. In cases where the lack of file disclosure or the controversy of the parties ’ interpretation of events precludes the Court from establishing with a sufficient degree of certainty whether the applicant was subjected to police incitement, the procedural aspect becomes decisive. In examining the procedure followed by the domestic courts the Court has had regard to the potential outcome of a successful plea of incitement (see Bannikova, cited above, §§ 5 2 and 53, with further references). As the starting point, the Court will therefore verify whether an arguable complaint of incitement constitutes a substantive defence under domestic law, or gives grounds for the exclusion of evidence, or leads to similar consequences (see Khudobin, cited above, §§ 133-135). Although the Court will generally leave it to the domestic authorities to decide what procedure must be followed by the judiciary when faced with a plea of incitement, it requires such a procedure to be adversarial, thorough, comprehensive and conclusive on the issue of entrapment, with the burden of proof on the relevant prosecution authority to demonstrate that there was no incitement. The scope of the domestic judicial review must include the reasons why the undercover operation was mounted, the extent of the law enforcement authorities ’ involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant was subjected ( see, among other authorities, Ramanauskas, cited above, § § 70 and 71, and Bannikova, cited above, § 48). The domestic courts ’ duty to ensure the overall fairness of the trial requires, inter alia, that the undercover agents and other witnesses who could testify on the issue of incitement should be heard in court and be cross-examined by the defence, or at least that detailed reasons should be given for a failure to do so (compare Lüdi v. Switzerland, 15 June 1992, § 49, Series A no. 238; Bulfinsky v. Romania, no. 28823/04, § 45, 1 June 2010; and Kuzmickaja v. Lithuania (dec.), no. 27968/03, 10 June 2008). The Court ’ s findings under the procedural test will become of decisive significance for the finding of whether or not impugned criminal proceedings have been conducted in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention ( compare, for instance, Sepil v. Turkey, no. 17711/07, § 37-40, 12 November 2013, and Constantin and Stoian v. Romania, nos. 23782/06 and 46629/06, § 64, 29 September 2009 ).",

                "47. Having regard to the limits of its international supervision, notably that it is not a court of fourth instance empowered to call into question the findings of the domestic courts as regards the commission of the offence in question, the Court notes that, in the examination of the present case, it must be guided by the relevant factual findings established at the domestic level. Thus, the Court will base its assessment on the fact – established by the domestic courts – that the applicant indeed accepted a bribe from Ms K. in exchange for a promise to assist her in the implementation of a business plan (compare, mutatis mutandis, Matanović v. Croatia, no. 2742/12, § 136 ). The only major procedural lacuna that was apparently left open at the domestic level – despite the fact of its being at the core of the question of whether or not the applicant was given a fair trial – is the latter ’ s claim that he was the victim of police entrapment and the domestic courts ’ failure to address this allegation. The Court is therefore called on to address this particular procedural defence."
            ],
            [
                "48. In this respect, the principal issue to be examined by the Court is whether the actions of the law-enforcement authority – the DCS – remained within the bounds of undercover work rather than inciting the applicant into taking a bribe. In other words, the Court must ascertain whether the DCS confined itself to “investigating criminal activity in an essentially passive manner” (see, for instance, Ramanauskas, cited above, §§ 66-67). Its ability to make a substantive finding on this point will depend, however, on whether or not the case file contains sufficient information on the undercover activities. If the substantive test is inconclusive owing to the lack of information in the file, the Court will proceed to the second step of its examination, whereby it will assess the procedure by which the plea of incitement was determined by the domestic courts in the light of the criteria set out in paragraph 46 above. Although there was no evidence that the applicant had committed any offences, in particular corruption-related ones, before the incident in question, the absence of a criminal record could not in itself, detached from the other circumstances of the case, be understood as an indication of bad faith in the law-enforcement authority ’ s decision to mount an undercover operation against him after Ms K. had reported his alleged request for a bribe. Nor can the subsequent technical and financial backing given by the DCS to the person who had purportedly received the request for a bribe – so that the latter could record the commission of the offence – be equated with the transgression by the police of the bounds of its undercover investigative work (compare, for instance, Matanović, cited above, § 138, and Milinienė, cited above, § § 37 and 38)."
            ],
            [
                "49. What starts to taint the legality of the police operation mounted against the applicant is the fact that Ms K. was hardly an ordinary private individual. The criminal file against the applicant contained material which confirmed the fact that that person had been the DCS ’ s usual collaborator in a number of unrelated criminal investigations. Ms K. conceded herself during the applicant ’ s trial that when she had approached the applicant for the first time on 1 December 2005, she had already been acting under the DCS ’ s instructions. On the other hand, however, the Court observes that, according to the official version of the events, it was not Ms K. who had proposed a bribe to the applicant. On the contrary, it was the latter who had been the first one to request a pay-off from her in the amount of USD 30,000. Although, the applicant claimed before the domestic courts that he had had no intention to retain any part of the received money for his personal benefit, this allegation is no valid excuse for his taking the initiative and raising financial aspects in the conversation with Ms K. (see paragraphs 7, 17, 18, 24 and 25 above ). In such circumstances, the Court cannot determine with sufficient certainty, only on the basis of the materials available in the case file, that Ms K. took an active and decisive role in the creation of the stratagem that instigated the commission of the bribe offence in question. Thus, the Court ’ s substantive test is inconclusive."
            ],
            [
                "50. Consequently, the Court has to proceed to the procedural test and to examine whether the applicant was able to raise the issue of police entrapment effectively in the domestic proceedings (see the general principles cited in paragraph 46 as well as paragraph 48 above ). In this regard, the Court is satisfied that the applicant basing his defence before the trial court on the grounds of alleged police entrapment was a valid course of action, as it could have resulted in the exclusion of the evidence obtained as a result of such an investigative technique (compare Matanović, cited above, § 140, and Bannikova, cited above, § 56 ). In particular, under sections 3, 6 and 7 of the Act on Special Investigative Activity it was outlawed for an investigative technique involving the infiltration of an undercover agent to be implemented with methods based on “deceit” and “inducement”, and a person concerned by these illicit methods of investigation was entitled to complain before a court. Furthermore, Article 111 § 1 (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure directly mandated a criminal court to exclude from the relevant case file evidence obtained as a result of any “illegal activity” or “unlawful method” (see paragraphs 36-38 above). Consequently, and given that the applicant had an arguable claim of entrapment, the Prosecutor ’ s Office should have assumed the burden of proving that there had been no incitement contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Bannikova, cited above, § 48)."
            ],
            [
                "51. However, having regard to the relevant criminal materials, the Court observes that the Prosecutor ’ s Office did not make any argument throughout the proceedings in an attempt to refute the applicant ’ s allegations of entrapment. This total silence on the part the Prosecutor ’ s Office could be explained by the objective impossibility of discharging the requisite burden of proof on account of the absence of any formal authorisation and supervision of the undercover operation in question ( see Vanyan, cited above, §§ 46 and 47, and Khudobin, cited above, § 135). Thus, the Court observes that the DCS sending Ms K., the infiltrated agent, to the applicant on an undercover mission was never ordered or supervised either by a court, which is considered by the Court ’ s case-law as the most appropriate form of supervision in such matters, or any other independent public authority competent in criminal matters (contrast Lüdi, cited above; also compare, among many other authorities, Teixeira de Castro, cited above, § 38, and Milinienė, cited above, § 39). Indeed, under section 7 §§ 3 ‑ 7 of the Act on Special Investigative Activity, it was not required that infiltration by an undercover agent – unlike certain other investigative techniques – be ordered and supervised by a court (see paragraph 39 above). In other words, the domestic law did not provide for the adequate regulation of the conduct of such a covert operation (compare, for instance, Veselov and Others v. Russia, nos. 23200/10 and 2 others, § 111, 2 October 2012 )."

            [
                "52. Lastly, even if the Prosecutor ’ s Office had failed to discharge the requisite burden of proof, that omission could not have excused the domestic courts from the need to address effectively the applicant ’ s plea of entrapment. The effectiveness of the judicial review should be assessed by having due regard to the reasons contained in the domestic courts ’ decisions. The courts were expected to establish, after having conducted adversarial proceedings, the reasons why the undercover operation had been mounted against the applicant, the extent of the DCS ’ s involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant had been subjected (see, for instance, Ramanauskas, cited above, § 71). However, the Court observes that the domestic courts, confronted with the applicant ’ s well ‑ substantiated allegations, did not provide any single reason in their decisions as to why those allegations ought to be dismissed (see paragraphs 27 and 33 above). The Court further notes the domestic courts ’ failure to secure the attendance and examination of another key witness, Ms N., who, according to the applicant and Ms K., was probably another undercover agent engaged by the DCS to entrap the applicant (see paragraphs 25-26 and 29-32). In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the judicial review of the allegations of entrapment was either conducted with sufficient respect for the principle of adversarial proceedings or that it established adequate reasons for dismissing the applicant ’ s defence."

In this way it risks having an impact on the impartiality of the court under Article 6 § 1 as well as the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 § 2 (see Ninn-Hansen v.

If there is a virulent press campaign surrounding a trial, what is decisive is not the subjective apprehensions of the suspect but whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, his fears can be held to be objectively justified (see Daktaras v. Lithuania (dec.), no. 42095/98, 11 January 2000; Włoch v. Poland (dec.), no. 27785/95, 30 March 2000; Priebke v. Italy (dec.), no. 48799/99, 5 April 2001; and Beggs, cited above, § 123)."

Even in cases involving jury trials, an appropriate lapse of time between the appearance of any prejudicial commentary in the media and the subsequent criminal proceedings, together with any suitable directions to the jury, will generally suffice to remove any concerns regarding the appearance of bias (see Beggs, cited above, § 124-128; and, as regards in particular the importance of jury directions, Pullicino v. Malta (dec.), no. 45441/99, 15 June 2000; and Mustafa (Abu Hamza), cited above, § § 39 -40 ). In particular, where the impugned newspaper reports appeared at a time when the future members of the jury did not know that they would be involved in the trial process, the likelihood of any appearance of bias is all the more remote, since it is highly unlikely that the jury members would have paid any particular attention to the detail of the reports at the time of their publication (see Beggs, cited above, § 126). In such cases, a direction to the jury to disregard extraneous material will usually be adequate to ensure the fairness of the trial, even if there has been a highly prejudicial press campaign (for an example where such a direction was sufficient, see Beggs, cited above, § 128). It is essential to underline in this respect that it is reasonable to assume that a jury will follow the directions given by the judge in the absence of any evidence suggesting the contrary ( Beggs, cited above, § 128; and Szypusz v. the United Kingdom, no. 8400/07, § 85, 21 September 2010)."

Russia (dec.), no. 30024/02, 8 July 2008; and Beggs, cited above, § 127 ). However, it is important to emphasise that the fact that the authorities were the source of the prejudicial information is relevant to the question of the impartiality of the tribunal only in so far as the material might be viewed by readers as more authoritative in light of its source. The question whether public officials have prejudged a defendant ’ s guilt in a manner incompatible with the presumption of innocence is a separate issue to be considered under Article 6 § 2, with the focal point being the conduct of those public officials and not the impartiality of the tribunal itself (see, for example, Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, §§ 39-41, Series A no. 308). Thus, while the authoritative nature of the published material may require, for example, a greater lapse of time or most robust jury directions, it is unlikely in itself to lead to the conclusion that a fair trial by an impartial tribunal is no longer possible. In particular, allegations that any disclosure of prejudicial material by the authorities was deliberate and was intended to undermine the fairness of the trial are irrelevant to the assessment of the impact of the disclosure on the impartiality of the trial court."

As noted above, the trial judge, when invited to consider the effect that an adverse media campaign might have on a “tribunal”, has at his disposal various possibilities to neutralise any possible risk of prejudice to the defence and ensure an impartial tribunal. In cases involving trial by jury, what is an appropriate lapse of time and what are suitable directions will vary depending on the specific facts of the case. It is for the national courts to address these matters – which, as the Law Commission observed in its 2012 consultation paper (see paragraph 67 above), are essentially value judgments – having regard to the extent and content of the published material and the nature of the commentary, subject to review by this Court of the relevance and sufficiency of the steps taken and the reasons given."

In any event, in his experience, the impact of pre-trial publicity and prejudicial media coverage was minimal even in high-profile cases.

Please do not do that. There was an element of inaccurate and unsatisfactory reporting at the time this matter first came to light. The allegations were not accurately reported in every instance and it is critically important that you decide the case upon the evidence that you hear in court and nowhere else. We tell jurors in all criminal cases not to carry out any research of their own. In a typical pub fight case we tell jurors not to go and have a look at the pub, not to turn themselves into sleuths because what is critical is you decide the case only upon what you hear in court. The defendants are entitled to know the basis and the exact basis upon which they are being tried. So, accordingly, please do not, either before the case starts tomorrow or indeed at any stage, carry out any internet research or indeed any research of any kind. I will also give you further instructions not to read any newspapers or listen to any television reports. The reason for that is sometimes they are inaccurate, sometimes they are speculative and they are always partial reporting. The only way you can hear and receive all the evidence is by being here in court, listening to it. That is where you receive the information.",

It will be quite wrong for anybody to tell you what they think about the case and it might affect your judgment in the long run. You have been selected to try a terrorist case, tell them, because that is what the allegation is here, one of terrorism, and leave it at that. There is no purpose at all in discussing the facts of the case with anybody and, indeed, it would be absolutely wrong and a contempt of court if you were to do so. I have explained the real reason for not doing so is the person you were discussing it with might be playing a part in deciding the case and you and only the 12 of you must do that, nobody else must play any part in doing so.

Its overriding objective was to provide an open and accountable prosecution process by ensuring the media had access to all relevant material wherever possible and at the earliest appropriate opportunity. The Protocol explained that the aim of the CPS was to ensure that the principle of open justice was maintained while at the same time balancing the rights of defendants to a fair trial with any likely consequences for victims or their families and witnesses occasioned by the release of prosecution material to the media."

Finally, it explains that where a guilty plea is accepted and the case does not proceed to trial, the same principles apply. But to ensure that only material informing the decision of the court is published, material released to the media must reflect the prosecution case and must have been read out, or shown in open court, or placed before the sentencing judge.",

The principal safeguards of the objective impartiality of the tribunal lie in the trial process itself and the conduct of the trial by the trial judge.

The abuse of process test needs to account for the cumulative effect of publicity, given that the issue is whether a fair trial is possible in all the circumstances and the effect that media coverage has had on the independence and impartiality of the tribunal. In contrast, the contempt test is necessarily focused on individual publications, because to hold media organisations in contempt for contributing to a climate of ‘ trial by media ’, where their individual publications would not give rise to a substantial risk of serious prejudice, could contravene article 10. In consequence, we consider that it would be a mistake to align the tests for whether there has been an abuse of process because of prejudicial media coverage and whether there has been a breach of section 2(2).

They know that it is integral to their responsibility. It is, when all is said and done, their birthright; it is shared by each one of them with the defendant. They guard it faithfully. The integrity of the jury is an essential feature of our trial process. Juries follow the directions which the judge will give them to focus exclusively on the evidence and to ignore anything they may have heard or read out of court. No doubt in this case [the judge] will give appropriate directions, tailor-made to the individual facts in the light of any trial post the sentencing hearing, after hearing submissions from counsel for the defendants.

He emphasised in particular that the 2010 report had found that jurors serving on high-profile cases were almost seven times more likely to recall media coverage than jurors serving on standard case and that in high-profile cases, twenty per cent of jurors who recalled media reports said that they had found it difficult to put the reporting out of their minds while serving as jurors. The 2012 Law Commission paper supported his argument that the risk of each publication should have been addressed separately, by reference, inter alia, to the area of circulation of the publication in question, the number of copies circulated, the prominence of the article in the publication, directions to the jury and the delay between publication and trial. The applicant contended that the difficult challenges produced by the multiple publications of different kinds had received no individualised assessment by the trial judge, who had simply concluded, after summarising the content of some of the offending material, that his experience informed him that he could ensure impartiality by directing the jury appropriately."

The publications were rendered more authoritative because they were reported as emanating from politicians, the Executive, the CPS and senior retired police officers involved in the investigation of the case. The material suggested that the applicant was far more deserving of conviction for reasons that the jury had not been permitted to know. The publications attacked not only the outcome of the first trial but also the judge and the jury for failing to produce a guilty verdict.

First, there was a risk that adverse publicity, particularly when unremitting and sensational, might prejudice a jury but the domestic case-law showed that English courts were well aware of that risk. Second, in the majority of cases the nature of the trial process and the role of the trial judge in directing the jury would ensure that the proceedings were fair. Third, in deciding whether a case was so exceptional that a fair trial was no longer possible, domestic courts were better placed to make the assessment than the Court.

Moreover, as the trial judge noted, there was a period of five months between the publicity and the start of the trial, and about a year between the publicity and the verdicts. This was relevant because, as had been recognised by the courts, the staying power of media reports was limited."

                "87. A virulent press campaign can adversely affect the fairness of a trial by influencing public opinion and, consequently, jurors called upon to decide the guilt of an accused. In this way it risks having an impact on the impartiality of the court under Article 6 § 1 as well as the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 § 2 (see Ninn-Hansen v. Denmark (dec.), no. 28972/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; and Beggs v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 15499/10, § 123, 16 October 2012). If there is a virulent press campaign surrounding a trial, what is decisive is not the subjective apprehensions of the suspect but whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, his fears can be held to be objectively justified (see Daktaras v. Lithuania (dec.), no. 42095/98, 11 January 2000; Włoch v. Poland (dec.), no. 27785/95, 30 March 2000; Priebke v. Italy (dec.), no. 48799/99, 5 April 2001; and Beggs, cited above, § 123)."

                "88. The Court has previously identified various matters that it considers relevant to the assessment of the impact of adverse publicity on the fairness of the trial or on respect for the presumption of innocence. Thus, it has made clear that there is unlikely to be any arguable complaint under Article 6 where the criminal charges are determined by professional judges, since their professional training and experience allow them to disregard any external influence (see, for example, Priebke, cited above; and G.C.P. v. Romania, no. 20899/03, § 48, 20 December 2011)."

                "89. Even in cases involving jury trials, an appropriate lapse of time between the appearance of any prejudicial commentary in the media and the subsequent criminal proceedings, together with any suitable directions to the jury, will generally suffice to remove any concerns regarding the appearance of bias (see Beggs, cited above, § 124-128; and, as regards in particular the importance of jury directions, Pullicino v. Malta (dec.), no. 45441/99, 15 June 2000; and Mustafa (Abu Hamza), cited above, § § 39 -40 ). In particular, where the impugned newspaper reports appeared at a time when the future members of the jury did not know that they would be involved in the trial process, the likelihood of any appearance of bias is all the more remote, since it is highly unlikely that the jury members would have paid any particular attention to the detail of the reports at the time of their publication (see Beggs, cited above, § 126). In such cases, a direction to the jury to disregard extraneous material will usually be adequate to ensure the fairness of the trial, even if there has been a highly prejudicial press campaign (for an example where such a direction was sufficient, see Beggs, cited above, § 128). It is essential to underline in this respect that it is reasonable to assume that a jury will follow the directions given by the judge in the absence of any evidence suggesting the contrary ( Beggs, cited above, § 128; and Szypusz v. the United Kingdom, no. 8400/07, § 85, 21 September 2010)."

                "90. In some cases concerning adverse press publicity, the Court has looked at whether the impugned publications were attributable to, or informed by, the authorities (see, for example, Sutyagin v. Russia (dec.), no. 30024/02, 8 July 2008; and Beggs, cited above, § 127 ). However, it is important to emphasise that the fact that the authorities were the source of the prejudicial information is relevant to the question of the impartiality of the tribunal only in so far as the material might be viewed by readers as more authoritative in light of its source. The question whether public officials have prejudged a defendant ’ s guilt in a manner incompatible with the presumption of innocence is a separate issue to be considered under Article 6 § 2, with the focal point being the conduct of those public officials and not the impartiality of the tribunal itself (see, for example, Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, §§ 39-41, Series A no. 308). Thus, while the authoritative nature of the published material may require, for example, a greater lapse of time or most robust jury directions, it is unlikely in itself to lead to the conclusion that a fair trial by an impartial tribunal is no longer possible. In particular, allegations that any disclosure of prejudicial material by the authorities was deliberate and was intended to undermine the fairness of the trial are irrelevant to the assessment of the impact of the disclosure on the impartiality of the trial court."

            [
                "91. It can be concluded from the foregoing that it will be rare that prejudicial pre-trial publicity will make a fair trial at some future date impossible. Indeed, the applicant has not pointed to a single case where this Court has found a violation of Article 6 on account of adverse publicity affecting the fairness of the trial itself. As noted above, the trial judge, when invited to consider the effect that an adverse media campaign might have on a “tribunal”, has at his disposal various possibilities to neutralise any possible risk of prejudice to the defence and ensure an impartial tribunal. In cases involving trial by jury, what is an appropriate lapse of time and what are suitable directions will vary depending on the specific facts of the case. It is for the national courts to address these matters – which, as the Law Commission observed in its 2012 consultation paper (see paragraph 67 above), are essentially value judgments – having regard to the extent and content of the published material and the nature of the commentary, subject to review by this Court of the relevance and sufficiency of the steps taken and the reasons given."

                "90. At the outset and in reply to the first applicant ’ s empirical arguments about the viability of the early Georgian model of plea bargaining, the Court reiterates that it cannot be its task to review whether the relevant domestic legal framework was, per se, incompatible with the Convention standards. Rather, this matter must be assessed by taking into consideration the specific circumstances of the first applicant ’ s criminal case. The Court further notes that it can be considered a common feature of European criminal - justice systems for an accused to obtain the lessening of charges or receive a reduction of his or her sentence in exchange for a guilty or nolo contendere plea in advance of trial or for providing substantial cooperation with the investigative authority (see the comparative legal study, paragraphs 62-75 above; see also, in this connection, Slavcho Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 28674/03, § 17, 27 November 2008, and Ruciński v. Poland, no. 33198/04, § 12, 20 February 2007). There cannot be anything improper in the process of charge or sentence bargaining in itself (see, mutatis mutandis, Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 and 36742/08, 6 July 2010). In this connection the Court subscribes to the idea that plea bargaining, apart from offering the important benefits of speedy adjudication of criminal cases and alleviating the workload of courts, prosecutors and lawyers, can also, if applied correctly, be a successful tool in combating corruption and organised crime and can contribute to the reduction of the number of sentences imposed and, as a result, the number of prisoners."
            ],
            [
                "91. The Court considers that where the effect of plea bargaining is that a criminal charge against the accused is determined through an abridged form of judicial examination, this amounts, in substance, to the waiver of a number of procedural rights. This cannot be a problem in itself, since neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 prevents a person from waiving these safeguards of his or her own free will (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 135, 17 September 2009 ). The Court observes in this connection that as early as 1987 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe called upon the member States to take measures aimed at the simplification of ordinary judicial procedures by resorting, for instance, to abridged, summary trials (see paragraph 54 above). However, it is also a cornerstone principle that any waiver of procedural rights must always, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance. In addition, it must not run counter to any important public interest (see, amongst other authorities, Scoppola, cited above, § 135 ‑ 36; Poitrimol v. France, 23 November 1993, § 31, Series A no. 277 ‑ A; and Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 73, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII)."

The Court thus observes that by striking a bargain with the prosecuting authority over the sentence and pleading no contest as regards the charges, the first applicant waived his right to have the criminal case against him examined on the merits. However, by analogy with the above ‑ mentioned principles concerning the validity of such waivers, the Court considers that the first applicant ’ s decision to accept the plea bargain should have been accompanied by the following conditions: (a) the bargain had to be accepted by the first applicant in full awareness of the facts of the case and the legal consequences and in a genuinely voluntary manner; and (b) the content of the bargain and the fairness of the manner in which it had been reached between the parties had to be subjected to sufficient judicial review."

While it is clear that the authorities must take into account the public demands for immediate and decisive action in the most notorious cases of alleged corruption, the co-rapporteurs insist that popular expectations cannot justify violations of the rights of suspects and the failure to respect the basic principles of due criminal procedure. Arrests of some former officials accused of corruption were carried out in spectacular circumstances, often without warrants even in cases where there was no indication that suspects had the intention to flee. Human rights organisations reported several cases of excessive force, some arrests were filmed and images – degrading to the suspects ’ human dignity – were widely broadcasted on several television channels. The respect for the principle of the presumption of innocence for some categories of suspects has yet to take hold in the new Georgia.",
                "48. The ‘ plea bargaining ’ system, which makes it possible for some suspects to have their charges reduced or dropped in return for the payment of the money they have allegedly embezzled, is, to say the least, controversial. While plea bargaining is broadly used in the United States as well as in some Council of Europe member States, it usually relates to agreements by which accused persons agree to plea guilty (denounce other culprits, etc.) in return for a lesser charge. The Georgian plea bargaining goes a step further and introduces a financial component into the quotation – the accused are asked to repay a certain sum, which is an approximation of what they have allegedly stolen. In return the prosecutor agrees to reduce or drop the charges. The deal must finally be approved by a judge.",

The co-rapporteurs consider that the specificities of the Georgian version of the plea-bargaining system, especially the introduction of the financial component and the seemingly arbitrary way in which it is applied to some cases and not to others, make this practice incompatible with Council of Europe standards. The system may not only create an impression that big thieves are allowed to buy an immunity from justice, but is also worrisome because the lack of legal and administrative checks and balances in the Georgian police, prosecutor services and courts create a risk of abuse. The co ‑ rapporteurs understand that the money obtained through ‘ plea bargaining ’ (some 30 million [United States dollars] so far) is very important and has helped to pay for pensions and other immediate needs, but they disagree with the notion suggested by the Prosecutor General that the efficiency of justice can be measured against the budgetary income it helps to generate. After years of a widespread corruption and systematic disregard for the rule of law Georgia needs justice which is efficient and equal for all.",

The Chairman of the Supreme Court informed the Commissioner that in 2010 plea agreements were applied in around 80% of all criminal cases.",

It also offers the important benefit of speedy adjudication of criminal cases, alleviating the workload of courts, prosecutors and lawyers. Further, it contributes to the reduction of sentences and as a result to the number of prisoners, which is crucial in the context of the high rate of prison overcrowding in Georgia.",

                "67. A defence lawyer is mandatory in the context of plea-bargaining; however, the role of the lawyers in this process is limited. According to the information obtained by the Commissioner, most defendants are virtually certain that they will be sentenced, and lawyers, instead of working towards their clients ’ acquittal, advise them to plea-bargain with the prosecutor to reduce the sentence to a minimum. This attitude is particularly common for violations that foresee imprisonment as a punishment. However, the Deputy Minister of Justice pointed out that the new Code of Criminal Procedure provisions which provide enhanced rights for the defence will also positively affect the defence ’ s position in the context of the plea agreement.",
                "68. One concern of the Commissioner relates to the discretionary powers of the prosecutor during the negotiation of the plea agreement. For instance, the prosecutor can now ask for sentences even below the minimum sentence provided in the law, a competence many believe should rest with the judge. In addition, the law does not define the required degree of cooperation of a defendant with the prosecution, which leads to subjectivity and inconsistency of practice.",
                "69. A plea agreement is approved by court decision. In the course of the review of the agreement by the court, the judge should make sure that the plea agreement is not concluded upon coercion and intimidation and should examine the evidence supporting the charges. The authorities assert that judicial oversight of the plea agreements is an important safeguard, stressing that the court can refuse to approve an agreement if charges are unsubstantiated or a violation is observed. However, lawyers maintain that in practice, the judge relies essentially on the evidence that the prosecutor presents when examining the terms of the agreement, and in the overwhelming majority of cases the judge agrees with the demands of the prosecutor.",
                "70. One of the peculiarities of the Georgian plea-bargaining system relates to Article 42 of the Criminal Code, which provides that fines can be imposed in the context of plea agreements even for violations of the Criminal Code for which this form of punishment is not foreseen. According to Transparency International Georgia, in practice fines are paid in 99% of the cases, a figure which is disputed by the authorities. The process lacks transparency, due to the absence of clear criteria for determining fines. Human rights defenders in Tbilisi alleged that this is done based on an assessment of the defendant ’ s ability to pay; this has led to a perception that freedom can be bought.",
                "71. Although the implementation of plea-bargaining in practice has given rise to concerns, the authorities maintain that sufficient safeguards exist in the system. The Deputy Minister of Justice did, however, acknowledge the need to increase transparency of the system and improve perceptions.",
                "72. The law also provides for a full release from sentence in exceptional cases where there is effective cooperation with the investigation. While this possibility may certainly help in resolving criminal cases, instances of abuse have been reported in this context. ...",
                "73. Concerns have also been raised that the system of plea-bargaining might make defendants more reluctant to complain against ill-treatment or excessive use of force by police, if this has been the case. The authorities have in the past acknowledged the problem and have introduced safeguards. However, the problem may lie not with the existence of system of plea-bargaining per se but rather, as already noted, the context in which it is being operated. In view of an almost certain conviction, for many defendants plea-bargaining is the only alternative to get a lighter sentence, and a defendant is less likely to bring a justified complaint of ill-treatment if there is a perceived risk that this could undermine the chance to conclude an agreement with the prosecutor.",
                "Conclusions and recommendations",
                "74. The functioning of the plea-bargaining system cannot and should not be seen as separate from the operation of the entire criminal justice system. The combination of several factors – very high conviction rates, a stringent sentencing policy and the low public trust in the administration in the justice system – may very well influence defendants to plead guilty even if innocent, leading to a distortion of justice.",
                "75. It is important to bear in mind that when consenting to a guilty plea, a defendant waives a number of rights, including the right to give testimony and the right to trial. The Commissioner notes that while safeguards may be provided in the legislation, their implementation in practice has been subject to criticism. Judges should exercise adequate control over plea-bargaining agreements and see to it that these safeguards are fully implemented in practice. The Commissioner is also concerned with the very limited role that the defence plays in the negotiation of a plea agreement.",
                "76. It is essential that the defendant ’ s plea must always be made voluntarily and free from any improper pressure. To this end, the system further needs the development of objective standards for the negotiations between the defence and the prosecutor, including a clearer definition of the concept ‘ cooperation with the investigation ’, as well as clear criteria for determining the amount of fines imposed upon the defendant.",
                "77. Finally, there is an urgent need for concrete steps to increase the transparency of the system. The Commissioner supports the efforts of the authorities in this regard and encourages them to adopt an inclusive approach by consulting with all relevant groups, including human right defenders and lawyers.” (Footnotes omitted.)"

                "“... The statistics show that plea bargains, once agreed upon between defendant and prosecutor, are almost always upheld.",
                "In theory, the presiding judge is meant to ensure that the plea bargain was not attained as a result of undue pressure on the defendant and that the deal was made voluntarily. The judge must also ensure that the defendant ’ s core rights (such as that of assistance by a defence attorney) were not violated. In practice, only eight plea bargains were denied by Georgian judges in 2008 out of a total that year of 8,770, a rate of less than 0.1%. Judges are also meant to ascertain that there is a prima facie case. In other words, the judge must be satisfied that the evidence provided by the prosecutor would be considered sufficient to warrant a full trial. The difference being that, in a plea bargain, the evidence is not questioned by the defendant.",
                "The lawyers interviewed by TI Georgia all doubted that judges reviewed the prima facie case ‘ in anything but the most procedural manner ’. One example of judges allegedly failing to look into the case properly is that of Natsvlishvili and Togonidze vs. Georgia, where the defendant said that the prosecutor only agreed to enter into a plea bargain after he transferred shares in a car manufacturing plant to the government and paid GEL 50,000 ‘ of his own free will ’. The court then upheld a plea bargain, based on an official fine of GEL 35,000, which did not include the ‘ presents ’ paid beforehand, without even looking into the suspicious payments. ...",
                "If you ’ re charged for a crime in Georgia, you can be pretty sure that you ’ ll be found guilty. Conviction rates are sky high. Of the 17,639 criminal cases filed at Georgian courts during 2008, only seven ended in an acquittal and 111 more were terminated before a verdict was reached. That makes for a 99% conviction rate, which opponents of plea bargaining say is a direct result of the loss of judicial independence caused by the practice. Prosecutors say that the high conviction rate is the result of ‘ hard work ’ and ‘ careful prosecution ’ and is evidence of the system working well.",
                "Deputy chief justice of the Supreme Court, Zaza Meishvili, argues that the conviction rate is nothing out of the ordinary when compared to the USA, where 90 ‑ 95% of criminal cases end in a plea bargain and therefore a guilty verdict.",
                "The difference however, is that a very high proportion of non-plea-bargaining cases in Georgia also end in conviction. Most countries have conviction rates far lower than Georgia ’ s. For example, amongst OECD countries, only Japan ’ s 99.7% conviction rate exceeds Georgia ’ s. ...",
                "While the proportion of acquittals has dropped since plea bargaining started in 2004, the numbers were so low before that it hasn ’ t made much difference. We have come from a 97% conviction rate in 2003 to a 99% conviction rate in 2009. In fact, in 2005, the year plea bargaining graduated from being an anti-corruption measure to being widespread practice in ordinary criminal cases, the number of acquittals and terminated cases almost doubled and the conviction rate came down to 94%; the lowest on record.",
                "The explanation for high conviction rates has less to do with plea bargaining and more to do with Georgia ’ s Soviet legal legacy, a system in which confession was king. As one academic put it: ‘ the most powerful person in the Soviet model of criminal justice was, and largely remains, the prosecutor. He or she was responsible for directing the entire criminal proceeding, and thought little of using coerced confessions, falsified evidence or pre-trial detention as a method of inducing a confession ’.",
                "Deputy Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Zaza Meishvili reaffirmed the high incidence of confessions to TI Georgia, saying the ‘ vast majority ’ of plea bargains involved a defendant ’ s confession.",
                "But while we cannot blame plea bargaining for overtly high conviction rates, the overwhelming statistical likelihood of conviction has another very negative effect. The essence of plea bargaining dictates that it should be just that, a bargaining process with the defendant trying to extract the lightest possible sentence from the prosecutor. This is possible only when the defendant has sufficient leverage to make such a deal worth the prosecutor ’ s while. In other words, the prosecutor knows that if he doesn ’ t agree to the defendant ’ s terms, he will have to go through a lengthy legal process, perhaps through three levels of courts. When you have conviction rates approaching 100%, this leverage is much weakened, allowing prosecutors to dictate the terms and leaving defendants with ‘ take it or leave it ’ offers.",
                "In systems with high conviction rates, plea bargaining doesn ’ t work. When even innocent defendants feel pressure to ‘ admit guilt ’ because the statistical likelihood of an acquittal is so low, the power is left in the hands of the prosecutors. Thus, unless Georgia ’ s conviction rate comes down to something more realistic, plea bargaining as an institution cannot work effectively.”"

The Government submitted that plea bargaining, a form of consensual and abbreviated criminal justice, had been successfully incorporated into the legislation and practice of various European States and worldwide in harmony with the fundamental fair - trial guarantees. The emergence and spread of plea bargaining had been driven by the increased interests of procedural economy. The Government highlighted that as early as 1987 the member States of the Council of Europe had been advised by the Committee of Ministers to develop means of simplifying and expediting trial procedures, which included summary judgments, out-of-court negotiations and guilty pleas (see paragraph 54 above). They further emphasised that the plea-bargaining process represented one of the most practical and successful tools against corruption and organised crime. The introduction of plea bargaining in Georgia in 2004 could not possibly be fully understood without appreciating the context of endemic criminality and corruption pervading in the country at that time. The use of plea bargaining had been intended as an urgent response to those systemic problems."

Nevertheless, the most substantive guarantees of a fair trial had still been retained under the domestic law, and they had been duly put into practice in the first applicant ’ s criminal case. Thus, first of all, the first applicant had been represented by qualified legal counsel, had given his prior approval before negotiations with the public prosecutor were started, and had provided the requisite written acceptance, countersigned by his lawyer, of the terms of the agreement reached. Subsequently, the trial court had examined the plea bargain at an oral and public hearing, during which it had enquired as to whether the plea bargain had been reached without duress and under otherwise fair conditions and whether the first applicant was willing to accept it in full awareness of the nature of the charges and the potential sentence. As further guarantees, the Government referred to the fact that not only had the first applicant been entitled to reject the agreed plea bargain during the court ’ s review, but also the judge, who had been required to assess the validity of the accusations, had been empowered to block the plea bargain in the event of any doubt as to the first applicant ’ s criminal liability."

Firstly, the first applicant had been represented by a qualified lawyer of his choosing as early as 16 March 2004, the very next day after his arrest (see paragraph 15 above). On 25 March 2004 he had sent a letter to the public prosecutor, expressing his intention to cooperate with the authorities and reach a settlement (see paragraph 18 above). On 1 August 2004 the first applicant was given access to the criminal case materials, and on 6 August 2004 he appointed a second qualified lawyer of his choosing (see paragraph 21 above). By 6 September 2004 the investigation had been terminated, the evidence against the first applicant had been added to the case file and an indictment accusing the first applicant of large-scale misappropriation of public funds had been issued by the public prosecutor. Having duly acquainted himself with the indictment and the evidence collected, the first applicant, represented by his two lawyers, had again confirmed his readiness to cooperate with the authorities and had transferred on the same day, 6 September 2004, his shares in the factory to the State in compensation for the damage caused by his conduct (see paragraphs 22 - 23 above)."

Otherwise, the City Court would have rejected the bargain, as it had the power to do by virtue of the applicable domestic law.

Whilst the acceptance of the bargain had entailed a waiver of certain procedural rights, that waiver had not been accompanied by effective safeguards against the abuse of due process by the prosecuting authority. To demonstrate the deficiencies of the Georgian model of plea bargaining in general, the first applicant gave his own comparative overview of how similar plea ‑ bargaining mechanisms functioned in a number of other European countries (notably in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and Russia). On the basis of that comparison, he claimed that, unlike the legal systems of the aforementioned countries, the Georgian model of plea bargaining had not allowed him to be represented by an advocate from the beginning of the investigation and had not allowed a judge to undertake a sufficient review of the fairness of the circumstances in which the plea bargain had been reached."

He also referred to the results of an empirical study, according to which even in those criminal - justice systems in which the acquittal rate amounted to 15-20%, accused persons who considered themselves innocent often chose to plead guilty. In other words, it could not be said that his decision to accept a plea bargain had been truly voluntary. Consequently, the only real opportunity for him to avoid a lengthy term of imprisonment had been entering into a plea bargain. The first applicant emphasised in that connection that, at the time of accepting the plea bargain, he had been detained in particularly intolerable and highly stressful conditions, sharing a cell with a murderer and a person who had abducted and ill-treated him in December 2002.

He also criticised the fact that only the prosecutor and not the defendant was entitled, under the domestic law, to apply to the court with a plea - bargain request at the material time and that it was the prosecutor and not the judge who had been empowered to choose what kind of punishment was to be imposed pursuant to the plea bargain.

He also complained that the domestic court ’ s powers in the plea-bargaining process had not represented a sufficient system of checks and balances on potential abuses of power by the prosecutor. The domestic court had only been able to review the plea agreement itself, and had been unable to enquire as to how the relevant negotiations had been conducted and whether any abuses had been committed during those negotiations, as there had been no written or audio record of them. Thus, even if the Kutaisi City Court had formally asked the first applicant during the hearing of 10 September 2004 whether he had been subjected to any form of pressure during the preceding negotiations, that enquiry could not have been an effective check, as it was clear that the first applicant, who had been detained at that time under the control of the executive branch of the State, would not have dared to confide in the court about such duress. Furthermore, the domestic court had not attempted to ensure that the applicant, an accused person, had fully understood the facts which had given rise to the charges against him."

                "89. The first applicant complained that the Kutaisi City Court had endorsed the plea bargain in a single day, whereas it had been objectively impossible to study the case materials in such a short period. His guilt and punishment had, in reality, been established by the prosecutor, and the domestic court had formally endorsed the prosecutor ’ s findings without carrying out its own judicial inquiry. Furthermore, observing that the transfer of the shares and the payments had taken place on 6, 8 and 9 September 2004, that is, prior to the approval of the plea bargain by the Kutaisi City Court on 10 September 2004, he submitted that if he had refused to accept the proposed plea bargain before the Kutaisi City Court on 10 September 2004, that would only have led to the continued deprivation of his liberty, in addition to the loss of all the previously forfeited assets, without receiving anything in exchange. In that connection the first applicant emphasised that he had never pleaded guilty to the offences he had been accused of. Lastly, the first applicant maintained his complaint regarding his inability to lodge an appeal against the City Court ’ s decision of 10 September 2004 convicting him on the basis of the plea bargain, claiming that the relevant criminal procedural legislation had not provided him with any legal avenue through which to contest the coercion applied to him during the plea-bargaining negotiations."

                "90. At the outset and in reply to the first applicant ’ s empirical arguments about the viability of the early Georgian model of plea bargaining, the Court reiterates that it cannot be its task to review whether the relevant domestic legal framework was, per se, incompatible with the Convention standards. Rather, this matter must be assessed by taking into consideration the specific circumstances of the first applicant ’ s criminal case. The Court further notes that it can be considered a common feature of European criminal - justice systems for an accused to obtain the lessening of charges or receive a reduction of his or her sentence in exchange for a guilty or nolo contendere plea in advance of trial or for providing substantial cooperation with the investigative authority (see the comparative legal study, paragraphs 62-75 above; see also, in this connection, Slavcho Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 28674/03, § 17, 27 November 2008, and Ruciński v. Poland, no. 33198/04, § 12, 20 February 2007). There cannot be anything improper in the process of charge or sentence bargaining in itself (see, mutatis mutandis, Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 and 36742/08, 6 July 2010). In this connection the Court subscribes to the idea that plea bargaining, apart from offering the important benefits of speedy adjudication of criminal cases and alleviating the workload of courts, prosecutors and lawyers, can also, if applied correctly, be a successful tool in combating corruption and organised crime and can contribute to the reduction of the number of sentences imposed and, as a result, the number of prisoners."
            ],
            [
                "91. The Court considers that where the effect of plea bargaining is that a criminal charge against the accused is determined through an abridged form of judicial examination, this amounts, in substance, to the waiver of a number of procedural rights. This cannot be a problem in itself, since neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 prevents a person from waiving these safeguards of his or her own free will (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 135, 17 September 2009 ). The Court observes in this connection that as early as 1987 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe called upon the member States to take measures aimed at the simplification of ordinary judicial procedures by resorting, for instance, to abridged, summary trials (see paragraph 54 above). However, it is also a cornerstone principle that any waiver of procedural rights must always, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance. In addition, it must not run counter to any important public interest (see, amongst other authorities, Scoppola, cited above, § 135 ‑ 36; Poitrimol v. France, 23 November 1993, § 31, Series A no. 277 ‑ A; and Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 73, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII)."

            [
                "92. The Court thus observes that by striking a bargain with the prosecuting authority over the sentence and pleading no contest as regards the charges, the first applicant waived his right to have the criminal case against him examined on the merits. However, by analogy with the above ‑ mentioned principles concerning the validity of such waivers, the Court considers that the first applicant ’ s decision to accept the plea bargain should have been accompanied by the following conditions: (a) the bargain had to be accepted by the first applicant in full awareness of the facts of the case and the legal consequences and in a genuinely voluntary manner; and (b) the content of the bargain and the fairness of the manner in which it had been reached between the parties had to be subjected to sufficient judicial review."
            ],
            [
                "93. In this connection, the Court notes, firstly, that it was the first applicant himself who asked the prosecuting authority to arrange a plea bargain. In other words, the initiative emanated from him personally and, as the case file discloses, could not be said to have been imposed by the prosecution; the first applicant unequivocally expressed his willingness to repair the damage caused to the State (see paragraphs 14, 18, 22 and 27 above). He was granted access to the criminal case materials as early as 1 August 2004 (see paragraph 21 above). The Court also observes that the first applicant was duly represented by two qualified lawyers of his choosing (compare Hermi, cited above, § 79). One of them met with the first applicant at the very beginning of the criminal proceedings, and represented him during the first investigative interview of 17 March 2004 (see paragraphs 15 - 16). The two lawyers ensured that the first applicant received advice throughout the plea-bargaining negotiations with the prosecution, and one of them also represented him during the judicial examination of the agreement. Of further importance is the fact that the judge of the Kutaisi City Court, who was called upon to examine the lawfulness of the plea bargain during the hearing of 10 September 2004, enquired of the first applicant and his lawyer as to whether he had been subjected to any kind of undue pressure during the negotiations with the prosecutor. The Court notes that the first applicant explicitly confirmed on several occasions, both before the prosecuting authority and the judge, that he had fully understood the content of the agreement, had had his procedural rights and the legal consequences of the agreement explained to him, and that his decision to accept it was not the result of any duress or false promises (see paragraphs 27, 28 and 31 above)."
            ],
            [
                "94. The Court also notes that a written record of the agreement reached between the prosecutor and the first applicant was drawn up. The document was then signed by the prosecutor and by both the first applicant and his lawyer, and submitted to the Kutaisi City Court for consideration. The Court finds this factor to be important, as it made it possible to have the exact terms of the agreement, as well as of the preceding negotiations, set out for judicial review in a clear and incontrovertible manner."
            ],
            [
                "95. As a further guarantee of the adequacy of the judicial review of the fairness of the plea bargain, the Court attaches significance to the fact that the Kutaisi City Court was not, according to applicable domestic law, bound by the agreement reached between the first applicant and the prosecutor. On the contrary, the City Court was entitled to reject that agreement depending upon its own assessment of the fairness of the terms contained in it and the process by which it had been entered into. Not only did the court have the power to assess the appropriateness of the sentence recommended by the prosecutor in relation to the offences charged, it had the power to reduce it (Article 679-4 §§ 1, 3, 4 and 6). The Court is further mindful of the fact that the Kutaisi City Court enquired, for the purposes of effective judicial review of the prosecuting authority ’ s role in plea bargaining, whether the accusations against the first applicant were well founded and supported by prima facie evidence (Article 679-4 § 5). The fact that the City Court examined and approved the plea bargain during a public hearing, in compliance with the requirement contained in Article 679-3 § 1 of the CCP, additionally contributed, in the Court ’ s view, to the overall quality of the judicial review in question."
            ],
            [
                "96. Lastly, as regards the first applicant ’ s complaint under Article 2 of Protocol No. 7, the Court considers that it is normal for the scope of the exercise of the right to appellate review to be more limited with respect to a conviction based on a plea bargain, which represents a waiver of the right to have the criminal case against the accused examined on the merits, than it is with respect to a conviction based on an ordinary criminal trial. It reiterates in this connection that the Contracting States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation under Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 (see, amongst others, Krombach v. France, no. 29731/96, § 96, ECHR 2001 ‑ II). The Court is of the opinion that by accepting the plea bargain, the first applicant, as well as relinquishing his right to an ordinary trial, waived his right to ordinary appellate review. That particular legal consequence of the plea bargain, which followed from the clearly worded domestic legal provision ( Article 679-7 § 2), was or should have been explained to him by his lawyers. By analogy with its earlier findings as to the compatibility of the first applicant ’ s plea bargain with the fairness principle enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see paragraphs 92-95 above), the Court considers that the waiver of the right to ordinary appellate review did not represent an arbitrary restriction falling foul of the analogous requirement of reasonableness contained in Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 either (for the general principle concerning the correlation between the fairness requirements of these two provisions, see Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § 125, 15 November 2007)."
            ],
            [
                "97. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the first applicant ’ s acceptance of the plea bargain, which entailed the waiver of his rights to an ordinary examination of his case on the merits and to ordinary appellate review, was undoubtedly a conscious and voluntary decision. Based on the circumstances of the case, that decision could not be said to have resulted from any duress or false promises made by the prosecution, but, on the contrary, was accompanied by sufficient safeguards against possible abuse of process. Nor can the Court establish from the available case materials that that waiver ran counter to any major public interest."

It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards the accused as guilty (see, mutatis mutandis, Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, § 35, Series A no. 308, and Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, § 37, Series A no. 62). The Court is mindful of the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of an offence (see Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 41, ECHR 2000 ‑ X). The principle of the presumption of innocence may be infringed not only by a judge or court, but also by other public authorities, including prosecutors (see Kuzmin v. Russia, no. 58939/00, §§ 51-63, 18 March 2010; Daktaras, cited above § 42; and Konstas v. Greece, no. 53466/07, § 32, 24 May 2011). The question whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the statement in question was made (see Daktaras, cited above, § 43)."

The Court cannot conclude on the basis of that interview that the Governor intended in any way to render the first applicant identifiable, either directly or indirectly, as the subject of those comments (contrast, for instance, Konstas, cited above, §§ 39-40)."

In certain situations a virulent media campaign can indeed adversely affect the fairness of a trial and involve the State ’ s responsibility.

According to the report, Mr S., the direct marketing executive, explained to the officers that he was not authorised to accept and sign the inspection order or the order to initiate proceedings against the applicant company. The officers asked him to direct them to someone authorised or to the mailroom, so that they could serve the orders and start the inspection. Mr S. took the officers to the mailroom but nobody was there. An employee who arrived at the mailroom at 9.25 a.m. refused to sign anything and said that she would call her superior. A moment later Mr P., the deputy finance executive, arrived at the mailroom. It is stated in the report that in a loud voice he then asked the officers to leave, pointing with his hand in the direction of the exit and showing no intention to cooperate with the officers, despite being warned by them that refusal to cooperate would be regarded as an obstruction of the inspection, resulting in a fine. Since none of the employees wanted to accept the orders, the officers eventually left them in the mailroom and the orders were thus deemed to be served. According to the report, at 9.31 a.m. the officers left the building because they believed that the inspection would not be possible without police assistance. At 9.57 a.m., after the arrival of the police, the officers again entered the applicant company’s premises. At 10 a.m. Mr V. arrived. He apologised for the inconvenience and was willing to cooperate.

By an order of 21 February 2012 the Office fined the applicant company 105,000 euros (EUR), 0.2 % of the company’s annual net turnover in the preceding year, for obstructing the inspection on 11 August 2011. The obstruction had been Mr P.’s unwillingness to cooperate with officers and to immediately facilitate access to evidence and its preservation. It concluded that the applicant company had obstructed the inspection by not making the inspection physically possible ( preiskava ni bila fizično omogočena ) after being requested and warned to do so by the officers. Waiting in the reception area for the applicant company to prepare for the inspection or for the authorised person of the company to arrive ran contrary to the purpose of an unannounced inspection, which was to secure evidence. The Office also held that it was a company’s duty to cooperate even when its legal representative was absent. In setting the fine, the Office considered that the inspection had been delayed for one hour and thirty minutes, and for twenty-six minutes the applicant company’s conduct had been outside the officers’ control and could have resulted in the destruction of incriminating evidence. Referring to the EU Commission’s practice, it held that the punishment had to be stringent enough to deter the offenders. It also had regard to the subsequent exemplary cooperation of the applicant company and the fact that this had been the first time a fine had been imposed under the Competition Act."

It requested an oral hearing, maintaining that a direct examination of the evidence was required to properly establish the facts of the case. In particular, the four witnesses, who had been present at the premises on the day of the alleged obstruction, would prove that the applicant company had not obstructed the inspection or refused to cooperate with the officers. They would also show that the officers had not properly introduced themselves and had tried to enter the premises in an aggressive manner. The applicant company also argued that the officers could not be prevented from doing something which they had not specifically requested, namely access to specific places or persons under the inspection. At the time the obstruction had allegedly been committed, the officers had only asked for someone on whom they could serve the orders and had been subsequently politely asked to wait in the reception area. The applicant company’s employees had complied with the duty to cooperate by trying to find that person. The applicant company argued that the officers could have freely continued with the inspection. Furthermore, had there been an obstruction of the inspection, the Office would have sanctioned the company on the spot and not six months later. As to Mr P., it held that he had not been an employee of the applicant company and had not been authorised to collect any mail. Since he was only in a contractual relationship with the applicant company, his allegedly illegal actions could not be attributed to it. Lastly, given the amount of the fine imposed, which was excessive, immediately enforceable and of a punitive nature, the proceedings at issue had been criminal in nature and required adequate fair trial guarantees."

It noted at the outset that the applicant company was not allowed to introduce new facts and evidence in the judicial review proceedings and that they would not be taken into consideration. The court emphasised that although the applicant company had contested the facts as established by the Office (see paragraph 10 above), it had not challenged the fact that the officers could not immediately after their arrival at the company’s premises secure the evidence. In particular, the majority of the management had been absent, while Mr P. had refused to cooperate and had asked the officers to leave the premises until the arrival of his superiors. According to the Supreme Court, the applicant company had merely argued that the above-described acts had not constituted an obstruction of the inspection. In the Supreme Court’s opinion this was not a question of fact but purely of law. In this connection, the court held that making the officers wait in the reception area while the company prepared for the inspection ran contrary to the purpose of an inspection. It was irrelevant whether the company’s employees had raised their voices at the officers or had asked them to leave. The only important fact was that the authorised persons could not immediately start securing the evidence. The applicant company had not acted in accordance with the minimum duty to cooperate, which had been necessary for the inspection, and had thus obstructed it. The court also rejected the argument that Mr P. could not obstruct the inspection, finding that he was a contractual worker working in the name of the applicant company in accordance with section 31(5) of the Competition Act (see paragraph 25 below).

Secondly, they maintained that the purpose of the fine was to enable the Agency to effectively exercise its supervisory powers under the Competition Act. The fine was not universally applicable. Lastly, the Government submitted that the amount of the fine depended on the economic size of the undertaking, whereas the maximum fine could not be higher than 1% of the undertaking’s annual turnover in the preceding business year. In the present case, the imposed fine had been five times smaller than the maximum statutory fine, which could not be converted into a prison sentence."

As to the proceedings concerning the finding of a violation of competition rules, the applicant company argued that the formal separation of administrative and minor-offence proceedings in the Competition Act was artificial because the proceedings were intertwined and conducted with the aim of imposing a fine for a substantive violation of competition rules. The fact that in the administrative proceedings only a declaratory decision on the abuse of a dominant position had been issued without any measures or actual effect, only confirmed its view that their only purpose had been to impose a fine in the subsequent minor-offence proceedings. In addition, criminal proceedings could be instigated against an undertaking and the persons responsible on the basis of the findings and conclusions of the Agency. With regard to the severity of the penalty, the applicant company asserted that a fine of up to 10% of the undertaking’s annual turnover in the preceding year was extremely stringent, and that it had initially been fined EUR 4,994,491.60."

Lastly, regarding the severity of the penalty, the applicant company argued that the imposed fine had been extremely high and that the impugned decision on the fine had been directly enforceable."

The Court reiterates its established case-law that, in determining the existence of a “criminal charge”, it is necessary to have regard to three factors: the legal classification of the measure in question in national law, the very nature of the measure, and the nature and degree of severity of the “penalty” (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 82, Series A no. 22). Furthermore, these criteria are alternative and not cumulative: for Article 6 to apply in respect of the words “criminal charge”, it suffices that the offence in question should by its nature be “criminal” from the point of view of the Convention, or should have made the person concerned liable to a sanction which, by virtue of its nature and degree of severity, belongs in general to the “criminal” sphere. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a “criminal charge” (see Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, §§ 30 and 31, ECHR 2006-XIII, and Zaicevs v. Latvia, no. 65022/01, § 31, ECHR 2007 ‑ IX (extracts))."

                "40. The Court notes at the outset that the Slovenian legal system outlines two different kinds of proceedings regarding the assessment of competition law violations: proceedings, like those concerned here, which are in their entirety held under the provisions of the Competition Act (supervision proceedings), and proceedings on minor offences which are carried out almost entirely under the provisions of the Minor Offences Act (see paragraph 30 above). It further notes that the same facts which gave rise to supervision proceedings could constitute the factual basis for a minor offence (section 73 of the Competition Act, see paragraph 25 above). However, the Court observes that the Agency can impose a fine only in minor-offence proceedings, when acting as a minor-offence authority pursuant to section 12(2) of the Competition Act (see paragraph 25 above). Furthermore, in minor-offence proceedings the domestic courts are in no way bound by the administrative decision of the Agency. They have jurisdiction to decide on all aspects of the case. Moreover, the administrative decision of the Agency can stand without the minor-offence decision. Therefore, the Court considers that the supervision proceedings, on the one hand, and the minor-offence proceedings before the Agency and ensuing judicial review proceedings, on the other, should be regarded as two separate sets of proceedings for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention. It will now turn to examine whether the criminal limb of Article 6 applied to the supervision proceedings.",

As regards the domestic classification of the finding of a violation of competition rules, the Court notes that an examination of the relevant legislation and the case-law of the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 25 ‑ 31 above) shows that the measure in question, considered in isolation, cannot be said to belong to criminal law under the domestic legal system. In this connection, the Court observes that the Agency when conducting supervision proceedings applies the rules of administrative procedure (section 15 of the Competition Act, see paragraph 25 above). Similarly, the legality of the decision-making of the Agency in this type of proceedings is subject to appeal before the Supreme Court, which decides in special judicial review proceedings, applying, mutatis mutandis, provisions of the Administrative Disputes Act (section 54 of the Competition Act, see paragraph 25 above). However, this consideration is not decisive, as the indications furnished by the domestic law have only a relative value (see A. Menarini Diagnostics S.R.L. v. Italy, no. 43509/08, § 39, 27 September 2011)."

                "42. The Court must now look at the nature of the offence and nature and degree of severity of the sanction which the applicant company risked incurring. It notes that the provision found to have been infringed by the applicant company (section 9 of the Competition Act, see paragraph 25 above) was intended to preserve free competition in the market. The Agency as a public regulatory authority monitored restrictive agreements and abuses of dominant position. These are general interests of society, usually protected by criminal law (see A. Menarini Diagnostics S.R.L., cited above, § 40). On the other hand, the contested decision (see paragraph 18 above) was issued by the Agency acting in its capacity as a supervisory authority (and not a minor-offence authority). When acting in such a capacity, the Agency was only entitled to determine the existence of a violation of competition rules, demand that the undertaking cease the violation and impose on the undertaking certain measures which it considered suitable for remedying the established violation and its consequences (section 37 of the Competition Act, see paragraph 25 above). In the supervision proceedings the decisions were to be issued on objective grounds without the need to establish any criminal intent or negligence on the undertaking’s part and were not entered in criminal records. The Court further finds it particularly important that in the present case, the impugned decision imposed no measures on the applicant company (compare and contrast with A. Menarini Diagnostics S.R.L., cited above, § 41). In fact, the applicant company itself acknowledged that the Agency in the supervision proceedings had only issued a declaratory decision on the abuse of a dominant position without any measures or actual effect on the applicant company (see paragraph 37 above)."

            [
                "43. Having regard to these factors, the Court considers that the decision issued in the supervision proceedings was not of a criminal character and was not intended to punish or deter but to restore the normal market situation (see, mutatis mutandis, OOO Neste St. Petersburg, ZAO Kirishiavtoservice, OOO Nevskaya Toplivnaya, ZAO Transservice, OOO Faeton, OOO PTK-Service v. Russia (dec.), nos. 69042/01, 69050/01, 69054/01, 69055/01, 69056/01, 69058/01, 3 June 2004; and contrast with Janosevic v. Sweden, no. 34619/97, § 68, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII). The supervision proceedings, as conducted in the present case, did not therefore involve the determination of a “criminal charge” within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. Moreover, the Court notes that there was no monetary obligation imposed on the applicant company and it does not discern any other aspect of the case that would warrant examination of the applicability of Article 6 in its civil limb."

As regards the first criterion, under the test established in Engel and Others (see paragraph 39 above), it is clear that the fine at issue was imposed pursuant to the Competition Act and was administrative under national law (see also paragraph 41 above). However, this is not decisive (see Öztürk v. Germany, 21 February 1984, § 52, Series A no. 73, and A. Menarini Diagnostics S.R.L., cited above, § 39). As for the second criterion, the Court notes that the measure imposed on the applicant company resulted from section 31 of the Competition Act, which applies a general obligation to a specific circumstance, that is, the imposition of fines on undertakings obstructing the Agency’s officers in the exercise of their powers (see, mutatis mutandis, Özmurat İnşaat Elektrik Nakliyat Temizlik San. ve Tic. Ltd. Şti. v. Turkey no. 48657/06, § 25, 28 November 2017). It would appear that the prohibition on obstructing inspections was intended to ensure effective exercise of the Agency’s powers. The Court observes that the effective exercise of official duties of agents of the State appears to be in the general interests of society, protected also by the Criminal Code in Slovenia (see paragraph 29 above). Moreover, with regard to the third criterion, it observes that the fine at issue concerned a substantial amount and that the maximum fine the applicant risked incurring amounted to more than EUR 500,000. Furthermore, the fine was directly enforceable (section 31(4) of the Competition Act, see paragraph 25 above). It was imposed several months after the inspection had finished, thus did not pursue the aim of ensuring an effective inspection. It was essentially intended to punish the unlawful conduct, in order to prevent reoffending, and not to compensate any damage caused by the applicant company."

They emphasised in this connection that section 59 of the Competition Act (see paragraph 25 above) did not prevent the court from conducting a hearing if the case in question so required.

Moreover, the Government also argued that the applicant ’ s absence at the trial had been the consequence of his failure to notify the authorities of his change of address."

                "51. As such, the Court should ascertain whether the trial court could be said to have shown sufficient diligence in its efforts to locate the applicant and to inform him about the criminal proceedings. In that connection, it makes the following observations. Firstly, although the applicant had issued the disputed cheque in his capacity as president of the executive board of his company, he was tried as an individual before the Bakırköy Criminal Court of First Instance. However, that court first sent a summons together with the indictment to the address of the company indicated by the applicant on the cheque. That summons was returned on the grounds that the company had left the address, leaving “PK. [post box] 5 Bakırköy ” as the new address. At the same time, the trial court sought assistance from the prosecutor ’ s office, which in turn asked the police and the relevant district mayor to locate the applicant. They concluded that the applicant had abandoned the address written on the cheque. Thereafter, the trial court issued a detention order in absentia in respect of the applicant under Article 223 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure, with a view to bringing him before the court, and waited from 14 February 2000 to 13 October 2004 for that warrant to be executed. Lastly, the trial court decided to serve the summons at the address indicated on the cheque, pursuant to section 35 ( 4 ) of the Law of Notifications then in force."

                "52. The Court takes note of the trial court ’ s above - mentioned efforts. However, those efforts were limited to the address of the company indicated on the cheque. Significantly, the trial court never attempted to serve the indictment or the summons or its decision at the applicant ’ s place of residence, despite the fact that he was tried before that court as an individual. More importantly, the Bağcılar Criminal Court of First Instance, which is also situated in Istanbul, was able to serve a summons at the applicant ’ s home address on 11 October 2001, in relation to criminal proceedings in which he was a complainant (for an almost identical situation, see Colozza, cited above, § 28 ). Moreover, the Küçükçekmece public prosecutor ’ s office, which is also situated in Istanbul, indicated the applicant ’ s home address in its decision not to prosecute dated 16 July 2001, a decision made within the context of other criminal proceedings. At this point, the Court finds it important to reiterate that the police were also able to locate and arrest the applicant at his home address in 2006."

Having regard to the foregoing, and bearing in mind the prominent place which the right to a fair trial holds in a democratic society within the meaning of the Convention (see Hokkeling v. the Netherlands, no. 30749/12, § 62, 14 February 2017), the Court is unable to subscribe to the Government ’ s argument that the trial court showed the requisite due diligence in its efforts to locate the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Davran v.

Upon settling the debt with the bank, the applicant had requested that İ.Ö. return the blank cheque to him, but İ.Ö. had failed to do so, alleging that she had lost it. He had accordingly reported the cheque as missing to the bank, and had asked to be notified in the event of any attempts to cash it.

It was also not clear what steps had been taken by the police to find his address when they had been instructed to do so by the trial court. In that connection, he referred to the fact that the trial court had neither requested information from the bank nor consulted the tax offices for his address.

Moreover, the trial court had also ordered the applicant ’ s detention in absentia with a view to bringing him before the court to give evidence. However, the trial court had not been able to find the applicant ’ s actual address, and had decided to serve its decision at the address indicated on the cheque, in accordance with section 35 in fine of the Notifications Act. Moreover, the applicant was a merchant, and he was supposed to run his business with due diligence, such as by providing the relevant institutions – for example, the mayor of the neighbourhood – with his new address. In the Government ’ s view, had the trial court sought the applicant ’ s address indefinitely, that would have paralysed the conduct of the criminal proceedings and led to the time-limit for the prosecution expiring or a miscarriage of justice."

                "48. The Court notes at the outset that, at the material time, trial in absentia was only possible under Turkish criminal law in respect of an offence punishable by a fine, “ light imprisonment ( hafif hapis cezası ) ”, confiscation, or a combination of those punishments (Article 22 5 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure ). In the present case, the offence of which the applicant was accused – namely that of issuing an uncovered cheque, an offence under the first sentence of Section 16 of Law no. 3167, in force at the material time – was punishable by a fine. Thus, it was within the scope of Article 22 5 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure. Reiterating that the impossibility of holding a trial by default may paralyse the conduct of criminal proceedings, in that it may lead, for example, to the dispersal of evidence, the expiry of the time-limit for a prosecution, or a miscarriage of justice ( Colozza v. Italy, 12 February 1985, § 29, Series A no. 89), the Court considers that the applicant ’ s trial in absentia had a legal basis under the Turkish law in force at the material time."
            ],
            [
                "49. The Court further notes that the first question to be answered is whether the applicant could be said to have expressly or through his own conduct – for instance by attempting to evade justice – waived his right to appear and defend himself. The starting point of that assessment will inevitably focus on the question of whether the applicant had knowledge of the criminal proceedings against him, without which no valid waiver can take place (see Dilipak and Karakaya v. Turkey, nos. 7942/05 and 24838/05, § 87, 4 March 2014, and compare Ait Abbou v. France, no. 44921/13, §§ 63 ‑ 65, 2 February 2017 ). In that connection, the Court notes that it does not have in its possession any evidence showing that the applicant either received the summonses to appear before the trial court or was served with the indictment or the final decision convicting him (see Abdelali v. France, no. 43353/07, § 52, 11 October 2012). Moreover, the Government did not dispute that before the Court (see Huzuneanu v. Italy, no. 36043/08, § 4 2, 1 September 2016). In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the applicant expressly and knowingly waived his right to appear and defend himself."
            ],
            [
                "50. The Court will now examine whether the applicant was sufficiently aware of the criminal proceedings, with a view to deciding whether he tacitly waived his right to appear and defend himself in any other way, for example by intending to escape trial. In that connection, it notes once again that the Government have neither claimed nor submitted any document that could arguably indicate that he was aware or had sufficient knowledge of the trial. Instead, the Government ’ s submissions in the instant case were focused on the fact that the trial court had acted diligently with regard to locating the applicant and had complied with the provisions of the domestic law then in force concerning the service of official documents. Moreover, the Government also argued that the applicant ’ s absence at the trial had been the consequence of his failure to notify the authorities of his change of address."
            ],
            [
                "51. As such, the Court should ascertain whether the trial court could be said to have shown sufficient diligence in its efforts to locate the applicant and to inform him about the criminal proceedings. In that connection, it makes the following observations. Firstly, although the applicant had issued the disputed cheque in his capacity as president of the executive board of his company, he was tried as an individual before the Bakırköy Criminal Court of First Instance. However, that court first sent a summons together with the indictment to the address of the company indicated by the applicant on the cheque. That summons was returned on the grounds that the company had left the address, leaving “PK. [post box] 5 Bakırköy ” as the new address. At the same time, the trial court sought assistance from the prosecutor ’ s office, which in turn asked the police and the relevant district mayor to locate the applicant. They concluded that the applicant had abandoned the address written on the cheque. Thereafter, the trial court issued a detention order in absentia in respect of the applicant under Article 223 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure, with a view to bringing him before the court, and waited from 14 February 2000 to 13 October 2004 for that warrant to be executed. Lastly, the trial court decided to serve the summons at the address indicated on the cheque, pursuant to section 35 ( 4 ) of the Law of Notifications then in force."
            ],
            [
                "52. The Court takes note of the trial court ’ s above - mentioned efforts. However, those efforts were limited to the address of the company indicated on the cheque. Significantly, the trial court never attempted to serve the indictment or the summons or its decision at the applicant ’ s place of residence, despite the fact that he was tried before that court as an individual. More importantly, the Bağcılar Criminal Court of First Instance, which is also situated in Istanbul, was able to serve a summons at the applicant ’ s home address on 11 October 2001, in relation to criminal proceedings in which he was a complainant (for an almost identical situation, see Colozza, cited above, § 28 ). Moreover, the Küçükçekmece public prosecutor ’ s office, which is also situated in Istanbul, indicated the applicant ’ s home address in its decision not to prosecute dated 16 July 2001, a decision made within the context of other criminal proceedings. At this point, the Court finds it important to reiterate that the police were also able to locate and arrest the applicant at his home address in 2006."
            ],
            [
                "53. Having regard to the foregoing, and bearing in mind the prominent place which the right to a fair trial holds in a democratic society within the meaning of the Convention (see Hokkeling v. the Netherlands, no. 30749/12, § 62, 14 February 2017), the Court is unable to subscribe to the Government ’ s argument that the trial court showed the requisite due diligence in its efforts to locate the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Davran v. Turkey, no. 18342/03, § 45, 3 November 2009, and Büyükdağ v. Turkey, no. 28340/95, § 67 in fine, 21 December 2000). In such a case, the submission that the national courts served the decision in accordance with the domestic legal provisions, a fact that is disputed between the parties in the present case, is not sufficient of itself to relieve the State of its obligations under Article 6 of the Convention."

                "54. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicant had no knowledge of the proceedings, and he did not waive his right to appear and defend himself or attempt to evade justice. Thus, it remains to be determined whether the domestic legislation afforded him, with sufficient certainty, the opportunity to appear at a new trial (see Sejdovic, cited above, § 101 in fine, and also Jones v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 30900/02, 9 September 2003)."

In that connection, the Court notes that the Government submitted no argument as to whether Turkish law, at the material time, offered any legal remedies providing for the rehearing of cases in which people had been tried and convicted in absentia, like the applicant in the instant case. Instead, the Government maintained that the applicant had been duly served with the decision and that he had failed to ask the Court of Cassation to hold a hearing, and consequently he should be considered to have waived that right."

He lodged an appeal on 5 May 2006 against the decision of the Bakırköy Criminal Court of First Instance. However, that court dismissed his appeal as being lodged outside the time-limit for appeals (Article 315 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure ). On 22 May 2006 the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision. On 2 October 2006 the Court of Cassation also rejected that appeal, maintaining that the trial court ’ s decision had been lawfully served on the applicant under section 35 of the Notification Act. On 8 November 2006, in accordance with Article 308 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicant requested that the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation to lodge an application to have the Court of Cassation ’ s decision set aside. On 1 December 2008 his application was rejected."

In so far as the Government argued that the applicant had implicitly waived his right to appear by failing to ask the Court of Cassation to hold a hearing in his appeal, the Court notes that Article 318 of the former Code of Criminal Code provides for the possibility of a hearing only in cases where an offence is punishable by the death penalty, “ heavy imprisonment ” or imprisonment for more than ten years. However, the applicant was tried for issuing an uncovered cheque and subsequently sentenced to a fine. In other words, there was no legal possibility to hold a hearing before the Court of Cassation in the applicant ’ s case, since the offence with which he was charged did not fall within the scope of Article 318. Given that the applicant had no right to a hearing before the Court of Cassation, he could not be said to have waived that right. The Government ’ s argument must therefore be rejected."

As regards the applicant ’ s attempt to use an extraordinary remedy, namely his application under Article 308 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure, a remedy formerly known as “rectification of judgment ”, the Court reiterates that it has already held that the use of that procedure was at the discretion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, and was therefore not a remedy directly accessible to individuals (see Akçiçek v. Turkey (dec.) no. 40965/10, 18 October 2011). In any event, that application was dismissed by the Principal Public Prosecutor ’ s Office in the present case."

The Court reiterates that, in accordance with its case-law, the duty to guarantee a criminal defendant ’ s right to be present in the courtroom – either during the original proceedings or in a retrial – ranks as one of the essential requirements of Article 6 and is deeply entrenched in that provision. Therefore, criminal proceedings which have been held in absentia and the reopening of which has been subsequently refused, without any indication that the accused has waived his or her right to be present during the trial, may fairly be described as “manifestly contrary to the provisions of Article 6 or the principles embodied therein” (see Stoichkov v.

That was also the reason why, at the time of his arrest by the police, he had not been able to pay an amount as little as TRY 500, and why that fine had been converted into imprisonment ( tazyik hapsi ).

The judge established that the applicant was the webmaster of an Internet forum on which defamatory messages against the complainants in the proceedings had been published, and that he had deliberately disregarded the request made to him by a police officer within the framework of the criminal investigation not to alter the messages in question. In fact, the applicant had proceeded to have the forum webpage removed altogether, despite the police officer ’ s request to leave it unchanged. As regards the charges for defamation and false accusation of a crime, the judge held that there were reasonable doubts as to whether the applicant had been aware of the messages in question before his police interview and that he should therefore be acquitted in that regard. It was also alleged that he had protected the individuals who had made the defamatory statements; however, the judge considered that he could not be found guilty of concealment as it had not been proved that he had been aware at the time of his police interview that it had been possible for him to have access to the Internet Protocol (IP) numbers of the participants on the forum."

On 16 May 2011 the Audiencia Provincial upheld the applicant ’ s conviction for serious disobedience to public authority and, unlike the first-instance judge, found him guilty of continuous and false accusation of a crime ( delito continuado de calumnias ). His punishment was a daily fine of 15 euros (EUR) for a period of eighteen months. He was also required to pay damages. In finding the applicant guilty, the appellate court stated that it had relied on the facts established by the first - instance judge and on the testimony given by the complainants, the applicant and the witnesses in the earlier trial. The court stated:",

The facts declared proved in the first - instance judgment constitute continuous and false accusation of a crime and defamation regulated and punished by section 205 and seq. of the Criminal Code in relation to section 74 of the same Code for which the defendant Jorge Gómez Olmeda should be declared guilty as a principal pursuant to sections 28 and 30 of the Code with the mitigating factor of undue delays pursuant to section 21 paragraph six of the Code.",
                "It is undisputed that documentary evidence does not require judicial immediacy for its assessment because it is written down and can be read and interpreted in the light of the circumstances of the case, which had been perfectly outlined in the complainants ’ brief and proved in the hearing, both with respect to what was written on the forum and the people against whom those expressions were directed. Those expressions imputed the commission of crimes to the complainants (sexual assault, sexual slavery of a person) and were detrimental to their fame and reputation to the extent that it is obvious that the imputations were serious in themselves and related to public understanding, which is an open-ended concept of which interpretation depends on the particular facts of the case. It is worth remembering that we are speaking here of a small town where everybody knows each other, where everybody runs into each other, where everybody attends the same places, where everyday life is routine and there is little room for novelties, where anything breaking the monotony is something which attracts public attention, where the genealogy of every inhabitant is known to the rest. For these reasons we find the applicant guilty of the crime of continuous and false accusation of a crime ... which he had been acquitted of at first instance.",

We disagree with the accused when he states that he was unaware of what was written on the forum, the argument on which the first - instance judge relied to acquit him of false accusation of a crime and defamation. And we disagree for the following two reasons. Firstly, because it was part of his duties as the administrator of the forum to be aware of what was written on it, to the extent that he was its ‘ censor ’, so to speak, on account of the fact that he had created it; and secondly, because it is untrue that he was unaware of what was written on it, since he had removed some phrases and messages which were insulting to the complainants, thus proving that he had read what was written on the forum in question and demonstrating that he had regarded what was written there as insulting to a specific individual or individuals, which led him to the decision to remove what he regarded as defamatory or insulting.”"

For the purposes of the Court’s assessment of the applicability of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, it is not the Court’s task to examine whether the prosecuting authorities’ procedural decisions and actions were in compliance with the requirements of the domestic law. The question before it is whether the applicant was a person “charged with a criminal offence” within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention. In order to answer that question, the Court is compelled to look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the situation before it (see Batiashvili v. Georgia, no. 8284/07, § 79, 10 October 2019). It notes once again that it is true that the applicant was never formally charged with a criminal offence in the discontinued criminal proceedings and that he did not become aware of the allegations made against him in those proceedings until sometime between February and May 2006 (see paragraph 9 above), after the civil claim under the CCrP had been lodged against him on 16 February 2006, less than a month after the discontinuation of the proceedings on 21 January 2006. However, having regard to the case-specific sequence of closely inter-connected events, described in paragraph 47 above, considered as a whole, as well as to the relatively close temporal proximity between the relevant events in question, the Court considers that, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the combined effect of the authorities’ actions taken as a result of a suspicion against the applicant was that his situation was “substantially affected” by the conduct of the authorities (compare, mutatis mutandis, Batiashvili, cited above, § 94) and that therefore, for the purposes of the present complaint, he must be considered a person “charged with a criminal offence” within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention."

The applicant submitted that Article 179.4 of the CCrP was not applicable in this case and that the civil claim should have been examined under the relevant provisions of civil law, under which all the statutes of limitations had long expired for any types of civil claims.

Such a civil claim was to be examined by the trial court hearing the criminal case from which the civil claim stemmed (see Article 187 of the CCrP in paragraph 27 above). Any periods for lodging a civil claim provided for by civil law and other fields of law did not apply to claims lodged under this procedure (see Article 179.4 of the CCrP in paragraph 27 above). It therefore appears that Article 179.4 of the CCrP precluded defendants in criminal proceedings from raising an objection that the civil claim lodged within the framework of those criminal proceedings was time-barred under civil law. However, in the applicant’s case, there were no active criminal proceedings pending against him at the time the civil claim was lodged. The claim was lodged with and examined by the civil court. This was done despite the clear language of the CCrP, according to which a civil claim could be lodged on the basis of the CCrP only within the framework of criminal proceedings, before the court examining the criminal charges. Thus, the applicant’s submissions concerning the lack of a lawful basis for the court’s acceptance of that claim for examination under the procedure established by the CCrP for “civil claims within the framework of criminal proceedings” and concerning the inapplicability of Article 179.4 of the CCrP were potentially decisive for the outcome of the case, as they might have led to rejection of the claim."

A “criminal charge”, within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 of the Convention, exists from the moment that an individual is officially notified by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence, or from the point at which his situation has been substantially affected by actions taken by the authorities as a result of a suspicion against him. It is the actual occurrence of the first of the aforementioned events, regardless of their chronological order, which triggers the application of Article 6 in its criminal aspect (see Simeonovi v.

Croatia, no. 29889/04, §§ 12-15, 36 and 41, 14 January 2010, where criminal proceedings against a suspect were discontinued owing to insufficient evidence that he had committed a criminal offence, and Vulakh and Others v.

The authorities intended to question him, albeit at that stage in the formal capacity of a witness, but clearly in connection with their suspicion that he had committed those offences (see paragraph 6 above). As expressly stated in the prosecuting authorities’ decision of 21 January 2006, following the investigation, the authorities considered that the applicant should be formally charged under Articles 308.1, 179.2.3, 179.2.1 and 179.3.2 of the Criminal Code, all of which provided for prison sentences in the event of a finding of guilt, but they were precluded from doing so owing to the expiry of the criminal limitation period (see paragraph 8 above).

As discussed in paragraph 38 above, that procedure required, inter alia, the existence of a “criminal charge”, as it could be instituted only against an “accused” person or a person who could be held materially liable for the criminal actions of the accused (and, in the present case, as noted above, the authorities considered that the applicant should have been charged as an “accused”)."

                "48. For the purposes of the Court’s assessment of the applicability of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, it is not the Court’s task to examine whether the prosecuting authorities’ procedural decisions and actions were in compliance with the requirements of the domestic law. The question before it is whether the applicant was a person “charged with a criminal offence” within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention. In order to answer that question, the Court is compelled to look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the situation before it (see Batiashvili v. Georgia, no. 8284/07, § 79, 10 October 2019). It notes once again that it is true that the applicant was never formally charged with a criminal offence in the discontinued criminal proceedings and that he did not become aware of the allegations made against him in those proceedings until sometime between February and May 2006 (see paragraph 9 above), after the civil claim under the CCrP had been lodged against him on 16 February 2006, less than a month after the discontinuation of the proceedings on 21 January 2006. However, having regard to the case-specific sequence of closely inter-connected events, described in paragraph 47 above, considered as a whole, as well as to the relatively close temporal proximity between the relevant events in question, the Court considers that, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the combined effect of the authorities’ actions taken as a result of a suspicion against the applicant was that his situation was “substantially affected” by the conduct of the authorities (compare, mutatis mutandis, Batiashvili, cited above, § 94) and that therefore, for the purposes of the present complaint, he must be considered a person “charged with a criminal offence” within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention."

                "49. As to the subsequent civil proceedings brought against the applicant, the Court reiterates that the scope of Article 6 § 2 is not limited to pending criminal proceedings against an applicant, and can apply to judicial decisions taken after such proceedings were concluded either by way of discontinuation or acquittal (see Allen, cited above, §§ 98-102, for a summary of the earlier case-law in that connection). Such subsequent judicial decisions fall within the scope of Article 6 § 2 when, by virtue of the domestic legislation and practice, they are linked to the criminal proceedings and constitute “consequences and necessary concomitants of”, or “a direct sequel to”, the conclusion of the criminal proceedings (ibid., §§ 99-100). Following the discontinuation of criminal proceedings, the presumption of innocence requires that a person’s lack of a criminal conviction be preserved in any other proceedings of whatever nature (ibid., § 102, with further references)."

                "50. In Allen, the Court clarified that, whenever the question of the applicability of Article 6 § 2 arose in the context of subsequent proceedings, the applicant had to demonstrate the existence of a link between the concluded criminal proceedings and the subsequent proceedings. Such a link is likely to be present, for example, where the subsequent proceedings require examination of the outcome of the prior criminal proceedings and, in particular, where they oblige the court to analyse the criminal judgment, to engage in a review or evaluation of the evidence in the criminal file, to assess the applicant’s participation in some or all of the events leading to the criminal charge, or to comment on the subsisting indications of the applicant’s possible guilt (ibid., § 104)."

            [
                "51. In the present case, the Court considers that the subsequent civil proceedings were linked to the discontinued criminal proceedings, and it has not been argued otherwise. The civil compensation claim was brought against the applicant by the prosecution authorities on behalf of the State under the provisions of the CCrP on “civil claims within the framework of criminal proceedings”. In their claim, the prosecution authorities relied on the evidence collected by the investigation, arguing that the defendants, including the applicant, had committed embezzlement of State funds in large amounts but could not be held criminally liable owing to the expiry of the limitation period, and requested the court to order these individuals to compensate the State for the “embezzlement”. Accordingly, under the relevant legislation and practice as applied by the domestic authorities and courts in the present case, the civil proceedings were the “direct consequence” of the criminal investigation. Moreover, the statements made by the court allegedly imputing criminal liability to the applicant, which the Court will assess below when examining the merits of the complaint, also created a link with the criminal proceedings."

The Court observes that it is true that, in his appeals, the applicant did not expressly refer to a breach of his right to presumption of innocence or expressly rely on Article 6 § 2 of the Convention or any specific domestic provisions protecting the presumption of innocence. However, the Court reiterates that Article 35 § 1 requires that the complaints intended to be made subsequently in Strasbourg should have been made to the appropriate domestic body “at least in substance” (see, among other authorities, Vučković and Others v. Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], nos. 17153/11 and 29 others, § 72, 25 March 2014, with further references). This means that if the applicant has not relied on the provisions of the Convention, he or she must have raised arguments to the same or like effect on the basis of domestic law, in order to have given the national courts the opportunity to redress the alleged breach in the first place (see, among other authorities, Radomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/12, § 117, 20 March 2018). It is not sufficient that a violation of the Convention is “evident” from the facts of the case or the applicant’s submissions. Rather, he or she must actually complain (expressly or in substance) of it in a manner which leaves no doubt that the same complaint that was subsequently submitted to the Court had indeed been raised at the domestic level (see Merot d.o.o. and Storitve Tir d.o.o. v.

He complained that the civil courts had referred to the prosecution’s statement of facts of the alleged criminal offence and accepted those facts as having been proved, in the absence of any such finding by a criminal court in a criminal trial, thus committing a “serious procedural violation” (see paragraph 22 above). The Court considers that the above submissions raised the substance of the complaint before the higher courts. Even though the applicant’s arguments lacked the appropriate legal references, they were based on domestic law. It ought to have been clear to the higher courts from those submissions that the applicant was complaining of, among other things, a breach of the presumption of innocence."

This may be so even in the absence of any formal finding; it suffices that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court regards the accused as guilty (see Allen, cited above, § 120, and Minelli v.

However, if the national decision on compensation were to contain a statement imputing criminal liability to the respondent party, this would raise an issue falling within the ambit of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention (see Allen, cited above, § 123; Ringvold v. Norway, no. 34964/97, § 38, ECHR 2003 ‑ II; Y v. Norway, no. 56568/00, §§ 41-42, ECHR 2003 ‑ II; and Diacenco v. Romania, no. 124/04, §§ 59-60, 7 February 2012)."

While the use of some unfortunate language may not necessarily be incompatible with Article 6 § 2 depending on the nature and context of the particular proceedings, the Court has found that the presumption of innocence was violated in situations where the civil courts held that it was “clearly probable” that the applicant had committed a criminal offence or expressly indicated that the available evidence was sufficient to establish that a criminal offence had been committed (see Allen, cited above, §§ 125-26, with further references to the relevant precedents, including Y v.

It was only after this decision that the prosecutor could proceed with the bill of indictment and the conclusion of the pre-trial investigation.

While the use of the term “proved” is unfortunate, the Court considers that, having regard to the context in which the word was used, both the applicant and the prosecutor were referring not to the question whether the applicant's guilt had been established by the evidence – which was clearly not one for the determination of the prosecutor – but to the question whether the case file disclosed sufficient evidence of the applicant's guilt to justify proceeding to trial."

It follows that the Court may only deal with the application if the request for extraordinary review of the County Court ’ s judgment and the constitutional complaint against the judgment of the Supreme Court dismissing the applicant ’ s request are considered remedies within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, in which case the six-month period provided for in that Article should be calculated from the date of the decision of the Constitutional Court regarding the constitutional complaint against the judgment of the Supreme Court."

Croatia, no. 55759/07, § 28, 25 June 2009, and Dolenec v. Croatia, no. 25282/06, § 199, 26 November 2009 )."

As to the applicant ’ s subsequent constitutional complaint, the Court reiterates its findings in the Dolenec case that under section 62 of the Constitutional Court Act, anyone who deems that a decision of a State body concerning his or her rights and obligations, or a suspicion or an accusation of a criminal act, has violated his or her human rights or fundamental freedoms may lodge a constitutional complaint against that decision and that, from the wording of section 62 of the Constitutional Court Act, the applicant had reason to believe that his constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court ’ s decision dismissing his request for extraordinary review of the County Court ’ s judgment was a remedy to be exhausted (see Dolenec, cited above, § 200). Therefore, the Court considers that the fact that the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgment of the Supreme Court cannot in any way be held against him, nor can the fact that he had previously lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgment of the Osijek County Court in any way impair his right to lodge a new constitutional complaint against the judgment of the Supreme Court and to wait for his constitutional complaint to be decided before bringing an application to the Court."

As to the additional documents submitted by the police, the Government argued that the Osijek Municipal Court had not relied on those documents in its judgment. Finally, the Government stressed that the State Attorney had also become aware of the expert witness ’ s written observations and the documents submitted by the police at the final hearing and that the prosecutor had therefore been in the same position as the applicant, which excluded the possibility of any violation of the principle of adversarial proceedings and of the equality of arms."

The right to a fair trial holds so prominent a place in a democratic society that there can be no justification for interpreting the guarantees of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention restrictively (see Moreira de Azevedo v. Portugal, 23 October 1990, § 66, Series A no. 189, and A.B. v. Slovakia, no. 41784/98, § 54, 4 March 2003 )."

The concept of a fair hearing implies, inter alia, the right to adversarial proceedings, according to which the parties must have the opportunity not only to make known any evidence needed for their claims to succeed, but also to have knowledge of, and comment on, all evidence adduced or observations filed, with a view to influencing the court ’ s decision (see Nideröst-Huber v. Switzerland, 18 February 1997, § 24, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I, and Mantovanelli v. France, 18 March 1997, § 33, Reports 1997 ‑ II ). In this respect, the Court notes that it is possible that a procedural situation which does not place a party at any disadvantage vis-à-vis his or her opponent still represents a violation of the right to adversarial proceedings if the party concerned did not have an opportunity to have knowledge of, and comment on, all evidence adduced or observations filed, with a view to influencing the court ’ s decision (see Krčmář and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 35376/97, § § 38-46, 3 March 2000 )."

The Court further reiterates that Article 6 § 3 ( b) guarantees the accused “adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence” and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on his behalf may comprise everything which is “necessary” to prepare the main trial. The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the ability to put all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings (see Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 78, 20 January 2005; Connolly v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 27245/95, 26 June 1996; Can v.

When assessing whether the accused had adequate time for the preparation of his defence, particular regard has to be had to the nature of the proceedings, as well as the complexity of the case and stage of the proceedings (see X. v. Belgium, no. 7628/76, Commission decision of 9 May 1977, Decisions and Reports (DR) 9, p. 172, and Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium, 10 February 1983, § 41, Series A no. 58 )."

These requests were granted and the police were ordered to submit the documents concerned.

The Court also notes that the applicant ’ s lawyer expressly asked for an adjournment of the hearing for a short period of time so that he could study the documents and prepare a response.

Having in mind the actions taken by the trial court, namely the fact that it had twice ordered the police to submit the documents in question, the Court has to conclude that the information held by the police was of relevance for the case and capable of influencing the outcome of the proceedings. In respect of such information, the trial court was obliged to secure the accused an opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and to put all his relevant arguments to it without restriction (see, Moiseyev, cited above, § 220). However, the Court is not satisfied that the reading out of the documents at the final hearing together with other evidence was sufficient to satisfy this requirement. In this respect, the Court recalls that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective; this is particularly so in respect of the rights of the defence in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial, from which they derive (see Artico v.

The Court ’ s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, cited above, § 50). In particular, “as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce ... Article 6 § 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses” (see Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, pp. 32-33, § 33, Series A no. 235 ‑ B ). It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, § 29, ECHR 2003-V )."

The Court further notes that the applicant asked the trial court to hear these witnesses to confirm his alleged detention in the period between January and mid-February 2006. However, charges against the applicant concerned the period between 10 August 2005 and 13 December 2005 and also 24 April 2006, in view of which the Court can accept the national court ’ s opinion as to the probative value of these witnesses for the establishment of the truth in this case.

The Court recalls that an accused’s right to communicate with his defence counsel out of hearing of a third person is part of the basic requirements of a fair trial in a democratic society and follows from Article 6 § 3 of the Convention. If a lawyer were unable to confer with his client and receive confidential instructions from him without surveillance, his assistance would loose much of its usefulness, whereas the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective (S. v. Switzerland judgment of 28 November 1991, Series A no. 220, p. 16, § 48). In the latter case the Court noted that the risk of collusion merits consideration, however the possibility of several defence counsel collaborating with a view to co-ordinating their defence strategy was not sufficient to restrict the accused’s rights of defence (loc. cit., p. 16, § 49)."

This was so in the case of Kempers v. Austria where the applicant was suspected of being the member of a gang and utmost confidentiality was necessary in order to catch the other members (No. 21842/93, Kempers v. Austria, Dec. 27.2.97, unpublished). In the present case such extraordinary features cannot be made out. The Court finds that the domestic courts essentially relied on a risk of collusion, but this was the very reason for which detention on remand had already been ordered. The restriction on contacts with defence counsel for a person who is already placed in detention on remand is an additional measure which requires further arguments. The Court cannot find that the Austrian courts or the Government have furnished convincing arguments in this respect."

As regards the complaint about the surveillance of the applicant’s contacts with counsel, the Review Chamber found the Investigating Judge’s decision to be correct. This order did not involve any criticism of counsel or any reproach of conduct contrary to law or the disciplinary rules of the members of the bar, but merely had the purpose of preventing any contact whatsoever with third persons in order not to endanger the success of the criminal investigation. The present case concerned the complicated business relations of the SDBV and several other companies managed by the applicant, and the flow of money between them.

The applicant had therefore the opportunity to reply to the submissions made by the Public Prosecutor at the hearing. As regards appeal proceedings on such issues before the Court of Appeal, the Government submit that the standard phrase in the introduction to decisions taken by the Court of Appeal - “after having heard the Senior Public Prosecutor” - only meant that the Senior Public Prosecutor had taken note of an appeal. It did not imply that he or she had participated in the deliberations of the Court of Appeal or actually made submissions. However, even if a Senior Public Prosecutor makes written submissions to a Court of Appeal, the failure to serve them on a detainee does not violate Article 5 § 4 of the Convention as proceedings under this provision need not offer the same procedural guarantees as proceedings under Article 6 of the Convention. In particular, such a step is unnecessary if, like in the present case, those submissions contain no new aspects (see No. 20055/92, Moser v. Austria, Dec. 13.4.94, unpublished)."

The domestic court dealing with such matters must provide the “guarantees of a judicial procedure”. The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties - the prosecutor and the detainee ( Grauzinis v. Lithuania, no. 37975/97, § 31, 10.10.2000)."

These requirements are derived from the right to an adversarial trial as laid down in Article 6 of the Convention, which means, in a criminal case, that both the prosecution and the defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. According to the Court’s case-law, it follows from the wording of Article 6 – and particularly from the autonomous meaning to be given to the notion of “criminal charge” – that this provision has some application to pre-trial proceedings (Imbrioscia v. Switzerland judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, p. 13, § 36). It thus follows that, in view of the dramatic impact of deprivation of liberty on the fundamental rights of the person concerned, proceedings conducted under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention should in principle also meet, to the largest extent possible under the circumstances of an on-going investigation, the basic requirements of a fair trial, such as the right to an adversarial procedure. While national law may satisfy this requirement in various ways, whatever method is chosen should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment thereon (see, mutatis mutandis, Brandstetter v. Austria judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 211, p. 27, § 67 and Garcia Alva v. Germany, no. 23541/94, § 39, 13.2.2001)."

Lithuania, no. 34578/97, § 100, ECHR 2000-IX). Nevertheless, a State which sets up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of applications for release from detention must in principle accord to the detainee the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (Toth v.

Austria where the applicant was suspected of being the member of a gang and utmost confidentiality was necessary in order to catch the other members (No. 21842/93, Kempers v.

Thus, Article 6 – especially paragraph 3 thereof – may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and in so far as the fairness of the trial is liable to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions. As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention is one element, among others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in Article 6 § 1 (see Imbrioscia v.

                "“The first accused, Ivan Dvorski, confessed to the criminal offences of robbery, aggravated murder of Ɖ. V., M. Š. and B.V. ..., exactly as is stated in the operative part of this judgment, to the police and in the presence of a defence lawyer. He later tried to contest that statement, claiming that he had not instructed the defence lawyer, M.R., that he had told the police officers that he wanted G.M. as his lawyer, that at the time he had been taken to the police station he had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and so on. However, this defence is not acceptable. The written record of arrest shows that Ivan Dvorski was arrested on 14 March 2007 at 9.50 a.m. at the Rijeka Police Station, and [M.]R., in favour of whom Ivan Dvorski signed the power of attorney, came to the police station on 14 March 2007 at 7.45 p.m. The written record of the questioning of the then suspect Ivan Dvorski shows that M.R. was informed at 6.15 p.m. and that the questioning started at 8.10 p.m. Besides the officers of the Rijeka Police, a typist and the defence lawyer of the then suspect Ivan Dvorski, the County State Attorney was also present during the questioning. The introductory part of the written record [indicates] that the then suspect Ivan Dvorski clearly stated that he had chosen and authorised M.R. to act as his defence lawyer and had consulted with him, after which he decided to give his statement. The written record is properly signed by the persons present. The first accused Ivan Dvorski had read the written record before signing it. Thus, the above shows without doubt that the contentions of Ivan Dvorski that he had not retained M.R. as his lawyer are unfounded. During the trial, at the request of Ivan Dvorski’s defence, a handwriting expert gave her opinion regarding the signature of Ivan Dvorski on the written record of his questioning by the police. The expert opinion proved beyond any doubt that the contested signature was that of Ivan Dvorski. The panel accepts such findings in their entirety; the findings were further explained at a hearing by the expert Lj.Z. Her findings were given in an objective, impartial and professional manner. Therefore, the questioning of Ivan Dvorski by the police was carried out in compliance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

Nobody, including [Ivan Dvorski’s] defence lawyer who was present during the police questioning – [M.]R. – has alleged any unlawful extraction of a confession and there is no indication of this in the record of the statement given by Ivan Dvorski, [who] at the time [was] only a suspect.”"

The applicant also referred to the request for the removal of the Rijeka County State Attorney and all his deputies lodged by G.M. on 16 March 2007, highlighting the part of that request which stated that he had been denied food during his detention in police custody.

When the first accused was brought to the Rijeka Police Station his defence rights were seriously infringed. However, during the trial this infringement was ignored. On 14 March 2007, the first accused’s mother and then also his now late father retained G.M. as his defence lawyer before the police, after he had been arrested. However, G.M. was not allowed access to the accused, and subsequently informed the relevant authorities thereof, but they ignored this. G.M. therefore lodged an action in the Rijeka Municipal Court in respect of an unlawful act, as well as a request for the removal of the Rijeka County State Attorney and all his deputies. In that request he alleged that the first accused had not been given any food by the police from 13 March 2007 at 1 p.m., when he had been brought to the Rijeka Police Station, until he had agreed to be represented by M.R. on 14 March at about 7 p.m. so as to give a self-incriminating statement, which was in violation of Article 225 § 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

He was arrested the next day, as found by the first-instance court. However, it is not true that M.R. came to the police station at 6.45 p.m.: he came at 7.45 p.m., which shows that the allegations of the first accused are true.

That court pointed out that the record of the applicant’s statement suggested that he had chosen M.R. to represent him during police questioning and that M.R. had provided him with adequate legal advice. The Supreme Court also noted that there was nothing in the case file to indicate that the applicant had been ill-treated or forced to confess. The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows.",
                "“The appellant erroneously argues that the first-instance court committed a grave breach of criminal procedure, contrary to Article 367 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in basing his conviction on the statement he gave to the police in the presence of a defence lawyer, which [in the appellant’s view] constitutes unlawfully obtained evidence for the purposes of Article 9 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and that the record of his questioning as a suspect by the police (in the presence of a defence lawyer) should thus have been excluded from the case file. In so doing, the appellant challenges the reasoning of the second-instance judgment to the effect that the lawfulness of the evidence was not affected by the appellant’s arguments that during his apprehension and arrest he had not been given food until he had agreed to be represented by M.R. These arguments of the appellant were refuted by the second-instance court on the basis of all the formally established information contained in the record of [his] questioning in the presence of a lawyer on 14 March 2007.",
                "This Court notes that [the complaint] regarding the question of the presence of a lawyer [during the questioning], as a legal requirement for the lawfulness of evidence obtained in this way during the police investigation, relates to two objections. The first objection concerns the restriction of access to the lawyer of [the defendant’s] own choosing, and the second objection relates to the pressure exerted on the suspect through the denial of food (Article 225 § 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), which, according to the appeal, eventually made him accept legal representation by the lawyer imposed on him, M.R., although his parents had already engaged the services of G.M. on the morning of 14 March 2007.",
                "It is to be noted that during the police criminal investigation a number of persons with a background of drug abuse, and with links to the victim Đ.V., were arrested, in particular from the neighbourhood of Gornja Vežica, and it was in the course of this action that the accused, Ivan Dvorski, was also apprehended. Only when a probable cause was established that the accused could have been the perpetrator of the offences in issue was he arrested on 14 March 2007 at 9.50 a.m.",
                "At the same time the father of the accused, who was in Croatia, whereas the accused’s mother was in Italy, was informed [of the arrest] by the police at 2.10 p.m., which shows that from that moment the father of the accused (after a telephone conversation with his mother) could have engaged the services of a lawyer for the accused, for which he would most certainly have needed some time. In such circumstances, this Court finds that the parents of the accused could not have already signed a power of attorney for the lawyer of the accused’s choice by 1.30 p.m. on the day in question.",
                "The other information from the record of the accused’s arrest and from the record of his questioning by the police shows that on 14 March 2007, as is indicated by the record of the arrest, the accused was brought to the Rijeka Police Station and, as is apparent from the record of Ivan Dvorski’s questioning by the police, the defence lawyer, M.R., was informed at 6.15 p.m. and came to the police station at 7.45 p.m. The questioning itself commenced at 8.10 p.m. and ended at 11 p.m., with a break between 10.35 p.m. and 10.38 p.m.",
                "It should be emphasised that in the introductory part of the record [of his questioning] the suspect, Ivan Dvorski, expressly stated that he had chosen M.R. as his defence lawyer and had signed the power of attorney in favour of him, and the record of the questioning shows that the defence lawyer had almost half an hour for consultation with the suspect before the questioning, in which time he was able to advise him of his rights.",
                "Thus, the relevant fact which follows from the formal procedural action described in the record of the suspect’s questioning is that the chosen lawyer came at least half an hour before the questioning commenced, and in the consultation with [the suspect] before the questioning he was able to give [the suspect] genuine legal advice as his chosen lawyer.",
                "It should also be noted that the essence of the suspect’s right to have a lawyer present during his questioning by the police lies in the necessity for legal protection of his rights, which is why the beginning, conduct and end of this formal [procedural] action is fully registered in the record [of the questioning].",
                "This is why all arguments to the contrary, as set out in the appeal against the second-instance judgment, and particularly those relating to the need to question G.M. as the second concurrent lawyer of [the suspect’s] choosing, have no support in the content of the formal record of the suspect’s questioning of 14 March 2007, because the record contains formally registered information regarding the contact with the chosen lawyer, the time the chosen lawyer came into the Rijeka Police Station, the time the questioning of the suspect commenced, the period in which a short break took place, and the time the procedural action finished, all of which was confirmed by the suspect and the defence lawyer of his choosing by signing the record without any objections as to its content.",
                "However, irrespective of the fact that the defence of the accused in the context of police questioning formally satisfied the requirements of Article 177 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the general thrust of the defence, as well as the substance of the defence as regards particular acts, and the confession, were provided voluntarily by the suspect, and his chosen lawyer was most certainly unable to have any influence on this, which at the same time rules out the possibility of any mental pressure being exerted on the suspect, as well as his subsequent arguments regarding the lawyer having been imposed on him during the police investigation. On the contrary, the suspect’s defence rights were fully secured, as required under the Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure.",
                "There is therefore no breach of Article 367 § 2 in conjunction with Article 9 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The refusal of the request to have the record of the suspect’s questioning by the police in the presence of a lawyer of his choosing excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence does not constitute a breach of his defence rights because the record of the suspect’s questioning by the police clearly and undoubtedly shows that the lawyer who was present [during the questioning] was the lawyer of the suspect’s free choice, and this also follows from the signed power of attorney in favour of the lawyer in question, who protected the suspect’s rights during the questioning. Accordingly, the refusal of the defence’s request did not have any bearing on the lawfulness and correctness of the judgment. At the same time, it was not necessary to question the new chosen lawyer as a witness and, for the reasons set out above, the facts of the case were not insufficiently or erroneously established, as was argued in the defendant’s appeal against the second-instance judgment.”"

This right should apply not only to criminal suspects but also to anyone who is under a legal obligation to attend – and stay at – a police establishment. If necessary, the law should be amended. Naturally, the fact that a detained person has stated that he wishes to have access to a lawyer should not prevent the police from beginning to question/interview him on urgent matters before the lawyer arrives.

In addition, in some cases, detained persons expressed scepticism about ex officio lawyers ’ independence from the police.

The Court reiterates that, even if the primary purpose of Article 6 of the Convention, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, is to ensure a fair trial by a “tribunal” competent to determine “any criminal charge”, it does not follow that the Article has no application to pre-trial proceedings. Thus, Article 6 – especially paragraph 3 thereof – may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and in so far as the fairness of the trial is liable to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions. As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention is one element, among others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in Article 6 § 1 (see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, §§ 36-37, Series A no. 275, and Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, § 50, ECHR 2008)."

The Court has held that, in order to exercise his right of defence, the accused should normally be allowed to have the effective benefit of the assistance of a lawyer from the initial stages of the proceedings because national laws may attach consequences to the attitude of an accused at the initial stages of police interrogation which are decisive for the prospects of the defence in any subsequent criminal proceedings (see Salduz, cited above, § 52). The Court has also recognised that an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, and in most cases this can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer, whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure that the right of an accused not to incriminate himself is respected (ibid., § 54; see also Pavlenko v. Russia, no. 42371/02, § 101, 1 April 2010)."

In such circumstances, the Court considers it important that from the initial stages of the proceedings a person charged with a criminal offence who does not wish to defend himself in person must be able to have recourse to legal assistance of his own choosing (for more detailed reasoning, see Martin v. Estonia, no. 35985/09, § § 90 and 93, 30 May 2013 ). This follows from the very wording of Article 6 § 3 (c), which guarantees that “[e]veryone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: ... to defend himself ... through legal assistance of his own choosing ...”, and is generally recognised in international human rights standards as a mechanism for securing an effective defence to the accused. The Court emphasises that the fairness of proceedings requires that an accused should be able to obtain the whole range of services specifically associated with legal assistance (see Dayanan v. Turkey, no. 7377/03, § 32, 13 October 2009, and paragraph 108 below)."

                "79. Notwithstanding the importance of the relationship of confidence between a lawyer and his client, this right is not absolute. It is necessarily subject to certain limitations where free legal aid is concerned and also where it is for the courts to decide whether the interests of justice require that the accused be defended by counsel appointed by them ( see Croissant v. Germany, 25 September 1992, § 29, Series A no. 237-B ). The Court has consistently held that the national authorities must have regard to the defendant’s wishes as to his or her choice of legal representation, but may override those wishes when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice (ibid., § 29; see also Meftah and Others v. France [GC], nos. 32911/96 and 2 others, § 45, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII; Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 66, 20 January 2005; Klimentyev v. Russia, no. 46503/99, § 116, 16 November 2006; Vitan v.

Where such grounds are lacking, a restriction on the free choice of defence counsel would entail a violation of Article 6 § 1 together with paragraph 3 (c) if it adversely affected the applicant’s defence, regard being had to the proceedings as a whole (see Croissant, cited above, § 31; see also Meftah and Others, cited above, §§ 46-47; Vitan, cited above, §§ 58-64; Zagorodniy, cited above, §§ 53-55; and Martin, cited above, §§ 90-97)."

Moreover, having regard to the considerations mentioned above, as the Court affirmed in its judgment in Salduz, in order for the right to a fair trial to remain “practical and effective”, Article 6 § 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such a restriction – whatever its justification – must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz, cited above, § 55-57; see also Panovits v. Cyprus, no. 4268/04, § 66, 11 December 2008)."

Unlike in Salduz, where the accused, who was being held in custody, had been denied access to a lawyer during police questioning, the present case concerns a situation where the applicant was afforded access to a lawyer from his first interrogation, but not – according to his complaint – a lawyer of his own choosing. In contrast to the cases involving denial of access, the more lenient requirement of “relevant and sufficient” reasons has been applied in situations raising the less serious issue of “denial of choice”. In such cases the Court’s task will be to assess whether, in the light of the proceedings as a whole, the rights of the defence have been “adversely affected” to such an extent as to undermine their overall fairness (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, § 31; Klimentyev, cited above, §§ 117-18; and Martin, cited above, §§ 96-97 )."

Against the above background, the Court considers that the first step should be to assess whether it has been demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for overriding or obstructing the defendant’s wish as to his or her choice of legal representation. Where no such reasons exist, the Court should proceed to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings. In making its assessment, the Court may have regard to a variety of factors, including the nature of the proceedings and the application of certain professional requirements (see Meftah and Others, cited above, §§ 45-48, and Martin, cited above, § 90); the circumstances surrounding the designation of counsel and the existence of opportunities for challenging this (ibid., §§ 90-97); the effectiveness of counsel’s assistance (see Croissant, cited above § 31, and Vitan, cited above, §§ 58-64 ); whether the accused’s privilege against self-incrimination has been respected (see Martin, cited above, § 90); the accused’s age (ibid., § 92); and the trial court’s use of any statements given by the accused at the material time (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, § 31; Klimentyev, cited above, §§ 117-18; and Martin, cited above, §§ 94-95 ). It is further mindful that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory (see, among many other authorities, Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 24, Series A no. 32; Imbrioscia, cited above, § 38; Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, § 30, Series A no. 76; and Salduz, cited above, § 55) and that in determining Convention rights one must frequently look beyond appearances and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see, inter alia, Delcourt v. Belgium, 17 January 1970, § 31, Series A no. 11; De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, 22 May 1984, § 48, Series A no. 77; Pavlenko, cited above, § 112; and Erkapić v. Croatia, no. 51198/08, §§ 80 ‑ 82, 25 April 2013 ). In cases where the accused had no legal representation, the Court also takes into consideration the opportunity given to the accused to challenge the authenticity of evidence and to oppose its use (see Panovits, cited above, § 82), whether the accused is in custody (see Salduz, cited above, § 60); whether such statements constituted a significant element on which the conviction was based and the strength of the other evidence in the case (see Salduz, cited above, § 57, and Panovits, cited above, §§ 76 and 82).",

It is also true that the trial court viewed his statement in the light of the complex body of evidence before it (compare Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, § 103, 10 March 2009). Specifically, in convicting the applicant, the trial court relied on the statements of a number of witnesses cross-examined during the trial, numerous expert reports and the records of the crime-scene investigation and searches and seizures, as well as relevant photographs and other physical evidence. In addition, the trial court had at its disposal the confessions made by the applicant’s co-accused at the trial, and neither the applicant nor his co-accused ever argued that any of their rights had been infringed when they had made those statements."

As to the manner in which M.R. was chosen to represent the applicant, the Court refers to Article 177 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which requires that an accused should first be invited to instruct a lawyer of his or her own choosing (see paragraph 60 above). Only where the lawyer initially chosen by a suspect is unable to attend police questioning within a certain period of time should a replacement lawyer be chosen from the list of duty lawyers provided to the competent police authority by the county branches of the Croatian Bar Association. However, there is no conclusive evidence in the documents submitted to the Court as to whether these procedures were followed in the applicant’s case. The Court finds it unfortunate that the procedures used and decisions taken were not properly documented so as to avoid any doubts raised about undue pressure in respect of the choice of lawyer (see, mutatis mutandis, Martin, cited above, § 90, and Horvatić v.

There is no indication of the exact time the applicant and M.R. actually commenced the consultation, nor is there any explanation of why that information was not provided in the record of the questioning. The Court notes also that the statement from D.H., the Rijeka County State Attorney, indicates that M.R. talked to the applicant in private for about ten minutes (see paragraph 26 above). The judgment of the Rijeka County Court indicates that M.R. came to the police station at 7.45 p.m. and that the questioning started at 8.10 p.m. (see paragraph 51 above). This was confirmed in the judgment of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 55 above). In the Court’s view, without speculating as to the effectiveness of the legal assistance provided by M.R., this period appears to have been relatively short, bearing in mind the scope and seriousness of the accusations, involving three counts of aggravated murder and further counts of armed robbery and arson. Regard should also be had in this context to the requirement in Article 6 § 3 (b) that an accused should be afforded adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his or her defence."

The fairness of proceedings requires that an accused should be able to obtain the whole range of services specifically associated with legal assistance. In this regard, counsel has to be able to secure without restriction the fundamental aspects of that person’s defence: discussion of the case, organisation of the defence, collection of evidence favourable to the accused, preparation for questioning, support for an accused in distress and checking of the conditions of detention (see Dayanan, cited above, § 32 )."

However, the reasoning employed by the national courts in the present case in relation to the legal challenge mounted by the applicant concerning the manner in which his confession had been obtained by the police was far from substantial. Neither the trial court nor the investigating judge nor any other national authority took any steps to obtain evidence from G.M. or the police officers involved in order to establish the relevant circumstances surrounding G.M.’s visit to Rijeka Police Station on 14 March 2007 in connection with the applicant’s questioning by the police.

In determining whether, taking the criminal proceedings as a whole, the applicant received the benefit of a “fair hearing” for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, the Court must have regard to the actions of the police in effectively preventing the applicant, at the very outset of the investigation, from having access to the lawyer chosen by his family and from freely choosing his own lawyer, and to the consequences of the conduct of the police for the subsequent proceedings. In the abstract, if a suspect receives the assistance of a qualified lawyer, who is bound by professional ethics, rather than another lawyer whom he or she might have preferred to appoint, this is not in itself sufficient to show that the whole trial was unfair – subject to the proviso that there is no evidence of manifest incompetence or bias (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37). In the instant case, it can be presumed that the consequence of the police’s conduct was that in his very first statement to the police, instead of remaining silent, as he could have done, the applicant made a confession, which was subsequently admitted in evidence against him. It is also significant that during the investigation and ensuing trial the applicant did not subsequently rely on his confession, save by way of mitigation in relation to the sentence, but took the first opportunity, before the investigating judge, to contest the manner in which the confession had been obtained from him by the police (see paragraphs 23-24, 31, 48, 52 and 54 above). Although there was other evidence against him, the significant likely impact of his initial confession on the further development of the criminal proceedings against him cannot be ignored by the Court. In sum, in the Court’s view, the objective consequence of the police’s conduct in preventing the lawyer chosen by the applicant’s family from having access to him was such as to undermine the fairness of the subsequent criminal proceedings in so far as the applicant’s incriminating initial statement was admitted in evidence."

A waiver of the right, once invoked, must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right (see Pishchalnikov v. Russia, no. 7025/04, § 77, 24 September 2009)."

The right to defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz, cited above, § 55). Under the Court ’ s case-law, a person acquires the status of a suspect calling for the application of the Article 6 safeguards not when it is formally assigned to him or her, but when the domestic authorities have plausible reasons for suspecting that person ’ s involvement in a criminal offence (see Brusco v.

On an unspecified date between 4 and 8 July 2006 the police questioned the applicant as a witness and he provided an account of his actions on that morning. However, the statements of the taxi drivers and the applicant ’ s own conduct at the taxi stand (see paragraph 9 above) casted serious doubt on the truthfulness of that account. On 8 July 200 6, after the questioning and the visit to the taxi stand, the applicant was detained and placed in a cell in connection with a certain “ offence of minor public disorder ”. The case file does not contain any material which would allow the Court to establish what the nature of this offence was (see paragraph 10 above)."

The Court considers that the fact that the applicant was the last person with whom K. had been seen before her disappearance combined with the fact that the taxi drivers refuted his statements regarding the morning on 28 June 2006 (see paragraph 6 8 above) threw a serious suspicion on the applicant. Looking beyond the appearances and concentrating on the realities of the situation, the Court finds that after the visit to the taxi stand, which took place between 4 and 8 July 2006, the police received strong reasons to suspect the applicant ’ s involvement into K. ’ s disappearance and on 8 July 2006 placed him in detention to ensure his availability for questioning as a criminal suspect ( see Rudnichenko v.

On 10 July 2006, when G. opened a criminal case against the applicant and arrested him on suspicion of murder, robbery and rape, his legal representation became mandatory under Article 45 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 4 1 above). However, between 8 and 10 July 2006 I., F., and G. questioned the applicant and made him participate in the reconstruction of events without a lawyer being present. From the material in the case file it does not follow that there were any, let alone compelling, reasons for not assigning a lawyer to the applicant as early as on 8 July 2006. The Court therefore considers that his right to legal assistance was restricted on this account."

Being questioned again in a lawyer ’ s presence on 9 September and 16 November 2006 the applicant slightly modified his account of the circumstances surrounding K. ’ s death (see paragraphs 2 4 and 29 above).

When deciding whether the admission of a statement made without legal assistance was compatible with Article 6, the Court should examine, in particular, whether the statement was promptly retracted and the admissions made in it consistently denied, particularly once legal advice had been obtained. The Court reiterates that in Bandaletov v. Ukraine (no. 23180/06, § 67, 31 October 2013) which concerned lack of access to a lawyer at the early stages of criminal proceedings, no violation of Article 6 §§ 1, 3 (c) of the Convention was found having regard, inter alia, to the fact that when being legally represented the applicant maintained the statements which he had earlier made in the absence of a lawyer. In the case Titarenko v. Ukraine (no. 31720/02, 20 September 2012) the Court found a violation of Article 6 §§ 1, 3 (c) of the Convention having regard, inter alia, to the fact, that as soon as the applicant became legally represented, he retracted the confessions which he had earlier made without a lawyer being present."

The Court is of the opinion that in the present case the statements which the applicant made without a lawyer on 10 July 2006 predetermined all the statements which he could make later. In particular, on 10 July 2006 the applicant incriminated himself not only by saying that he had robbed, raped and killed K., but also by showing the crime scene to the police which immediately inspected it and collected physical evidence. The Court accepts that after the applicant became legally represented, theoretically speaking, it was open for him to say that he had not robbed, killed and raped K. It is, however, difficult to see how it would be possible for him to retract the statement concerning location of the crime scene after it had been actually found and inspected by the police. In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that the absence of legal assistance on 10 July 2006 could not be remedied by the fact that subsequently the applicant was legally represented and repeated his self-incriminating statements in the presence of a lawyer."

Article 97 specifies that a person has the right to legal assistance from the moment of his or her detention or the moment when charges are brought against him or her. Article 94 stipulates that the participation of a defence lawyer is mandatory where, inter alia, the case concerns an offence punishable by at least ten years of imprisonment; in such a case, the competent body is required to appoint such a lawyer. Article 55 of the Code, applicable after charges have been brought, lists in detail the rights of the accused, which include the right to legal assistance and to have the defence lawyer present during the implementation of all investigative measures; the right to make statements on the charges ( обяснения ) or to remain silent; the right to present evidence, to consult the case file and to make objections; the right to participate in the criminal proceedings; and the right to appeal against any decision affecting his rights and interests."

These include persons who have participated in the criminal proceedings in another procedural quality, apart from the co-accused, the victim, the civil claimant or civil defendant and any private prosecuting party, and officers of the Ministry of the Interior who have participated in a search and seizure procedure, a reconstruction of an accident or an identity parade (paragraph 1). In addition, investigating bodies which have carried out an investigative action cannot give witness testimony about that action, even if the record taken of the action does not meet the statutory requirements (paragraph 2). Whether police officers who have questioned a suspect informally may later testify as to the content of the statements made by that suspect is an issue which has been addressed by the Supreme Court of Cassation under Article 118 § 2 or Article 115 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 29 above), and has been given conflicting answers. In some cases the Supreme Court has held that such police officers are not investigating bodies within the meaning of Article 118 § 2, and are thus not prevented from giving testimony in the ensuing criminal proceedings (for example, Решение № 486 от 10.03.2015 г. на ВКС по н.д. № 1406/2014 г., I н. о., also referred to in paragraph 40 below). In other decisions the result was the opposite, with the Supreme Court of Cassation analysing the matter from the point of view of Article 115 and not Article 118 § 2, and holding that such testimony was inadmissible as the rights of the suspect had been violated (for example, Решение № 391 от 25.10.2013 г. на ВКС по н.д. № 1220/2013 г., III н. о ., also referred to in paragraph 48 below).",

In addition, he stated that his confession as recounted by the officers had been made under duress, and submitted that he had not reiterated that confession after he had been taken to an investigator (see paragraphs 18, 22 and 24 above). While, indeed, the applicant did not expressly state that he had not been assisted by a lawyer when he had confessed to Officers Z.K. and V.V., the Court is of the view that his complaint has been made in substance before the domestic courts. It notes in this respect that the relevant issue, namely whether the testimony of the two police officers recounting the applicant ’ s confession was admissible evidence, has always been considered by the domestic courts as an issue within the whole framework of the domestic rules of criminal procedure. These rules contain strict standards applicable to the authorities who have the powers to take statements from a suspect, and the taking of such a statement is linked to the bringing of charges against a suspect, informing them of the charges and their rights and providing them with a lawyer. Thus, the question of whether the testimony of the two police officers was admissible evidence and whether they were prohibited from giving evidence under Article 118 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was directly linked to the question of whether the applicant ’ s confession was collected without violating the rights of the accused to remain silent and his right to a lawyer."

The Court notes in that regard that the applicant was questioned by the police officers investigating the murder outside the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure. Further, after his confession to the two police officers, the investigating authorities proceeded with charging him and putting him on pre-trial detention on an unrelated minor crime (see paragraph 13 above). It was only six months later that the applicant was charged with the murder and questioned in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 14 above).

In the case at hand, there is no dispute that the applicant ’ s confession as such could not have been used as evidence in the trial, as it was not obtained in accordance with the requirements of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The confession was not made before a competent body (a prosecutor, an investigator or a court – see paragraph 29 above), which could take a statement from a suspect only after providing them with their full rights, including the right to a lawyer. Since the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the exclusion of evidence collected in a manner incompatible with its rules (see paragraph 28 above), the confession could not be included in the body of probative evidence.

The applicant did not repeat the confession made in front of Officers Z.K. and V.V. during his subsequent interviews with the prosecuting authorities (see paragraph 14 above).

This is even more relevant in the light of the fact that the body of evidence examined at the trial also contained exonerating evidence, but on balance the national courts found that the accusations had nevertheless been proved (see paragraph 23 above)."

Police officer G. had obtained the applicant ’ s statement of his surrender and confession as a result of the applicant ’ s free will.

The applicant ’ s counsel maintained before the trial court that the applicant ’ s statement of his surrender and confession, which he had retracted on the following day when questioned for the first time in the presence of a lawyer, should be declared inadmissible evidence. She noted that investigator A. had drawn up the record of the applicant ’ s arrest as a suspect on 26 August 2005. However, for unknown reasons she had not questioned him as a suspect on the same day. Instead, the police officers had obtained the statement of his surrender and confession on their own initiative, without any such instruction from the investigator. They had done so using psychological and physical coercion, as confirmed, inter alia, by the statements of Zh. and the applicant ’ s wife (see paragraphs 2 9 and 3 1 above), the certificate from detention facility IZ-11/2 (see paragraph 16 above) and the forensic medical expert report of 7 September 2005 (see paragraph 19 above). Furthermore, his confession statement had been obtained in the absence of a lawyer. Under Article 142 § 1 of the CCrP, a statement of one ’ s surrender and confession was meant to be voluntary. Therefore, if obtained from a person arrested on suspicion of having committed a crime, any such statement should be subjected to particular scrutiny. Its voluntary nature was ensured through procedural guarantees under Articles 46 ( “The suspect ” ) and 51 ( “ Compulsory participation of counsel for the defence” ) of the CCrP. Otherwise, such a confession statement should be declared inadmissible evidence in accordance with Article 75 § 2 (1) of the CCrP."

According to the roles agreed on between them, the applicant had remained on guard in his car outside the commercial centre, while B. and Zh. had entered while the centre was still open and had hidden there. During the night they had attacked a woman guard and tied her up. Then they had forced locks and stolen property, in particular jewellery and mobile phones.

In sentencing the applicant the Town Court took into account information about his personality, in particular that he had received positive character references from his places of residence and employment, and that he had no criminal or administrative offences record. It considered his statement of surrender and confession, the fact that he had two minor children and that he had voluntarily surrendered the stolen gold jewellery, as well as his health condition, as mitigating circumstances. B. and Zh. were convicted of robbery with the use of violence and sentenced to nine years ’ and eight and a half years ’ imprisonment respectively. The Town Court granted the victims ’ civil actions and ordered the applicant and his co-defendants to pay 396,800 Russian roubles (RUB) jointly in respect of pecuniary damage.

It held, in particular, that the statement had been obtained in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure. Under Article 142 § 1 of that Code, a statement of surrender and confession was a voluntary statement by a person about a crime committed by him. It had not therefore been necessary to have an instruction from an investigator in order to obtain it. The law did not provide for any additional requirements to such a statement, save that the individual concerned was to be warned of his or her criminal responsibility for deliberately giving false information. Therefore, the absence of a lawyer had not rendered the statement unlawful and had not violated the applicant ’ s right to defend himself.

They had all denied any wrongdoing. It had been established that, having written his confession, the applicant had suddenly jumped to his feet and hit his head against a wall. The Supreme Court also referred to the most recent decision by the investigative authority, dated 1 April 2007, by which the criminal proceedings against the police officers had been terminated (see paragraph 26 above), and to the results of the internal police inquiry dismissing the applicant ’ s allegations of ill ‑ treatment (see paragraph 37 above).

                "Under the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the right in question [under Article 48 § 2 of the Constitution] is directly applicable and the assistance of (defence) counsel does not depend on the formal recognition of the individual as a suspect or an accused person. Nor does it depend on the moment when any procedural act by an investigation authority, inquiry authority or a prosecutor ’ s office is carried out; furthermore, the Constitution of the Russian Federation does not empower the federal legislature to impose restrictive conditions on the exercise of this right.",
                "Article 48 § 2 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation clearly specifies the essential characteristics of an individual who actually needs legal assistance because his constitutional rights, primarily the right to liberty and security of the person, are restricted, including in the case of criminal prosecution seeking to establish his guilt. Thus, the constitutional right to have the assistance of (defence) counsel extends to the individual from the moment of actual restriction of his rights.",
                "Within the literal meaning of the provisions enshrined in Articles 2, 45 and 48 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the right to qualified legal assistance is guaranteed to any person, irrespective of his or her formal status in the proceedings and whether or not he or she is officially declared to be detained or under suspicion, if duly authorised authorities have subjected the person to measures that actually restrict the individual ’ s liberty and security of person, including freedom of movement. These measures involve keeping a person in custody by officials, forcibly bringing or delivering him or her to the inquiry or investigation office, holding incommunicado, and any other actions that significantly restrict the liberty and security of the person.",
                "Insofar as the constitutional right to have the assistance of (defence) counsel may not be restricted by federal law, terms such as ‘ detained ’, ‘ accused ’ and ‘ bringing charges ’ are to be construed within their constitutional meaning rather than within the more narrow meaning ascribed to them in the Code of Criminal Procedure of the RSFSR. Ensuring the exercise of this constitutional right necessitates consideration of both the status in proceedings and the actual situation of the person facing public criminal prosecution. Moreover, the very fact of criminal prosecution and, accordingly, accusatory activity undertaken against a particular person may be proven by a decision to institute criminal proceedings against the person, investigative actions in his or her regard (search, identification, interrogation, etc.), and other measures aiming at his exposure or indicating the existence of suspicions against him or her ( inter alia, by informing the individual, under Article 51 § 1 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, of the right not to incriminate himself or herself). In so far as these actions are intended to establish facts and circumstances proving the guilt of the prosecuted person, he or she should be given an immediate opportunity to seek assistance of (defence) counsel. This creates the conditions enabling him or her to properly understand his or her rights and responsibilities, any charges brought against him or her, and, consequently, to defend himself or herself effectively. These conditions also ensure that the evidence obtained during the investigation will not later be found inadmissible (Article 50 § 2 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation).",
                "Pursuant to Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, access to legal assistance is seen as an indispensable guarantee of the right to defence in case of criminal prosecution. These international instruments establish that everyone who is arrested or detained is to be informed promptly of the reasons for his arrest and any charge against him, is entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court, and is entitled to a fair and public hearing and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing.”",

It found that by providing for the right to legal assistance from the moment that the arrest record or the detention order was read out to the suspect, rather than from the moment of arrest as guaranteed by Article 48 of the Constitution, Article 47 § 1 made the exercise of the right to legal assistance dependent on the discretion of the prosecuting authorities.",

The constitutional right to legal assistance arose from the moment when the relevant person ’ s rights were actually restricted, for example when measures which effectively restricted his or her rights to liberty and security, including his or her freedom of movement, were undertaken by competent authorities ( decisions on inadmissibility no. 1280 ‑ O of 17 July 2012, no. 638-O of 20 March 2014, no. 1338-O of 24 June 2014, no. 2380 ‑ O of 23 October 2014 and no. 2787 ‑ O of 23 December 2014 with a reference to earlier decision no. 1522-O-O of 17 November 2009 ).

The investigative authority ’ s finding that the applicant had committed an act of self-harm was based on the account of events put forward by the police officers, notably G., who, in the applicant ’ s submissions, was the officer who had used physical violence against him, and K., who had allegedly been in the room with G. when the applicant ’ s injuries were sustained. The investigative authority ’ s failure to verify the two versions of the origin of the applicant ’ s injuries by using such investigative means as confrontations and identification parades, as pointed out repeatedly by the supervising authorities (see paragraphs 22 and 25 ‑ 26 above), casts doubt on the unconditional preference it gave to the police officers ’ version. Furthermore, the finding of self ‑ harm does not accord with the forensic medical expert ’ s conclusion as to the origin of the injuries, which excluded the possibility that the injuries could have been caused as a result of a fall, that is by a single impact from a flat surface, as was also noted by the supervising authority (see paragraph 22 above), and suggested that they could have been caused by blows from blunt hard objects with a limited contact surface.

The ill-treatment can be regarded as having caused the applicant, who was in a state of particular vulnerability, considerable fear, anguish and mental suffering and driven him to act against his will.

The prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings on the grounds that the applicant ’ s version of his ill ‑ treatment by the police officers, which was not excluded on the facts, could only be verified by way of a full investigation for which it was necessary to open a criminal case, given that there was sufficient information disclosing elements of a crime under Article 286 § 3 (a) of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 22 above). According to the prosecutor, the pre ‑ investigation inquiry had not reliably established the circumstances in which the applicant had sustained his injuries. In particular, it was not possible in the course of the pre ‑ investigation inquiry to carry out an identification parade, which would have enabled the applicant to identify the police officer who had assaulted him – even though the applicant “would most likely [have been] able to identify [ him ] ” – or a confrontation between them (ibid.)."

It is not possible to establish within the framework of a “pre ‑ investigation inquiry” the facts of a case, particularly the identity of persons who could have been responsible for the ill-treatment. A “pre ‑ investigation inquiry” alone is not capable of leading to the punishment of those responsible, since the opening of a criminal case and a criminal investigation are prerequisites for bringing charges against the alleged perpetrators, which may then be examined by a court. Confronted with numerous cases of this kind against Russia, the Court has held that it was bound to draw stronger inferences from the mere fact of the investigative authority ’ s refusal to open a criminal investigation into credible allegations of serious ill ‑ treatment in police custody. This was indicative of the State ’ s failure to comply with its obligation under Article 3 to carry out an effective investigation (see Lyapin v.

Hence, nothing can explain the three - month delay in commencing the criminal investigation into the applicant ’ s complaint. The Court considers that such a delay could not but have had an adverse impact on the investigation, undermining the investigative authority ’ s ability to secure the evidence concerning the alleged ill ‑ treatment (see Indelicato v.

There is no indication in the materials before the Court that even such obvious investigative measures as identification parades and confrontations, the importance of which was twice noted by the investigators ’ superiors, were conducted in the course of the investigation (see paragraphs 22 and 25 above). Equally, the forensic medical expert ’ s conclusion that the applicant ’ s injuries could not have been caused by a single impact from a flat surface, to which the investigative authority ’ s attention was drawn in the decision to open a criminal case (see paragraph 22 above), was ignored (see paragraph 26 above)."

The applicant was taken to the police station and interviewed by police officers about the circumstances of the crime. He was subjected to ill ‑ treatment (see paragraph 66 above) and confessed to having participated in the crime. His confession was documented by police officer G. in the statement recording his surrender and confession. That record states that the applicant had been informed of Article 51 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation (see paragraph 10 above). Once given access to a lawyer on the following day during his first questioning as a suspect by the investigator, the applicant retracted his confession statement, asserting that it had been given as a result of his ill ‑ treatment by the police officers. He consistently repudiated his confession throughout the ensuing proceedings, in which he was represented by a lawyer. He was able to challenge the admissibility of the statement as evidence at his trial on two grounds, which he has now raised before this Court. Firstly, he asserted that the confession statement had been extracted from him as a result of his ill ‑ treatment by the police officers, and, secondly, that it had been obtained without him having access to a lawyer. The trial court regarded his confession as admissible evidence, considering that the allegations of his ill ‑ treatment were unsubstantiated, that access to a lawyer had not been required by domestic law and that the applicant had been informed of the right not to incriminate himself. In convicting the applicant the trial court relied to a significant extent on his confession (see paragraphs 38-39 above).

In relying on the police officers ’ statements denying any wrongdoing on their part and on the internal police inquiry dismissing the applicant ’ s allegations, the court attached no significance to the police officers ’ obvious interest in the applicant ’ s allegations of ill ‑ treatment being rejected. Overall, the trial court ’ s reasoning for its dismissal of the applicant ’ s objection displays a failure to conduct its own independent assessment of all the relevant factors with a view to ascertaining whether there were reasons to exclude from evidence the applicant ’ s confession statement, allegedly “tainted” by a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, so as to ensure the fairness of the trial, and instead indicates its reliance on the decision of the investigative authority (see paragraphs 37 ‑ 38 above), which the Court has found to have been based on an investigation which did not meet the Article 3 requirements (see paragraph 74 above). This lack of a careful assessment of the quality of the impugned evidence ( the applicant ’ s confession statement ) and the circumstances in which it was obtained, which cast doubts on its reliability and accuracy, was not remedied by the higher courts. In consequence, the applicant ’ s confession obtained as a result of his inhuman and degrading treatment (see paragraph 65 above) was used by the domestic courts as evidence of the applicant ’ s guilt. In so doing, the domestic courts legalised the police officers ’ efforts to use a “statement of surrender and confession” to document the applicant ’ s confession, obtained under duress, after his apprehension on suspicion of having committed a crime, contrary to the meaning envisaged for such a statement in Article 142 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (voluntary statement by a person about a crime he or she has committed, see paragraph 50 above)."

According to the domestic courts in the applicant ’ s case, no prior access to a lawyer was required in order to make a statement of surrender and confession. The subsequent use of such a statement in evidence at the trial could not therefore be contested on the ground of the lack of legal advice (see paragraphs 42 and 44-45 above).

The Court reiterates that although not absolute, the right of everyone charged with a criminal offence to be effectively defended by a lawyer, assigned officially if need be, is one of the fundamental features of a fair trial. Early access to a lawyer at the investigation stage of the proceedings serves as a procedural guarantee of the privilege against self ‑ incrimination and a fundamental safeguard against ill-treatment, given the particular vulnerability of the accused at that stage of the proceedings (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, § 54, ECHR 2008; Nechiporuk and Yonkalo v. Ukraine, no. 42310/04, § 263, 21 April 2011; and Martin v. Estonia, no. 35985/09, § 79, 30 May 2013). In order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently “practical and effective”, Article 6 § 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction – whatever its justification – must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz, cited above, § 55). A systematic restriction of the right of access to legal assistance, on the basis of statutory provisions, is sufficient in itself for a violation of Article 6 to be found (see Salduz, cited above, § 56; and Dayanan v.

France, no. 1466/07, §§ 46 ‑ 55, 14 October 2010 ). This would also correspond to the domestic criminal procedural - law requirement that the right of access to a lawyer arises from the moment of actual arrest (see paragraph 46 above), which accords with the Constitutional Court ’ s interpretation of the right to legal assistance as arising from the moment of actual restriction of one ’ s constitutional rights, in particular the right to liberty and security, and not from the moment of the formal recognition of one ’ s status as a suspect or one ’ s detention (see paragraphs 48-49 and 54- 55 above)."

In any event, no reliance can be placed on the mere fact that the applicant had been reminded of his right to remain silent and signed the relevant record (see Salduz, cited above, § 59; and Płonka v.

In that case, the Court held, inter alia, that the Government were not able to show the validity of the applicant ’ s waiver of his right to a lawyer on the basis of the documents he had signed while in police custody, given that the applicant had contested the content of his police statements first of all during his appearance before the public prosecutor and subsequently throughout the entire proceedings (see Knox v. Italy, no. 76577/13, § 126, 24 January 2019). The Court is mindful of the probative value of documents signed while in police custody. However, as with many other guarantees under Article 6 of the Convention, those signatures are not an end in themselves and they must be examined by the Court in the light of all the circumstances of the case (see Ruşen Bayar v. Turkey, cited above, § 121).

Moreover, there had been no element indicating that the applicant had not validly waived her right to legal assistance. To support that contention, the Government referred to Yoldaş v. Turkey, no. 27503/04, §§ 51 ‑ 54, 23 February 2010, and argued that the applicant ’ s statement form had indicated that no lawyer had been requested. Thus, the statement form, which the applicant had signed, should be sufficient to show that the applicant had validly waived her right to a lawyer when giving statements to the police. They further pointed out that İ.A., who had also been arrested during the same period with the applicant, had benefited from the assistance of a lawyer. In the view of the Government, this refuted the applicant ’ s allegation that she had been denied the assistance of a lawyer."

The Court reiterates that the right to be assisted by a lawyer applies throughout and until the end of the questioning by the police, including when the statements taken are read out and the suspect is asked to confirm and sign them, as the assistance of a lawyer is equally important at this point of the interview. The lawyer ’ s presence and active assistance during questioning by police is an important procedural safeguard aimed at, among other things, preventing the collection of evidence through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the suspect and protecting the freedom of a suspected person to choose whether to speak or to remain silent when questioned by the police (see Soytemiz v.

The Court also reiterates that neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 of the Convention prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or tacitly, the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial. That also applies to the right to legal assistance. However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, such a waiver must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance. Such a waiver need not be explicit, but it must be voluntary and constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right. Before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be. Moreover, the waiver must not run counter to any important public interest (see Simeonovi, cited above, § 115). It follows that a waiver of the right to a lawyer, a fundamental right among those listed in Article 6 § 3 which constitute the notion of a fair trial, must be strictly compliant with the above requirements (see, mutatis mutandis, Murtazaliyeva v. Russia [GC], no. 36658/05, § 118, 18 December 2018)."

Those considerations also hold true for the validity of a waiver of the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial, as what constitutes a valid waiver cannot be the subject of a single unvarying fact but must depend on the individual circumstances of the particular case (see Murtazaliyeva, cited above, §§ 117 ‑ 18).",

The Court observes at the outset that the present case differs from Salduz, where the restriction on the applicant ’ s right of access to a lawyer stemmed from Law no. 3842 and was thus systemic. In other words, there was no blanket restriction on the applicant ’ s right of access to a lawyer in police custody, as at the time of her arrest Law no. 3842 – which had provided for a systemic restriction on access to a lawyer in respect of people who had been accused of committing an offence that fell within the jurisdiction of State Security Courts – had already been amended. For that reason, from 15 July 2003 onwards it had been legally possible for suspects to have access to a lawyer when giving statements to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge subject to the condition that they had asked for one."

Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court observes that according to the statement form dated 14 November 2003, which the applicant signed, she was informed of her rights, including her right to have legal assistance and her right to remain silent at the time her statements were taken. The first page of the same record where the applicant stated that she did not want a lawyer or to remain silent includes a printed phrase stating “No lawyer sought” and a box next to it is marked with a printed “X”. Moreover, the Court notes that it was essential that the applicant be clearly informed about the consequences of not requesting the assistance of a lawyer. The Government have not demonstrated that the applicant received any specific information to that effect."

In that connection, the Government relied on the Yoldaş judgment (cited above) to support their argument that the applicant had validly waived her right to a lawyer when giving statements to the police. In their reading of that judgment, the Court considered the applicant ’ s statement form, which had been signed by him and according to which he had not asked for a lawyer, as an unequivocal waiver. Therefore, the same approach should also be maintained in the instant case in view of the applicant ’ s declaration to the effect that she had not asked for a lawyer on the statement form, which she had signed."
            ],
            [
                "52. The Court takes note of the following factors in relation to its Yoldaş judgment (cited above, §§ 52-53). Firstly, it is important to reiterate that in Yoldaş the Court did not adjudicate the validity of the applicant ’ s waiver on the basis of a single isolated element, namely the applicant ’ s signature on the statement form explaining the rights of arrested persons, including the right to remain silent and the right to legal assistance. In fact, it was a combination of facts such as the applicant ’ s undisputed signature on the statement form and on the form concerning the rights of suspects and accused ( şüpheli sanık hakları formu ), his handwritten note on another record that he would not wish to see his family while in custody, and more importantly the trial court ’ s scrupulous examination of the applicant ’ s police statements and its subsequent refusal to convict the applicant in respect of six offences that were based solely on his police statements. In the light of those factors, the Court, after carrying out a holistic assessment of the circumstances of that case, with an emphasis on the trial court ’ s scrutiny of the applicant ’ s allegation that he had been denied legal assistance when giving statements to the police, and after having observed that there had been nothing in the proceedings to suggest that the applicant ’ s waiver of legal assistance while in police custody had not been free and unequivocal, concluded that the waiver had been valid and that there had been no violation of the applicant ’ s rights under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "53. In the view of the Court, the present case cannot be rejected on the basis of Yoldaş as it differs from it in certain important aspects. First of all, the applicant ’ s statement form in the instant case did not bear a handwritten note by her (compare Sharkunov and Mezentsev v. Russia, no. 75330/01, § 104, 10 June 2010). Secondly, the applicant in Yoldaş retracted his police statements only during the course of the trial, whereas in the instant case the applicant immediately retracted her police statements as soon as she had access to a lawyer both before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, and maintained that position before the trial court (see Dvorski v. Croatia [GC], no. 25703/11, § 102, ECHR 2015). Furthermore, as will be examined below, the trial court does not appear to have subjected the applicant ’ s police statements to scrutiny when using those statements to convict her. As a result, the Court dismisses the Government ’ s argument based on Yoldaş."

            [
                "54. On that account, the applicant ’ s situation appears to resemble that of the applicant in the case of Ruşen Bayar v. Turkey (no. 25253/08, 19 February 2019), who was tried and convicted in the same set of criminal proceedings as the applicant in the instant case. In that case, the Court held, inter alia, that the Government were not able to show the validity of the applicant ’ s waiver of his right to a lawyer on the basis of the documents he had signed while in police custody, given that the applicant had contested the content of his police statements first of all during his appearance before the public prosecutor and subsequently throughout the entire proceedings (see Knox v. Italy, no. 76577/13, § 126, 24 January 2019). The Court is mindful of the probative value of documents signed while in police custody. However, as with many other guarantees under Article 6 of the Convention, those signatures are not an end in themselves and they must be examined by the Court in the light of all the circumstances of the case (see Ruşen Bayar v. Turkey, cited above, § 121). In addition, the use of a printed waiver formula may represent a challenge as to ascertaining whether the text actually expresses an accused ’ s free and informed decision to waive his or her right to be assisted by a lawyer."

In the instant case, the Court is of the view that the applicant ’ s immediate statements to the doctor at the end of her police custody on 17 November 2003 that the police had hit her head, threatened to kill and rape her and had driven their car into her, as a result of which she had fallen unconscious, and her statements to the public prosecutor that she had had to sign the police statements as a result of the violence and coercion on their part, are weighty indications against the conclusion that she had waived her right to a lawyer in accordance with the Convention standards when giving statements to the police on 16 November 2003. This remains so despite the fact that the Court has already declared inadmissible the applicant ’ s complaint that she was subjected to duress while in police custody as being manifestly ill-founded, because the absence of any element suggesting that the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment or was otherwise coerced into making incriminating statements is not, in itself, sufficient to conclude that the waiver in a given case is valid for the purposes of a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention (see Bozkaya v.

France [GC], nos. 32911/96 and 2 others, § 45, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII; Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 66, 20 January 2005; Klimentyev v. Russia, no. 46503/99, § 116, 16 November 2006; Vitan v.

Where such grounds are lacking, a restriction on the free choice of defence counsel would entail a violation of Article 6 § 1 together with paragraph 3 (c) if it adversely affected the applicant’s defence, regard being had to the proceedings as a whole (see Croissant, cited above, § 31; see also Meftah and Others, cited above, §§ 46-47; Vitan, cited above, §§ 58-64; Zagorodniy, cited above, §§ 53-55; and Martin, cited above, §§ 90-97)."

                "81. Unlike in Salduz, where the accused, who was being held in custody, had been denied access to a lawyer during police questioning, the present case concerns a situation where the applicant was afforded access to a lawyer from his first interrogation, but not – according to his complaint – a lawyer of his own choosing. In contrast to the cases involving denial of access, the more lenient requirement of “relevant and sufficient” reasons has been applied in situations raising the less serious issue of “denial of choice”. In such cases the Court’s task will be to assess whether, in the light of the proceedings as a whole, the rights of the defence have been “adversely affected” to such an extent as to undermine their overall fairness (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, § 31; Klimentyev, cited above, §§ 117-18; and Martin, cited above, §§ 96-97 )."
            ],
            [
                "82. It is the latter test which is to be applied in the present case. Against the above background, the Court considers that the first step should be to assess whether it has been demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for overriding or obstructing the defendant’s wish as to his or her choice of legal representation. Where no such reasons exist, the Court should proceed to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings. In making its assessment, the Court may have regard to a variety of factors, including the nature of the proceedings and the application of certain professional requirements (see Meftah and Others, cited above, §§ 45-48, and Martin, cited above, § 90); the circumstances surrounding the designation of counsel and the existence of opportunities for challenging this (ibid., §§ 90-97); the effectiveness of counsel’s assistance (see Croissant, cited above § 31, and Vitan, cited above, §§ 58-64 ); whether the accused’s privilege against self-incrimination has been respected (see Martin, cited above, § 90); the accused’s age (ibid., § 92); and the trial court’s use of any statements given by the accused at the material time (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, § 31; Klimentyev, cited above, §§ 117-18; and Martin, cited above, §§ 94-95 ). It is further mindful that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory (see, among many other authorities, Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 24, Series A no. 32; Imbrioscia, cited above, § 38; Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, § 30, Series A no. 76; and Salduz, cited above, § 55) and that in determining Convention rights one must frequently look beyond appearances and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see, inter alia, Delcourt v. Belgium, 17 January 1970, § 31, Series A no. 11; De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, 22 May 1984, § 48, Series A no. 77; Pavlenko, cited above, § 112; and Erkapić v. Croatia, no. 51198/08, §§ 80 ‑ 82, 25 April 2013 ). In cases where the accused had no legal representation, the Court also takes into consideration the opportunity given to the accused to challenge the authenticity of evidence and to oppose its use (see Panovits, cited above, § 82), whether the accused is in custody (see Salduz, cited above, § 60); whether such statements constituted a significant element on which the conviction was based and the strength of the other evidence in the case (see Salduz, cited above, § 57, and Panovits, cited above, §§ 76 and 82).",

                "“The first accused, Ivan Dvorski, confessed to the criminal offences of robbery, aggravated murder of Ɖ. V., M. Š. and B.V. ..., exactly as is stated in the operative part of this judgment, to the police and in the presence of a defence lawyer. He later tried to contest that statement, claiming that he had not instructed the defence lawyer, M.R., that he had told the police officers that he wanted G.M. as his lawyer, that at the time he had been taken to the police station he had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and so on. However, this defence is not acceptable. The written record of arrest shows that Ivan Dvorski was arrested on 14 March 2007 at 9.50 a.m. at the Rijeka Police Station, and [M.]R., in favour of whom Ivan Dvorski signed the power of attorney, came to the police station on 14 March 2007 at 7.45 p.m. The written record of the questioning of the then suspect Ivan Dvorski shows that M.R. was informed at 6.15 p.m. and that the questioning started at 8.10 p.m. Besides the officers of the Rijeka Police, a typist and the defence lawyer of the then suspect Ivan Dvorski, the County State Attorney was also present during the questioning. The introductory part of the written record [indicates] that the then suspect Ivan Dvorski clearly stated that he had chosen and authorised M.R. to act as his defence lawyer and had consulted with him, after which he decided to give his statement. The written record is properly signed by the persons present. The first accused Ivan Dvorski had read the written record before signing it. Thus, the above shows without doubt that the contentions of Ivan Dvorski that he had not retained M.R. as his lawyer are unfounded. During the trial, at the request of Ivan Dvorski’s defence, a handwriting expert gave her opinion regarding the signature of Ivan Dvorski on the written record of his questioning by the police. The expert opinion proved beyond any doubt that the contested signature was that of Ivan Dvorski. The panel accepts such findings in their entirety; the findings were further explained at a hearing by the expert Lj.Z. Her findings were given in an objective, impartial and professional manner. Therefore, the questioning of Ivan Dvorski by the police was carried out in compliance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

Nobody, including [Ivan Dvorski’s] defence lawyer who was present during the police questioning – [M.]R. – has alleged any unlawful extraction of a confession and there is no indication of this in the record of the statement given by Ivan Dvorski, [who] at the time [was] only a suspect.”"

The applicant also referred to the request for the removal of the Rijeka County State Attorney and all his deputies lodged by G.M. on 16 March 2007, highlighting the part of that request which stated that he had been denied food during his detention in police custody.

When the first accused was brought to the Rijeka Police Station his defence rights were seriously infringed. However, during the trial this infringement was ignored. On 14 March 2007, the first accused’s mother and then also his now late father retained G.M. as his defence lawyer before the police, after he had been arrested. However, G.M. was not allowed access to the accused, and subsequently informed the relevant authorities thereof, but they ignored this. G.M. therefore lodged an action in the Rijeka Municipal Court in respect of an unlawful act, as well as a request for the removal of the Rijeka County State Attorney and all his deputies. In that request he alleged that the first accused had not been given any food by the police from 13 March 2007 at 1 p.m., when he had been brought to the Rijeka Police Station, until he had agreed to be represented by M.R. on 14 March at about 7 p.m. so as to give a self-incriminating statement, which was in violation of Article 225 § 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

He was arrested the next day, as found by the first-instance court. However, it is not true that M.R. came to the police station at 6.45 p.m.: he came at 7.45 p.m., which shows that the allegations of the first accused are true.

That court pointed out that the record of the applicant’s statement suggested that he had chosen M.R. to represent him during police questioning and that M.R. had provided him with adequate legal advice. The Supreme Court also noted that there was nothing in the case file to indicate that the applicant had been ill-treated or forced to confess. The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows.",
                "“The appellant erroneously argues that the first-instance court committed a grave breach of criminal procedure, contrary to Article 367 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in basing his conviction on the statement he gave to the police in the presence of a defence lawyer, which [in the appellant’s view] constitutes unlawfully obtained evidence for the purposes of Article 9 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and that the record of his questioning as a suspect by the police (in the presence of a defence lawyer) should thus have been excluded from the case file. In so doing, the appellant challenges the reasoning of the second-instance judgment to the effect that the lawfulness of the evidence was not affected by the appellant’s arguments that during his apprehension and arrest he had not been given food until he had agreed to be represented by M.R. These arguments of the appellant were refuted by the second-instance court on the basis of all the formally established information contained in the record of [his] questioning in the presence of a lawyer on 14 March 2007.",
                "This Court notes that [the complaint] regarding the question of the presence of a lawyer [during the questioning], as a legal requirement for the lawfulness of evidence obtained in this way during the police investigation, relates to two objections. The first objection concerns the restriction of access to the lawyer of [the defendant’s] own choosing, and the second objection relates to the pressure exerted on the suspect through the denial of food (Article 225 § 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), which, according to the appeal, eventually made him accept legal representation by the lawyer imposed on him, M.R., although his parents had already engaged the services of G.M. on the morning of 14 March 2007.",
                "It is to be noted that during the police criminal investigation a number of persons with a background of drug abuse, and with links to the victim Đ.V., were arrested, in particular from the neighbourhood of Gornja Vežica, and it was in the course of this action that the accused, Ivan Dvorski, was also apprehended. Only when a probable cause was established that the accused could have been the perpetrator of the offences in issue was he arrested on 14 March 2007 at 9.50 a.m.",
                "At the same time the father of the accused, who was in Croatia, whereas the accused’s mother was in Italy, was informed [of the arrest] by the police at 2.10 p.m., which shows that from that moment the father of the accused (after a telephone conversation with his mother) could have engaged the services of a lawyer for the accused, for which he would most certainly have needed some time. In such circumstances, this Court finds that the parents of the accused could not have already signed a power of attorney for the lawyer of the accused’s choice by 1.30 p.m. on the day in question.",
                "The other information from the record of the accused’s arrest and from the record of his questioning by the police shows that on 14 March 2007, as is indicated by the record of the arrest, the accused was brought to the Rijeka Police Station and, as is apparent from the record of Ivan Dvorski’s questioning by the police, the defence lawyer, M.R., was informed at 6.15 p.m. and came to the police station at 7.45 p.m. The questioning itself commenced at 8.10 p.m. and ended at 11 p.m., with a break between 10.35 p.m. and 10.38 p.m.",
                "It should be emphasised that in the introductory part of the record [of his questioning] the suspect, Ivan Dvorski, expressly stated that he had chosen M.R. as his defence lawyer and had signed the power of attorney in favour of him, and the record of the questioning shows that the defence lawyer had almost half an hour for consultation with the suspect before the questioning, in which time he was able to advise him of his rights.",
                "Thus, the relevant fact which follows from the formal procedural action described in the record of the suspect’s questioning is that the chosen lawyer came at least half an hour before the questioning commenced, and in the consultation with [the suspect] before the questioning he was able to give [the suspect] genuine legal advice as his chosen lawyer.",
                "It should also be noted that the essence of the suspect’s right to have a lawyer present during his questioning by the police lies in the necessity for legal protection of his rights, which is why the beginning, conduct and end of this formal [procedural] action is fully registered in the record [of the questioning].",
                "This is why all arguments to the contrary, as set out in the appeal against the second-instance judgment, and particularly those relating to the need to question G.M. as the second concurrent lawyer of [the suspect’s] choosing, have no support in the content of the formal record of the suspect’s questioning of 14 March 2007, because the record contains formally registered information regarding the contact with the chosen lawyer, the time the chosen lawyer came into the Rijeka Police Station, the time the questioning of the suspect commenced, the period in which a short break took place, and the time the procedural action finished, all of which was confirmed by the suspect and the defence lawyer of his choosing by signing the record without any objections as to its content.",
                "However, irrespective of the fact that the defence of the accused in the context of police questioning formally satisfied the requirements of Article 177 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the general thrust of the defence, as well as the substance of the defence as regards particular acts, and the confession, were provided voluntarily by the suspect, and his chosen lawyer was most certainly unable to have any influence on this, which at the same time rules out the possibility of any mental pressure being exerted on the suspect, as well as his subsequent arguments regarding the lawyer having been imposed on him during the police investigation. On the contrary, the suspect’s defence rights were fully secured, as required under the Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure.",
                "There is therefore no breach of Article 367 § 2 in conjunction with Article 9 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The refusal of the request to have the record of the suspect’s questioning by the police in the presence of a lawyer of his choosing excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence does not constitute a breach of his defence rights because the record of the suspect’s questioning by the police clearly and undoubtedly shows that the lawyer who was present [during the questioning] was the lawyer of the suspect’s free choice, and this also follows from the signed power of attorney in favour of the lawyer in question, who protected the suspect’s rights during the questioning. Accordingly, the refusal of the defence’s request did not have any bearing on the lawfulness and correctness of the judgment. At the same time, it was not necessary to question the new chosen lawyer as a witness and, for the reasons set out above, the facts of the case were not insufficiently or erroneously established, as was argued in the defendant’s appeal against the second-instance judgment.”"

This right should apply not only to criminal suspects but also to anyone who is under a legal obligation to attend – and stay at – a police establishment. If necessary, the law should be amended. Naturally, the fact that a detained person has stated that he wishes to have access to a lawyer should not prevent the police from beginning to question/interview him on urgent matters before the lawyer arrives.

In addition, in some cases, detained persons expressed scepticism about ex officio lawyers ’ independence from the police.

The Court reiterates that, even if the primary purpose of Article 6 of the Convention, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, is to ensure a fair trial by a “tribunal” competent to determine “any criminal charge”, it does not follow that the Article has no application to pre-trial proceedings. Thus, Article 6 – especially paragraph 3 thereof – may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and in so far as the fairness of the trial is liable to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions. As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention is one element, among others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in Article 6 § 1 (see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, §§ 36-37, Series A no. 275, and Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, § 50, ECHR 2008)."

The Court has held that, in order to exercise his right of defence, the accused should normally be allowed to have the effective benefit of the assistance of a lawyer from the initial stages of the proceedings because national laws may attach consequences to the attitude of an accused at the initial stages of police interrogation which are decisive for the prospects of the defence in any subsequent criminal proceedings (see Salduz, cited above, § 52). The Court has also recognised that an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, and in most cases this can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer, whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure that the right of an accused not to incriminate himself is respected (ibid., § 54; see also Pavlenko v. Russia, no. 42371/02, § 101, 1 April 2010)."

In such circumstances, the Court considers it important that from the initial stages of the proceedings a person charged with a criminal offence who does not wish to defend himself in person must be able to have recourse to legal assistance of his own choosing (for more detailed reasoning, see Martin v. Estonia, no. 35985/09, § § 90 and 93, 30 May 2013 ). This follows from the very wording of Article 6 § 3 (c), which guarantees that “[e]veryone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: ... to defend himself ... through legal assistance of his own choosing ...”, and is generally recognised in international human rights standards as a mechanism for securing an effective defence to the accused. The Court emphasises that the fairness of proceedings requires that an accused should be able to obtain the whole range of services specifically associated with legal assistance (see Dayanan v. Turkey, no. 7377/03, § 32, 13 October 2009, and paragraph 108 below)."

                "79. Notwithstanding the importance of the relationship of confidence between a lawyer and his client, this right is not absolute. It is necessarily subject to certain limitations where free legal aid is concerned and also where it is for the courts to decide whether the interests of justice require that the accused be defended by counsel appointed by them ( see Croissant v. Germany, 25 September 1992, § 29, Series A no. 237-B ). The Court has consistently held that the national authorities must have regard to the defendant’s wishes as to his or her choice of legal representation, but may override those wishes when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice (ibid., § 29; see also Meftah and Others v. France [GC], nos. 32911/96 and 2 others, § 45, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII; Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 66, 20 January 2005; Klimentyev v. Russia, no. 46503/99, § 116, 16 November 2006; Vitan v.

Where such grounds are lacking, a restriction on the free choice of defence counsel would entail a violation of Article 6 § 1 together with paragraph 3 (c) if it adversely affected the applicant’s defence, regard being had to the proceedings as a whole (see Croissant, cited above, § 31; see also Meftah and Others, cited above, §§ 46-47; Vitan, cited above, §§ 58-64; Zagorodniy, cited above, §§ 53-55; and Martin, cited above, §§ 90-97)."

Moreover, having regard to the considerations mentioned above, as the Court affirmed in its judgment in Salduz, in order for the right to a fair trial to remain “practical and effective”, Article 6 § 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such a restriction – whatever its justification – must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz, cited above, § 55-57; see also Panovits v. Cyprus, no. 4268/04, § 66, 11 December 2008)."

Unlike in Salduz, where the accused, who was being held in custody, had been denied access to a lawyer during police questioning, the present case concerns a situation where the applicant was afforded access to a lawyer from his first interrogation, but not – according to his complaint – a lawyer of his own choosing. In contrast to the cases involving denial of access, the more lenient requirement of “relevant and sufficient” reasons has been applied in situations raising the less serious issue of “denial of choice”. In such cases the Court’s task will be to assess whether, in the light of the proceedings as a whole, the rights of the defence have been “adversely affected” to such an extent as to undermine their overall fairness (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, § 31; Klimentyev, cited above, §§ 117-18; and Martin, cited above, §§ 96-97 )."

Against the above background, the Court considers that the first step should be to assess whether it has been demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for overriding or obstructing the defendant’s wish as to his or her choice of legal representation. Where no such reasons exist, the Court should proceed to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings. In making its assessment, the Court may have regard to a variety of factors, including the nature of the proceedings and the application of certain professional requirements (see Meftah and Others, cited above, §§ 45-48, and Martin, cited above, § 90); the circumstances surrounding the designation of counsel and the existence of opportunities for challenging this (ibid., §§ 90-97); the effectiveness of counsel’s assistance (see Croissant, cited above § 31, and Vitan, cited above, §§ 58-64 ); whether the accused’s privilege against self-incrimination has been respected (see Martin, cited above, § 90); the accused’s age (ibid., § 92); and the trial court’s use of any statements given by the accused at the material time (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, § 31; Klimentyev, cited above, §§ 117-18; and Martin, cited above, §§ 94-95 ). It is further mindful that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory (see, among many other authorities, Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 24, Series A no. 32; Imbrioscia, cited above, § 38; Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, § 30, Series A no. 76; and Salduz, cited above, § 55) and that in determining Convention rights one must frequently look beyond appearances and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see, inter alia, Delcourt v. Belgium, 17 January 1970, § 31, Series A no. 11; De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, 22 May 1984, § 48, Series A no. 77; Pavlenko, cited above, § 112; and Erkapić v. Croatia, no. 51198/08, §§ 80 ‑ 82, 25 April 2013 ). In cases where the accused had no legal representation, the Court also takes into consideration the opportunity given to the accused to challenge the authenticity of evidence and to oppose its use (see Panovits, cited above, § 82), whether the accused is in custody (see Salduz, cited above, § 60); whether such statements constituted a significant element on which the conviction was based and the strength of the other evidence in the case (see Salduz, cited above, § 57, and Panovits, cited above, §§ 76 and 82).",

It is also true that the trial court viewed his statement in the light of the complex body of evidence before it (compare Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, § 103, 10 March 2009). Specifically, in convicting the applicant, the trial court relied on the statements of a number of witnesses cross-examined during the trial, numerous expert reports and the records of the crime-scene investigation and searches and seizures, as well as relevant photographs and other physical evidence. In addition, the trial court had at its disposal the confessions made by the applicant’s co-accused at the trial, and neither the applicant nor his co-accused ever argued that any of their rights had been infringed when they had made those statements."

As to the manner in which M.R. was chosen to represent the applicant, the Court refers to Article 177 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which requires that an accused should first be invited to instruct a lawyer of his or her own choosing (see paragraph 60 above). Only where the lawyer initially chosen by a suspect is unable to attend police questioning within a certain period of time should a replacement lawyer be chosen from the list of duty lawyers provided to the competent police authority by the county branches of the Croatian Bar Association. However, there is no conclusive evidence in the documents submitted to the Court as to whether these procedures were followed in the applicant’s case. The Court finds it unfortunate that the procedures used and decisions taken were not properly documented so as to avoid any doubts raised about undue pressure in respect of the choice of lawyer (see, mutatis mutandis, Martin, cited above, § 90, and Horvatić v. Croatia, no. 36044/09, §§ 80-82, 17 October 2013)."

There is no indication of the exact time the applicant and M.R. actually commenced the consultation, nor is there any explanation of why that information was not provided in the record of the questioning. The Court notes also that the statement from D.H., the Rijeka County State Attorney, indicates that M.R. talked to the applicant in private for about ten minutes (see paragraph 26 above). The judgment of the Rijeka County Court indicates that M.R. came to the police station at 7.45 p.m. and that the questioning started at 8.10 p.m. (see paragraph 51 above). This was confirmed in the judgment of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 55 above). In the Court’s view, without speculating as to the effectiveness of the legal assistance provided by M.R., this period appears to have been relatively short, bearing in mind the scope and seriousness of the accusations, involving three counts of aggravated murder and further counts of armed robbery and arson. Regard should also be had in this context to the requirement in Article 6 § 3 (b) that an accused should be afforded adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his or her defence."

The fairness of proceedings requires that an accused should be able to obtain the whole range of services specifically associated with legal assistance. In this regard, counsel has to be able to secure without restriction the fundamental aspects of that person’s defence: discussion of the case, organisation of the defence, collection of evidence favourable to the accused, preparation for questioning, support for an accused in distress and checking of the conditions of detention (see Dayanan, cited above, § 32 )."

However, the reasoning employed by the national courts in the present case in relation to the legal challenge mounted by the applicant concerning the manner in which his confession had been obtained by the police was far from substantial. Neither the trial court nor the investigating judge nor any other national authority took any steps to obtain evidence from G.M. or the police officers involved in order to establish the relevant circumstances surrounding G.M.’s visit to Rijeka Police Station on 14 March 2007 in connection with the applicant’s questioning by the police.

In determining whether, taking the criminal proceedings as a whole, the applicant received the benefit of a “fair hearing” for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, the Court must have regard to the actions of the police in effectively preventing the applicant, at the very outset of the investigation, from having access to the lawyer chosen by his family and from freely choosing his own lawyer, and to the consequences of the conduct of the police for the subsequent proceedings. In the abstract, if a suspect receives the assistance of a qualified lawyer, who is bound by professional ethics, rather than another lawyer whom he or she might have preferred to appoint, this is not in itself sufficient to show that the whole trial was unfair – subject to the proviso that there is no evidence of manifest incompetence or bias (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37). In the instant case, it can be presumed that the consequence of the police’s conduct was that in his very first statement to the police, instead of remaining silent, as he could have done, the applicant made a confession, which was subsequently admitted in evidence against him. It is also significant that during the investigation and ensuing trial the applicant did not subsequently rely on his confession, save by way of mitigation in relation to the sentence, but took the first opportunity, before the investigating judge, to contest the manner in which the confession had been obtained from him by the police (see paragraphs 23-24, 31, 48, 52 and 54 above). Although there was other evidence against him, the significant likely impact of his initial confession on the further development of the criminal proceedings against him cannot be ignored by the Court. In sum, in the Court’s view, the objective consequence of the police’s conduct in preventing the lawyer chosen by the applicant’s family from having access to him was such as to undermine the fairness of the subsequent criminal proceedings in so far as the applicant’s incriminating initial statement was admitted in evidence."

The applicant had been made aware of her procedural rights and had made use of them during the proceedings, in particular by way of lodging submissions. Provision of free legal assistance was not made necessary by the circumstances of the case, in view of the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant, and the simplicity of the procedure, which could be fully understood by a lay person.

In any event, the present application raises new and important issues concerning interpretation and application of Article 6 of the Convention in applications concerning Russia, in particular where the defendant did not face a custodial sentence.

The Convention is not opposed to the moves towards “decriminalization” which are taking place - in extremely varied forms - in the member States of the Council of Europe ( ibid .). Nevertheless, if the Contracting States were able at their discretion, by classifying an offence as “regulatory” instead of criminal, to exclude the operation of the fundamental clauses of Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention, this might lead to results incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention ( ibid. and Ezeh and Connors [GC], cited above, § 83)."

The aim of prevention is consistent with a punitive purpose and may be seen as a constituent element of the very notion of punishment ( ibid ., § 30).

Minor contradictions in their statements could be explained by their concern not to disclose their residence and activities to the authorities and by the psychological strain to which they had been subjected during and following the incident. The witnesses had feared problems with the police and acts of revenge by the perpetrators. This explained why they had not reported the offence immediately after the events and why the police had only been informed on 12 February 2007 by their friend L."

It observed that the witnesses’ attention during the incident had been focused on the other perpetrator carrying the knife and that the applicant himself had only stayed in the flat for a short period of time. Their inability to identify the applicant also showed that, contrary to the defence’s allegation, the witnesses had not testified with a view to incriminating him. The court further considered that the fact that the witnesses had failed to attend the trial could be explained by their unease at having to recall, and being questioned about, the offence and therefore did not as such affect their credibility.",

The accused had initially stated that a different perpetrator and R. had been in the flat at the time of the incident the following day. The applicant had subsequently amended his submissions and claimed that it had been he and B. who had gone into the victims’ flat on 3 February 2007 with a view to making use of the women’s services as prostitutes. He had further conceded that he had followed P. when she escaped over the balcony. He explained that he had done so in order to prevent her from calling the neighbours or the police, since, in view of his criminal record, he had been afraid of getting into trouble and because of the problems he had previously encountered with prostitutes on a similar occasion in Kassel."

This should have been done prior to the hearing of the main witnesses for the prosecution by the investigating judge, from which he had been excluded under Article 168c § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In such circumstances, defence counsel had a right to be present at the witness hearing under Article 168c § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (save in the circumstances enumerated in Article 168c § 5, which did not apply to his case).

In any event, this would not have justified his and his counsel’s exclusion from that hearing as there were various means of allaying such fears. As O. and P. were due to leave Germany shortly after their hearing by the investigating judge, it would have been possible to appoint counsel for the applicant just before the hearing and also to arrest the applicant immediately before that hearing, thus allowing him or at least his counsel to question the witnesses in person without the latter having to fear any intimidation."

The Court’s findings in that judgment, made in the context of a common-law system, should be transposed to continental-law systems in a flexible manner.

It had summoned the witnesses for a hearing and, following the submission of medical certificates by the witnesses, had again attempted to secure their presence by informing them that they would be protected and asking them to state in which circumstances they would be prepared to testify. The Regional Court had no jurisdiction to compel the witnesses, who were Latvian nationals residing in Latvia, to attend a hearing in Germany, as coercive measures were prohibited under Article 8 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (see paragraph 66 above)."

The Regional Court’s request to the Latvian court asking the latter to verify the grounds given by the witnesses for their refusal to testify, or to explore further ways of questioning them, had gone unanswered.

Furthermore, the Court should clarify whether it still accepted the principle of impossibilium nulla obligatio est as a good reason for admitting the evidence of an absent witness.

However, in other cases, the lack of a good reason for a prosecution witness’s absence alone was considered sufficient to find a breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) ( see Rudnichenko v. Ukraine, no. 2775/07, §§ 105 ‑ 10, 11 July 2013, and Nikolitsas v.

In yet other cases a differentiated approach was taken: the lack of good reason for a prosecution witness’s absence was considered conclusive of the unfairness of the trial unless the witness testimony was manifestly irrelevant for the outcome of the case ( see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, §§ 709-16, 25 July 2013; Cevat Soysal v. Turkey, no. 17362/03, §§ 76-79, 23 September 2014; and Suldin v. Russia, no. 20077/04, §§ 56-59, 16 October 2014). The Grand Chamber, in the light of the foregoing (see paragraphs 111-12 above), considers that the absence of good reason for the non-attendance of a witness cannot of itself be conclusive of the unfairness of a trial.

As regards the question whether it is necessary to review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors even in cases in which the importance of an absent witness’s evidence did not attain the threshold of sole or decisive evidence grounding the applicant’s conviction, the Court reiterates that it has generally considered it necessary to carry out an examination of the overall fairness of the proceedings. This has traditionally included an examination of both the significance of the untested evidence for the case against the accused and of the counterbalancing measures taken by the judicial authorities to compensate for the handicaps under which the defence laboured (see Gani v. Spain, no. 61800/08, § 41, 19 February 2013, with further references; see also Fąfrowicz v.

The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair will depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness.

Only once that witness evidence is admitted can the trial court assess, at the close of the trial and having regard to all the evidence adduced, the significance of the evidence of the absent witness and, in particular, whether the evidence of the absent witness is the sole or decisive basis for convicting the defendant.

It may therefore be appropriate, in a given case, to examine the steps in a different order, in particular if one of the steps proves to be particularly conclusive as to either the fairness or the unfairness of the proceedings (see in this connection, for instance, Nechto v.

If there was a good reason for the witness’s non-attendance in that sense, it follows that there was a good reason, or justification, for the trial court to admit the untested statements of the absent witness as evidence. There are a number of reasons why a witness may not attend a trial, such as absence owing to death or fear (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, §§ 120-25), absence on health grounds (see, for instance, Bobeş v.

That lawyer would have had the right to be present at the witness hearing before the investigating judge and, as a rule, would have had to be notified thereof (Article 168c §§ 2 and 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).

Where the investigating authorities took the reasonable view that the witness concerned would not be examined at the hearing of the trial court, it is essential for the defence to have been given an opportunity to put questions to the witness at the investigation stage (compare also Vronchenko, cited above, §§ 60 et seq., and Rosin, cited above, §§ 57 et seq., where the minor victims of a sexual offence were promised at the investigation stage that they would not be asked questions about the offence on any further occasions )."

It agrees with the applicant that the witnesses were heard by the investigating judge because, in view of the witnesses’ imminent return to Latvia, the prosecution authorities considered that there was a danger of their evidence being lost. This is shown by the reasoning of the prosecution’s own request to the investigating judge to hear O. and P. speedily in order to obtain a true statement which could be used at the subsequent trial (see paragraph 20 above). The Court observes in that context that, under Article 251 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the written records of a witness’s previous examination by an investigating judge may be read out at the trial under less strict conditions than the records of a witness examination by the police (Article 251 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; see paragraph 61 above)."

Counsel for H. then declared that H. would also not answer further questions by the court since there was a risk that the witness could incriminate herself. The Regional Court observed that criminal investigations had been pending against H. on suspicion of not having rendered assistance to the victim and of having attempted to obstruct the prosecution of the police officers involved in the ill-treatment. The court thus ordered that H. be granted the right not to testify pursuant to section 55 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see “Relevant domestic law” below) and for this reason also refrained from submitting the questions formulated by counsel to the witness. The Court specified that once a witness had invoked his or her right to remain silent pursuant to the said provision any further questions were inadmissible.

He threatened two police officers with death who had arrived at the victim ’ s flat following a neighbour ’ s emergency call. The officers requested reinforcements, used pepper spray and subsequently subdued the victim using considerable force. The victim thereupon entered into a state of “excited delirium” and displayed extreme agitation, violent behavior, insensitivity to pain, and “ superhuman ” strength. The applicant and another police officer then arrived as further reinforcements, repeatedly hit the victim ’ s legs and managed to shackle the victim who nonetheless continued to struggle. No police officer involved in the arrest was aware that the victim was suffering from a psychotic bout. One of the police officers involved, police officer A., sustained minor injuries."

They were angry that the victim continued with his futile resistance which was perceived as particularly unruly. They also wanted to take revenge for their colleague A. ’ s injuries.

Even assuming such involvement, there had been no reasons for G. to expect that any of the police officers participating in the ill-treatment would disclose the underlying events at their own initiative.

G. and H. had an intimate relationship while G. was married to another woman. As it had had transpired already in the course of the preliminary proceedings, they had to expect questions concerning their intimate relationship in a highly publicised trial by the defence with a view to casting doubt on their credibility."

In contrast, the account of the events given by the applicant and the co-accused and their denial of any involvement in the applicant ’ s ill-treatment in the “watergate” were contradictory and not supported by the further available evidence."

For instance, the applicant himself had conceded that in the cell he had kicked the victim once in the hip as a warning and with a view to preventing a possible attack by the latter. Another accused, D., had confessed that he had also beaten the victim one time in the cell, not because it was necessary to prevent an attack but rather because he could not control his anger at the victim. Police officer A. who had sustained minor injuries on the occasion of the victim ’ s arrest and had been heard as a witness on the occasion of the trial had testified that when the victim had been taken to the ambulance one of the accused police officers had told him “We have taken revenge for you”. In the court ’ s view these additional testimonies constituted evidence that the police officers ’ treatment of the victim had not constituted an ordinary and appropriate reaction to the resistance of an arrested person. The Regional Court further referred to two medical expert opinions confirming that while the injuries sustained by the victim were not particularly serious and had not directly led to his death, they could nevertheless be aligned with the description given by G. and H. of his ill-treatment in police custody."

Having regard to the above considerations, the Regional Court concluded that there was nothing to cast doubt on the veracity of G. and H. ’ s testimonies to the extent they concerned the circumstances of the victim ’ s ill-treatment. The court conceded that it could not be established whether the force used by the police officers or, alternatively, the medical maltreatment in the hospital had caused the victim ’ s death and considered that this uncertainty had a mitigating effect on the sentences imposed. The Regional Court nevertheless maintained that the ill-treatment in the “watergate” had led to the victim ’ s bleeding and consecutive transport to the hospital and that there had therefore been a causal connection between the physical abuse in police custody and the latter ’ s death. Since the co-accused had acted jointly their respective participation in the ill-treatment was imputable to each of them.",

The applicant had not had a right to be present during the police interrogation of G. and H. who at that time had been co-suspects.

The witnesses had freely chosen not to answer questions of the defence. H. had declared that she would not answer further questions by the court.

Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of their evidence, by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings (see Lucà v. Italy, no. 33354/96, § 39, ECHR 2001 ‑ II, § 39 and Solakov v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ”, no. 47023/99, § 57, ECHR 2001 ‑ X)."

The Court notes at the outset that in the present case, it is not concerned with testimony that was given by witnesses whose identity was concealed from the accused or who were absent at trial. G. and H. whose identity was known to the defence gave live evidence in open court in the presence of the applicant, his co-accused and the respective defence counsel. The witnesses gave an account of their recollection of previous statements made in the course of the preliminary proceedings and answered questions posed by the presiding judge, another judge and the public prosecutor. The Court observes in this context that pursuant to section 244 (2) of the German Code of Criminal Procedure the trial court was required to extend, proprio motu, the taking of evidence to all facts and means of proof relevant with a view to establishing the truth and actual circumstances of the case. There is nothing to establish that the trial court has not observed these requirements in the case at hand.",
                "Thus, the court, the prosecution as well as the accused and their respective counsel were in a position to observe the witnesses ’ demeanour under questioning and to form their own impression of their probity and credibility (see, by contrast, Kostovski v. the Netherlands, 20 November 1989, §§ 42 and 43, Series A no. 166 and Windisch v.

While it would clearly have been preferable for the defence to directly confront the witnesses, in particular in view of the fact that it is common ground between the parties that their testimonies were significant for the applicant ’ s subsequent conviction, the Court nevertheless observes that it was not imputable to the domestic authorities that G. and H. could not be questioned by the defence. The Court accepts the Government ’ s argument that at the investigation stage there were no grounds for the domestic authorities to arrange for such possibility since G. and H. were interrogated by the police as co-suspects of the applicant. It further shares the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s view, as reflected in its decision of 16 August 2004, that it had not been foreseeable for the domestic authorities that G. and H. would subsequently refuse to answer questions of the defence when examined in court in their capacity as witnesses."

The Court also accepts that in the course of the ensuing trial the domestic courts were under an obligation to respect the witnesses ’ decision to avail themselves of their statutory right not to testify and that in order not to circumvent such right the trial court refrained from submitting questions prepared by the defence to witness H. The latter had, in any event, explicitly refused to answer any further questions by the trial court itself. The Court recalls in this context that it has recognised that, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6 (see Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, § 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ VI ). The Court further finds it relevant to note that it had been in particular the allegations by the applicant and another accused in the course of the trial, indicating that the witnesses had been involved in the events at issue, that were at the origin of the court ’ s decision to grant the latter the right not to answer questions of the applicant and defence counsel."

Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 116, ECHR 2010 ). It therefore shares the Government ’ s view that the interests of justice were obviously in favour of admitting G. and H. ’ s testimony since otherwise any further prosecution of the accused police officers would have de facto been blocked. It is also recalled in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court ’ s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly and in particular whether the defendant ’ s rights have not been unacceptably restricted and that he or she remains able to participate effectively in the proceedings (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, § 83, 16 December 1999 and Stanford v. the United Kingdom, 23 February 1994, § 26, Series A no. 282 ‑ A)."

In this connection the Court notes that the applicant and defence counsel who were able to observe the witnesses ’ demeanour under questioning (see § 59 above) had an opportunity to challenge the latter ’ s credibility as well as the accuracy of their testimonies in the course of the trial (see Isgrò v. Italy, no. 11339/85, § 36, 19 February 1991). In accordance with sections 257 and 258 of the Code of Criminal Procedure they had the right to comment on and to challenge the statements made by G. and H. directly after the examination of the witnesses by the court and the public prosecutor and once the taking of evidence as a whole had been concluded. The applicant, while not being able to question the witnesses directly, thus nevertheless had the possibility to cast doubt on their credibility and contradict their account of the circumstances of the case (see Asch v. Austria, 26 April 1991, § 29, Series A no. 203 and Accardi and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 30598/02, ECHR 2005 ‑ II ).

Austria, 24 November 1986, § 32, Series A no. 110 ). In view of these inconsistencies in the witnesses ’ statements and given the defendant ’ s inability to examine them, the court itself emphasised that it was required to subject the credibility and accuracy of their testimonies to particular scrutiny."

Consequently, the Regional Court took into account and assessed various aspects that could have put into question the witnesses ’ probity in its thoroughly reasoned judgment, including those invoked by the applicant. The court further referred to the opinion of the psychiatric expert who had thrown light on the motivation and psychological context in which the testimonies had been given. Having regard to the circumstances of the case, the Regional Court provided arguments why there were no grounds to assume that the witnesses had wrongly accused their colleagues or had concealed a possible own involvement in the victim ’ s ill-treatment. The trial court further observed that the witnesses had plausible reasons for their decision not to answer questions by the defence. The Court considers that the arguments advanced by the domestic courts in this respect were not immaterial for their conclusion that the testimonies given by G. and H. were credible and consistent to the extent they concerned the circumstances of the victim ’ s ill-treatment (see De Lorenzo v. Italy (dec.), no. 69264 / 01, 12 February 2004). In these circumstances the Court is satisfied that the necessary care was applied in the evaluation of G. and H. ’ s statements."

In addition, the applicant himself had conceded that he had at least in the cell participated in the victim ’ s ill-treatment. While such elements of evidence taken separately may not have been conclusive for the charges the applicant was found guilty of, these items taken together and in combination with the further factual evidence secured at the crime scene as well as the expert opinions and medical diagnosis specifying the victim ’ s injuries, nevertheless corroborated G. and H. ’ s testimonies. The Court recalls in this context that the witness statements submitted in the course of a trial do not have to cover all the elements of the charges at issue but that some of them can be derived by means of logical reasoning or other material submitted to the acting judge ( ibid.)."

Having regard to the above considerations and the evidence in support of G. and H. ’ s statements, the Court considers that the Regional Court was able to conduct a fair and proper assessment of the latter ’ s reliability. Against this background, and viewing the fairness of the proceedings as a whole, the Court considers that, notwithstanding the handicaps under which the defence laboured, there were sufficient counterbalancing factors to conclude that the admission in evidence of G. and H. ’ s testimonies did not result in a breach of Article 6 § 1 read in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention. The Court further finds that there is nothing to demonstrate that the applicant, who had been represented by counsel throughout the proceedings, did not have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence in breach of Article 6 § 1 read in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (b )."

Finally, as regards the evaluation of the admitted evidence by the trial court, the Court reiterates that Article 6 of the Convention does not lay down any rules on the way evidence should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and national courts. It is not the Court ’ s function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention ( see Garcia Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, ECHR 1999-I). The Court finds that there is nothing to establish that the assessment of the evidence by the domestic courts in the case at hand was arbitrary or that the reasons advanced for their conclusion that there had been a causal connection between the victim ’ s ill-treatment and his subsequent death in hospital, infringed the principle of in dubio pro reo."

In the Court ’ s opinion, the balancing of the interests of the defence against arguments in favour of maintaining the anonymity of witnesses raises special problems if the witnesses in question are members of the State ’ s police force. Although their interests ‒ and indeed those of their families ‒ also deserve protection under the Convention, it must be recognised that their position is to some extent different from that of a disinterested witness or a victim. They owe a general duty of obedience to the State ’ s executive authorities and usually have links with the prosecution; for these reasons alone their use as anonymous witnesses should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 56, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 III). On the other hand, the Court has recognised that, provided that the rights of the defence are respected, it may be legitimate for the police authorities to wish to preserve the anonymity of an agent deployed in undercover activities for his own or his family ’ s protection and so as not to impair his usefulness for future operations (see Lüdi v.

The Supreme Court pointed out in this regard that the defendants had not been convicted of any previous offence, they all enjoyed a good reputation and the offences had been isolated ‒ albeit serious ‒ unlawful actions. The Supreme Court ordered the trial court to reconsider whether it was appropriate to hear testimony from the officer as an anonymous witness."

Although the defendant had not uttered any threats, it was clear, given the nature of the criminal activity, that there was a danger of interference with the officers ’ fundamental rights. The defendant knew the identity of the witnesses and who had testified against him and he might have reacted accordingly. Moreover, he had had a face-to-face confrontation with one of the witnesses pursuant to Article 104 a of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the mere fact that he did not know the identity of the witnesses could not result in a violation of his defence rights or his other basic rights."

The Constitutional Court found that the measure in question had been accompanied by adequate procedural safeguards and had thus been proportionate: the Czech police officers had been heard directly in the courtroom, in the presence of the defendants and their defence counsels, who could have asked questions. There had thus been direct contact between the anonymous witnesses and the court and the other procedural parties. The court, the defendants and their counsels had been able to gain an immediate impression as to how the witnesses gave their testimonies and could take part in the questioning. In the case of a Dutch police officer, who used a false name, he had not been present at the courtroom himself but his testimony and all the questions had been transmitted using technical means and the parties had been allowed to react and to put questions to him.

It does not suffice for the witness subjectively to feel endangered and therefore ask to be heard as an anonymous witness. The criminal justice authorities are under an obligation to assess whether the measure is justified and to give reasons for their conclusion. The second requirement is an obligation on the part of the court to take all the requisite steps to assess the reliability of the witness (compare Article 209 § 2 of the CCP) and the defendant cannot be prevented from doing the same.",

Thus, even though the defence was put in a more difficult position, the degree of the restriction was minimalised. As far as the second requirement was concerned, the courts adduced a large body of evidence and carefully assessed the reliability of particular testimonies.

The Břeclav District Court had merely stated that there had been a legal basis for reading out the records of their testimonies at the hearing and the Brno Regional Court had added that the witnesses were foreign nationals with no ties to the Czech Republic.

The offence had not been a serious one (the applicants were charged with accepting bribes of 10 to 25 EUR), the criminal proceedings had not concerned organised crime, and revealing her identity would not have jeopardised her future professional duties.

The courts had failed to ensure that these requirements were met. The reliability of the truck drivers had not been subjected to any scrutiny, for example by interrogating them further or questioning other individuals known to them.

These witnesses usually travelled outside their country of residence and outside the Czech Republic and they became inaccessible to the authorities once they had left the Czech Republic. Ensuring their appearance before the trial court or questioning them through the medium of international judicial assistance would have required considerable time and financial resources and the whole criminal proceedings would have lasted significantly longer. Moreover, despite the existence of a legal framework offering mutual judicial assistance in criminal matters, in reality the procedure was often difficult and the results uncertain. In the instant case, the seriousness of the offences meant that it was necessary to act expeditiously. In relation to the use of an agent pursuant to Article 158e of the CCP, the Government argued that such a measure had been self-evident in terms of the seriousness of the criminal activity in question and the courts had explained the reasons why her identity had not been disclosed.

These principles may be summarised as follows (see Seton, cited above, § 58, and Poletan and Azirovik, cited above, § 82; for a shorter summary see Paić, cited above, §§ 29-30):",
                "(i) the Court should first examine the preliminary question of whether there was a good reason for admitting the evidence of an absent witness, keeping in mind that witnesses should as a general rule give evidence during the trial and that all reasonable efforts should be made to secure their attendance;",
                "(ii) typical reasons for non-attendance are, as in the case of Al ‑ Khawaja and Tahery (cited above), the death of the witness in question or the fear of retaliation. There are, however, other legitimate reasons why a witness may not attend trial;",
                "(iii) when a witness has not been examined at any prior stage of the proceedings, allowing the admission of a witness statement in lieu of live evidence at trial must be a measure of last resort;",
                "(iv) the admission as evidence of the statements of absent witnesses results in a potential disadvantage for the defendant, who, in principle, in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. In particular, he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence given by such witnesses by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings;",
                "(v) according to the “sole or decisive rule”, if the conviction of a defendant is solely or mainly based on evidence provided by witnesses whom the accused is unable to question at any stage of the proceedings, his defence rights are deemed to have been unduly restricted;",
                "(vi) in this context, the word “decisive” should be narrowly understood as indicating evidence of such significance or importance as is likely to be determinative of the outcome of the case. Where the untested evidence of a witness is supported by other corroborative evidence, the assessment of whether it is decisive will depend on the strength of the supporting evidence: the stronger the other incriminating evidence, the less likely that the evidence of the absent witness will be treated as decisive;",
                "(vii) however, as Article 6 § 3 of the Convention should be interpreted in the context of an overall examination of the fairness of the proceedings, the sole or decisive rule should not be applied in an inflexible manner;",
                "(viii) in particular, where a hearsay statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission as evidence will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 § 1. At the same time, where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. Because of the dangers of the admission of such evidence, it would constitute a very important factor to be balanced in the scales and one which would require sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance to the case."

Those principles have been further clarified in the Schatschaschwili case ( cited above, §§ 111-131), in which the Grand Chamber confirmed that the absence of good reason for the non-attendance of a witness could not, of itself, be conclusive of the lack of fairness of a trial, although it remained a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness, and one which might tip the balance in favour of finding a breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3(d). The Court recalls in this regard that in cases concerning a witness ’ s absence owing to an inability to contact the witness, the domestic courts must, as a rule, have resorted to international legal assistance where a witness resided abroad and such mechanisms were available (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, §121)."

Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant ’ s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton v. the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, §§ 58 and 59, 31 March 2016).",

If there was good reason for the witness ’ s non-attendance in that sense, it follows that there was good reason, or justification, for the trial court to admit the untested statements of the absent witness as evidence (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 119). There are a number of reasons why a witness may not attend trial (see Al ‑ Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, §§ 120-125), including situations where the witness proved to be untraceable (see Tseber v. the Czech Republic, no. 46203/08, § 48, 22 November 2012, and Paić, cited above, § 34)."

However, the absence of “good reason” is not the end of the matter because it is a consideration which is not in itself conclusively indicative of a lack of fairness in a criminal trial, although it constitutes a very important factor to be weighed up in the overall balance, together with the other relevant considerations (see Seton, cited above, § 62).",

                "46. In the Court ’ s opinion, the balancing of the interests of the defence against arguments in favour of maintaining the anonymity of witnesses raises special problems if the witnesses in question are members of the State ’ s police force. Although their interests ‒ and indeed those of their families ‒ also deserve protection under the Convention, it must be recognised that their position is to some extent different from that of a disinterested witness or a victim. They owe a general duty of obedience to the State ’ s executive authorities and usually have links with the prosecution; for these reasons alone their use as anonymous witnesses should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 56, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 III). On the other hand, the Court has recognised that, provided that the rights of the defence are respected, it may be legitimate for the police authorities to wish to preserve the anonymity of an agent deployed in undercover activities for his own or his family ’ s protection and so as not to impair his usefulness for future operations (see Lüdi v. Switzerland, 15 June 1992, § 49, Series A no. 238, and Van Mechelen, cited above, § 57)."

                "47. Turning to the present case, the Court observes that both the District Court and the Regional Court gave as the reason that the agent ’ s identity had not been disclosed the fact that disclosure might impair her usefulness for future operations. In this regard the Court is aware of the difficulties inherent in the police ’ s task of searching for and gathering evidence for the purpose of detecting and investigating offences. To perform this task, they are increasingly obliged to make use of undercover agents, informers and covert practices, particularly in tackling organised crime and corruption (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramanauskas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 74420/01, § 49, ECHR 2008). The interest of the public in ensuring that corrupt practices are prosecuted is beyond doubt and there is also a legitimate interest on the part of the police authorities in corruption cases in preserving the anonymity of an undercover agent for operational reasons (see, mutatis mutandis, Lüdi, cited above, § 49). Therefore, it cannot be said that the Czech courts did not have good reason for concealing the identity of the police agent and hearing her as an anonymous witness.",

Moving on to the second stage of the test in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, that is to say, the question of whether or not the evidence of the absent witness whose statements were admitted in evidence constituted the sole or a decisive basis for the defendant ’ s conviction, the Court reiterates that it should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant ’ s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but was nevertheless satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have constituted a handicap to the defence (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 116, and Seton, cited above, § 59).",

                "49. The Court observes that there is little or nothing in the case file to support the finding that the drivers ’ depositions could be described as “determinative of the outcome of the case”. The trial court based its conclusion regarding the guilt of each of the applicants on two to three different pieces of documentary evidence: primarily it was the written report by the police agent who had witnessed the first and the second applicants accepting bribes and it was corroborated especially by the customs documents bearing the rubber stamps displaying their personal numbers, as well as by the truck drivers ’ travel documents confirming the exact time and place of the customs clearance, supported by the records of the applicants ’ verified presence at work at a particular time (see paragraph 11 above). Moreover, as is apparent from the file, although the truck drivers described the customs officials ’ general practice of accepting bribes, they were unable to describe specific individuals. While, for the above reasons, the testimonies of the truck drivers therefore may not have constituted sole or decisive evidence providing a basis for the applicants ’ conviction, the fact remains that they carried significant weight, and the admission thereof may have entailed a handicap for the defence (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 116).",

                "50. The Court observes that although the statement given by the undercover police agent at the hearing before the District Court on 14 December 2005 assisted the prosecution in confirming the facts of the case, it cannot be described as “determinative of the outcome of the case”. Indeed, the District Court attributed special weight to the documentary evidence, namely the agent ’ s own written report, customs documents bearing the applicants ’ personal rubber stamps, the truck drivers ’ travel documents and other documents proving their presence at the customs office at the exact time of the customs clearance. In this regard the Court reiterates that the assessment of whether or not the evidence is decisive depends on the strength of the supporting evidence (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 123). Therefore, considering the extent and weight of other evidence and bearing in mind the importance ascribed thereto by the national courts, the agent ’ s testimony cannot be treated as decisive. Nevertheless, it still carried significant weight. Consequently, given the need under Article 6 to assess the fairness of the proceedings taken as a whole, the Court still needs to determine whether there existed sufficient factors to counterbalance any handicaps that the admission of that evidence might have entailed for the defence (see Seton, cited above, § 64).",

The Court points out that the following elements were identified by the Grand Chamber in the case of Schatschaschwili as being relevant in this context: the trial court ’ s approach to the untested evidence, the availability and strength of further incriminating evidence, and the procedural measures taken to compensate for the lack of opportunity to directly cross-examine witnesses at the trial (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 145, and Paić, cited above, § 38).",

                "52. The Court observes that in the national courts ’ judgments there is no indication that they approached the statements given by the truck drivers with any specific caution, nor did the fact that they were absent witnesses prompt the national courts to attach less weight to their statements (compare, for example, Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 157, and Paić, cited above, § 43). On the other hand, the Court notes that the trial court carried out a rigorous assessment of all the evidence, and weighed up its value and significance to the proceedings. It is also evident that the national courts had before them, additional incriminating evidence supporting the statements made by the truck drivers, as shown above (see paragraph 11 ). Moreover, the testimonies in question were of a merely corroborative nature as none of the depositions could directly incriminate any of the customs officers and, if anything, showed only certain patterns of behaviour at particular a customs office. As the trial court explained in its judgment, it was other documentary evidence that was decisive for the outcome of the case."
            ],
            [
                "53. In this regard, it should be also noted that the Czech Code of Criminal Procedure provides for measures enabling the prosecution to have the evidence of witnesses whom they expect to become unavailable to testify at trial taken at the pre-trial stage. Article 158 a of the CCP provides for the hearing of a witness before charges are brought where this can be considered necessary as “an urgent or non - repeatable measure” and for the reading out of a witness ’ s statement at the trial if the witness concerned does not attend. The conduct of the investigation at this early stage, including recourse to the measures provided for under Article 158 a of the CCP, was conducted in the presence and under the supervision of a judge (see paragraph 17 above). While this is not in itself a substitute for the defendant ’ s right to examine those who accused him (see Tseber, cited above, § 62), the Court considers that, by ensuring the lawfulness of the procedures followed by the police, it did provide one of the procedural safeguards protecting the right to a fair trial."

The Court takes note of the fact that the applicants had the opportunity to present their own version of events and to cast doubt on the credibility of the absent witnesses, pointing out any incoherence or inconsistency with the other evidence (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 131). In addition, the identities of the witnesses were known to the defence, which was able to identify and investigate any motives they may have had for lying, and the applicants could therefore contest the witnesses ’ credibility effectively, albeit to a lesser extent than in a direct confrontation (see Garofolo v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 4380/09, § 56 2 April 2013, and Brzuszczyński v. Poland, no. 23789/09, § 88, 17 September 2013). As is apparent from the file, the defence did not allege any incoherence or inconsistency in the truck drivers ’ testimonies but rather considered them as poor evidence and in a general way implied that the truck drivers had been promised impunity. The appellate court explained that there were no grounds to assume that these witnesses were motivated by the promise of impunity and ruled out this possibility. The depositions were carried out in the presence of the judges at the Břeclav District Court which supervised the legality of their execution (see paragraph 14 above).",

The Court notes that the domestic legal framework, in the form of Article 209 of the CCP and the accompanying instruction issued by the Ministry of Justice, lays down the detailed conditions under which courts may hear witnesses anonymously. The law provides for two specific procedural safeguards designed to ensure a fair trial and addressing especially matters such as the credibility of evidence : firstly there is the possibility of contesting the reliability of an anonymous witness and the credibility of his or her testimony and, in this regard, the possibility of putting questions to him or her; secondly Article 209 § 2 of the CCP requires the trial court to take all necessary measures to assess the witness ’ s reliability without the submission of any petition in this regard (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above)."

The evidential material in the case file suggests that it organised the hearing of 14 December 2005 especially in order to hear the anonymous witness using voice - streaming media. The witness was questioned in a separate room, her identity having been ascertained by the judge outside the courtroom, and she was instructed as a witness in accordance with the CCP. All eighteen defendants, including the applicants, were properly summoned."

As the transcript of the court hearing shows, all the defendants and their legal representatives had the opportunity to confront the witness, put questions to her directly and comment on her testimony. However, as she was in a separate room, they could not make their own judgment as to her demeanour (see Van Mechelen, cited above, § 62 ). The hearing was attended by only the third applicant. The first and the second applicants excused themselves and their defence counsel authorised a substitute representative to attend the hearing. At the hearing, the third applicant made one comment and asked one question. The representative of the first and the second applicants was inactive. It must therefore be stated that, as far as the first and the second applicant are concerned, they did not attempt to conduct any confrontation with the intention of comparing their stories with the statements of the undercover agent or casting doubt on her credibility. The Court thus considers that, in substance, they may be considered to have waived their right to cross-examine the witness (see, mutatis mutandis, Poletan and Azirovik, cited above, § 87)."

Moreover, the Court finds that even if there is no doubt that the witness ’ s identity remained undisclosed to the defence ‒ given that her personal details and address were withheld from the applicants and their legal representatives ‒ the Court must take into consideration the fact that the applicants knew her, if not by her authentic professional identity, at least by her physical appearance, as a result of having worked with her in the customs office. Therefore, as is not unusual in practice, some disclosure took place in the form of a material used in the course of cross ‑ examination. As the Court already noted, the extent of the disclosure has an impact on the extent of the handicap under which the defence is labouring (see Ellis and Simms v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46099/06, 10 April 2012). In the present case, the defence were able to challenge the reliability of the evidence of the undercover police agent and undermine her version of events, in particular, as the transcript of the court hearing shows, knowing the work-station at which and timeframe during which she had worked at the customs office, the defence argued that she could not physically have seen the customs officers taking bribes."

The Court also notes in this regard the fact that it had apparently not been commonplace to use video conferencing facilities at the time when the witnesses were heard. As regards the anonymous witness, the Court considers in particular that the Czech courts had good reason for concealing the identity of the police agent and hearing her as an anonymous witness (see paragraph 44 above)."

In particular, “as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce ...

The Court observes that the applicant's alleged lack of proficiency in English and his inability to understand the proceedings became a live issue for the first time on 4 January 1996 when the trial court was informed by his legal team that the applicant wished to enter a guilty plea to the charges brought against him. At the request of the applicant's counsel, the trial judge directed that an interpreter be present at the hearing on sentence to be held on 26 January 1996 (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). The judge was thus put on clear notice that the applicant had problems of comprehension. However, notwithstanding his earlier concern to ensure that the applicant could follow the subsequent proceedings it would appear that the judge allowed himself to be persuaded by the applicant's counsel's confidence in his ability to “make do and mend” (see paragraph 17 above). Admittedly, the trial judge left open the possibility of the applicant having recourse to the linguistic assistance of his brother if the need arose. However, in the Court's opinion the verification of the applicant's need for interpretation facilities was a matter for the judge to determine in consultation with the applicant, especially since he had been alerted to counsel's own difficulties in communicating with the applicant. It is to be noted that the applicant had pleaded guilty to serious charges and faced a heavy prison sentence. The onus was thus on the judge to reassure himself that the absence of an interpreter at the hearing on 26 January 1996 would not prejudice the applicant's full involvement in a matter of crucial importance for him. In the circumstances of the instant case, that requirement cannot be said to have been satisfied by leaving it to the applicant, and without the judge having consulted the latter, to invoke the untested language skills of his brother."

However, the restaurant was run by a succession of management companies under short-term management contracts. The various companies were all registered for Value Added Tax (“VAT”) purposes but failed to make any VAT payments or returns to the Customs and Excise authorities. In addition, wages were paid to employees in cash and were not declared to the Inland Revenue.

To follow this practice may be inconvenient in some cases, and may cause some further expenditure of time; but such a procedure is more in consonance with that scrupulous care of the accused's interest which has distinguished the administration of justice in our criminal courts, and therefore it is better to adopt it.”"

The Court observes that the applicant's alleged lack of proficiency in English and his inability to understand the proceedings became a live issue for the first time on 4 January 1996 when the trial court was informed by his legal team that the applicant wished to enter a guilty plea to the charges brought against him. At the request of the applicant's counsel, the trial judge directed that an interpreter be present at the hearing on sentence to be held on 26 January 1996 (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). The judge was thus put on clear notice that the applicant had problems of comprehension. However, notwithstanding his earlier concern to ensure that the applicant could follow the subsequent proceedings it would appear that the judge allowed himself to be persuaded by the applicant's counsel's confidence in his ability to “make do and mend” (see paragraph 17 above). Admittedly, the trial judge left open the possibility of the applicant having recourse to the linguistic assistance of his brother if the need arose. However, in the Court's opinion the verification of the applicant's need for interpretation facilities was a matter for the judge to determine in consultation with the applicant, especially since he had been alerted to counsel's own difficulties in communicating with the applicant. It is to be noted that the applicant had pleaded guilty to serious charges and faced a heavy prison sentence. The onus was thus on the judge to reassure himself that the absence of an interpreter at the hearing on 26 January 1996 would not prejudice the applicant's full involvement in a matter of crucial importance for him. In the circumstances of the instant case, that requirement cannot be said to have been satisfied by leaving it to the applicant, and without the judge having consulted the latter, to invoke the untested language skills of his brother."

This situation typically arises when, as in the present case, deportation is delayed as a result of the indication by the Court of an interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.

The assessment must focus on the foreseeable consequences of the applicant ’ s removal to the country of destination, in the light of the general situation there and of his or her personal circumstances (see, for example, Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. 1948/04, § 136, 11 January 2007; and Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 107 and 108).”"

The first applicant stated that he had not received any personal threats since 2008 as the family had repeatedly moved around. The son (the third applicant) had spent most of his time indoors for fear of attacks and had only attended school for his final examinations.

                "The current country information, however, shows that there are serious shortcomings in the police ’ s work on crime-scene investigations and inquests. One of the reasons is probably that many police officers are relatively new and lack experience, and that it takes time to introduce a new method of investigation based on technical evidence. This problem is naturally accentuated by the fact that many individual police officers live under a threat emanating from different terrorist groups, which is likely to diminish their effectiveness. Nevertheless, the current country information shows that the number of suspects who have been prosecuted during the past few years has increased significantly. Even if fewer than half of all suspects are eventually prosecuted, this is still an improvement.",

Instances of police infiltration, which were previously widespread, have decreased significantly. The leading representatives of the police authority have expressed both their willingness and their ambition to maintain general security in Iraq. The current country information also shows that it has become more difficult for al-Qaeda Iraq to operate freely in Iraq and that there has been a significant decline in sectarian violence. Today violence is mainly aimed at individual targets, especially civil servants, police, security forces and some minorities.",

For this reason [the first applicant] has been exposed to two murder attempts, his brother has been kidnapped and [the first and second applicant] ’ s daughter has been killed. Furthermore, on several occasions, [the first applicant] has suffered physical damage to his house and stock. [The first and second applicants] are convinced that al-Qaeda is behind these abuses. The family are also afraid of al-Qaeda in the event of their return.",
                "The Migration Agency notes that [the first applicant] stopped working for the Americans in 2008 after his and [the second applicant] ’ s daughter was killed. The Migration Agency further notes that [the first applicant] stayed in Baghdad until December 2010 and that [the second and third applicants] lived in Baghdad until September 2011. During this period they were not exposed to any direct abuses. [The first applicant] has, however, been indirectly threatened on four or five occasions by the people who guard his stock. Also, his stock has been attacked. [The first and second applicants] explained that they had managed to escape from abuses because they were in hiding and living in different places in Baghdad. The Migration Agency notes that [the first and second applicants] have two daughters who live with their grandmother in Baghdad and a daughter who is married and lives with her family in Baghdad. These family members have not been exposed to any threats or abuses.",
                "The Migration Agency notes that the abuses which the family claim to be at risk of being exposed to are criminal acts which their home country ’ s authorities have a duty to prosecute. In order to decide whether the family can enjoy protection against the abuses they fear, the Migration Agency notes the following.",
                "In accordance with the principle that it is for an asylum-seeker to justify his or her need for protection and that it is primarily for the applicant to provide relevant information for the assessment in the case, the onus must be on the applicant to plead that he or she cannot or, owing to a severe fear of the consequences, for example, will not avail himself or herself of the protection of the authorities available in Iraq. In addition, the applicant must justify this. The shortcomings which still exist in the Iraqi legal system are then to be noted and evaluated in the context of the individual assessment of each asylum case. The circumstances on which an applicant relies in arguing that protection by the authorities is deficient are first of all examined in the usual way. In those cases in which the alleged risk of persecution or other abuses does not emanate from the authorities, which as a rule is the case in Iraq, the applicant must show what efforts he or she has made to be afforded protection by the authorities. The applicant can do this either by relying on evidence or by giving a credible account of events which appear plausible. When assessing the authorities ’ ability to protect against threats of violence emanating from terrorist groups or unknown perpetrators in a specific case, the individual ’ s situation, as well as the severity of the violence or threats, their nature and their local reach, must be assessed individually (see Migration Agency, Legal opinion on protection by the authorities in Iraq, 5 April 2011, Lifos 24948).",

[The first and second applicants] never turned to the Iraqi authorities for protection. [The first applicant] has stated that the Iraqi authorities lack the capacity to protect the family. Further, he has stated that he did not dare to turn to the authorities because he would then have been forced to disclose his address, which could have resulted in al-Qaeda being able to find him. [The second applicant] has stated that al-Qaeda works together with the authorities. As stated earlier, the Migration Agency finds that there has been a significant decline in instances of police infiltration, which previously were widespread. Against the background of the fact that [the first and second applicants] have not even tried to seek the protection of the Iraqi authorities, the Migration Agency considers that they have not made a plausible case that they would not have access to protection by the authorities in the event of potential threats from al-Qaeda upon returning to Iraq.",
                "Against this background, the Migration Agency finds that [the first and second applicants] have not made a plausible case that the Iraqi authorities lack the capacity and the will to protect the family from being exposed to persecution within the meaning of Chapter 4, section 1, of the Aliens Act or to abuses within the meaning of Chapter 4, section 2, first subsection, first point, first line, of the Aliens Act. The Migration Agency notes in this context that there is no armed conflict in Iraq. The Migration Agency therefore finds that the family are not to be regarded as refugees or as being in need of alternative or other protection, for which reason the family do not have the right to refugee status or alternative protection status.",

Nevertheless, against the background of the above reasoning, the Migration Agency finds that the family also cannot be regarded as being otherwise in need of protection, within the meaning of Chapter 4, section 2a, first subsection, of the Aliens Act. The family do not therefore have any right to a status falling under any other need of protection.",

Many of those who have remained in ISIS-controlled areas are taking up the invitation and publicly repenting. The practice, however, is not without risks, as it allows ISIS to collect names, addresses, ID numbers and other identification details of thousands of men, who it could decide to target later.",

                "This briefing is based on a two-week investigation in northern Iraq, during which Amnesty International visited the cities of Mosul, Kirkuk, Dohuk and Erbil and surrounding towns and villages in these areas, and the camps for displaced people in al-Khazer/Kalak and Garmawa; and met with survivors and relatives of victims of attacks perpetrated by ISIS and by government forces and allied militias, civilians displaced by the conflict, members and representatives of minorities, religious figures, local civil society organizations, international organizations assisting the displaced, and Peshmerga military commanders.

                "Where armed actors operate in populated residential areas, the warring parties must take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians. They must take precautions to protect civilians and civilian objects under their control against the effects of attacks by the adversary, including by avoiding – to the maximum extent feasible – locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas. International humanitarian law also expressly prohibits tactics such as using ‘ human shields ’ to prevent attacks on military targets. However, failure by one side to separate its fighters from civilians and civilian objects does not relieve its opponent of its obligation under international humanitarian law to direct attacks only at combatants and military objectives and to take all necessary precautions in attacks to spare civilians and civilian objects. International humanitarian law prohibits intentional attacks directed against civilians not taking part in hostilities, indiscriminate attacks (which do not distinguish between civilian and military targets), and disproportionate attacks (which may be expected to cause incidental harm to civilians that would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated). Such attacks constitute war crimes. These rules apply equally to all parties to armed conflicts at all times without exception.",
                "The conflict in northern Iraq has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, who have fled to neighbouring Kurdish areas administered by the KRG. Most are living in dire conditions, some in camps for internally displaced people (IDPs) and others sheltering in schools, mosques, churches and with host communities. At first civilians who fled after ISIS captured large areas of north-western Iraq were being allowed to enter the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), but in recent weeks access for non-Kurdish Iraqis has been severely restricted by the KRG. Some of those who fled are seeking refuge in the KRI while others, mostly Shi ’ a Turkmen and Shabak, want to travel southwards to the capital and beyond where the majority of the population is Shi ’ a and where they feel they would be safer.",
                "While the Iraqi central government remains beset by political and sectarian divisions, and the KRG appears increasingly focused on annexing more territory to the areas it controls, Iraqi civilians caught up in the conflict are finding it increasingly difficult to find protection and assistance.",
                "Amnesty International calls on all parties to the conflict to put an immediate end to the killing of captives and the abduction of civilians; to treat detainees humanely at all times; to refrain from carrying out indiscriminate attacks, including the use of artillery shelling and unguided aerial bombardments in areas with large concentrations of civilians. It also reiterates its call on the KRG to allow civilians who are fleeing the fighting – whatever their religion or ethnicity – to seek refuge in and safe passage through KRG-controlled areas.”"

                "1. Since the publication of UNHCR ’ s 2012 Iraq Eligibility Guidelines and the 2012 Aide Mémoire relating to Palestinian refugees in Iraq, Iraq has experienced a new surge in violence between Iraqi security forces (ISF) and Kurdish forces ( Peshmerga ) on the one hand and the group ‘ Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham ’ (hereafter ISIS), which operates both in Iraq and Syria, and affiliated armed groups on the other hand. Civilians are killed and wounded every day as a result of this surge of violence, including suicide attacks and car bombs, shelling, airstrikes, and executions. As a result of advances by ISIS, the Government of Iraq is reported to have lost full or partial control over considerable parts of the country ’ s territory, particularly in Al-Anbar, Ninewa, Salah Al-Din, Kirkuk and Diyala governorates. Although the ISF and Kurdish forces, supported by US airstrikes, have recently regained control over some localities, mostly along the internal boundaries with the Kurdistan Region, overall frontlines remain fluid. The conflict, which re-escalated in Al-Anbar governorate in January 2014 and since then spread to other governorates, has been labelled as a non-international armed conflict. Casualties so far in 2014 represent the highest total since the height of sectarian conflict in 2006-2007.",
                "27. As the situation in Iraq remains highly fluid and volatile, and since all parts of the country are reported to have been affected, directly or indirectly, by the ongoing crisis, UNHCR urges States not to forcibly return persons originating from Iraq until tangible improvements in the security and human rights situation have occurred. In the current circumstances, many persons fleeing Iraq are likely to meet the 1951 Convention criteria for refugee status. When, in the context of the adjudication of an individual case of a person originating from Iraq, 1951 Convention criteria are found not to apply, broader refugee criteria as contained in relevant regional instruments or complementary forms of protection are likely to apply. In the current circumstances, with massive new internal displacement coupled with a large-scale humanitarian crisis, mounting sectarian tensions and reported access restrictions, particularly into the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, UNHCR does in principle not consider it appropriate for States to deny persons from Iraq international protection on the basis of the applicability of an internal flight or relocation alternative. Depending on the profile of the individual case, exclusion considerations may need to be examined.”"

                "53. The relevant parts of the UNHCR 1998 Note on Burden and Standard of Proof in Refugee Claims state as follows:",
                "5. Facts in support of refugee claims are established by adducing proof or evidence of the alleged facts. Evidence may be oral or documentary. The duty to produce evidence in order affirmatively to prove such alleged facts, is termed ‘ burden of proof ’.",
                "6. According to general legal principles of the law of evidence, the burden of proof lies on the person who makes the assertion. Thus, in refugee claims, it is the applicant who has the burden of establishing the veracity of his/her allegations and the accuracy of the facts on which the refugee claim is based. The burden of proof is discharged by the applicant rendering a truthful account of facts relevant to the claim so that, based on the facts, a proper decision may be reached. In view of the particularities of a refugee ’ s situation, the adjudicator shares the duty to ascertain and evaluate all the relevant facts. This is achieved, to a large extent, by the adjudicator being familiar with the objective situation in the country of origin concerned, being aware of relevant matters of common knowledge, guiding the applicant in providing the relevant information and adequately verifying facts alleged which can be substantiated.",
                "III. Standard of Proof – General Framework and Definitional Issues",
                "7. In the context of the applicant ’ s responsibility to prove facts in support of his/her claim, the term ‘ standard of proof ’ means the threshold to be met by the applicant in persuading the adjudicator as to the truth of his/her factual assertions. Facts which need to be ‘ proved ’ are those which concern the background and personal experiences of the applicant which purportedly have given rise to fear of persecution and the resultant unwillingness to avail himself/herself of the protection of the country of origin.",
                "8. In common law countries, the law of evidence relating to criminal prosecutions requires cases to be proved ‘ beyond reasonable doubt ’. In civil claims, the law does not require this high standard; rather the adjudicator has to decide the case on a ‘ balance of probabilities ’. Similarly in refugee claims, there is no necessity for the adjudicator to have to be fully convinced of the truth of each and every factual assertion made by the applicant. The adjudicator needs to decide if, based on the evidence provided as well as the veracity of the applicant ’ s statements, it is likely that the claim of that applicant is credible.",
                "9. Obviously the applicant has the duty to tell the truth. In saying this though, consideration should also be given to the fact that, due to the applicant ’ s traumatic experiences, he/she may not speak freely; or that due to time lapse or the intensity of past events, the applicant may not be able to remember all factual details or to recount them accurately or may confuse them; thus he/she may be vague or inaccurate in providing detailed facts. Inability to remember or provide all dates or minor details, as well as minor inconsistencies, insubstantial vagueness or incorrect statements which are not material may be taken into account in the final assessment on credibility, but should not be used as decisive factors.",
                "10. As regards supportive evidence, where there is corroborative evidence supporting the statements of the applicant, this would reinforce the veracity of the statements made. On the other hand, given the special situation of asylum-seekers, they should not be required to produce all necessary evidence. In particular, it should be recognised that, often, asylum-seekers would have fled without their personal documents. Failure to produce documentary evidence to substantiate oral statements should, therefore, not prevent the claim from being accepted if such statements are consistent with known facts and the general credibility of the applicant is good.",
                "11. In assessing the overall credibility of the applicant ’ s claim, the adjudicator should take into account such factors as the reasonableness of the facts alleged, the overall consistency and coherence of the applicant ’ s story, corroborative evidence adduced by the applicant in support of his/her statements, consistency with common knowledge or generally known facts, and the known situation in the country of origin. Credibility is established where the applicant has presented a claim which is coherent and plausible, not contradicting generally known facts, and therefore is, on balance, capable of being believed.",
                "12. The term ‘ benefit of the doubt ’ is used in the context of standard of proof relating to the factual assertions made by the applicant. Given that in refugee claims, there is no necessity for the applicant to prove all facts to such a standard that the adjudicator is fully convinced that all factual assertions are true, there would normally be an element of doubt in the mind of the adjudicator as regards the facts asserted by the applicant. Where the adjudicator considers that the applicant ’ s story is on the whole coherent and plausible, any element of doubt should not prejudice the applicant ’ s claim; that is, the applicant should be given the ‘ benefit of the doubt ’.",

                "13. The phrase ‘ well-founded fear of being persecuted ’ is the key phrase of the refugee definition. Although the expression ‘ well-founded fear ’ contains two elements, one subjective (fear) and one objective (well-founded), both elements must be evaluated together.",
                "14. In this context, the term ‘ fear ’ means that the person believes or anticipates that he/she will be subject to that persecution. This is established very largely by what the person presents as his/her state of mind on departure. Normally, the statement of the applicant will be accepted as significant demonstration of the existence of the fear, assuming there are no facts giving rise to serious credibility doubts on the point. The applicant must, in addition, demonstrate that the fear alleged is well-founded.",
                "15. The drafting history of the Convention is instructive on this issue. One of the categories of ‘ refugees ’ referred to in Annex I of the IRO Constitution, is that of persons who ‘ expressed valid objections to returning ’ to their countries, ‘ valid objection ’ being defined as ‘ persecution, or fear, based on reasonable grounds of persecution ’. The IRO Manual declared that ‘ reasonable grounds ’ were to be understood as meaning that the applicant has given ‘ a plausible and coherent account of why he fears persecution ’. The Ad Hoc Committee on Statelessness and Related Problems adopted the expression ‘ well-founded fear of persecution ’ rather than adhered to the wording of the IRO Constitution. In commenting on this phrase, in its Final Report the Ad Hoc Committee stated that ‘ well-founded fear ’ means that a person can show ‘ good reason ’ why he fears persecution.",
                "16. The Handbook states that an applicant ’ s fear of persecution should be considered well-founded if he ‘ can establish, to a reasonable degree, that his continued stay in his country of origin has become intolerable... ’.",
                "17. A substantial body of jurisprudence has developed in common law countries on what standard of proof is to be applied in asylum claims to establish well-foundedness. This jurisprudence largely supports the view that there is no requirement to prove well-foundedness conclusively beyond doubt, or even that persecution is more probable than not. To establish ‘ well-foundedness ’, persecution must be proved to be reasonably possible. Attached as an annex is an overview of some recent jurisprudence, by country.",
                "Indicators for assessing well-foundedness of fear",
                "18. While by nature, an evaluation of risk of persecution is forward-looking and therefore inherently somewhat speculative, such an evaluation should be made based on factual considerations which take into account the personal circumstances of the applicant as well as the elements relating to the situation in the country of origin.",
                "19. The applicant ’ s personal circumstances would include his/her background, experiences, personality and any other personal factors which could expose him/her to persecution. In particular, whether the applicant has previously suffered persecution or other forms of mistreatment and the experiences of relatives and friends of the applicant as well as those persons in the same situation as the applicant are relevant factors to be taken into account. Relevant elements concerning the situation in the country of origin would include general social and political conditions, the country ’ s human rights situation and record; the country ’ s legislation; the persecuting agent ’ s policies or practices, in particular towards persons who are in similar situation as the applicant, etc. While past persecution or mistreatment would weigh heavily in favour of a positive assessment of risk of future persecution, its absence is not a decisive factor. By the same token, the fact of past persecution is not necessarily conclusive of the possibility of renewed persecution, particularly where there has been an important change in the conditions in the country of origin. ”"

Paragraphs 196 and 197 of the Handbook state as follows:",
                "“ 196. It is a general legal principle that the burden of proof lies on the person submitting a claim. Often, however, an applicant may not be able to support his statements by documentary or other proof, and cases in which an applicant can provide evidence of all his statements will be the exception rather than the rule. In most cases a person fleeing from persecution will have arrived with the barest necessities and very frequently even without personal documents. Thus, while the burden of proof in principle rests on the applicant, the duty to ascertain and evaluate all the relevant facts is shared between the applicant and the examiner. Indeed, in some cases, it may be for the examiner to use all the means at his disposal to produce the necessary evidence in support of the application. Even such independent research may not, however, always be successful and there may also be statements that are not susceptible of proof. In such cases, if the applicant ’ s account appears credible, he should, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, be given the benefit of the doubt.",
                "197. The requirement of evidence should thus not be too strictly applied in view of the difficulty of proof inherent in the special situation in which an applicant for refugee status finds himself. Allowance for such possible lack of evidence does not, however, mean that unsupported statements must necessarily be accepted as true if they are inconsistent with the general account put forward by the applicant. ”",

The Chamber underlined that the Migration Agency had not found the applicants or the documents submitted on these points to be credible.

Moreover, it observed that the evidence submitted to the domestic courts as well as to the Court, allegedly certifying that al-Qaeda had also searched for the first applicant in September 2011 and that his house had been burned down on 12 November 2011, was very simple in nature, such as to cast doubt on its authenticity.

The Swedish authorities were not convinced that the recording had dated from February 2010 or that the applicants would be unable to obtain protection from the Iraqi authorities because the first applicant had publicly criticised them during the debate.

It had chosen to ignore parts of the applicants ’ evidence, finding that the last threat from al-Qaeda had occurred in 2008. Concerning the threats from 2008 onwards, the applicants claimed that the Swedish authorities and courts had dismissed the evidence submitted by them and had found that it was not likely that there were threats against the first applicant in his home country. It was common in the Swedish asylum process for evidence submitted by asylum-seekers to be investigated in order to ascertain its credibility. However, in the present case, the domestic authorities had categorically dismissed the evidence submitted by the applicants without making any effort to investigate its veracity by, for example, contacting the Iraqi authorities or the Alhurra media channel. They had thus not fulfilled their obligations under Articles 3 and 6 of the Convention. Had the Swedish authorities – and the Chamber – had any doubts about the credibility of the evidence submitted, they should first have made a well-informed decision on whether or not to accept it as credible. Had they correctly evaluated the evidence submitted, their assessment would most likely have been different from the one they had made in their decisions.

If an asylum-seeker ’ s general credibility was not called into question, he or she should make an honest effort to support his or her oral submissions. In the assessment of the credibility of the submissions, importance should be placed on whether they were coherent and not contradictory, and whether their essential elements remained unchanged during the asylum proceedings. In the first applicant ’ s case there had been no reason to call his credibility into question. There had been a natural reason for invoking his political activities late in the asylum process: he had not been afforded an opportunity to give a complete account of his arguments in his asylum interview and therefore he had focused on the most urgent threat, namely that posed by al-Qaeda. Whether the televised public debate had been aired in 2008 or 2010 did not in any way invalidate or mitigate the first applicant ’ s credibility or the threat level against him. The fact that the debate had been aired should have been a sufficient reason to take it seriously and investigate it. The only reason why the first applicant had not been subjected to ill-treatment between 2008 and 2011 was that he had been in hiding."

If a threat from government agencies had existed before he had fled to Sweden, the threat would continue to exist upon his return. Should he be forced to return, he would have to deny his identity and hide from the government authorities, and this would be in clear breach of the Convention. Available country information suggested that former employees of the American troops were placed in a vulnerable situation. Besides being regarded as traitors to their homeland by al-Qaeda, they were now also under threat from ISIS, who saw them as direct targets.

The ill-treatment he had suffered was in essence comparable to torture. On the sole basis of the incidents to which he had referred, the burden of proof should have been placed on the Swedish authorities and not on him. The incidents referred to and the ill-treatment suffered by the first applicant were also indicative of the assessment of the potential threats and risks he was likely to face on his return. As the domestic authorities had accepted that all these incidents had actually taken place, the incidents at issue should have been the starting-point for a forward-looking threat assessment. The Swedish authorities should have presented enough arguments to counter this threat assessment on the basis of actual events. Since they had failed to do so, the assumption had to be that the same threat scenario still persisted. The Swedish authorities should also have taken into consideration the first applicant ’ s previous experiences and his vulnerability resulting from cooperation with the American forces in Iraq. The Iraqi authorities would not be able to protect him if he needed protection in the future. The burden of proof should have rested with the Swedish authorities, which had not been able to prove that the first applicant would not be subjected to any ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention if returned to his home country."

According to the most recent information provided by the Migration Agency, the intensity of violence in Baghdad still did not constitute a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.

Concerning the applicants ’ personal circumstances, the Government noted that the first applicant had not mentioned his alleged persecution by al-Qaeda in his interviews which had taken place only a few weeks after the alleged incident, and that the documents submitted in support of that allegation had been of a very simple nature, thus casting doubt on their authenticity. The Government agreed with the Chamber that the applicants had not substantiated their allegation that they had been persecuted by al-Qaeda after 2008. The Government stressed that the first applicant had not provided any evidence that he had been subjected to any personal threats since 2008. He had stayed in Baghdad until December 2010 and his wife and son until September 2011 without being subjected to any direct threats or assaults. Two of his daughters still lived in Baghdad and had not been subjected to any threats. As the attacks on the first applicant had been focused on those years when he had had a business contract with the American forces and had ceased thereafter, it was likely that the threats and attacks were not linked to him personally but rather were intended to deter him from cooperating with the Americans. Moreover, the first applicant had never asked the Iraqi authorities for any protection. The Government maintained that the applicants had failed to show that they had been unable to be granted protection by the Iraqi authorities."

When he had done so in his subsequent submissions, he had initially claimed that the debate had taken place in February 2008, then in February 2010. The DVD of the debate submitted as evidence clearly indicated that the recording had not been made after 4 March 2008. The Chamber had agreed with the Government that the applicants had failed to show either that the recording had been made after 4 March 2008 or that the first applicant risked being persecuted on account of it."

                "The Government submitted that the available country-of-origin information showed that the general situation in Baghdad in 2008, with groups linked to al-Qaeda threatening and punishing anyone cooperating or working with American or Western forces, no longer prevailed. Instead, current country-of-origin information indicated that the greatest threat in relation to the general situation in Baghdad today emanated from ISIS, which was seeking to persecute Shia Muslims in general and other religious minorities.",
                "In the applicants ’ case, the threats and the violence had been closely connected to the first applicant ’ s cooperation with the American forces. As this cooperation had long since ceased, the situation for the applicants had changed. Furthermore, according to country-of-origin information, the Iraqi authorities were no longer deemed to be infiltrated by terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda or ISIS, contrary to the applicants ’ contention. While such groups had their origins in Sunni extremist groups, the authorities in Baghdad were dominated by the Shiite community.",

As to the issue of burden of proof, the Government noted that, according to Swedish case-law, the UNHCR Handbook was an important source of law and the UNHCR reports and recommendations an important source of guidance which, however, had to be balanced against information about the situation in a given country. According to the domestic case-law, a person applying for a residence permit bore the initial burden of proving that the actual circumstances required for a residence permit to be granted were in place. While the initial burden of proof lay with the applicant, the obligation to elicit and evaluate the relevant facts was shared between the applicant and the migration authorities and courts. According to the travaux préparatoires to the Swedish Aliens Act, the standard of proof could not be set too high for claims concerning the risk of persecution as it was rarely possible to present solid evidence that could clearly confirm the existence of such a risk. It was often necessary to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt when all available evidence had been obtained and checked and when the examiner was satisfied with the applicant ’ s general credibility. A prerequisite for the benefit of the doubt was that the applicant ’ s statement was coherent and not contradictory and that the essence of the statement remained unchanged during the asylum procedure."

According to the principle that the courts had ultimate responsibility for investigations, as set forth in section 8 of the Administrative Court Procedure Act, the Migration Court had to take all relevant circumstances into account and ensure that the investigation of the case was adequate and complete. The Migration Agency had an obligation to provide service and guidance and to investigate. It had to help individuals to take advantage of their rights and guide them by taking the initiative to conduct further investigations, depending on the circumstances. In asylum cases this obligation to investigate was even more far-reaching. Moreover, according to the domestic case-law, the threshold for evidence was set higher for circumstances that could reasonably be confirmed by the applicant but lower for circumstances that were more difficult to prove."

The Government noted that, in the present case, the first applicant ’ s account of the risk of persecution by al-Qaeda until 2008 was essentially consistent and detailed, did not contain contradictory information, and was supported by relevant country-of-origin information. He had thus discharged his burden of proof and was therefore entitled to be given the benefit of the doubt. However, as the applicants had not sought asylum until December 2010 and September 2011, they had to plausibly establish that, as matters stood at the time of the domestic proceedings, they would still face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention upon returning to Baghdad. They had failed to discharge this burden of proof. It was only after the Migration Agency had denied the applicants residence permits that they had come up with new claims and evidence which had been incoherent and contradictory. As the essence of their account had changed, they could not be given the benefit of the doubt. As there was a lack of credibility, the domestic authorities and courts had no reason to investigate these claims any further. The applicants ’ situation had changed after 2008 and their need for protection had ceased. During the domestic proceedings the migration authorities had taken all relevant circumstances into account and ensured that the investigation of the case was adequate and complete.

In the present case the alleged persecution of the applicants had been carried out by non-State actors.

Sweden ([GC], no. 43611/11, ECHR 2016). The relevant paragraphs of the latter judgment read as follows :",
                "“111. The Court reiterates that Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations, including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens (see, for example, Hirsi Jamaa and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 27765/09, § 113, ECHR 2012; Üner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, § 54, ECHR 2006-XII; Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 67, Series A no. 94; and Boujlifa v. France, 21 October 1997, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VI). However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the destination country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, §§ 124-125, ECHR 2008).",
                "112. The assessment of whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces such a real risk inevitably requires the Court to examine the conditions in the destination country in the light of the standards of Article 3 of the Convention (see Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 67, ECHR 2005-I). These standards entail that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this level is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (see Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, § 60, ECHR 2001-II).",

Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention applies not only to the danger emanating from State authorities but also where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (see NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, § 110, 17 July 2008; F.H. v. Sweden, no. 32621/06, § 102, 20 January 2009; and H.L.R. v. France, 29 April 1997, § 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ III )."

The Court reiterates that Article 3 does not, as such, preclude Contracting States from placing reliance on the existence of an internal flight alternative in their assessment of an individual ’ s claim that a return to his country of origin would expose him to a real risk of being subjected to treatment proscribed by that provision (see Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. 1948/04, § 141, 11 January 2007; Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, § 98, Reports 1996-V; and Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, §§ 67-68, ECHR 2001-II)."

Therefore, as a precondition of relying on an internal flight alternative, certain guarantees have to be in place: the person to be expelled must be able to travel to the area concerned, gain admittance and settle there, failing which an issue under Article 3 may arise, the more so if in the absence of such guarantees there is a possibility of his ending up in a part of the country of origin where he may be subjected to ill-treatment (see Salah Sheekh, cited above, § 141, and Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom, nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07, § 266, 28 June 2011).",

If the applicant has not already been deported, the material point in time for the assessment must be that of the Court ’ s consideration of the case (see Chahal, cited above, § 86). A full and ex nunc evaluation is required where it is necessary to take into account information that has come to light after the final decision by the domestic authorities was taken (see, for example, Maslov v. Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, §§ 87-95, ECHR 2008 and Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 215). This situation typically arises when, as in the present case, deportation is delayed as a result of the indication by the Court of an interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. Since the nature of the Contracting States ’ responsibility under Article 3 in cases of this kind lies in the act of exposing an individual to the risk of ill treatment, the existence of the risk must be assessed primarily with reference to those facts which were known or ought to have been known by the Contracting State at the time of the expulsion. The assessment must focus on the foreseeable consequences of the applicant ’ s removal to the country of destination, in the light of the general situation there and of his or her personal circumstances (see, for example, Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. 1948/04, § 136, 11 January 2007; and Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 107 and 108).”"

                "“117. In cases concerning the expulsion of asylum-seekers, the Court does not itself examine the actual asylum applications or verify how the States honour their obligations under the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees. Its main concern is whether effective guarantees exist that protect the applicant against arbitrary refoulement, be it direct or indirect, to the country from which he or she has fled. By virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the guaranteed rights and freedoms is laid on the national authorities. The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. This subsidiary character is articulated in Articles 13 and 35 § 1 of the Convention (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, §§ 286-287, ECHR 2011). The Court must be satisfied, however, that the assessment made by the authorities of the Contracting State is adequate and sufficiently supported by domestic materials as well as by materials originating from other reliable and objective sources such as, for instance, other Contracting or third States, agencies of the United Nations and reputable non-governmental organisations (see, among other authorities, NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, § 119, 17 July 2008).",

However, it is clear that not every situation of general violence will give rise to such a risk. On the contrary, the Court has made it clear that a general situation of violence would only be of sufficient intensity to create such a risk ‘ in the most extreme cases ’ where there was a real risk of ill-treatment simply by virtue of an individual being exposed to such violence on return (see Sufi and Elmi, cited above, §§ 216 and 218.

The following elements may represent such risk factors: previous criminal record and/or arrest warrant, the age, gender and origin of a returnee, a previous record as a suspected or actual member of a persecuted group, and a previous asylum claim submitted abroad (see NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 143-144 and 146)."

Asylum-seekers are normally the only parties who are able to provide information about their own personal circumstances. Therefore, as far as the individual circumstances are concerned, the burden of proof should in principle lie on the applicants, who must submit, as soon as possible, all evidence relating to their individual circumstances that is needed to substantiate their application for international protection. This requirement is also expressed both in the UNHCR documents (see paragraph 6 of the UNHCR Note on Burden and Standard of Proof in Refugee Claims and paragraph 196 of the UNHCR Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status, both referred to in paragraphs 53-54 above) and in Article 4 § 1 of the EU Qualification Directive, as well as in the subsequent case-law of the CJEU (see paragraphs 47 and 49-50 above)."

In respect of such matters, the domestic authorities examining a request for international protection have full access to information. For this reason, the general situation in another country, including the ability of its public authorities to provide protection, has to be established proprio motu by the competent domestic immigration authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, H.L.R. v. France, cited above, § 37; Hilal, cited above, § 60; and Hirsi Jamaa and Others, cited above, § 116). A similar approach is advocated in paragraph 6 of the above-mentioned Note issued by the UNHCR, according to which the authorities adjudicating on an asylum claim have to take “the objective situation in the country of origin concerned” into account proprio motu. Similarly, Article 4 § 3 of the Qualification Directive requires that “all relevant facts as they relate to the country of origin” are taken into account.",

Specific issues arise when an asylum-seeker alleges that he or she has been ill-treated in the past, since past ill-treatment may be relevant for assessing the level of risk of future ill-treatment. According to the established case-law, in the evaluation of the risk of future ill-treatment it is necessary to take due account of the fact that the applicant has made a plausible case that he or she was subjected to ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention in the past. For example, in R.C. v. Sweden, in which the applicant had already been tortured, the Court considered that “the onus rest[ed] with the State to dispel any doubts about the risk of his being subjected again to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the event that his expulsion proceeded” (see R.C. v. Sweden, cited above, § 55). In R.J. v. France, while sharing the French Government ’ s doubts as to the claims made by the applicant, a Tamil from Sri Lanka, concerning the conditions of his detention and his financial support for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the Court found that the Government had failed to effectively rebut the strong presumption raised by the medical certificate of treatment contrary to Article 3 (see R.J. v. France, no. 10466/11, § 42, 19 September 2013). In the case of D.N.W. v. Sweden the Court concluded that “the applicant ha[d] failed to make it plausible that he would face a real risk of being killed or subjected to ill-treatment upon return to Ethiopia” even though it accepted that the applicant had been detained and subjected to ill-treatment by the Ethiopian authorities in the past (see D.N.W. v.

Furthermore, this issue, which is closely linked with the general questions of assessment of evidence, is addressed in paragraph 19 of the UNHCR Note on Burden and Standard of Proof in Refugee Claims, dealing with indicators for assessing the well-foundedness of a fear of persecution, which states as follows: “While past persecution or mistreatment would weigh heavily in favour of a positive assessment of risk of future persecution, its absence is not a decisive factor. By the same token, the fact of past persecution is not necessarily conclusive of the possibility of renewed persecution, particularly where there has been an important change in the conditions in the country of origin” (see paragraph 53 above). The Court considers that the UNHCR ’ s general approach to the burden of proof is also of interest in the present context: while the burden of proof lies with the asylum-seeker, the State official examining the asylum claim shares the duty to ascertain and evaluate all relevant facts with the asylum-seeker (see paragraph 6 of the UNHCR 1998 Note on Burden and Standard of Proof in Refugee Claims and paragraph 196 of the UNHCR Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status – cited in paragraphs 53 and 54 above). Moreover, as regards the assessment of the overall credibility of an asylum claim, paragraph 11 of the Note on Burden and Standard of Proof in Refugee Claims states that credibility is established where the applicant has presented a claim which is coherent and plausible, not contradicting generally known facts, and therefore is, on balance, capable of being believed (see paragraph 53 above)."

This account is consistent with relevant country-of-origin information available from reliable and objective sources (see paragraph 39 above).

In this connection attention must be paid to the fact that it has already been established that the first applicant was ill-treated until 2008. Moreover, another significant factor is that his contacts with the American forces were highly visible as his office was situated at the United States military base referred to by the applicants as “Victoria Camp”.
