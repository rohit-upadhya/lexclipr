The Court of Appeal found that in reply to the questions put by the investigating judge, and in particular the question: ‘ Were you present at the demonstration in the streets of Basse-Terre on 12 February 1983? ’, Mr Ezelin said merely: ‘ I have nothing to say on the matter ’.

It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.

Thus, these four applicants submitted that they had prospects of success in relation to seeking a review of the court decisions against them, because the reviewing court would be able to remedy the inconsistent approaches adopted by the judges of the District Court in respect of the different applicants, namely those offences punished by a fine and those punished by administrative detention.

The respondent Government had not argued that this procedure should be disregarded in respect of the issues relating to freedom of assembly, for instance, being manifestly devoid of purpose in the context of the specific issues relating to Article 11 of the Convention (see, by way of comparioson, Leonid Petrov v.

For its part, the Court notes that the Russian Criminal Code contained Article 149 making it a criminal offence for a public official to obstruct a public assembly, in particular with recourse to physical force; Article 286 punishing abuse of power by a public official (a statutory provision frequently used, for instance, in relation to complaints arising in the context of use of force by the police, with or without a related issue concerning deprivation of liberty, see Aleksandr Andreyev v.

The Court observes that the thrust of the applicants ’ related complaint concerns the use of force during the public event and injuries sustained at the hands of public officials (see, inter alia, Mostipan v. Russia, no. 12042/09, § 38, 16 October 2014 concerning recourse to the criminal-complaint procedure for ill ‑ treatment complaints).

Under the CComP, an application for supervisory review was to be lodged within three months of the date of the last impugned judgment being issued. In this connection, it is noted that the Court agreed in 2009 that the supervisory-review procedure under the CComP (which remained in force until August 2014) had the status of a remedy in commercial cases (see Kovaleva and Others, cited above )."

The Court observes that the 2006 decision by the Constitutional Court was published and was thus accessible to all concerned, including parties to CAO proceedings and the courts, who were to rely on it as the applicable law. Following the legislative reform in December 2008, entailing the deletion of Article 30.11 which was at the heart of the 2006 constitutional decision, it is questionable whether that decision could continue to serve as a legal basis under Russian law for characterising the amended review procedure as based on the new Article 30.12 of the CAO. Be that as it may, it is noted that the review procedure remained essentially similar to the previous supervisory-review procedure under Article 30.11 of the CAO. The Court accepts that it was not immediately obvious to the applicants in 2009 that it might no longer be appropriate to rely on the 2006 constitutional ruling and the rules of the CComP (compare Smadikov, cited above). As a matter of fact, having used the “ordinary” appeal procedure, the applicants did not then procrastinate, and promptly lodged their applications for review within the three-month time-limit mentioned in the CComP. Importantly, the Court notes the applicants ’ argument that their application for review was justified by the apparent divergent interpretation and application of the CAO in what seemed to be the same factual circumstances relating to the events on 7 and 10 August 2009. In view of the nearly identical trial judgments in respect of all applicants, and following the quashing of the judgments in respect of ten applicants by the District Court, the Court accepts that the remaining four applicants (who had already served their penalties of administrative detention, which were enforceable immediately following the trial judgment) could reasonably have considered that they had prospects of success in further challenging the final decisions in their own cases, including the appeal decisions issued by the same District Court."

Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 91, ECHR 2015 ). Article 11 of the Convention only protects the right to freedom of “peaceful ” assembly, a notion which does not cover a demonstration where the organisers and participants have violent intentions.

Nor did the parties make any specific submissions before the Court on the above matters. It cannot be said that the applicants were reproached by the domestic authorities for any specific act of violence or for having any violent intentions. In this connection, the Court reiterates that an individual does not cease to enjoy the right to freedom of peaceful assembly as a result of sporadic violence or other punishable acts committed by others in the course of a demonstration if the individual in question remains peaceful in his or her own intentions or behaviour (see Ziliberberg v. Moldova (dec.), no. 61821/00, 4 May 2004 ). The possibility of persons with violent intentions, not members of the organising association, joining a demonstration cannot as such take away that right (see Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, § 155, 12 June 2014 ). Even if there is a real risk that a public demonstration might result in disorder as a result of developments outside the control of those organising it, such a demonstration does not as such fall outside the scope of Article 11 § 1, and any restriction placed thereon must be in conformity with the terms of paragraph 2 of that provision (see Taranenko, cited above, § 66 )."

In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts.",
                "(c) Freedom of assembly as enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention protects a demonstration that may annoy or cause offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote. Any measures interfering with freedom of assembly and expression other than in cases of incitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles – however shocking and unacceptable certain views or words used may appear to the authorities – do a disservice to democracy and often even endanger it. The nature and severity of the penalties imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference in relation to the aim pursued. Where the sanctions imposed on demonstrators are criminal in nature, they require particular justification. A peaceful demonstration should not, in principle, be rendered subject to the threat of a criminal sanction, and notably to deprivation of liberty. Thus, the Court must examine with particular scrutiny cases where sanctions imposed by the national authorities for non-violent conduct involve a prison sentence (ibid., §§ 144-46, with further references).",
                "(d) An unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation or notification, does not necessarily ( by itself) justify an interference with a person ’ s right to freedom of assembly. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public demonstrations, since they allow the authorities to minimise disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance.",
                "(e) The absence of prior authorisation or notification and the ensuing “unlawfulness” of an action do not give carte blanche to the authorities; they are still restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11. Thus, it should be established why a demonstration was not authorised in the first place, what the public interest at stake was, and what risks were represented by the demonstration. The method used by the police to discourage protesters – containing them in a particular place or dispersing the demonstration – is also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference.",
                "(f) Any demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life, for instance disruption of traffic. This fact in itself does not justify an interference with the right to freedom of assembly, as it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance. The appropriate “degree of tolerance” cannot be defined in abstracto : one must look at the particular circumstances of the case and particularly at the extent of the “disruption to ordinary life”. This being so, it is important for associations and others organising demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, to abide by the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force.",

As regards Mr Annenkov, Ms Suprunova, Ms Guseva and Ms Zakharova, the above findings concerning the unjustified use of force against them (paragraphs 87 - 91 above) suffice for the Court to conclude that there was also a disproportionate “interference” under Article 11 of the Convention, in particular in so far as it entailed termination of their participation in the gathering (compare Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 38-44, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIV, where the Court found that the use by the police of pepper spray to disperse a non- authorised demonstration had been disproportionate, even though it was acknowledged that the event could have disrupted the flow of traffic)."

As regards Mr Khripunov, it appears that the appeal court based his conviction on the fact that certain entrepreneurs had impeded the market officials from entering the building and had refused to stop doing this. The court did not clearly assert, with reference to evidence, that the applicant had been personally involved in this particular action. Nor did it sufficiently specify how his manner of protest had endangered public safety or public order. Even assuming that the applicant did indeed “grab an officer ’ s uniform”, as first mentioned in the appeal decision, this mere fact by itself was not shown to be sufficient to justify the penalty of detention of five days in the context of the applicant ’ s exercise of his freedom of assembly."

The police assessed the situation as a “meeting” (see paragraph 51 above). While accepting that on 7 August 2009 Mr Khripunov had taken part in a “gathering” within the meaning of the Act, the domestic courts did not specify what specific legal requirement incumbent on a public event ’ s organisers and/or participants had been violated. For instance, it was not specified whether the prior notification requirement was applicable in the case and, if yes, whether it had been (complied) with."

As regards Mr Buzov, the Court does not overlook that Mr Buzov ’ s arguments before the courts in relation to his freedom of peaceful assembly were rather cursory, and that at trial he did not insist on hearing witnesses (such as the arresting officers or senior officers who supervised the police officers), except for one person who testified against him and then, on appeal, one person who testified in his favour. However, this did not absolve the national authorities from justifying his conviction and sentence, or from adducing sufficient reasons for the “interference” under Article 11 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "138. In this connection, the Court observes that the court decisions in respect of Mr Buzov do not specify the pertinent factual and legal elements, in particular how he behaved in a disorderly manner or “disobeyed” a lawful order by a police officer, or why the courts considered him to be “among the active participants”. The decisions also do not specify what the order given by an officer was about or whether it was lawful, in particular under the Public Events Act and the Police Act. While there are some indications of a fight between certain entrepreneurs and security guards employed by a private company, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant himself participated in this fight or otherwise behaved violently. Nor did the domestic authorities assess whether his allegedly obstructing the market officials from entering the building constituted a legitimate exercise of his right to “peaceful assembly” (compare Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, §§ 102-11, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII; Barraco v. France, no. 31684/05, §§ 36-39, 5 March 2009; Lucas v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 39013/02, 18 March 2003; and Drieman and Others v. Norway (dec.), no. 33678/96, 4 May 2000), or whether the factual circumstances showed the existence of a “public event” which would be subject to the prior notification requirement under the Public Events Act. In fact, had this been a public event in the form of a “gathering” ( that is, an assembly of citizens in a specially designated or arranged location for the purpose of the collective discussion of socially important issues), it appears that Russian law would not have required prior notification to the authorities (see paragraphs 65 - 67 above). This was a relevant factual and legal aspect of the case, which did not receive adequate examination at domestic level."

Both sides asked the Court to re-examine the proportionality of the “interference”, while raising a disagreement about certain circumstances having significance for such an assessment. The Court, for its part, is not satisfied that the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the “interference” under Article 11 of the Convention were sufficient for then sentencing four applicants to detention. Faced with the domestic courts ’ failure to give reasons that would be both relevant and sufficient to justify the interference, the Court finds that the domestic courts cannot be said to have “applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11” or to have “based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts” (see paragraph 131 above; see also Novikova and Others v. Russia, nos. 25501/07 and 4 others, § 152, 26 April 2016, and Terentyev v. Russia, no. 25147/09, § 24, 26 January 2017)."

According to the official version, the protesters were not interested in proceeding to the meeting venue; they stopped because they had either intended to break the cordon in order to proceed towards Bolshoy Kamennyy Bridge and then to the Kremlin, or to stir up the crowd to incite disorder.

                "The police did not, however, inform the organisers of the changes they had decided upon, and they only became aware of the police-imposed changes to the event when they arrived at the site on the afternoon of [6 May 2012].",
                "The City Council did not [send] out a written announcement that a special representative from the city authorities would be present at the event, nor did the chairman of the Moscow local department of the Ministry of [the Interior], Vladimir Kolokoltsev, issue any special orders on sending a special representative of the Ministry to the event.",
                "The organizers requested twelve hours to set up a stage and sound equipment for the rally; however, on the morning of [6 May 2012], the authorities only allocated six hours of advance access. Furthermore, at 1:30pm, the police did not allow vehicles with stage equipment onto the site until they had been searched. The searches revealed a small number of tents, and [the] authorities detained a number of people as a result. The police finally allowed the truck with the stage equipment onto Bolotnaya Square at 250pm, just 70 minutes before the march was due to begin.”"

                "51. As regards the circumstances in which the assembly was dispersed, the Expert Commission ’ s report stated as follows.",
                "“As the march approached Bolotnaya Square, [the] demonstrators found that a police cordon [was blocking off most] of the square, leaving only a narrow stretch along the waterfront for the rally. The police established a triple cordon of officers on Bolshoy Kammeny Bridge, which prevented any movement in the direction of the Kremlin. The first cordon was positioned close to the junction of Maly Kamenny Bridge and the Bolotnaya waterfront. Students from the Police College and officers of the Patrol Guard Service (without any protective equipment) made up this line. Behind them were two rows of OMON [riot police], a line of voluntary citizen patrol ( ‘ druzhinniki ’ ), and another cordon of OMON. A number of water cannons were visible between the second and third cordons.",
                "[The report contained two photographs comparing the police cordon on 4 February 2012, a thin line of police officers without protection gear, and the one on 6 May 2012, multiple ranks of riot police with full protection gear backed up by heavy vehicles.]",
                "The police cordons, which blocked off movement in the direction of the Kremlin, created a bottleneck that slowed the march ’ s progress to such an extent that it came to a virtual stop as demonstrators attempted to cross the bridge. Moreover, just beyond Luzhkov Bridge, the marchers had to go through a second set of metal detectors, where progress was very slow since there were only 14 detectors.",
                "By 5:15pm, the majority of the march was immobile. A number of leaders, including Sergey Udaltsov, Alexey Navalnyy and Ilya Yashin, encouraged demonstrators to sit down on the road in front of the ‘ Udarnik ’ cinema facing the police cordon to protest [against] the inability of the march to continue and to demand that they be given access to the originally allocated space for the rally on Bolotnaya Square. An estimated 50-200 people joined the sit-down protest. The leaders stressed the need to maintain a peaceful protest and appealed to demonstrators to remain calm. Participants chanted, ‘ We will not go away ’ and ‘ Police together with the people ’. The leaders attempted to address the crowds using loudspeakers, but those behind the sit-down protest could not hear or see events as they transpired. The sit-down protest did not completely block the road, but it did restrict the movement of those approaching the police lines and the bottleneck caused by the police cordon. As a result, the crowd grew denser as more demonstrators arrived from Bolshaya Yakimanka Street.",
                "At 5:42pm, the [chief of the Moscow Department of the Interior] issued a statement:",
                "‘ The organizers of the rally and other participants refuse to proceed to the agreed place of the rally (to Bolotnaya Square). They [have] stopped on the roadway near the ‘ Udarnik ’ theatre. Some of them [have] sat on the ground and thus blocked the movement of the column. Despite repeated warnings on the part of the police to proceed to the place of the rally, they won ’ t move thereby creating a real threat of a jam and trauma for participants. An inquiry commission is working on the spot to document their actions related to appeals to commit mass public disorder with a view to further consider the issue of instituting criminal proceedings. ’",
                "Some demonstrators appeared to become frustrated with standing and waiting and began to walk away. Some tried to pass through the police cordon to leave the area, but the police refused to let them through. Instead, they were directed to go back through the crowd to Bolshaya Polyanka Street, even though this was practically impossible.",
                "The police used loud speakers to inform demonstrators of the rally location. They asked participants to pass directly to Bolotnaya Square and not stop at the bridge, despite the fact that the major part of the square was closed to demonstrators. They announced that all actions on the bridge could be considered illegal. However, given the poor quality of the sound equipment, only those nearest the police could hear this information; the majority of protesters did not hear the police instructions.",
                "From the moment difficulties first arose for demonstrators attempting to cross Maly Kammeny Bridge, demonstrators made repeated attempts to negotiate with the police over moving their cordons to allow protesters onto Bolotnaya Square.",
                "Dmitry Oreshkin, a member of the Presidential Human Rights Council, and Member of Parliament Gennady Gudkov tried to talk to [the] police authorities at around 5:30pm, but there was no response. Shortly after participants broke through the police cordon at 6:20pm, a group of human rights activists spoke to Colonel Birukov, head of the [Moscow Department of the Interior] ’ s press centre. At 7:00pm, MP Ilya Ponomarev tried to stop violence during the clashes on the embankment by speaking to the authorities, but he did not get a positive response.",
                "Many of those involved in organising the event stated that they tried to engage with [the] police throughout the day to ensure the event took place in a peaceful manner.",
                "Nadezhda Mityushkina : ‘ I tried unsuccessfully to find the responsible people in the Ministry of [the Interior] in order to solve [the] organizational problems. I knew whom to contact in case we needed help when issues arose... Only at 6:00-6:30pm did a police officer approach me. I knew from previous demonstrations that he was a senior officer responsible for communication with event organisers ... and he told me that the authorities had suspended the demonstration. As one of the rally organizers, he told me to announce from the stage that the event was over, which I did following our conversation. ’",
                "Igor Bakirov : ‘ A police officer in a colonel ’ s uniform contacted me only once, and I showed him the documents [confirming] my credentials as an event organiser. Later clashes with the police erupted, I couldn ’ t find anyone with whom to communicate and cooperate. ’",
                "Sergey Davidis : ‘ I personally did not meet nor have time to get into contact with the authorities regarding the fences set up around the perimeter of the rally. I assumed some other organizers had already spoken to the authorities regarding this issue or were speaking with them at that time. There was no one to contact and nothing to talk about. I only saw the OMON officers who behaved aggressively and were not predisposed to get into a conversation. ’",
                "At 5:55pm, as people tried to move through the narrow gap between the police cordon and the waterfront to reach Bolotnaya Square, the police line moved two steps forward, further pressing the crowd. This in turn generated a counter response from the crowd, and protesters began pushing back. In several places, the police cordon broke, and a few dozen people found themselves in the empty space behind the first police line. It is impossible to determine whether the [breaking of the cordon] was the result of conscious action by sections of the crowd or if the police cordon simply broke due to the pressure from such a large number of people.",
                "Some of those who made it past the police lines were young men, but there were also many elderly citizens and others who did not resemble street fighters. Those who found themselves behind the police cordon did not act in an aggressive manner but appeared to move towards the entrance to the Bolotnaya [park], the supposed rally point.",
                "Different demonstrators reacted very differently to the breaking of the police line. Some tried to move away, others called for people to break the cordon, while some tried to restrain the crowd from [trampling on] those who were still taking part in the sit-down protest. As pressure and tension grew, the sit-down protesters stood up rather than risk being trampled. There was a high degree of confusion, and people were not clear on what was happening.",
                "Just after the [breaking of the police cordon] at approximately at 6:00pm, a single Molotov cocktail was thrown from the crowd. It landed behind the police ranks and ignited the trousers of ... a 74-year-old demonstrator who had passed through the cordon. The police used their fire extinguishers to put out the fire. This was the only such incident recorded during the day ...",
                "Soon after the cordons were broken, the authorities began to detain those who remained behind the police lines, taking them to special holding areas. The police also arrested some protesters at the front of the crowd who had not tried to break through the cordon. The police cordon was fully restored after about four minutes. ...",
                "At 6:10pm, Sergey Udaltsov, Alexey Navalnyy and Boris Nemtsov managed to walk from the Udarnik cinema to the stage at the waterfront followed by a large number of people. A police cordon blocked access to the stage, but they were allowed through. As they tried to start the rally, the police intervened. ...",
                "... OMON officers then detained Sergey Udaltsov on stage and shortly afterwards detained Boris Nemtsov and Alexey Navalnyy as well. By 6:50pm, the organizers began to disassemble the stage.",
                "In the two hours between 6pm and 8pm, the demonstration was marked by two distinct types of activity. For much of the time, demonstrators and the police stood face to face without much happening. These moments were interspersed with periods when the police advanced and the crowd moved back. There does not appear to have been any clear reason for the police decision to advance other than to divide the crowd up into smaller sections. More than anything, the police advances served to raise tensions and provoke some members of the crowd to push back. There is little evidence that demonstrators initiated the violence. Rather, they appear to have become aggressive only in response to the authorities ’ advances.",
                "During these interchanges some protesters threw objects at the police, and the police used their batons freely. The crowd threw plastic bottles, shoes and umbrellas ...",
                "At around 6:20pm, the police announced that the rally was cancelled and asked protesters to disperse. Police used a loudspeaker to state, ‘ Dear citizens, we earnestly ask you not to disturb public order! Otherwise, in accordance with the law, we will have to use force! Please, leave here, and do not stop. Go to the metro. ’ Although the police used a loudspeaker, the announcement was not loud enough to reach the majority of the crowd. It is likely that only those nearest to the loudspeakers could have heard the call to disperse.",
                "There was confusion over the police demands because at the same time ... Colonel Birukov, head of the Moscow [Department of the Interior] ’ s press service, told a group of human rights defenders (including Vladimir Lukin, Dmitri Oreshkin, Victor Davydov and Nikolai Svanidze ) that the demonstrators could continue to Bolotnaya Square to take part in the rally.",
                "By 6:30pm the crowd at the corner of Maly Kamenny Bridge and the waterfront was cut in two. Those on Maly Kamenny Bridge were pushed in the direction of Bolshaya Polyanka Street, while those on the waterfront were cut off from both Bolshoy and Maly Kamenny Bridges.",
                "Around 6:54pm, the police cordon that acted as a barrier along the waterfront near the Luzhkov Bridge was removed, and demonstrators were able to move freely along the Bolotnaya waterfront. Approximately 15 minutes later, some 200 police officers in protective equipment who had formed a cordon at the Luzhkov Bridge began pushing protesters in the direction of Lavrushinsky Lane, which runs from Bolotnaya Square to the Tretyakovskaya metro station. At the same time, police began to push people back along the Bolotnaya waterfront from the Luzhkov Bridge towards the Udarnik cinema. Those who remained on the waterfront linked arms in passive resistance. The police pushed forward, divided the crowd and began to detain demonstrators.",
                "At around 7:47pm ... authorities created a corridor to allow demonstrators to leave the Bolotnaya area.",
                "At 7:53pm a group of OMON officers appeared from the bushes of Bolotnaya Gardens and divided those demonstrators that remained on the square. Those on one side were able to move towards Malyy Kamennyy Bridge, while those on the other remain[ ed ] totally blocked between the police lines.",
                "At 8:08pm the last groups of people slowly left the waterfront along a corridor formed by the policemen. The police also began to move people away from the Kadashevskaya waterfront on the other side of the Obvodnoy Channel. Some people were detained, while others were pushed along Bolshaya Polyanka Street in the direction of the Lavrushinsky Lane.",

                "52. On 20 March 2013 the Zamoskvoretskiy branch of the Investigative Committee dismissed ten individual complaints and two official enquiries made in relation to the matter, one by Mr I. Ponomarev, a deputy of the State Duma, and another one by Mr A. Babushkin, President of the Public Supervisory Committee of Moscow. The complaints and enquiries concerned the allegedly unlawful acts of the police in dispersing the rally on 6 May 2012, including excessive use of force and arbitrary arrests. The Investigative Committee interviewed one of the ten individuals who had lodged the complaints and four police officers deployed in the cordon around Bolotnaya Square, including squadron and regiment commanders. They stated, in particular, that they had been acting under orders to maintain public safety and to identify and arrest the most active instigators of unrest; only those resisting the demands of the police had been arrested and no force had been used unnecessarily. The police officers stated that when the police had had to intervene, they had used combat manoeuvres and truncheons but not tear gas or other exceptional means of restraint. Squadron Commander S. explained that he had been deployed in the sector adjacent to the stage and that there had been no incidents or disorder in that sector; no one had been arrested. The decision listed thirteen other internal inquiries carried out following individual complaints and medical reports; in six cases the allegations of abuse had been found to be unsubstantiated and in seven cases the police conduct had been found to be lawful. As regards the substance of the complaints at hand, the Investigative Committee found as follows.",
                "“... having crossed Malyy Kamennyy Bridge, the column leaders stopped. Many participants in the march bypassed the organisers and proceeded to Bolotnaya Square towards the stage ... When the march participants had filled nearly all of Bolotnaya Embankment, limited by the police cordon on one side and by the stage on the other side, the organisers were still at the point between Malyy Kamennyy Bridge, Bolotnaya Square, [the park] and the Udarnik cinema ...",
                "At this time the organisers demanded that the police officers let them pass through to the Kremlin. The police told them that they would not let anyone pass through to the Kremlin because the event was authorised to take place at Bolotnaya Square, where the stage had been specially set up, and they were told to proceed. After that, the organisers decided to call a sit-down protest and called upon those present to disobey the lawful orders of the police. After that, the meeting participants congregated opposite the Udarnik cinema, where after a while they attempted to break the cordon, which [the police] did not manage to prevent. Therefore the police began arresting those who had been most actively involved in breaking the cordon; they were put in a police van and then taken to police stations in Moscow. After the confrontation had been localised, the police officers slightly dispersed the crowd, having apprehended the most active perpetrators. From the very beginning of the sit-down protest the police requested the participants through loudspeakers to proceed to the stage, not to act on provocation and not to commit unlawful acts, but these requests had no effect and therefore [it was clear that] the breaking of the cordon had been organised. In suppressing it the police officers acted in coordination and concert. They did not use force or special means of restraint. However, the work of the officers charged with apprehending offenders did involve the use of force and special means of restraint, in so far as necessary, against persons putting up resistance.",
                "Later on, in the area of Malyy Kamennyy Bridge and at the [park] corner some localised confrontations took place ... force and special means of restraint were used.

Bolotnaya Square is a traditional place for holding various opposition events. We all had a clear understanding what the route would be, where the stage would be, what the layout would be. We came there at that time for a rather traditional, customary event, the scenario of which was well-known to everybody ... two days beforehand the maps showing where people would assemble and the route of the march were published on the official [news] website RiaNovosti; they are still posted there. The map was published on the [police] website ‘ Petrovka, 38 ’ and this map is still posted there. Not only the organisers, but the participants too, they knew where they were going ... When we approached the venue of the meeting ... we saw that the map showing where people would assemble on the square had been essentially altered. It was quite different from the map of 4 February [2012], and, above all, different from the document which had been agreed with the Moscow mayor ’ s office and had been published on the website[s] RiaNovosti and ‘ Petrovka, 38 ’ ... [according to which] people were to assemble on Bolotnaya Embankment as well as in the park at Bolotnaya Square. However, when we came we saw that the park at Bolotnaya Square, taking up approximately 80% of the square, was barred and cordoned off ... since [the cordon] did not correspond [to the map] the column stopped. The event organisers and the people who came just waited for this question to be resolved, for the police to remove the wrong cordon, for the police chiefs to reply as to what had changed, why the approved meeting was not being conducted according to the scenario that had been approved ... I had previously [organised events] ... Somebody had taken the map and changed the location of the meeting. This had practically never happened before ... to show visually that we were not going anywhere, we sat on the ground ... the first line of [the police] cordon was composed of 20-year-old conscripts, and with a thousand people pressing on it the cordon broke. It could only break. This led to an uncontrollable situation, as several policemen were walking and trying to say something through megaphones – impossible to tell what they were saying. Some activists passing by were also speaking through megaphones – impossible to tell what they were saying. No authorities were present on the spot. And [it was] impossible to understand who was in command. So all of that caused the rupture of the police cordon. People started spreading across that spot ...Then I tried to walk over to the stage to try and explain to the gathering what was going on, using the amplifiers. I did not know then that the police had already cut off the amplifiers.",

All the [high-ranking] police officers were asked, but they only shrugged. Nobody could understand what was going on. The State Duma deputies present on the spot tried to act as negotiators, but ... they said that nobody wanted to come up to us. We could see some police officers resembling chiefs, at a distance ... but it was impossible to get to them ... it was impossible to reach the [police] command. Nobody would come to us. Nobody could negotiate despite everyone ’ s wish to do so.",

                "“The negotiations with the [mayor ’ s office] were very difficult this time ... I had been the organiser of most events from 25 December 2011. It was always possible to meet the deadline, to find a compromise, [but not this time]. ... It was [only] on 4 [May 2012] that we received the written agreement. On the same day the working meeting took place ... Usually, everything is decided no later than five days before the event. This time there was practically twenty-four hours ’ notice. We could not even bring the vehicles carrying the stage to the square before 1 p.m. [on 6 May 2012]. We were put under very harsh conditions ... we only had three hours to put up the stage ... At the [working meeting] technical issues were discussed, but for the previous events we held, as a matter of practice, [there was] an on-site reconnaissance: the representatives of the organisers [together with] the representatives of the police ... would visit the site, walk through the route and determine where the barriers would be put, the stage, the lavatories, so that there was no ambiguity in understanding how the event would unfold. This time, because [the working meeting] was on 4 [May 2012], and the event was on 6 [May 2012], it was already clear at the working meeting that we wouldn ’ t have time for an on-site reconnaissance; therefore at Mr Deynichenko ’ s suggestion it was stated that in organising the event we would follow the example of the assembly held on 4 February [2012]. Then, it was also a march from Kaluzhskaya Square and a meeting at Bolotnaya Square. The only thing that was noted was that this time the stage would be a bit closer to the park at Bolotnaya Square, at the corner of the square, because originally it had been declared that there would be 5,000 participants. We had a feeling that people were disappointed, somehow low-spirited, and that not many would come. When we realised that there would be more people I told Mr Oleynik [the First Deputy Director of the Regional Security Department], but he told us that it was unacceptable. But it was clear that we could not do anything about it. We warned that there would be significantly more participants ... When we called Mr Deynichenko the following day he told [us] that he had had a map drawn up by the Department of the Interior, and that Mr Udaltsov could come during the day to see it to clarify any issues. During the day he postponed the meeting several times and then he no longer answered the phone. Therefore it was not possible to see or discuss the map.",

                "No, of course not. The event of 4 February [2012] had been organised so that the meeting was held at Bolotnaya Square. Bolotnaya Square is an area comprising the park and Bolotnaya Embankment. It was supposed that people would ... turn [like before] towards the park. It was said that everything except the position of the stage, which would be 20 metres further forward, would be the same as [the last] time; this was expressly spelled out. We were guided by it.",

When I crossed [to] the area allocated to the march, even before passing through the metal detectors, Colonel Makhonin, who is traditionally in charge of the march, called me. We met.

I could not push through to get there. I learned that both [State Duma deputies] were conducting negotiations; I thought that it was probably going to settle this situation ... at a certain point Ms Mityushkina called me and said that the police were demanding to terminate the event. I explained ... that if [the police] considered that there had been breaches, they had to give us time to remedy these defects, they could not end the event at once. I called Mr Udaltsov ... and said that we were coming, [that there was] no need to end anything. Actually, when I reached the corner the sit-in protest had already ended.

On the website of the Moscow Department of the Interior a map was posted showing the location of the police [cordon] and the access points. The map was in the public domain and one could see that the park of Bolotnaya Square should have been open. But it turned out to be closed. Moreover, we openly announced on the Internet, and it was reported in the media, that the route would be exactly the same as on 4 February 2012 ... On 4 February 2012 there was an authorised event ... all of [ Bolotnaya ] Square was open, no cordons on Bolshoy Kamennyy Bridge. We easily turned into the square, there had been no scuffles ... we were sure that on 6 May 2012 it would be exactly the same picture ... but the police had deceived us, blocked Bolotnaya Square, having left a very narrow passage for the demonstrators. We understood that it would be hard to pass through this bottleneck. We stopped, and to show the police that we were not going to storm the Kremlin and the [ Bolshoy ] Kamennyy Bridge we sat on the ground ... Mr Gudkov [the State Duma deputy], ... offered to be an intermediary in the negotiations between the protesters and the police ... we waited, all was peaceful ... he several times attempted to negotiate but this came to nothing. It became clear that ... the crowd were about to panic. We got up. And an awful scuffle began ... I was moving [to the stage] ... when I arrived there I saw a strange scene for an authorised event. The microphones had all been switched off, Mr Navalnyy and Mr Udaltsov had been arrested just before me. The police never act like that at authorised events. I took a megaphone and addressed the people. I did not speak for long. Within a few minutes the police apprehended me. ...",

                "Only peaceful assemblies are protected",

Such discussions might, for example, cover the deployment of law enforcement personnel, stewarding arrangements, and particular concerns relating to the policing operation.",

                "The policing of assemblies must be guided by the human rights principles of legality, necessity, proportionality and non-discrimination and must adhere to applicable human rights standards. In particular, the State has a positive duty to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable peaceful assemblies to take place without participants fearing physical violence. Law enforcement officials must also protect participants of a peaceful assembly from any person or group (including agents provocateurs and counter-demonstrators) that attempts to disrupt or inhibit it in any way.",

                "If a standoff or other dispute arises during the course of an assembly, negotiation or mediated dialogue may be an appropriate means of trying to reach an acceptable resolution. Such dialogue – whilst not always successful – can serve as a preventive tool helping to avoid the escalation of conflict, the imposition of arbitrary or unnecessary restrictions, or recourse to the use of force.",
                "15. ... For the purposes of the Guidelines, an assembly means the intentional and temporary presence of a number of individuals in a public place for a common expressive purpose.",
                "18. The question of at what point an assembly can no longer be regarded as a temporary presence (thus exceeding the degree of tolerance presumptively to be afforded by the authorities towards all peaceful assemblies) must be assessed in the individual circumstances of each case. ... Where an assembly causes little or no inconvenience to others then the authorities should adopt a commensurately less stringent test of temporariness ... the term ‘ temporary ’ should not preclude the erection of protest camps or other non-permanent constructions.",

                "25. ’ Peaceful ’ assemblies: Only ‘ peaceful ’ assembly is protected by the right to freedom of assembly. ...",
                "26. The term ‘ peaceful ’ should be interpreted to include conduct that may annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote, and even conduct that temporarily hinders, impedes or obstructs the activities of third parties. Thus, by way of example, assemblies involving purely passive resistance should be characterized as ‘ peaceful ’ ...",
                "28. If this fundamental criterion of ‘ peacefulness ’ is met, it triggers the positive obligations entailed by the right to freedom of peaceful assembly on the part of the State authorities ... It should be noted that assemblies that survive this initial test (thus, prima facie, deserving protection) may still legitimately be restricted on public order or other legitimate grounds ...",
                "38. To aid certainty, any prior restrictions should be formalised in writing and communicated to the organiser of the event within a reasonable timeframe (see further paragraph 135 below). Furthermore, the relevant authorities must ensure that any restrictions imposed during an event are in full conformity with the law and consistent with established jurisprudence. Finally, the imposition, after an assembly, of sanctions and penalties which are not prescribed by law is not permitted.",
                "95. Whether behaviour constitutes the intentional incitement of violence is inevitably a question which must be assessed on the particular circumstances. Some difficulty arises where the message concerns unlawful activity, or where it could be construed as inciting others to commit non-violent but unlawful action. Expressing support for unlawful activity can, in many cases, be distinguished from disorderly conduct, and should not therefore face restriction on public order grounds. The touchstone must again be the existence of an imminent threat of violence.",
                "96. ... resort to [hate] speech by participants in an assembly does not of itself necessarily justify the dispersal of the event, and law enforcement officials should take measures (such as arrest) only against the particular individuals involved (either during or after the event).",
                "Restrictions imposed during an assembly",
                "108. The role of the police or other law enforcement personnel during an assembly will often be to enforce any prior restrictions imposed in writing by the regulatory body. No additional restrictions should be imposed by law enforcement personnel unless absolutely necessary in light of demonstrably changed circumstances. On occasion, however, the situation on the ground may deteriorate (participants, for example, might begin using or inciting imminent violence), and the authorities may have to impose further measures to ensure that other relevant interests are adequately safeguarded. In the same way that reasons must be adduced to demonstrate the need for prior restrictions, any restrictions imposed in the course of an assembly must be equally rigorously justified. Mere suspicions will not suffice, and the reasons must be both relevant and sufficient. In such circumstances, it will be appropriate for other civil authorities (such as an Ombudsman ’ s office) to have an oversight role in relation to the policing operation, and law enforcement personnel should be accountable to an independent body. Furthermore ... unduly broad discretionary powers afforded to law enforcement officials may breach the principle of legality given the potential for arbitrariness. The detention of participants during an assembly (on grounds of their committing administrative, criminal or other offences) should meet a high threshold given the right to liberty and security of person and the fact that interferences with freedom of assembly are inevitably time sensitive. Detention should be used only in the most pressing situations when failure to detain would result in the commission of serious criminal offences.",
                "Decision-making and review process",
                "132. The regulatory authority ... should fairly and objectively assess all available information to determine whether the organisers and participants of a notified assembly are likely to conduct the event in a peaceful manner, and to ascertain the probable impact of the event on the rights and freedoms of other non-participant stakeholders. In doing so, it may be necessary to facilitate meetings with the event organiser and other interested parties.",
                "133. The regulatory authority should also ensure that any relevant concerns raised are communicated to the event organiser, and the organiser should be offered an opportunity to respond to any concerns raised. This is especially important if these concerns might later be cited as the basis for imposing restrictions on the event. Providing the organiser with such information allows them the opportunity to address the concerns, thus diminishing the potential for disorder and helping foster a cooperative, rather than confrontational, relationship between the organisers and the authorities.",
                "134. Assembly organisers, the designated regulatory authorities, law enforcement officials, and other parties whose rights might be affected by an assembly, should make every effort to reach mutual agreement on the time, place and manner of an assembly. If, however, agreement is not possible and no obvious resolution emerges, negotiation or mediated dialogue may help reach a mutually agreeable accommodation in advance of the notified date of the assembly. Genuine dialogue between relevant parties can often yield a more satisfactory outcome for everyone involved than formal recourse to the law. The facilitation of negotiations or mediated dialogue can usually best be performed by individuals or organisations not affiliated with either the State or the organiser. The presence of parties ’ legal representatives may also assist in facilitating discussions between the assembly organiser and law enforcement authorities. Such dialogue is usually most successful in establishing trust between parties if it is begun at the earliest possible opportunity. Whilst not always successful, it serves as a preventive tool helping to avoid the escalation of conflict or the imposition of arbitrary or unnecessary restrictions.",
                "135. Any restrictions placed on an assembly should be communicated in writing to the event organiser with a brief explanation of the reason for each restriction (noting that such explanation must correspond with the permissible grounds enshrined in human rights law and as interpreted by the relevant courts). The burden of proof should be on the regulatory authority to show that the restrictions imposed are reasonable in the circumstances. Such decisions should also be communicated to the organiser within a reasonable timeframe – i.e. sufficiently far in advance of the date of a proposed event to allow the decision to be judicially appealed to an independent tribunal or court before the notified date of the event.",
                "136. The regulatory authority should publish its decisions so that the public has access to reliable information about events taking place in the public domain. This might be done, for example, by posting decisions on a dedicated web-site.",
                "147. Governments must ensure that law enforcement officials receive adequate training in the policing of public assemblies. Training should equip law enforcement agencies to act in a manner that avoids escalation of violence and minimises conflict, and should include ‘ soft skills ’ such as negotiation and mediation. ...",
                "149. Law enforcement agencies should be proactive in engaging with assembly organizers: [o] fficers should seek to send clear messages that inform crowd expectations and reduce the potential for conflict escalation ...

Indeed, dispersal of assemblies should be a measure of last resort and should be governed by prospective rules informed by international standards.

Guidelines should specify the circumstances that warrant dispersal, and who is entitled to make dispersal orders (for example, only police officers of a specified rank and above).",

They pointed out that the Moscow authorities and the event organisers had worked out the terms of the public assembly in their written exchange and in person at the working meeting on 4 May 2012. However, the police had suspected the protesters of intending to act in breach of the agreed terms, and on 5 May 2012 the prosecutor ’ s office had issued the organisers with a warning to that effect.

According to the Government, two State Duma deputies, the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation and a member of the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation had supported the police ’ s demands and tried to convince the protesters to follow the route, to no avail. Then, at 6 p.m. one of the organisers, acting at the request of the police, had announced the early termination of the meeting; from 5.58 p.m. to 7 p.m. some of the protesters had attempted to break the police cordon and had thrown various objects at the police. From 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. the police had gradually forced the protesters to leave and had arrested those who put up the most active resistance. The Government submitted that the intervention of the police had been justified since the assembly had ceased to be “peaceful” within the meaning of Article 11 of the Convention. In dispersing the protesters, the police had not resorted to excessive force: only police truncheons had been used; only the most aggressive perpetrators had been targeted; and no tear gas or smoke bombs had been deployed."

He contended that the restriction of the area had had no purpose other than to prevent the possibility of tents being erected in the park.

No confrontations had taken place within the authorised perimeter in front of the stage. Overall, he argued that the response by the police had been uncoordinated and disproportionate and that it had had the effect of escalating the confrontation rather than defusing it. The immense number of police officers and extensive crowd-control resources deployed at the site of the assembly should have allowed the authorities to ensure the peaceful continuation of the meeting, but they had chosen to terminate it instead.

He maintained that he had been arrested merely for his presence at the site of the rally as a means of discouraging him and others from participating in opposition rallies. He further complained that the domestic courts had taken no account of his arguments and exonerating evidence and had imposed the most severe penalty possible.

It is, in any event, for the Court to give a final ruling on the restriction ’ s compatibility with the Convention and this is to be done by assessing the circumstances of a particular case (see Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( dec. ), no. 50841/99, ECHR 2001-X, and Galstyan v.

It was therefore large enough not only for the originally declared 5,000 participants, or the officially recorded turnout of 8,000, but even for the organisers ’ retrospective estimate of 25,000. However, the organisers objected not only to the lack of access to the park, but, above all, to the discovery of a last-minute alteration of the venue layout, which allegedly led to a misunderstanding and the disruption of the assembly."

The assembly organisers claimed that it had been expressly agreed at the working meeting to replicate on 6 May 2012 the route and the format of the assembly that had taken place on 4 February 2012. Their testimonies to that effect have been neither confirmed nor denied by the officials who were present at the working meeting. When cross-examined, Mr Deynichenko and Mr Sharapov stated that the inclusion of the park had not been requested or discussed. Assuming that the latter was true and no express agreement had been reached as regards the park, the Court nevertheless considers that it was not entirely unreasonable on the part of the organisers to perceive it as having been included by default. Firstly, the official boundary of Bolotnaya Square comprised the park, as confirmed by the expert witnesses N. and M., as well as the head of Yakimanka district municipality of Moscow. Secondly, the park had been included in the meeting venue on the previous occasion, a fact admitted by the official sources, in particular the witness Mr Sharapov (see the testimonies of all the aforementioned witnesses quoted in paragraph 63 above)."

After the working meeting, the police developed the security plan and drew up their own map, which excluded the park. It is not clear whether their map was based on their perception of the discussion at the working meeting, or whether they decided on the park ’ s closure afterwards, taking into account the expected number of participants and the potential public-order issues. In any event, both the security plan and the maps used by the police forces remained police internal documents and were not shared with the organisers (see the Moscow Department of the Interior ’ s reply to the Investigative Committee, paragraph 48 above, and the Moscow City Court judgment in Mr Udaltsov ’ s and Mr Razvozzhayev ’ s case, paragraph 63 above)."

Moreover, the fact that the map had been in the public domain for at least twenty-four hours before the assembly allowed the officers responsible for the security of the meeting to spot any errors and to inform the organisers and the public accordingly. Given the high priority attached to policing this event and the thoroughness with which the security forces followed up every piece of information concerning the protest activity, it was unlikely that the published map had inadvertently escaped their attention."

The assembly leaders and participants maintained that it was a reaction to the unexpected change of the venue layout and an attempt to negotiate a passage through the park. This reason is in principle consistent with the Court ’ s finding that the placement of the police cordon was different from that expected by the assembly organisers (see paragraph 112 above)."

It is impossible to establish whether any such request was indeed expressed because no witnesses other than the police heard it. On the other hand, a number of witnesses unrelated to the conflicting parties confirmed that the sit-in leaders had demanded that the police move the cordon back so as to allow access to the park. The independent observers from the Ombudsman ’ s office who had been involved in the negotiations explained that the protesters, faced with the narrowed-down passage, had demanded that it be widened. Moreover, they named the police official, Colonel Biryukov, to whom the Ombudsman had passed on that demand (see the testimonies of Ms Mirza and Mr Vasilyev, paragraphs 57 and 59 above). Likewise, the assembly observer from the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation testified that no calls to move towards the Kremlin had been made (see the testimony of Mr Svanidze, paragraph 58 above). Similar testimonies were also given by the two State Duma deputies, Mr G. Gudkov and Mr D.

It appears from the video-footage submitted by the parties, and it is confirmed by the witness accounts, that the sit-in narrowed the passage to Bolotnaya Square even further and that it caused some confusion and impatience among the demonstrators aspiring to reach the meeting venue. Nevertheless, the same sources made it clear that with only twenty to fifty people sitting on the ground, the sit-in remained localised and left sufficient space for those wishing to pass. It is beyond doubt that the sit-in was strictly peaceful. However, it required the authorities ’ intervention – and those taking part in it openly invited it – since the cordon could not be moved without the authorities ’ consent and relevant orders. The question therefore arises whether at this stage the authorities took all reasonable steps to preserve the assembly ’ s peaceful character."

It is not for the Court to indicate the most appropriate manoeuvre for the police cordon in the circumstances. The fact that the police were exercising caution against the park being taken over by a campsite, or that they were unwilling to allow the protesters to proceed in the direction of the Kremlin, or both, might have justified the refusal to allow access to the park, given that in any event the assembly had sufficient space for a meeting.

From approximately 5 p.m. to 5.15 p.m. the organisers were addressing the police officers forming the cordon, but it appears that there were no senior police officers among them competent to discuss those issues; the senior officers were apparently watching the event from some distance behind the cordon. The negotiators became involved at around 5.15 p.m. and the talks continued until at least 5.45 p.m. The police chose first to contact the protest leaders through an intermediary, the Ombudsman, who had to tell them to stand up and go towards the stage. He passed on the message and returned to the police the protesters ’ demand to open the passage to the park. It is unclear whether, after that initial exchange, the police replied to the protesters and, if so, whether the Ombudsman managed to transmit the reply.

However, Colonel Biryukov told the Ombudsman that the decision regarding the police cordon was outside his powers (see the testimonies of Ms Mirza and Mr Vasiliev, paragraphs 57 and 59 above).

However, it is not clear whether he had the authority to negotiate with the assembly organisers or to alter the position of the cordon specified in the security plan. Police Colonel Deynichenko was in charge of the overall command of the security operation; on 4 May 2012 he took part in the working meeting, and on 6 May 2012, after the assembly, he drew up a report on the implementation of the security plan.

The domestic courts did not rule on those points, and no relevant evidence has been presented to the Court. In any event, the senior police officers had ample opportunity to contact the organisers by telephone and to approach personally the sit-in participants by simply walking a few metres. Mr Makhonin, for his part, testified that he had not tried to call Mr Udaltsov until he arrived at Bolotnaya Square “after the mass disorder had already begun” (see paragraph 63 above). Given that the first incident occurred a few minutes after the sit-in had ended, this means that he did not call Mr Udaltsov during the sit-in and was away from Bolotnaya Square while it lasted. At 6 p.m. he appeared in the stage area, where he instructed Ms Mityushkina to end the assembly (see paragraphs 131 et seq. below)."

He was not a member of the operational headquarters either. According to the security plan, it was Colonel Smirnov ’ s and Colonel Saprykin ’ s task to personally meet the organisers before the beginning of the march in order to brief them and to have them sign the undertakings (see paragraph 24 above), although in practice it was Colonel Makhonin who did this."

Faced with that situation, instead of proceeding to the space available in front of the stage, they began a sit-in, which made the congestion worse (see paragraphs 114 and 117 above). In the Court ’ s view, the controversy concerning the placement of the police cordon could reasonably have been dealt with had the competent officials been prepared to come forward in order to communicate with the assembly organisers and to discuss the placement of the cordon with them.

Furthermore, the authorities failed to respond to the real-time developments in a constructive manner. In the first fifteen minutes after the march ’ s arrival at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge, no official took any interest in talking to the march leaders showing signs of distress in front of the police cordon. Eventually, when the sit-in began, they sent the Ombudsman with a message to the leaders to stand up and move on, which did not answer the protesters ’ concerns. Whether or not the senior police officers beyond the cordon had initially understood the demands of the sit-in leaders, there was nothing preventing them from immediately clarifying the issue and from giving them a clear answer."

At 5.55 p.m. the pressure of the crowd caused the cordon to break, but it was quickly restored without the use of force, and in the next few minutes protesters from among the crowd began tossing various objects at the police cordon, including a Molotov cocktail. At the same time, at 6 p.m., at the far end of Bolotnaya Square Ms Mityushkina, acting on the instructions of Colonel Makhonin, announced from the stage that the meeting was over.

The Court considers that, irrespective of whether the domestic requirements for “mass disorder” had been met, the tensions were still localised at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge while the rest of the venue remained calm. The authorities have not shown that, prior to declaring the whole meeting over, they had attempted to separate the turbulent sector and target the problems there, so as to enable the meeting to continue in the sector of the stage where the situation remained peaceful.

At the same time, the Court observes, and the Government have insisted on this point, that the applicant was not arrested and punished for breaching the rules on public assemblies.

They explained that the length of the applicant ’ s detention had been calculated from 9.30 p.m. on 6 May 2012, the time when he was taken to the Krasnoselskiy District police station, and argued that the term of his pre-trial detention had not exceeded the statutory limit of forty ‑ eight hours. Overall, the Government submitted that the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty had complied with domestic law and that all requisite formalities, such as issuing a lawful detention order, had been fulfilled."

The Court reiterates that the expressions “lawful” and “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law” in Article 5 § 1 of the Convention essentially refer back to national law and state the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. However, the “lawfulness” of detention under domestic law is not always the decisive element. The Court must in addition be satisfied that detention during the period under consideration was compatible with the purpose of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, which is to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary fashion. Furthermore, the list of exceptions to the right to liberty secured in Article 5 § 1 of the Convention is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty (see Giulia Manzoni v. Italy, 1 July 1997, § 25, Reports 1997 ‑ IV)."

It appears that the police were in haste to disperse the remaining demonstrators from Bolotnaya Square after the early termination of the rally, and since the applicant had not yet left they decided to arrest him. Even if the preceding disorder at Malyy Kamenny bridge may explain, if not justify, their zealousness in pursuing the peaceful protesters lingering at the site, and even accepting that the situation might not have allowed the relevant documents to be drawn up on the spot, there is no explanation, let alone justification, for the applicant ’ s ensuing detention at the police station."

The Government submitted that his arrest and detention had the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on suspicion of having committed an administrative offence and thus fell within the ambit of Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention. The Court notes that the duration of administrative detention should not as a general rule exceed three hours, which is an indication of the period of time the law regards as reasonable and sufficient for drawing up an administrative offence report.

Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Lucà v.

                "74. In assessing the severity of the sanction under Article 212 of the Criminal Code the Court considers it important that the criminal file did not suggest any pre-existing intention by the applicant to participate in mass disorder. Just as in Yaroslav Belousov (cited above, § 179), there is nothing in the case file to suggest that the applicant was among those responsible for the onset of clashes between the protesters and the police. As far as can be discerned from the indictment, he hit the police officer at the height of the clashes, when the police were already arresting protesters, an act which, according to him, was in response to the indiscriminate and unnecessary use of force by the police. The domestic courts did not establish the particular circumstances in which that behaviour occurred and dismissed the applicant ’ s arguments about excessive use of force by the police as unfounded while leaving his allegations unrebutted. The Court concludes that the applicant was not regarded as one of the individuals responsible for the disruption of the assembly or prompting the use of force by the police. The applicant ’ s conduct therefore, although involving violence, was sporadic in nature and, in the light of the domestic courts ’ findings, did not attain the degree of aggression which the Court has found in other cases to amount to violence calling for resolute measures, in particular the subsequent sentencing of people to lengthy prison terms (see, by contrast, Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, §§ 156-63, 12 June 2014, and Osmani and Others v. the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001)."
            ],
            [
                "75. Given the applicant ’ s minor role in the assembly and the fact he had an incidental involvement in the clashes, the Court does not consider that the risks referred to by the Government – potential civil unrest, political instability and a threat to public order – had any personal relation to him. While the Court does not endorse the applicant ’ s violent behaviour and reiterates that the State authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation in sanctioning such actions (see Gülcü, cited above, § 116, and Taranenko, cited above, §§ 81-97), it considers that the reasons advanced by the Government could not justify a three-year prison sentence for participation in mass disorder under Article 212 of the Criminal Code. The Court considers that there was no “pressing social need” to give the applicant a sentence of that duration in addition to sentencing him for assault on the policeman."

The event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at Bolotnaya Square which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. The march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at Bolotnaya Square it became apparent that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue, allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting. To control the crowd the police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers; there were numerous clashes between the two sides. At 5.30 p.m. the police ordered the meeting to finish early and began to disperse the participants. It took them about two hours to clear the square."

According to him, on 6 May 2012 he arrived at Kaluzhskaya Square to take part in the march and walked down Yakimanka Street to Bolotnaya Square. He passed the metal detectors and joined other protestors in front of the stage, where a rock group was performing. Sometime after 6 p.m. he walked towards Malyy Kamenyy Bridge but discovered that movement in that direction had been blocked by a police cordon. The applicant walked back, staying in the general area; at around 7.30 p.m. groups of police officers started pushing into the crowd, forcing it apart by using their truncheons. Protestors were surrounded and squeezed together. At some point the applicant realised that he was facing the police line and that the police were using excessive force to arrest protestors. The applicant was both angered and scared by the actions of the police and actively resisted. He was eventually seized by four police officers and escorted to a police car, which took him to a police station."

The Justice of the Peace established that after the meeting at Bolotnaya Square the applicant had shouted anti-government slogans, ignoring the lawful demands of the police to cease those acts. He had thrown objects at the police officers, including stones, flagpoles, empty plastic bottles, and pieces of asphalt, and had refused to proceed to the police van.

One extension order was also issued by the Moscow City Court. After the case had been sent for trial, the detention order was issued by the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow.

The Court reiterates that while Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention is mostly concerned with the existence of a lawful basis for detention within criminal proceedings, Article 5 § 3 of the Convention deals with the possible justification for such detention. Moreover, according to the Court ’ s established case-law under the latter provision, the persistence of a reasonable suspicion is a sine qua non for the validity of continued detention (see Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova [GC], no. 23755/07, § 87, ECHR 2016 (extracts)). The Court therefore deems it more appropriate to deal with this complaint under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see Kovyazin and Others v.

The domestic courts considered that the applicant, faced with the risk of prison, was likely to abscond, influence witnesses, or interfere with the administration of justice. In addition, the domestic courts relied on the fact that the applicant had forcefully resisted arrest on 6 May 2012 and on the allegation from undisclosed sources that he had connections among football fans and groups of anarchists.

In any event, the risk of the applicant conspiring with others or influencing witnesses diminished with the passage of time. In addition, the courts did not refer to any concrete facts underlying the fear of him absconding or perverting the course of justice, and those risks were assessed in an abstract and hypothetical way.

The Court noted, in particular, the domestic courts ’ reliance on the gravity of the charges as the main factor for the assessment of the potential to abscond, reoffend or obstruct the course of justice, and their reluctance to pay proper attention to a discussion of each applicant ’ s personal situation or to have proper regard to factors pointing in favour of release.

However, with the passage of time the nature and the seriousness of the offence as the ground for the applicant ’ s continued detention inevitably became less and less relevant (see Kovyazin and Others, cited above, § 85, and Artemov v.

In describing his participation in the mass disorder, they merely referred to his use of violence against a police officer, also classified as a separate criminal offence (see, by contrast, Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, § 178, where chanting anti-government slogans by the applicant constituted participation in acts of mass disorder)."

Just as in Yaroslav Belousov (cited above, § 179), there is nothing in the case file to suggest that the applicant was among those responsible for the onset of clashes between the protesters and the police. As far as can be discerned from the indictment, he hit the police officer at the height of the clashes, when the police were already arresting protesters, an act which, according to him, was in response to the indiscriminate and unnecessary use of force by the police. The domestic courts did not establish the particular circumstances in which that behaviour occurred and dismissed the applicant ’ s arguments about excessive use of force by the police as unfounded while leaving his allegations unrebutted. The Court concludes that the applicant was not regarded as one of the individuals responsible for the disruption of the assembly or prompting the use of force by the police. The applicant ’ s conduct therefore, although involving violence, was sporadic in nature and, in the light of the domestic courts ’ findings, did not attain the degree of aggression which the Court has found in other cases to amount to violence calling for resolute measures, in particular the subsequent sentencing of people to lengthy prison terms (see, by contrast, Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, §§ 156-63, 12 June 2014, and Osmani and Others v. the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001)."

The Court observes that the refusals to give authorisation could have had a chilling effect on the applicants and other participants in the assemblies.

It noted that the 1990 Assemblies Act was based on the premise that the exercise of this freedom did not require any authorisations or licences issued by the State.

In so doing, it placed assemblies within the meaning of the Assemblies Act on a par with events of a commercial character or organised for entertainment purposes. This was incompatible with the special position that freedom of expression occupied in a democratic society and rendered nugatory the special place that assemblies had in the legal system under the Constitution and the Assemblies Act.

The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion.

In the former, the Traffic Officer, acting on behalf of the Mayor of Warsaw, had refused permission for the march, relying on the organisers'failure to submit a “traffic organisation plan ” within the meaning of section 65 (a) of the Road Traffic Act. In the latter decision the Mayor had relied on the argument that the applicants had failed to comply with more stringent requirements imposed by the law on organisers of assemblies held on roads used for road traffic."

This difference of treatment had not pursued a legitimate aim, the more so as the Mayor and his collaborators had made it plain to the public that they would ban the demonstrations because of the homosexual orientation of the organisers, regardless of any legal grounds."

It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded by those provisions. Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions – and to this extent it is autonomous – there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of the latter (see, among many other authorities, Van Raalte v.

These decisions focused on technical aspects of the organisation of the assemblies and on compliance with the relevant requirements (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). It has been established that in the proceedings before the Traffic Officer the applicants were required to submit a “traffic organisation plan ” and that their request was refused because of their failure to submit such a plan.

On 9 June 2005 the municipal authorities, acting on the Mayor's behalf, gave decisions banning the stationary assemblies to be organised by the first five applicants, referring to the need to avoid any possible violent clashes between participants in the various demonstrations to be held on 11 June 2005.

The Court reiterates that there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on questions of public interest, in particular as regards politicians themselves (see Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV, and Castells v. Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236 ). However, the exercise of freedom of expression by elected politicians who at the same time are holders of public offices in the executive branch of government entails particular responsibility. In certain situations it is a normal part of the duties of such public officials personally to take administrative decisions which are likely to affect the exercise of individual rights, or that such decisions are given by public servants acting in their name. Hence, the exercise of freedom of expression by such officials may unduly impinge on the enjoyment of other rights guaranteed by the Convention (as regards statements by public officials, amounting to declarations of a person's guilt, pending criminal proceedings, see Butkevičius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, § 53, ECHR 2002 ‑ II (extracts); see also Allenet de Ribemont v. France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 16, §§ 35-36, and Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, §§ 41 ‑ 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ X). When exercising their freedom of expression they may be required to show restraint, bearing in mind that their views can be regarded as instructions by civil servants whose employment and careers depend on their approval."

The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin, cited above, § 39 ). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to an interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see Bączkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, § 66-68, 3 May 2007 ). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, §§ 59 ‑ 62, ECHR 2003 ‑ III). So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 7 and 30, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII, and Hyde Park and Others v.

In order to determine whether an offence qualifies as “criminal” for the purposes of the Convention, it is first necessary to ascertain whether or not the provision defining the offence belongs, in the legal system of the respondent State, to criminal law; next, the “very nature of the offence” and the degree of severity of the penalty risked must be considered (see, among other authorities, Öztürk v.Germany, 21 February 1984, § 50, Series A no. 73; Demicoli v.

Austria, 23 October 1995, §§ 33-35, Series A no. 329 ‑ B ). Where this is the case, the indication afforded by national law is not decisive for the purpose of Article 6 and the very nature of the offence in question is a factor of greater importance (see Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, 28 June 1984, § 71, Series A no. 80; Weber v. Switzerland, 22 May 1990, § 32, Series A no. 177; and Menesheva v. Russia, no. 59261/00, § § 96-98, ECHR 2006 ‑ III )."

The police, on the other hand, alleged that Mr Kasparov had not simply been walking but had been taking part in an unauthorised demonstration, and they insisted that he had been doing so at a time when the event at the Griboyedov monument had ended. Another controversy between the parties relates to the place of arrest. According to the police, the applicants, including the first applicant, were arrested when the demonstration threatened to spill over into Red Square, a designated high-security area.

They claimed, in particular, that the applicants had been offered a different venue at which to conduct a public event on the requested date and that the proposed changes had seemingly been accepted by the event organisers. Moreover, the authorised meeting had indeed taken place at the Griboyedov monument, and the applicants could have participated in it. Instead, the applicants had pursued the itinerary indicated in the original request, walking on the pavement and on the road, obstructing pedestrians and traffic, and had then tried to enter Red Square. Given that this route had not been agreed with the Moscow authorities, the police could not have foreseen that the march would take place there and then and therefore could not have taken measures to maintain public order and safety. That was why the applicants, who were ignoring the police warnings, had had to be arrested.

France, 26 April 1991, § 35, Series A no. 202 ). The Court takes cognisance of the applicants ’ request to examine these as two separate issues because of the particular circumstances of the case. It observes that the administrative charges brought in this case referred, inter alia, to the applicants ’ having chanted anti-government slogans during an unauthorised demonstration. This complaint, falling in principle under Article 10, is similar in scope to those examined in Galstyan (cited above, § § 95-96 and § 100), where the applicant was arrested and convicted because of his behaviour during a political demonstration, and Sergey Kuznetsov v. Russia, ( no. 10877/04, § 23, 23 October 2008 ), where the applicant was charged with an administrative offence for distributing offensive leaflets during a picket.

                "84. The Court reiterates that the interference does not need to amount to an outright ban, legal or de facto, but can consist in various other measures taken by the authorities. The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin, cited above, § 39 ). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to an interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see Bączkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, § 66-68, 3 May 2007 ). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, §§ 59 ‑ 62, ECHR 2003 ‑ III). So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 7 and 30, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII, and Hyde Park and Others v. Moldova, no. 33482/06, §§ 9, 13, 16, 41, 44 and 48, 31 March 2009 ), and penalties imposed for having taken part in a rally (see Ezelin, cited above, § 41; Osmani and Others v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” (dec.), no. 50841/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ X; Mkrtchyan v. Armenia, no. 6562/03, § 37, 11 January 2007; Galstyan, cited above, §§ 100 ‑ 02; Ashughyan v. Armenia, no. 3 3268/03, §§ 75 ‑ 77, 17 July 2008; and Sergey Kuznetsov, cited above, § 36)."

The Court considers in that connection that irrespective of whether Mr Kasparov, Mr Tarasov and Mr Toropov were heading to an authorised public gathering, as they alleged, or were already in the process of conducting an unauthorised rally, as the Government claimed, their arrest constituted an interference with their right of peaceful assembly, as did the ensuing administrative charges brought against them. The Court observes, moreover, that the Government did not dispute the existence of the interference with the right to peaceful assembly in the present case."

                "86. The Court reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and is one of the foundations of such a society (see among numerous authorities, Galstyan, cited above, § 114). This right, of which the protection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. When examining whether restrictions on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered “necessary in a democratic society” the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation. An interference will be considered “necessary in a democratic society” for a legitimate aim if it answers a “pressing social need” and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and if the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient” (see, for example, Coster v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24876/94, § 104, 18 January 2001 and S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 101, ECHR 2008). It is, in any event, for the Court to give a final ruling on the restriction ’ s compatibility with the Convention and this is to be done by assessing the circumstances of a particular case (see Osmani and Others, cited above )."

                "88. As regards the lawfulness of the applicants ’ arrest and the subsequent administrative charges brought against them, the parties ’ diverging views on this point are rooted in their conflicting accounts of the factual circumstances of the case. The three applicants claimed that they had been walking to the authorised public event at the Griboyedov monument, and there had therefore been no grounds for their arrest, whereas the Government claimed that they had had to be arrested because they had been conducting a demonstration in breach of the regulations and because they were threatening to break through the security perimeter of Red Square. The Court has already found that the domestic courts made no attempt to establish the precise circumstances of the applicants ’ arrest, such as the time and the place, in order to verify whether it had been necessary to stop them (see paragraphs 60 -6 2 and 66 above). In the absence of sufficient factual material to resolve this controversy the Court is unable to accept either party ’ s version of events as a basis for deciding whether the authorities acted lawfully. In any event, it considers that in this case the issue of compliance with the law is indissociable from the question whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”. It will therefore examine this issue below ( see Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § 53, ECHR 2006 ‑ II )."

                "90. To assess whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” the Court will examine the proportionality of the interference in the light of the reasons given by the domestic courts. It observes that, according to the domestic judgments, the applicants were “ walking in a big group of people shouting anti-government slogans ”, that this constituted a public demonstration that had not been approved by the Moscow authorities and that the applicants were therefore in breach of Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences. It follows that in the domestic courts ’ view it was the lack of permission to stage a public demonstration that served as grounds for charging them with administrative offences."
            ],
            [
                "91. The Court reiterates that although it is not a priori contrary to the spirit of Article 11 if, for reasons of public order and national security, a High Contracting Party requires that the holding of meetings be subject to authorisation, an unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation, does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly ( see Cisse v. France, no. 51346/99, § 50, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Oya Ataman, cited above, § § 37 and 39 ). While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (ibid., § 42; see also Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, § 34, ECHR 2007 ‑ III; Fáber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 49, 24 July 2012, and Berladir and Others v. Russia, no. 34202/06, § 38, 10 July 2012 )."

Turning to the Government ’ s argument that the applicants were arrested because of the risk of the demonstration spilling over into the security area of Red Square, it must be noted that these reasons were also cited by the policemen who gave testimony. However, the police reports did not mention any such risk and, in any event, it did not form part of the reasoning given by the Justice of the Peace or the Tverskoy District Court. Moreover, the Court notes that the place of arrest set out in the judgments, 19 Tverskaya Street, is about 1.4 km away from the nearest approach to Red Square. Given the modest size of the group (estimated by the police as fifty to sixty persons) and the undeniably peaceful character of the march, the Court is not persuaded that the threat of the marchers penetrating the security area was imminent."

The Government ’ s allegation that the police had resorted to arresting the protesters because they were taken aback by the unforeseeable and unauthorised demonstration and were otherwise unable to cope is inconsistent with the facts established by the domestic courts. In particular, a policeman testified that the authorities had anticipated a rally at the time and place where the applicants were arrested, and measures had been taken to cordon off the area in advance of the march (see paragraph 23 above). Clear instructions had been given to the police officers who took part in the riot control operation specifically planned for the event. Moreover, the documents submitted by the Government reveal that reinforcements from the riot police had been brought in for the day from twenty-nine regions of Russia precisely because of the expected demonstration (see paragraph 11 above). These preparations should undoubtedly have enabled the police to divert a march of this scale from the high-security area."

The Court notes that the interference in the present cases amounted to the applicants ’ being arrested and sentenced to “administrative” detention in order to prevent their participation in the demonstration of 2 April 2011 and to punish them for having participated in opposition protests. The legal basis for those measures was Articles 296 and 310.1 of the CAO, which prescribes an administrative penalty for “ minor hooliganism ” and for “ failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer ” respectively. Thus, the measures in question were imposed relying on legal provisions which had no connection with the intended purpose of those measures. The Court cannot but agree with the applicants that the interference with their freedom of peaceful assembly on such a legal basis could only be characterised as arbitrary and unlawful (compare Hakobyan and Others, cited above, § 107 )."

                "84. The Court reiterates that interference with the exercise of freedom of peaceful assembly does not need to amount to an outright ban, legal or de facto, but can consist in various other measures taken by the authorities. The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 39, Series A no. 202, and Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 100, 15 October 2015 ). States must not only safeguard the right to assemble peacefully but must also refrain from applying unreasonable indirect restrictions upon that right (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ III). In Djavit An v. Turkey the Court considered that the refusals to grant permits to the applicant in order to cross into southern Cyprus had in effect barred his participation in bi-communal meetings there, preventing him consequently from engaging in peaceful assembly with people from both communities. The Court observed that hindrance could amount to a violation of the Convention just like a legal impediment (see Djavit An, cited above, § 61 and, mutatis mutandis, Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 18 December 1996, § 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ VI)."

The applicants alleged that the true reason behind their arrest and conviction had been to punish them for their political activity and to prevent them from attending the demonstration of 2 April 2011. The Government claimed that the reasons for the applicants ’ arrest and conviction were not related to any public assembly."

                "86. The Court notes that in essence the parties are disputing the factual basis for the applicants ’ convictions. The Court has emphasised on many occasions that it is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 28883/95, 4 April 2000, and Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, § 135, 24 February 2005). Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court ’ s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court, however, is not bound by the findings of domestic courts, although in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts (see Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, §§ 29-30, Series A no. 269, and Avşar v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, § 283, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII (extracts)). The Court has previously applied this reasoning in the context of Article 11 of the Convention (see Hakobyan and Others v. Armenia, no. 34320/04, §§ 92-99, 10 April 2012 and, mutatis mutandis, Europapress Holding d.o.o. v. Croatia, no. 25333/06, § 62, 22 October 2009)."

                "87. In assessing evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is to rule not on criminal guilt or civil liability, but on Contracting States ’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. The Court adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all the evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII)."

The demonstrations were held, inter alia, on 11 and 12 March 2011, 2 and 17 April 2011, 22 May 2011, and 19 June 2011. A number of international and domestic reports alleged that during the same period, the authorities had resorted to various seemingly arbitrary measures to quell support for the opposition (see paragraphs 67-76 above). The “ Observations on the human rights situation in Azerbaijan ” of 29 September 2011 adopted by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe stated, in particular, that “ [o] ne of the Commissioner ’ s recommendations to the Azerbaijani authorities was to end practices of unjustified or selective criminal prosecution of journalists or others who may express critical opinions ”. It noted that despite those recommendations, “ resort to such methods has apparently not abated” (see paragraph 67 above). The European Parliament in its Resolution of 12 May 2011 on Azerbaijan stated that it deplored “ the practice of intimidating, arresting, prosecuting and convicting independent journalists and political activists on various criminal charges [and] the arrest of around 200 people prior to, and during, the anti-government protests of 2 April 2011 in Baku ”. It called on the Azerbaijani authorities to allow peaceful protest as well as freedom of assembly (see paragraph 7 0 above)."

                "89. It follows from those reports that pre - emptive and/or retaliatory arrests and convictions under the Criminal Code or the CAO were widely used by the authorities to supress support for the opposition. The legal grounds used for detention of opposition activists were quite diverse and included grounds under the Criminal Code such as possession of drugs, possession of arms, evading military service, resistance to arrest and hooliganism, as well as grounds under the CAO such as failure to obey an order of a police officer and violation of traffic rules or otherwise disturbing public order. Opposition activists were reported to have been accused of disobeying a police officer for, for example, failing to produce an identity document or using foul language on the telephone."

It emerges clearly from the various sources cited above that, at the material time, opposition activists were routinely deterred or prevented from participating in demonstrations; were punished for having done so; and were punished for advocating or showing support for those demonstrations. This was done by resorting to the procedure of administrative detention under various substantive provisions of the CAO ( compare Hakobyan and Others, cited above, §§ 90-92 )."

Reportedly, on 31 March 2011 the Ministry of Internal Affairs warned the public that attempts to hold a protest rally on 2 April in the streets and squares of central Baku without the agreement of the BCEA would be prevented (see paragraph 77 above)."

Thus, according to the official records, all three applicants were arrested on the street for offences related to breach of public order, and none of them resisted being taken into police custody. The first applicant was accused of disobeying an order to show an identity document. Police officers had allegedly mistaken him for a person on a wanted list and had therefore stopped his car and demanded his identity document. However, neither the name of the wanted person, nor his specific features that had led the police officers to suspect the applicant were ever indicated by the police or the domestic courts. The second and third applicants were accused of swearing aloud at no one in particular and for no apparent reason. It is remarkable that neither of those charges, which were practically identical, provided sufficient details of the acts attributed to the applicants. They were couched in standardised and vague terms and remained unclear and unexplained at the trial ( compare Hakobyan and Others, cited above, §§ 93-95 )."

The legal basis for those measures was Articles 296 and 310.1 of the CAO, which prescribes an administrative penalty for “ minor hooliganism ” and for “ failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer ” respectively. Thus, the measures in question were imposed relying on legal provisions which had no connection with the intended purpose of those measures. The Court cannot but agree with the applicants that the interference with their freedom of peaceful assembly on such a legal basis could only be characterised as arbitrary and unlawful (compare Hakobyan and Others, cited above, § 107 )."

Lastly, the Court notes that the applicants alleged before the respective domestic courts that their arrest had been unlawful and contested the police officers ’ versions of the facts surrounding their arrest. However, there is nothing in the case files to suggest that the domestic courts took note of the applicants ’ arguments that they had been arrested for their activities as members of the opposition. The courts merely accepted the police ’ s versions of the facts and the charges as presented in the relevant police reports, and ignored the applicants ’ specific, relevant and important arguments. In this regard, the Court notes that whereas there were no witnesses who could have appeared on the first applicant ’ s behalf, in their oral and written submissions before the domestic courts the second and third applicants had indicated persons who would have confirmed their versions of the facts, namely, the second applicant ’ s father and the third applicant ’ s lawyer. Considering the nature and seriousness of all three applicants ’ allegations, the criminal nature of the proceedings against them and the lack of effective legal assistance, in the Court ’ s view the domestic courts should have taken steps to obtain the testimonies of those persons or attempted in some other way to clarify the disputed facts."

Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction – whatever its justification – must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6 (see Salduz v.

The waiver of a right guaranteed by the Convention – insofar as it is permissible – must be established in an unequivocal manner and must be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance (see Colozza v.

                "132. In addition, the Court emphasises that under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention, an accused is entitled to legal assistance which is practical and effective and not theoretical or illusory. This Convention provision speaks of “assistance” and not of “nomination”: mere nomination does not ensure effective assistance, since a lawyer may be prevented from providing such assistance for various practical reasons, or shirk his or her duties. A State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. However, if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or is sufficiently brought to the authorities ’ attention in some other way, the authorities must take steps to ensure that the accused effectively enjoys the right to legal assistance (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, §§ 33-37, Series A no. 37, and Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, § 65, Series A no. 168). Moreover, where it is clear that the lawyer representing the accused before the domestic court has not had the time and facilities to organise a proper defence, the court should take positive measures to ensure that the lawyer is given an opportunity to fulfil his obligations in the best possible conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, § 31, Series A no. 76). The Court notes that in the case of the first applicant, a State-funded lawyer joined the proceedings at the trial stage. There is nothing in the material before the Court to suggest, however, that before the opening of the first-instance court hearing he was afforded the time and facilities to organise a proper defence. The Court also observes that during the hearing the State-funded lawyer did not submit any written objections, complaints or motions on the applicant ’ s behalf. In his oral submissions the lawyer simply stated that the applicant was not guilty and asked the court to terminate the administrative proceedings against him. These circumstances give reason to believe that the representation by the State-funded lawyer was of a formalistic nature. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal failed to reply to the applicant ’ s complaints of lack of effective legal assistance both at the pre-trial proceedings and at the first-instance court hearing."

Secondly, even though the applicants refused State-funded legal assistance, it must be ascertained that their refusal amounted to an unequivocal waiver of the right to a lawyer.

A separate language and alphabet were created and imposed by decree of 2 August 1944. A massive assimilation campaign accompanied by brutalities was launched in Yugoslavia. For a short period of time the Bulgarian Communist Party – inspired by the idea of creating a Bulgarian-Yugoslav federation – also initiated a campaign of forcible imposition of a ‘Macedonian’ identity on the population in the region of Pirin Macedonia. In the 1946 and 1956 censuses individuals living in that region were forced to declare themselves ‘Macedonians’. The campaign was abandoned in 1963, partly due to the refusal of the population to change their identity.",
                "In those parts of the geographical region of Macedonia which were in Yugoslavia the realities of the bi-polar cold-war world – where the relations between Yugoslavia and the socialist block dominated by the USSR were tense – exacerbated the population’s feeling of doom and exasperation and their fear that unification with Bulgaria proper would never be possible. The forcible imposition of a Macedonian identity by the Tito regime also played a decisive role.",

The assemblies were held without a presumption of legality, such a presumption constituting a vital aspect of effective and unhindered exercise of freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. The Court observes that the refusals to give authorisation could have had a chilling effect on the applicants and other participants in the assemblies. It could also have discouraged other persons from participating in the assemblies on the grounds that they did not have official authorisation and that, therefore, no official protection against possible hostile counter ‑ demonstrators would be ensured by the authorities."

The Court refers in this respect to its finding concerning Article 13 of the Convention (see paragraph 8 4 below).

The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others v.

This provision complements the other substantive provisions of the Convention and the Protocols. It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded by those provisions. Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions – and to this extent it is autonomous – there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of the latter (see, among many other authorities, Van Raalte v.

It has been established that in the proceedings before the Traffic Officer the applicants were required to submit a “traffic organisation plan ” and that their request was refused because of their failure to submit such a plan.

Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV, and Castells v. Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236 ). However, the exercise of freedom of expression by elected politicians who at the same time are holders of public offices in the executive branch of government entails particular responsibility. In certain situations it is a normal part of the duties of such public officials personally to take administrative decisions which are likely to affect the exercise of individual rights, or that such decisions are given by public servants acting in their name. Hence, the exercise of freedom of expression by such officials may unduly impinge on the enjoyment of other rights guaranteed by the Convention (as regards statements by public officials, amounting to declarations of a person's guilt, pending criminal proceedings, see Butkevičius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, § 53, ECHR 2002 ‑ II (extracts); see also Allenet de Ribemont v. France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 16, §§ 35-36, and Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, §§ 41 ‑ 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ X). When exercising their freedom of expression they may be required to show restraint, bearing in mind that their views can be regarded as instructions by civil servants whose employment and careers depend on their approval."

In principle, regulations of this nature should not represent a hidden obstacle to the freedom of peaceful assembly as it is protected by the Convention. It goes without saying that any demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life and encounter hostility; this being so, it is important that associations and others organising demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, respect the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force."

The Court reiterates that although it is not a priori contrary to the spirit of Article 11 if, for reasons of public order and national security, a High Contracting Party requires that the holding of meetings be subject to authorisation, an unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation, does not justify per se an infringement of freedom of assembly ( see Cisse v. France, no. 51346/99, § 50, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Oya Ataman, cited above, §§ 37- 39). While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Bukta and Others v.

The most frequent problems encountered include the banning of demonstrations in central and easily accessible locations and the use of force to disperse the demonstrations which still go ahead, leading to arrests and, in some cases, harsh sentences. ...",

In particular, he reiterates the recommendation of the 2010 Report, inviting the authorities to reform the existing system of internal disciplinary investigations of police ill-treatment and to introduce an independent police complaints body. ...",
                "63. Azerbaijan amended its Law on Freedom of Assembly in 2008, following two opinions adopted by the Council of Europe Venice Commission. While the law is thus in line with international standards, undue restrictions of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly are widely reported in practice. The problems mainly stem from the interpretation of Article 5 of the law. This Article provides for a “notification” procedure before convening an assembly. In 2006, the Venice Commission welcomed the confirmation by representatives of the Government that the requirement in the law was for notification and not for a prior permission to hold the assembly, noting that “other provisions of the Law could, as they currently stand, encourage the competent authorities to issue a blanket prohibition as soon as the notification process proves incomplete.” In 2007, the Venice Commission added that a system of notification is in itself admissible so long as it is only meant to help the authorities cope more easily with the practical problems involved with the holding of an assembly; it also stressed that it is indeed important that assemblies can be held with a presumption of legality so as to avoid any chilling effect on organisers and participants.",
                "64. The Commissioner notes that the authorities have also confirmed that the legislation does not require permission for rallies. However, the authorities appear to have interpreted it as requiring such permission, and a system of authorisation has in practice replaced the system of notification. Peaceful protesters have for instance been effectively banned from demonstrating in central Baku since 2006, despite advanced notification of the assemblies. Several requests by the political opposition or civil society to hold demonstrations were allegedly denied or, when allowed, organisers were obliged to have them in areas very remote from the city centre. ...",

He therefore calls on the authorities to assess the functioning of that law. In particular, the authorities should ensure that no authorisation is required for the holding of public demonstrations and that the system of notification is applied in accordance with European standards.",

The Commissioner welcomes the announced publication by the authorities of a list of locations where demonstrations will be made possible, and calls for these to include adequate locations in the centre of Baku and other cities, as a first step towards a better enjoyment of the right to freedom of assembly by the population of Azerbaijan. Given the need for tolerance in a democratic society, the authorities should nevertheless seek to facilitate and protect public assemblies at the organisers ’ preferred location. ...",

The Commissioner is of the view that participants in peaceful assemblies should not be sanctioned for the mere fact of being present at and actively participating in the demonstration in question, provided they do not do anything illegal, violent or obscene in the course of it. The Commissioner therefore urges the authorities to ensure that no disproportionate sanction, which would undermine the fundamental right to peaceful assembly, is imposed.",

The Court reiterates that interference with the exercise of freedom of peaceful assembly does not need to amount to an outright ban, legal or de facto, but can consist in various other measures taken by the authorities. The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 39, Series A no. 202 ). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see Bączkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, §§ 66-68, 3 May 2007 ). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to interference as well (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, §§ 59 ‑ 62, ECHR 2003 ‑ III). So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 7 and 30, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII, and Hyde Park and Others v. Moldova, no. 33482/06, §§ 9, 13, 16, 41, 44 and 48, 31 March 2009), and penalties imposed for having taken part in a rally (see Ezelin, cited above, § 41; Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ X; Mkrtchyan v.

On the other hand, the Law on Freedom of Assembly provided the relevant local executive authority (in the present case, the BCEA) with broad powers to prohibit or stop a public assembly. Also, the Law vested it with the rights to restrict or change the place, route and/or time of a gathering, and to designate specific areas for public assemblies (see paragraphs 2 8 and 29 above). A number of international reports have stressed that a system of notification set forth by the Constitution has been replaced in practice by a system of authorisation (see paragraphs 4 0 -4 2 above). The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe in his Report of 6 August 2013 stated, in particular, that “peaceful protesters have ... been effectively banned from demonstrating in central Baku since 2006, despite advanced notification of the assemblies” (see paragraph 4 1 above).

In effect, the key circumstance constituting the basis for the administrative proceedings against the applicant was the fact that the demonstration in which he participated was unauthorised (contrast with Malofeyeva v. Russia, no. 36673/04, 30 May 2013 ). In such circumstances the Court has doubts about the credibility of the formal ground invoked by the authorities for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction."

When the Court carries out its scrutiny, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 11 the decisions they delivered in the exercise of their discretion. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among other authorities, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I, and Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § 70, ECHR 2006 ‑ II)."

The Court reiterates that although it is not a priori contrary to the spirit of Article 11 if, for reasons of public order and national security, a High Contracting Party requires that the holding of meetings be subject to authorisation, an unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation, does not justify per se an infringement of freedom of assembly ( see Cisse v. France, no. 51346/99, § 50, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Oya Ataman, cited above, §§ 37- 39). While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, § 34, ECHR 2007 ‑ III; Fáber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 49, 24 July 2012; Malofeyeva v. Russia, cited above, §§ 136-37; and Kasparov and Others v.

In the present case the organisers of the demonstration of 19 June 2011 gave prior notice to the BCEA in accordance with Article 49 of the Constitution and Article 5 of the Law on Freedom of Assembly. However, the authorities have not explained why, instead of taking measures to minimise the disruption to traffic and implementing other safety measures, they decided to refuse “authorisation” of the demonstration and subsequently to disperse it. The domestic courts in their turn did not attempt to examine whether the absence of authorisation justified the dispersal. Taking into account that the Constitution required only notification about a public assembly, not its authorisation, the Court considers that the authorities ignored the circumstances that were particularly relevant for assessment of the necessity of the interference."

The Court also observes that the authorities dispersed the demonstration shortly after it began, despite the fact that it had been intended to be peaceful and had been conducted in a peaceful manner up to that point. This already calls into question the Government ’ s assertion about the necessity of the dispersal. It has not been argued or demonstrated that it would have been difficult for the police to contain or redirect protestors, or control the situation otherwise, protect public safety and prevent any possible disorder or crime. Nor has it been shown, either at the domestic level or before the Court, that the demonstration posed a high level of disruption of public order.

Nor did they specify who had given such an order and when, or indicate its exact wording. In such circumstances, reference by the authorities to Article 310.1 of the CAO as a ground for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction appears to be unsubstantiated. Despite being formally charged with failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, the applicant in fact was arrested and convicted for his participation in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration. The Court notes that at the material time, no penalty in the form of deprivation of liberty was provided for under the CAO for participating in an unauthorised public assembly or generally for violation of rules on holding public assemblies. Nevertheless, the applicant was sentenced to five days ’ “administrative ” detention on charges that he “had failed to stop participating in the unauthorised demonstration”. It follows that the arbitrary reference to Article 310.1 of the CAO as a ground for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction also made it possible to apply a penalty which was otherwise not applicable to the action held against him."

In particular, in his appeal he argued that the legal basis invoked by the police for his arrest had been arbitrary; that the law, including the Constitution, required advance notification about an intended public assembly and not authorisation for holding one; and that there were no circumstances justifying dispersal of the demonstration since it had been peaceful.

Secondly, the Court emphasises that, under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention, an accused is entitled to legal assistance which is practical and effective and not theoretical or illusory. This Convention provision speaks of “assistance” and not of “nomination”: mere nomination does not ensure effective assistance, since a lawyer may be prevented from providing such assistance for various practical reasons, or shirk his or her duties. A State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. However, if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or is sufficiently brought to the authorities ’ attention in some other way, the authorities must take steps to ensure that the accused effectively enjoys the right to legal assistance (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, §§ 33-37, Series A no. 37, and Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, § 65, Series A no. 168). Moreover, where it is clear that the lawyer representing the accused before the domestic court has not had the time and facilities to organise a proper defence, the court should take positive measures to ensure that the lawyer is given an opportunity to fulfil his obligations in the best possible conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, § 31, Series A no. 76). The Court notes that a State-funded lawyer joined the proceedings at the trial stage; it is not clear whether, before the opening of the first-instance court hearing, he was afforded the time and facilities to organise a proper defence. However, the Court observes that during the hearing the State-funded lawyer did not submit any written objections, complaints or motions on the applicant ’ s behalf. His oral submissions consisted of a brief repetition of the applicant ’ s statement and a request addressed to the court to consider the applicant ’ s age and the fact that he had children.

In essence, a closed shop is an undertaking or workplace in which, as a result of an agreement or arrangement between one or more trade unions and one or more employers or employers ’ associations, employees of a certain class are in practice required to be or become members of a specified union. The employer is not under any legal obligation to consult or obtain the consent of individual employees directly before such an agreement or arrangement is put into effect. Closed shop agreements and arrangements vary considerably in both their form and their content; one distinction that is often drawn is that between the \"pre-entry\" shop (the employee must join the union before engaged) and the \"post-entry\" shop (he must join within a reasonable time after being engaged), the latter being more common.",
                "In the United Kingdom, the institution of the closed shop is of very long standing. In recent years, closed shop arrangements have become more formalised and the number of employees covered thereby has increased (3.75 million in the 1960 ’ s and 5 million in 1980, approximately). Recent surveys suggest that in many cases the obligation to join a specified union does not extend to existing non-union employees."

Nevertheless, the courts had since the 1920 ’ s recognised the legitimacy of the trade union object of advancing the union ’ s interests even to the point of enforcing the dismissal, or a ban on the hiring, of non-union employees. However, it was an unlawful conspiracy at common law to pursue a closed shop against individuals beyond the point which the courts regarded as the defence of genuine trade union interests (Huntley v. Thornton [1957] 1 All England Law Reports 234; Morgan v. Fry [1967] 2 All England Law Reports 386).",

In particular, a majority of that Commission took the view that an existing employee who was dismissed for refusal to join a union following the introduction of a closed shop should be able to succeed against his employer in a complaint of unfair dismissal so long as he could show that he had reasonable grounds for that refusal."

Leaving aside cases of justified summary dismissal, it was lawful to dismiss an employee, even without cause, provided that he was given due notice. The remedy open to an employee dismissed without due notice was merely to sue for the balance of wages he would have earned during the appropriate notice period; the courts would not order his employer to re-engage him. These principles applied, for example, to dismissals motivated by an employee ’ s joining, or refusing to join, a trade union.",

An individual who considered that he had been unfairly dismissed could present a complaint to an industrial tribunal; unless the dismissal had been motivated by one or more reasons specified in the Act (for example, qualifications, conduct, redundancy) or some other substantial reason and unless the employer was found to have acted reasonably in treating that or those reasons as a sufficient reason for dismissal, the tribunal could award compensation to the employee or recommend that he be re-engaged.

                "Secondly, pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a \"democratic society\" (p. 23, par. 49). Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position. Accordingly, the mere fact that the applicants ’ standpoint was adopted by very few of their colleagues is again not conclusive of the issue now before the Court.",

                "64. The Court has noted in this connection that a majority of the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers ’ Associations, which reported in 1968, considered that the position of existing employees in a newly-introduced closed shop was one area in which special safeguards were desirable (see paragraph 14 above). Again, recent surveys suggest that, even prior to the entry into force of the Employment Act 1980 (see paragraph 24 above), many closed shop arrangements did not require existing non-union employees to join a specified union (see paragraph 13 above); the Court has not been informed of any special reasons justifying the imposition of such a requirement in the case of British Rail. Besides, according to statistics furnished by the applicants, which were not contested, a substantial majority even of union members themselves disagreed with the proposition that persons refusing to join a union for strong reasons should be dismissed from employment. Finally, in 1975 more than 95 per cent of British Rail employees were already members of NUR, TSSA or ASLEF (see paragraph 31 above).",

This is confirmed by paragraph 7 (1) of the memorandum of association, which aims merely to'awaken and strengthen the national consciousness of Silesians'. ...",
                "(ii) The social research relied on by the applicants to demonstrate the existence of a'Silesian nationality'does not accord with numerous other scientific publications. Polish sociology distinguishes between two concepts of'homeland', namely a'local homeland'and an'ideological homeland'. In German, this distinction is expressed by the terms Heimat (local homeland) and Vaterland (ideological homeland). The research relied on by the applicants merely refers to the self-identification of the inhabitants of Silesia, indicating that their local self-identification takes precedence over their national self-identification. ...",
                "(iii) Paragraph 10 of the memorandum of association states that any person of Silesian nationality may become an ordinary member of the association, but does not clearly specify the criteria for establishing whether or not a given person fulfils this requirement. This absence of unambiguous criteria is contrary to section 10(1) ( i ) and ( iv ) of the Law on associations. Moreover, it renders paragraph 15 (2) (b) of the memorandum unlawful, for that provision allows the Management Committee to deprive a person of his membership in the event of failure to satisfy the conditions set out in the memorandum of association. ...",
                "(iv) Paragraph 30 of the memorandum of association, which calls the Union an'organisation of the Silesian national minority', is misleading and does not correspond to the facts. There is no basis for regarding the Silesians as a national minority. Recognising them as such would be in breach of Articles 67 § 2 and 81 § 1 of the [ former ] Constitution, which guarantee Polish citizens equal rights. In particular, under the relevant provisions of the Law on elections to the Sejm [ [2] ] of 28 May 1993 [ Ordynacja wyborcza do Sejmu Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej –'the 1993 Elections Act'], registration of the Union would give it a privileged position in terms of distribution of seats in Parliament. The Union would obtain rights and privileges guaranteed to national minorities in respect of education in their native language and access to the media. Registration of the association would be to the detriment of other ethnic groups in Poland, such as Cracovians [ Krakowiacy ], Highlanders [ Górale ] and Mazurians [ Mazurzy ]; this would amount to a return to the tribalism [ podziały plemienne ] which existed prior to the formation of the Polish State. ...",

They asserted that the fact that the majority of Poles failed to recognise the existence of a Silesian nation did not mean that there was no such nation. They cited various scientific publications and went on to explain that the fact that the Silesians formed a distinct group had already been acknowledged at the end of the First World War; moreover, the Silesians had always sought to preserve their identity and had always formed a distinct group, regardless of whether Upper Silesia had belonged to Germany or to Poland. Consequently, any comparison between them and the Cracovians or Highlanders was totally unjustified, because the latter groups neither regarded themselves as national minorities, nor had they ever been perceived as such in the past. Finally, the applicants cited certain letters of the Ministry of the Interior that had been published by the press and which explained that the National and Ethnic Minorities Bill [3] had explicitly stated that a “declaration that a person belongs to a minority shall not be questioned or verified by the public authorities”."

The Regional Court, leaving this issue aside – merely because of certain statutory time-limits – simplified the proceedings in an unacceptable manner. This led, in itself, to a failure on the part of the court to establish all the circumstances relevant to the outcome of the case and, furthermore, provided a sufficient basis for this appeal.",

The appellant does not contest the majority of these aims; it must be said that such activities as restoring Silesian culture, promoting knowledge of Silesia or providing social care for members of the association are worthy of respect and support. However, these aims can be fully accomplished without the contested provision of the memorandum of association, namely paragraph 30 ... In addition, the applicants were not prevented from incorporating the above-mentioned aims into the memorandum of an existing association called'Movement for the Autonomy of Silesia'[ Ruch Autonomii Śląska ], the more so as the applicants belong to influential circles of the latter organisation.",

                "On the other hand, an'ethnic group'is understood as a group which has a distinct language, a specific culture and a sense of social ties, is aware of the fact that it differs from other groups, and has its own name.",
                "Polish ethnographic science of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries describes'Silesians'as an autochthonous population of Polish origin residing in Silesia – a geographical and historical region. At present, as a result of political and social changes, the term'Silesians'refers equally to immigrants who have been living in this territory for several generations and who identify themselves with their new region of residence. It also refers to the German-speaking population, linked with Silesia by [such factors as] birth, residence and tradition (see the encyclopaedia published by the Polish Scientific Publishers in 1996). ...",
                "The applicants derive the rights they claim from the principles set out in the [Framework Convention], stating that every person belonging to a national minority has the right freely to choose to belong or not to belong to such a minority. ... In relying on European standards, they fail, however, to remember that a national minority with which a given person identifies himself must exist. There must be a society, established on the basis of objective criteria, with which this person wishes to identify. No one can determine his national identity independently of a fundamental element, which is the existence of a specific nation.",
                "It emerges from the above-mentioned definition of a'nation'that a nation is formed in a historical process which may last for centuries and that the crucial element which forms a nation is its self-identification, that is to say its national awareness established on the basis of the existing culture by a society residing on a specific territory.",
                "Certainly, the Silesians belong to a regional group with a very deep sense of identity, including their cultural identity; no one can deny that they are distinct. This does not, however, suffice for them to be considered a distinct nation. They have never commonly been perceived as a distinct nation and they have never tried to determine their identity in terms of [the criteria for a'nation']. On the contrary, the history of Silesia unequivocally demonstrates that the autochthonous inhabitants [of this region] have preserved their distinct culture and language (the latter having Polish roots from an ethnic point of view), even though their territories were not within the borders of the Polish State and even though they were under strong German influence. They are therefore Silesians – in the sense of [inhabitants of the] region, not in the sense of [their] nationality. Thus, Upper Silesia, in its ethnic roots [sic], remained Polish; that was, without a doubt, demonstrated by three uprisings. The role played by the Silesians in building and preserving the Polish character of Silesia, even though they remained isolated from their homeland, is unquestionable.",
                "However, a given nation exists where a group of individuals, considering itself a'nation', is in addition accepted and perceived as such by others. In the common opinion of Polish citizens, both the Silesians and other regional groups or communities [ for example, the Highlanders or the Mazurians] are perceived merely as local communities. In the international sphere, Poland and, similarly, France and Germany are perceived as single-nation States, regardless of the fact that there exist distinct ethnic groups ( for example, the inhabitants of Alsace or Lorraine in France, or the inhabitants of Bavaria in Germany ).",
                "On the whole, sociologists agree that the Silesians constitute an ethnic group and that the autochthonous inhabitants [of Silesia ] do have some features of a nation but that those features are not fully developed. That ... means that the awakening of their national identity is still at a very early stage. A nation exists only when there are no doubts as to its right to exist. ... In Poland, national minorities constitute only a small part of society, that is to say about 3 to 4%. They include – and this has never been denied – Germans, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Lithuanians, Slovaks, Czechs, Jews, Roma, Armenians and Tatars.",
                "In the Polish tradition, national minorities are perceived as groups linked to a majority outside Poland; in other words, a minority is an ethnic group that has support amongst a majority [residing] abroad. Moreover, traditionally, our society has not considered that groups which preserve a distinct culture but which do not belong to any State can be deemed to be national minorities. Accordingly, for a long time the Roma people were regarded as an ethnic, not a national group. ...",
                "The applicants'opinion that the mere choice of the individual concerned is decisive for his nationality is reflected in paragraph 10 of the memorandum of association. Acceptance of this opinion would consequently lead to a situation in which the aims pursued by the association could be accomplished by groups of members who did not have any connection or links with Silesia and who had become members of the Union solely to gain an advantage for themselves. Undoubtedly, such groups of members cannot [be allowed] to accomplish the aims of an association of a national minority. ...",
                "The applicants have relied on the results of sociological research carried out in 1994 in the province of Katowice. Indeed, the research demonstrates that 25% of persons requested to declare their ethnic and regional identity replied that they were Silesians. However, it transpires from [the material collected in the course of another piece of sociological research of 1996 which was submitted by the applicants during the appeal hearing] that two years later the number of persons who considered themselves to be Silesians had decreased to 12.4% and that, moreover, the majority of inhabitants of the province of Katowice considered themselves to be Poles ( that is, 81.9%, including 18.1% who stated that they were'Polish Silesians'; only 3.5% of inhabitants considered themselves to be Germans, including 2.4 % who stated that they were'German Silesians').",
                "In the light of the above research, it cannot be said that such a poorly established self-identity of a small (and decreasing) group of Silesians, as demonstrated by their refusal to declare that they belong to the [Polish] nation, provides a basis for recognising that all Silesians (who have lived in Silesia for generations and state that they belong to the Polish nation) constitute a separate nation. This would be contrary to the will of the majority, a will well known to the applicants.",
                "We therefore find that the appellant is right in submitting that granting the applicants'application for their association to be registered is unjustified because the memorandum of association is contrary to the law, namely Article 5 of the Civil Code. Indeed, the application is aimed at registering an organisation of a minority which cannot be regarded as a national minority and at circumventing the provisions of the 1993 Elections Act and other statutes conferring particular privileges on national minorities. Granting such a request could lead to granting unwarranted rights to the association in question. This would, moreover, give it an advantage in relation to other regional or ethnic organisations.",

Their arguments are summarised as follows:",
                "“Since a refusal to register an association could be justified only if an activity specified in the memorandum of association was banned by the law, the principal issue to be determined by the Court of Appeal was whether the memorandum of the applicants'association complied with the statutory requirements. That was clearly not the case and the court's fear that the registration of the applicants'association would in future lead to discrimination against other national or ethnic minorities was based on mere speculation. In any event, the Law on associations [in sections 8(2), 25 et seq. ] provided for various means whereby the activity of an association could be supervised by the competent State authorities or, in the event that its activity was unlawful, the association could be dissolved.",
                "However, the Court of Appeal, instead of assessing the formal requirements of the registration, decided at the outset that the core issue in the proceedings was to establish whether a Silesian nation existed. It consequently went on to lay down its own arbitrary and controversial definition of'nation'and'national minority', and finally concluded that there was no'Silesian nation'. It did so without any effort to obtain expert evidence in respect of such an important matter.”"

This means that the name of an association should not be misleading. Since the requirement set out in the above-mentioned section was not complied with, the refusal to register the applicants'association was justified under section 14 (1).",

That means that a given nation must exist prior to the individual making a decision to belong to this nation.

                "“... [A] necessary prerequisite for the registration of an association is the conformity of its memorandum of association with the entire domestic legal order, including conformity with [the provisions of ] international treaties ratified by Poland.",
                "In the present case the Court of Appeal had no doubts as to the lawfulness of the aims pursued by [the applicants'] association, but refused to register the association for the sole reason that [the applicants], in the memorandum of association, used such terms as'Silesian nation'and'Silesian national minority'.",
                "We agree with the opinion [of the Court of Appeal].'National minority'is a legal term ( see Article 35 of the Constitution of 2 February 1997 ), although it is not defined either in Polish law or in the conventions relied on in the appeal on points of law. However, the explanatory report to the [ Framework Convention ] states plainly that the individual's subjective choice of a nation is inseparably linked to objective criteria relevant to his or her national identity. That means that a subjective declaration of belonging to a specific national group implies prior social acceptance of the existence of the national group in question. ...",
                "An individual has the right to choose his or her nation but this, as the Court of Appeal rightly pointed out, does not in itself lead to the establishment of a new, distinct nation or national minority.",
                "There was, and still is, a common perception that a Silesian ethnic group does exist; however, this group has never been regarded as a national group and has not claimed to be regarded as such. ...",
                "Registration of the association, which in paragraph 30 of its memorandum of association states that it is an organisation of a [specific] national minority, would be in breach of the law because it would result in a non-existent'national minority'taking advantage of privileges conferred on [genuine] national minorities. This concerns, in particular, the privileges granted by the 1993 Elections Act ... such as an exemption from the requirement that a party or other organisation standing in elections should get at least 5% of the votes, which is a prerequisite for obtaining seats in Parliament ... [or] ... privileges in respect of the registration of electoral lists; thus, it suffices for an organisation of a national minority to have its electoral lists registered in at least five constituencies [whereas the general requirement is to register an electoral list in at least half of the constituencies in the whole of Poland].",
                "Pursuant to the relevant ruling of the Constitutional Court [ Trybunał Konstytucyjny ] [4] on the interpretation of the 1993 Elections Act, ... the privileges [referred to above] are conferred on electoral committees of registered national minorities and, in case of doubt [as to whether or not an electoral committee represents a national minority], the State Electoral College may request evidence.",
                "The simplest means of proving the existence of a specific national minority is to present a memorandum of association confirming that fact. It is true that, under the new Constitution, resolutions of the Constitutional Court on the interpretation of statutes no longer have universally binding force; however, in view of the persuasiveness of the reasons given by the Constitutional Court and the requirements of practice, [we consider that] a memorandum of association still remains basic evidence demonstrating the existence of a national minority.",
                "Conferring on the Silesians, an ethnic group, the rights of a national minority would be contrary to Article 32 of the Constitution, stating that all persons are equal before the law, [because] other ethnic minorities would not enjoy the same rights.",
                "The memorandum of association is contrary to section 10(1) ( iv ) of the Law on associations, which stipulates that a memorandum of association must set out rules concerning acquisition and loss of membership, and the rights and duties of members. Paragraph 10 of the memorandum provides that everyone who is a Polish citizen and has submitted a written declaration stating that he is of Silesian nationality may become a member of the Union, whereas paragraph 15 states that a person ceases to be a member of the Union if, inter alia, he has not fulfilled the membership requirements set out in the memorandum of association. Since no Silesian nation exists, no one would lawfully be able to become a member of the Union, because his declaration of Silesian nationality would be untrue. ...",
                "Furthermore, it must be pointed out that the refusal to register the association does not contravene Poland's international obligations. Both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ... and the Convention allow [the State] to place restrictions on the freedom of association, [in particular such as] are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety or for the protection of health and morals or for the protection of the rights of others.",
                "It is contrary to public order to create a non-existent nation that would be able to benefit from the privileges conferred solely on national minorities. Such a situation would also lead to the infringement of the rights of others, not only national minorities but also all other citizens of Poland. Granting privileges to a [specific] group of citizens means that the situation of the other members of society becomes correspondingly less favourable.",
                "This is particularly so in the sphere of election law: if certain persons may become members of Parliament [because of their privileged position], it means that other candidates must obtain a higher number of votes than what would be required in the absence of privileges [in that respect].",
                "It also has to be noted that the essential aims of the association can be accomplished without the contested provisions of the memorandum and without the [specific] name of the association. Under the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, national and ethnic minorities have equal rights as regards their freedom to preserve and develop their own language, to maintain their customs and traditions, to develop their culture, to establish educational institutions or institutions designed to protect their religious identity and to participate in the resolution of matters relating to their cultural identity ( see Article 35). ...”",

In its ruling, the Constitutional Court addressed, among other things, the following question:",

                "“It must be stressed at the outset that the basis for section 5(1) of the 1993 Elections Act is to give Polish citizens belonging to national minorities an equal opportunity to participate in representative bodies. However, the possibility provided by this provision for electoral committees of registered national minority organisations to take advantage of exemptions from electoral thresholds is an exception to the principle of equality of electoral rights in a material sense. In practice, the electoral committee that has submitted a given national minority list [of candidates] will participate [in the distribution of seats in Parliament] ..., despite the fact that its list has not attained the corresponding threshold. This solution reflects a certain understanding of the equality principle that involves entities participating in elections being given equal opportunities ... This amounts to discrimination in favour of electoral committees of registered national minority organisations in comparison with other electoral committees. Since they constitute an exception to the equality principle, provisions governing such discrimination cannot be interpreted extensively.",
                "Secondly, section 5(1) reserves the privilege of exemption from electoral thresholds to lists of candidates supplied by the electoral committees of one or more registered national minority organisations, and only committees of that type may submit corresponding declarations to the State Electoral College. The emphasis should be placed on both the reference to'registered organisations of national minorities'and to electoral committees acting in their name, for this privilege is available to'national minority'organisations that are organised and act as such. [A] ... condition of the validity, and hence of effectiveness of a declaration seeking to take advantage of the exemption is that it must be submitted by an entity entitled to do so. It is therefore the responsibility of that entity to provide documentary evidence of its entitlement to submit the declaration. In practice, this amounts to a responsibility to submit to the State Electoral College documents unambiguously demonstrating that the electoral committee submitting the declaration is an entity entitled to do so, that is to say, the electoral committee of not just any organisation, but of one or more registered national minority organisations.",
                "In accordance with section 5(2), the State Electoral College is required to acknowledge, without delay, receipt of the declaration referred to in subsection ( 1 ), in other words, a declaration that has been submitted by an entity entitled to do so. In that connection, the College has a duty to verify whether the declaration was submitted by such an entity, and if in doubt, may require documentation unambiguously confirming the entity's right to submit the declaration, as the declaration gives rise to legal consequences, so justifying the need for specific verification. ... If such documents are not submitted, the State Electoral College is precluded from acknowledging receipt of the declaration referred to in section 5(1), since, apart from the requirement that it be made at the prescribed time to the appropriate electoral college, a vital condition for the validity of the declaration is that it be made by an entitled entity. On the other hand, the State Electoral College does not verify the content of the declaration, for which the electoral committee takes full responsibility.",

A margin of doubt in relation to borderline facts does not by itself make a legal provision unforeseeable in its application. Nor does the mere fact that such a provision is capable of more than one construction mean that it fails to meet the requirement of “foreseeability” for the purposes of the Convention. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain, taking into account the changes in everyday practice ( see Refah Partisi ( the Welfare Party) and Others and Rekvényi, cited above).",

The choice as to what form such recognition should take and whether it should be implemented through international treaties or bilateral agreements or incorporated into the Constitution or a special statute must, by the nature of things, be left largely to the State concerned, as it will depend on particular national circumstances."

In Poland the rules applicable to national or ethnic minorities are not to be found in a single document, but are divided between a variety of instruments, including the Constitution, electoral law and international agreements. The constitutional guarantees are afforded to both national and ethnic minorities. The Constitution makes no distinction between national and ethnic minorities as regards their religious, linguistic and cultural identities, the preservation, maintenance and development of their language, customs, traditions and culture, or the establishment of educational and cultural institutions (see paragraph 37 above). In contrast, electoral law introduces special privileges only in favour of “registered organisations of national minorities” (see paragraph 41 above). It does not give any indication as to the criteria a “national minority” must fulfil in order to have its organisation registered.",
                "However, the Court considers that the lack of an express definition of the concept of “national minority” in the domestic legislation does not mean that the Polish State was in breach of its duty to frame law in sufficiently precise terms. Nor does it find any breach on account of the fact that the Polish State chose to recognise minorities through bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries rather than under a specific internal procedure. The Court recognises that, for the reasons explained above, in the area under consideration it may be difficult to frame laws with a high degree of precision. It may well even be undesirable to formulate rigid rules. The Polish State cannot, therefore, be criticised for using only a general statutory categorisation of minorities and leaving interpretation and application of those notions to practice."

As regards the registration procedure, it was both inevitable and consistent with the adjudicative role vested in them for the national courts to be left with the task of interpreting the notion of “national minority”, as distinguished from “ethnic minority” within the meaning of the Constitution, and assessing whether the applicants'association qualified as an “organisation of a national minority” (see paragraph 65 above)."

While in the context of Article 11 the Court has often referred to the essential role played by political parties in ensuring pluralism and democracy, associations formed for other purposes, including those protecting cultural or spiritual heritage, pursuing various socio-economic aims, proclaiming or teaching religion, seeking an ethnic identity or asserting a minority consciousness, are also important to the proper functioning of democracy. For pluralism is also built on the genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs, artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively."

Indeed, forming an association in order to express and promote its identity may be instrumental in helping a minority to preserve and uphold its rights.",

Freedom of association is not absolute, however, and it must be accepted that where an association, through its activities or the intentions it has expressly or implicitly declared in its programme, jeopardises the State's institutions or the rights and freedoms of others, Article 11 does not deprive the State of the power to protect those institutions and persons. This follows both from paragraph 2 of Article 11 and from the State's positive obligations under Article 1 of the Convention to secure the rights and freedoms of persons within its jurisdiction ( see Refah Partisi ( the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, §§ 96-103)."

Nonetheless, that power must be used sparingly, as exceptions to the rule of freedom of association are to be construed strictly and only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restrictions on that freedom. Any interference must correspond to a “pressing social need”; thus, the notion “necessary” does not have the flexibility of such expressions as “useful” or “desirable” (see Young, James and Webster, and Chassagnou and Others, cited above)."

This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, mutatis mutandis, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others, cited above, p. 27, §§ 46-47, and Refah Partisi ( the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 100 ).",

The applicants submitted that the effective – and ultimate – power to acknowledge or reject their claim to privileges under section 5 of the 1993 Elections Act was vested in the State Electoral College (see paragraph 79 above). The Government, on the other hand, contended that the College would have had no power to reject a declaration by the association notifying it that it had set up an “electoral committee of a registered organisation of a national minority” because that would have been the legal status enjoyed by the association as confirmed by documentary evidence in the form of the memorandum of their registered association and, more particularly, paragraph 30 thereof (see paragraph 86 above)."

When considering the legal consequences of registering the association with the statement in its memorandum of association that it was “an organisation of the Silesian national minority”, the Supreme Court evidently worked on the assumption that, had the members of the association run for election, the State Electoral College would have had no choice but to accept their declaration under section 5 of the 1993 Elections Act (see paragraph 36 above). Such a reading of the relevant provisions of domestic law, limiting the role of the State Electoral College to controlling technical and formal matters, with no competence to examine substantive criteria such as the existence or not of a “national minority”, cannot, in the Court's opinion, be regarded as arbitrary. Under Polish law, as authoritatively interpreted by the Polish Supreme Court, therefore, the procedure before the State Electoral College could not – after the registration of the association – serve to prevent its members from acquiring special electoral status (see paragraphs 36 and 42-43 above).",
                "Had registration been granted, a decision by the applicants to run as candidates in elections as members of the association would, as the Government have pointed out (see paragraph 86 above), have been no more than a legitimate exercise of their political rights. In consequence, the Court is not convinced that any of the drastic measures available under the Law on associations, such as annulment of a resolution to put up candidates in elections or dissolution of the association, which could be imposed only if “such a resolution [was] contrary to the law or the provisions of the memorandum of association” or “if its activities ... demonstrated a flagrant or repeated failure to comply with the law or with the provisions of the memorandum of association” (see paragraph 40 above), would have been applicable and, therefore, susceptible of avoiding the particular mischief which the authorities were seeking to avoid."

The Court will accordingly proceed on the understanding, which was the basis of the judgment by the Polish Supreme Court, that under Polish law the registration of the applicants'association as an “organisation of a national minority” was capable by itself of setting in motion a chain of further events that would lead, subject only to voluntary actions by the association and its members, to the acquisition of electoral privileges. In other words, the risk that the association and its members might claim electoral privileges was inherent in any decision that allowed them to form the association without first amending paragraph 30 of the memorandum of association."

                "103. That being so, the appropriate time for countering the risk of the perceived mischief, and thereby ensuring that the rights of other persons or entities participating in parliamentary elections would not actually be infringed, was at the moment of registration of the association and not later. The Court does not therefore subscribe to the applicants'analysis of the impugned measure as being one of prior restraint in anticipation of any action which the association might or might not take in future and which could as well have been controlled by the exercise of the authorities'supervisory powers under sections 25 and 26 of the Law on associations. In reality, imposing as a condition for registration of the association that the reference to an “organisation of a national minority” be removed from paragraph 30 of the memorandum of association was no more than the legitimate exercise by the Polish courts of their power to control the lawfulness of this instrument, including the power to refuse any ambiguous or misleading clause liable to lead to an abuse of the law – in the event, a clause which would create for the association and its members a capacity, which could not be impeded, to enjoy electoral privileges to which they were not entitled (see the reasoning of the Supreme Court quoted in paragraph 36 above).",
                "Consequently, the Court accepts that the national authorities, and in particular the national courts, did not overstep their margin of appreciation in considering that there was a pressing social need, at the moment of registration, to regulate the free choice of associations to call themselves an “organisation of a national minority”, in order to protect the existing democratic institutions and election procedures in Poland and thereby, in Convention terms, prevent disorder and protect the rights of others (see paragraph 76 above).",

They further submitted that the machinery established by the Law on associations for monitoring the activities of associations would not be sufficient to prevent them from taking advantage of privileges under electoral law (see paragraphs 82-86 above)."

The Court, on the basis of Polish law as authoritatively interpreted by the Polish Supreme Court, has already rejected the applicants'argument that the provisions on the regulation of the activities of associations in the Law on associations would have provided an alternative and less onerous means of avoiding a future abuse of electoral privileges by the applicants'association (see paragraphs 101 and 103, first sub-paragraph, above). The Court does however accept that, in its impact on the applicants, the impugned measure was radical: it went so far as to prevent the association from even commencing any activity.",
                "However, the degree of interference under paragraph 2 of Article 11 cannot be considered in the abstract and must be assessed in the particular context of the case. There may also be cases in which the choice of measures available to the authorities for responding to a “pressing social need” in relation to the perceived harmful consequences linked to the existence or activities of an association is unavoidably limited.",
                "In the instant case the refusal was not a comprehensive, unconditional one directed against the cultural and practical objectives that the association wished to pursue, but was based solely on the mention, in the memorandum of association, of a specific appellation for the association. It was designed to counteract a particular, albeit only potential, abuse by the association of its status as conferred by registration. It by no means amounted to a denial of the distinctive ethnic and cultural identity of Silesians or to a disregard for the association's primary aim, which was to “awaken and strengthen the national consciousness of Silesians” (see paragraph 19 above). On the contrary, in all their decisions the authorities consistently recognised the existence of a Silesian ethnic minority and their right to associate with one another to pursue common objectives (see paragraphs 32 and 36 above). All the various cultural and other activities that the association and its members wished to undertake could have been carried out had the association been willing to abandon the appellation set out in paragraph 30 of its memorandum of association.",
                "Like the Chamber, the Grand Chamber finds it hard to perceive any practical purpose for this paragraph in relation to the association's proposed activities other than to prepare the ground for enabling the association and its members to benefit from the electoral privileges accorded by section 5(1) of the 1993 Elections Act to “registered organisations of national minorities” (see also paragraph 64 of the Chamber's judgment). The disputed restriction on the establishment of the association was essentially concerned with the label which the association could use in law – with whether it could call itself a “national minority” – rather than with its ability “to act collectively in a field of mutual interest” (see paragraph 88 above). As such, it did not go to the core or essence of freedom of association.",

The authorities did not prevent them from forming an association to express and promote distinctive features of a minority but from creating a legal entity which, through registration under the Law on associations and the description it gave itself in paragraph 30 of its memorandum of association, would inevitably become entitled to a special status under the 1993 Elections Act. Given that the national authorities were entitled to consider that the contested interference met a “pressing social need” and given that the interference was not disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued, the refusal to register the applicants'association can be regarded as having been “necessary in a democratic society” within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 of the Convention.",

Similarly, it does not contain an explicit ban on the creation of regional parties. Accordingly, the requirement in section 3 § 2 of [the Political Parties Act] that political parties may be created and operated only on the federal ( all-Russian) level is a limitation of the constitutional right to freedom of association in political parties. Such limitations are permissible only if they are necessary in order to protect constitutionally guaranteed values (Article 55 § 4 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation ).",
                "3.1. ... [The Political Parties Act] guarantees the right to freedom of association in political parties (section 2) and provides that political parties are established for the purpose of ensuring participation by Russian citizens in the political life of their society. Their mission is to form and articulate citizens ’ political will, to take part in public and political actions, elections and referenda, as well as to represent citizens ’ interests in State and municipal bodies (section 3 § 1). According to the substance of [the Political Parties Act ], political parties are created to ensure Russian citizens ’ participation in the political life of the entire Russian Federation rather than in one of its parts. Their vocation is to form the political will of the multinational Russian people as a whole and to articulate nationwide interests first and foremost. Their aims should not be associated with the interests of certain regions only. At the same time, when carrying out their activities directly in the regions, political parties must combine nationwide and regional interests ...",
                "The federal legislator ... made the acquisition (and retention) of the status of a political party conditional, firstly, on a public association expressing the interests of a considerable number of citizens irrespective of their region of residence and, secondly, on its carrying out activities in the entire territory of the Russian Federation or most of it. Such structuring of the political scene is aimed at preventing the division of the political forces and the emergence of numerous artificial small parties (especially during electoral campaigns) created for a short duration and therefore incapable of fulfilling their mission ... in the country ’ s political system.",
                "3.2. ... In the contemporary conditions where Russian society has not yet acquired solid experience of democratic existence and is faced with serious challenges from separatist, nationalist and terrorist forces, the creation of regional political parties – which would inevitably be interested in vindicating mainly their own purely regional or local interests – might result in a breach of the territorial integrity and unity of the political system and undermine the federative structure of the country.",
                "The legal line between regional political parties and political parties based in fact on ethnic or religious affiliation would be blurred. Such parties ... would inevitably strive to assert mainly the rights of their respective ethnic and religious communities, which at the present stage of historic development would distort the process of forming and articulating the political will of the multinational people which is the bearer of sovereignty and the only source of power in the Russian Federation.",
                "Moreover, taking into account the complex [federal] structure of the Russian Federation, the establishment of regional and local political parties in each region of the Federation might lead to the rise of numerous regional party systems. This might turn the emerging party system ... into a destabilising factor for the developing Russian democracy, popular sovereignty, federalism and the unity of the country, and weaken the constitutional protection of people ’ s rights and freedoms, including the right to freedom of association in political parties and the equal right of all citizens to establish a political party and participate in its activities in the entire territory of the Russian Federation.",
                "3.3. Thus, the requirement contained in [the Political Parties Act] that the status of a political party may be acquired only by nationwide (all-Russian) public associations pursues such constitutionally protected aims as the creation of a real multiparty system, the legal institutionalisation of political parties in order to assist the development of the civil society, and ... the formation of large, nationwide political parties. This requirement is also necessary in the contemporary historical conditions of developing democracy and rule of law in the Russian Federation for the purpose of protecting constitutional values and, above all, securing the unity of the country. The above limitation is temporary in character and must be abolished as soon as the circumstances justifying it become different.",
                "4. Although it provides for a multiparty system and guarantees the right to freedom of association in political parties and the freedom of their activities, the Constitution of the Russian Federation does not set any requirements concerning the number of parties, or any membership requirements. Nor does it prohibit establishing a minimum membership requirement for political parties. It is the role of the federal lawmaker to establish those requirements in such a way that, on the one hand, the [required minimum] membership and territorial scale of activities of political parties are not excessive and do not encroach on the very essence ... of the citizens ’ right to freedom of association and, on the other hand, [the political parties] are capable of fulfilling their aims and mission as nationwide (all-Russian) political parties. In other words, the lawmaker must be guided by the criteria of reasonable sufficiency ensuing from the principle of proportionality.",
                "When deciding on the minimum membership and the territorial scale of the activities of political parties the lawmaker has a wide discretion, taking into account that this issue is to a considerable degree based on political expediency. This follows from the fact that there exist different solutions to the issue in the legislation of other countries (the minimum membership requirement for political parties is considerably higher or lower than that contained in section 3 of [the Political Parties Act]) ...",
                "Defining the minimum-membership requirement for political parties in [the Political Parties Act], the lawmaker apparently proceeded from the necessity for a political party to have considerable support in society. Such support is required to fulfil the main mission of a political party in a democratic society, namely forming and articulating the political will of the people. The requirements such as contained in section 3 § 2 of [the Political Parties Act] [as in force until 20 December 2004] are not in themselves incompatible with the Constitution of the Russian Federation. These quantitative requirements might become incompatible with the Constitution if their enforcement results in the practical impossibility for the citizens to exercise their constitutional right to freedom of association in political parties, for example if, in breach of the constitutional principle of the multiparty system, they permit the establishment of one party only.",
                "5. The principle of political pluralism guaranteed by Article 13 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation may be implemented not only through a multiparty system and establishment and the activities of political parties with various ideologies. Therefore the forfeiture by interregional, regional and local public associations ... of the right to be called a political party does not mean that such associations are deprived of the right to participate in the political life of society at the regional and local levels. Nor have their members been deprived of the right to freedom of association.",
                "... public associations have the majority of the rights guaranteed to political parties ... The provision of [the Political Parties Act] that a political party is the only kind of public association that may nominate candidates in elections to State bodies (section 6 § 1) does not mean that other public associations, including regional and local ones, ... are deprived of the right to nominate candidates for elections to municipal bodies or the right to initiate regional or local referenda ...",
                "6. It follows from the above that, taking into account the historical conditions of development of the Russian Federation as a democratic and federative State governed by the rule of law, sections 3 § 2 and 47 § 6 of [the Political Parties Act] setting out the requirements for political parties and providing for the forfeiture by interregional, regional and local public associations of the status of political parties ... cannot be considered as imposing excessive limitations on the right to freedom of association. The above requirements do not prevent citizens of the Russian Federation from exercising their constitutional right to freedom of association by creating all-Russian political parties or joining them, or from defending their interests and achieving their collective goals in the political sphere at the interregional, regional and local levels by creating public associations ... and joining them ... ”"

That will and those interests can be expressed only by large, well-structured political parties.",

                "1. States should recognise that everyone has the right to associate freely in political parties. This right shall include freedom to hold political opinions and to receive and impart information without interference by a public authority and regardless of frontiers. The requirement to register political parties will not in itself be considered to be in violation of this right.",
                "3. Prohibition or enforced dissolution of political parties may only be justified in the case of parties which advocate the use of violence or use violence as a political means to overthrow the democratic constitutional order, thereby undermining the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the constitution. The fact alone that a party advocates a peaceful change of the Constitution should not be sufficient for its prohibition or dissolution.",
                "5. The prohibition or dissolution of political parties as a particularly far-reaching measure should be used with utmost restraint. Before asking the competent judicial body to prohibit or dissolve a party, governments or other state organs should assess, having regard to the situation of the country concerned, whether the party really represents a danger to the free and democratic political order or to the rights of individuals and whether other, less radical measures could prevent the said danger.",

Legal measures directed to the prohibition or legally enforced dissolution of political parties shall be a consequence of a judicial finding of unconstitutionality and shall be deemed as of an exceptional nature and governed by the principle of proportionality. Any such measure must be based on sufficient evidence that the party itself and not only individual members pursue political objectives using or preparing to use unconstitutional means.",

                "B. Registration as a necessary step for recognition of an association as a political party, for a party ’ s participation in general elections or for public financing of a party does not per se amount to a violation of rights protected under Articles 11 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Any requirements in relation to registration, however, must be such as are ‘ necessary in a democratic society ’ and proportionate to the objective sought to be achieved by the measures in question. Countries applying registration procedures to political parties should refrain from imposing excessive requirements for territorial representation of political parties as well as for minimum membership. The democratic or non-democratic character of the party organisation should not in principle be a ground for denying registration of a political party. Registration of political parties should be denied only in cases clearly indicated in the Guidelines on prohibition of political parties and analogous measures, i.e. when the use of violence is advocated or used as a political means to overthrow the democratic constitutional order, thereby undermining the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the constitution. The fact alone that a peaceful change of the Constitution is advocated should not be sufficient for denial of registration.",
                "C. Any activity requirements for political parties, as a prerequisite for maintaining the status as a political party and their control and supervision, have to be assessed by the same yardstick of what is ‘ necessary in a democratic society ’. Public authorities should refrain from any political or other excessive control over activities of political parties, such as membership, number and frequency of party congresses and meetings, operation of territorial branches and subdivisions.",
                "D. State authorities should remain neutral in dealing with the process of establishment, registration (where applied) and activities of political parties and refrain from any measures that could privilege some political forces and discriminate others. All political parties should be given equal opportunities to participate in elections.",
                "E. Any interference of public authorities with the activities of political parties, such as, for example, denial of registration, loss of the status of a political party if a given party has not succeeded in obtaining representation in the legislative bodies (where applied), should be motivated, and legislation should provide for an opportunity for the party to challenge such decision or action in a court of law.",
                "F. Although such concern as the unity of the country can be taken into consideration, Member States should not impose restrictions which are not “necessary in a democratic society” on the establishment and activities of political unions and associations on regional and local levels.",
                "G. When national legislation provides that parties lose their status of a political party if they do not succeed to take part in elections or to obtain representation in legislative bodies, they should be allowed to continue their existence and activities under the general law on associations.",
                "a. Registration of political parties",
                "10. The already mentioned study on the establishment, organisation and activities of political parties conducted in 2003 by the Sub-Commission on Democratic Institutions has shown that many countries view registration as a necessary step for recognition of an association as a political party, for participation in general elections or for public financing. This practice – as the Venice Commission has stated before in its Guidelines on Prohibition and Dissolution of Political Parties – even if it were regarded as a restriction of the right to freedom of association and freedom of expression, would not per se amount to a violation of rights protected under Articles 11 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The requirements for registration, however, differ from one country to another. Registration may be considered as a measure to inform the authorities about the establishment of the party as well as about its intention to participate in elections and, as a consequence, benefit from advantages given to political parties as a specific type of association. Far-reaching requirements, however, can raise the threshold for registration to an unreasonable level, which may be inconsistent with the Convention. Any provisions in relation to registration must be such as are necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the object sought to be achieved by the measures in question.",
                "b. Activity requirements for political parties and their control and supervision",
                "11. Similar caution must be applied when it comes to activity requirements for political parties as a prerequisite for maintaining their status as a political party and their control and supervision. Far-reaching autonomy of political parties is a cornerstone of the freedoms of assembly and association and the freedom of expression as protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the Convention requires that interference with the exercise of these rights must be assessed by the yardstick of what is ‘ necessary in a democratic society ’. The only type of necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of those rights is, therefore, one which may claim to spring from ‘ democratic society ’. In particular, control over the statute or charter of a party should be primarily internal, i.e. should be exercised by the members of the party. As regards external control, the members of a party should have access to a court in case they consider that a decision of a party organ violates its statute. In general, judicial control over the parties should be preferred over executive control.",
                "12. Another important aspect is that of equal treatment of parties by public authorities. In the case of registration procedure (if it is foreseen by national legislation) the State should proceed carefully in order to avoid any possible discrimination of political forces which might be considered as representing an opposition to the ruling party. In any case, clear and simple procedures should exist to challenge any decision and/or act of any registration authority in a court of law.",
                "d. Political parties and elections",
                "16. The main objective of political parties is participation in the public life of their country. Elections are essential for the fulfilment of this task; therefore the principle of equality between parties is of utmost importance. In recent years some new democracies claim that the stability of government and the good functioning of parliament can be achieved through limiting the number of parties participating in elections. This suggestion seems to be in contradiction with European standards applicable to electoral process.",

The general trend is to avoid restricting the number of parties by tinkering with the terms and conditions governing registration, because refusal to register a party is often a convenient way for the authorities to get rid of a competitor who is irksome rather than insignificant”[CDL-EL(2002)1, ch. II.4.1].",

There should be a possibility to create parties on regional and local levels since some groups of citizens might want to associate in groups limiting their action to local and regional levels and to local and regional elections. However, certain new democracies consider such extensive approach to the freedom of association premature in the light of their effort to preserve the unity of the State. Such concern can be understood, but before any restrictions are imposed, the principle of proportionality and the yardstick of what is ‘ necessary in a democratic society ’ should be considered thoroughly. ”"

In fact, the very concept of the political party is based on the aim of participating “in the management of public affairs by the presentation of candidates to free and democratic elections”. They are thus a specific kind of association, which in many countries is submitted to registration for participation in elections or for public financing. This requirement of registration has been accepted, considering it as not per se contrary to the freedom of association, provided that conditions for registration are not too burdensome. And requirements for registration are very different from one country to another: they may include, for instance, organisational conditions, requirement for minimum political activity, of standing for elections, of reaching a certain threshold of votes. However, some pre-conditions for registration of political parties existing in several Council of Europe Member States requiring a certain territorial representation and a minimal number of members for their registration could be problematic in the light of the principle of free association in political parties.”"

In particular, in order to obtain registration political parties are required to prove that they have a certain number of founding members. The required minimum membership ranges from 30 in Turkey and 100 in Croatia to 5,000 in Moldova and 25,000 in Romania. Five countries ( Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Spain ) do not impose any minimum membership requirement on political parties. Three more countries, while not setting a membership requirement as such, make registration of a political party conditional on producing a certain number of signatures of support (5,000 in Finland and Norway and 10,000 in Ukraine ). In only two countries is there a statutory requirement that a political party establish regional branches in a certain number of regions ( in more than one half of the regions in Ukraine and in all regions in Armenia ).

Georgia prohibits explicitly establishment of political parties on the grounds of regional or territorial basis. Germany does not include political activities on the local level as aiming at taking part in the forming of the will in the representation of the people, i.e. the whole of the people; associations which are politically active on the local level only, therefore, do not fall within the concept of political party in the sense of the Constitution and the German legislation on political parties.",

Germany requires parties to maintain regional branches, and in the United Kingdom a party must state whether it intends to operate in the United Kingdom as a whole, in part of the United Kingdom or at a local level; however, this is no more than a statement of intention, and the law does not appear to impose a legal obligation on the party to carry out this statement of intention.

In particular, the requirement to submit the same documents as for the registration of a newly established political party had no basis in domestic law. It followed from the wording of section 16 of the Political Parties Act containing a list of documents to be submitted to the registration authority (see paragraph 44 above) that it applied only to cases of initial registration of a political party immediately after its establishment by the founding congress. Section 27 § 3 of that Act established a simplified notification procedure for registration of amendments to the information contained in the Register (see paragraph 46 above). The Registration of Legal Entities Act also differentiated between initial registration of a legal entity and registration of amendments to the Register, providing for an authorisation procedure in the former case and a notification procedure in the latter (see paragraph 41 above). It followed that the applicant had been unlawfully and arbitrarily required to submit, for verification by the registration authority, the documents enumerated in section 16 of the Political Parties Act. It had however complied with that unlawful requirement and produced the necessary documents."

The term of office of the previous ex officio representatives had expired in April 2006. As the authorities had refused to register the new ex officio representatives duly elected at the general conference, the applicant had become unable to function properly. It could not establish new regional branches, submit annual reports or other documents requested by the authorities, or re - submit a request for registration of amendments to the Register, as all those actions required the signatures of the ex officio representatives. Moreover, it had not been the first time that the authorities had invalidated the decisions adopted at the applicant ’ s general conferences. The extraordinary general conference of 17 December 2005 had been convened because the domestic authorities had refused to recognise the decisions adopted at the previous general conference. Finally, the authorities ’ finding that the general conference of 17 December 2005 had been illegitimate had served as a basis for the dissolution of several of the applicant ’ s regional branches and the ultimate dissolution of the applicant itself. For the above reasons, the applicant considered that the authorities ’ refusal to amend the Register had amounted in fact to dissolution in disguise."

                "70. The Government submitted that the interference with the applicant ’ s rights had been lawful. The Political Parties Act established a special authorisation procedure for registration of political parties. The requirement to obtain a registration authorisation was justified by the special status and role of political parties. The Political Parties Act did not differentiate between types of registration. The same rules therefore applied to the registration of a newly established political party and to the registration of any amendments to the information contained in the Register. In all cases a political party had to submit the documents specified in section 16 of the Political Parties Act (see paragraph 44 above) and the registration authority had competence to verify those documents and decide whether to authorise or refuse registration (see sections 15 § 5, 29 § 1 and 38 § 1 of the Political Parties Act in paragraphs 43, 45 and 53 above). The fact that those provisions allowed different interpretations was not contrary to the Convention. Many laws were inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, were vague and whose interpretation and application were questions of practice. The role of adjudication vested in the courts was precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remained, taking into account the changes in everyday practice ( the Government referred to Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 ‑ III, and Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, § 65, ECHR 2004 ‑ I ). The Government concluded that domestic provisions governing registration of political parties met the requirements of accessibility and foreseeability. In any event, the applicant had applied to the domestic authorities for instructions as to the registration procedure to be followed and had received detailed explanations. It was also significant that the lawfulness of the refusal of registration had been examined and confirmed by the domestic courts. Given that it was in the first place for the national authorities, and notably the courts, to interpret domestic law, it was not the Court ’ s task to substitute its own interpretation for theirs in the absence of arbitrariness ( they referred to Tejedor García v. Spain, 16 December 1997, § 31, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VIII )."

As to the justification for the refusal of registration, the Government submitted that the domestic authorities had refused registration of amendments to the Register because the documents produced by the applicant were flawed with substantive defects. Their perusal had revealed that the general conference which had elected the ex officio representatives and decided to change the official address of the applicant had been illegitimate. In particular, the delegates who had taken part in that conference had not been elected in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and the applicant ’ s articles of association. The minutes of that conference could not therefore serve as a basis for amending the State Register. The refusal to amend the Register aimed at furthering democracy within the applicant party and protecting the rights of its members to participate in the regional and general conferences and thereby take part in the decision-making process."

In particular, it had taken part in the regional elections, had submitted an annual activity report according to which it had spent more than a million roubles in 2006, and its representatives had participated in the dissolution proceedings. As for the dissolution, it had been ordered on different grounds which were not in any way related to the refusal of registration. Nor had the refusal of registration aimed at disrupting the applicant ’ s activities. The domestic authorities had simply exercised legitimate control over the applicant ’ s compliance with the registration procedure established by domestic law. They argued that the applicant had an obligation to respect domestic law and the domestic authorities were entitled, and had an obligation, to watch over its compliance with statutory requirements and procedures. In particular, it had been necessary to verify whether the applicant ’ s general assembly had been convened and held in accordance with domestic law and its articles of association in order to protect its members from taking arbitrary decisions in breach of democratic procedures."

That citizens should be able to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned (see Sidiropoulos and Others v.

Nonetheless, that power must be used sparingly, as exceptions to the rule of freedom of association are to be construed strictly and only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restrictions on that freedom. In determining whether a necessity within the meaning of paragraph 2 of these Convention provisions exists, the States have only a limited margin of appreciation, which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, including those given by independent courts (see Gorzelik and Others, cited above § § 94 and 95; Sidiropoulos, cited above, § 40; and Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v.

In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in the Convention and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v.

They argued that those requirements pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the constitutional foundations of the Russian Federation and the rights and legitimate interests of others. Their “necessity” had been confirmed by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 55 and 56 above). In particular, the requirements of minimum membership and regional representation promoted the process of consolidation of political parties, created prerequisites for the establishment of large, strong parties, prevented excessive parliamentary fragmentation and thereby ensured normal functioning of the parliament and furthered the stability of the political system. The above requirements were not discriminatory because they did not prevent the emergence of diverse political programmes and were applied in equal measure to all political parties, irrespective of their ideology, aims and purposes set out in their articles of association. Nor did they impair the very essence of the citizens ’ right to freedom of association, as political parties which did not meet that requirement had an opportunity to reorganise themselves into public associations. The Government also argued that the special features of the social and political situation prevailing in contemporary Russia had to be taken into account when determining whether the statutory requirements imposed on political parties were justified ( they referred to Igor Artyomov v. Russia ( dec .), no. 17582/05, 7 December 2006)."

As the applicant had breached the requirements of minimum membership and regional representation, and had thereby violated the rights and interests of those parties that complied with the requirements, it had been necessary to dissolve it. The dissolution had not been automatic as the applicant had been given a choice between bringing the number of its members and regional branches into compliance with the amended law to retain its status as a political party or reorganising itself into a public association. However, it had failed to make use of that choice and had therefore become subject to dissolution. It was also noteworthy that the applicant had not been dissolved or banned on account of extremist activities. It was therefore possible for it to establish a new party under the same name.

It considers that the defence of territorial integrity is closely linked with the protection of “national security” (see, for example, United Communist Party of Turkey, cited above, § 40), while the protection of a State ’ s democratic institutions and constitutional foundations relates to “the prevention of disorder”, the concept of “order” within the meaning of the French version of Article 11 encompassing the “institutional order” (see Basque Nationalist Party – Iparralde Regional Organisation v.

Under domestic law only those political parties that have taken part in the elections and obtained more than 3% of the votes cast are entitled to public financing (see paragraph 51 above). The existence of a certain number of minor political parties supported by relatively small portions of the population does not therefore represent a considerable financial burden on the State treasury.

It has already held that, although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of the majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see Gorzelik and Others, cited above, § 90).

The authorities also have power to conduct inspections once a year and issue warnings or start dissolution proceedings if a political party has an insufficient number of members (see paragraphs 53 and 54 above).

In this regard, the Court takes note of the opinion of the Venice Commission that altering the terms and conditions for obtaining and retaining the status of a political party may be seen as affording an opportunity of unjustifiably dissolving political parties (see paragraph 58 above).

Article 11 cannot be interpreted as imposing an obligation on associations or organisations to admit whosoever wishes to join. Where associations are formed by people, who, espousing particular values or ideals, intend to pursue common goals, it would run counter to the very effectiveness of the freedom at stake if they had no control over their membership. By way of example, it is uncontroversial that religious bodies and political parties can generally regulate their membership to include only those who share their beliefs and ideals. Similarly, the right to join a union “ for the protection of his interests ” cannot be interpreted as conferring a general right to join the union of one's choice irrespective of the rules of the union: in the exercise of their rights under Article 11 § 1 unions must remain free to decide, in accordance with union rules, questions concerning admission to and expulsion from the union ( Cheall, cited above; see also Article 5 of the European Social Charter and the Conclusions of the European Committee of Social Rights, Relevant International Materials, paragraphs 22-24 above )."

It was then not able to pursue an appeal against the EAT for ignoring that claim. In particular, the applicant did not require the EAT to apply section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998, by seeking to construe the legislation so as to make it compatible with its Convention right. It was only concerned to ensure that it could rely on Mr Lee's various activities as the basis for expelling him; it did not propose any construction of section 174 which would have accorded with its case before this Court, namely that it had an Article 11 right to determine its own membership.

Counsel did rely on section 3 submitting that section 174 should be construed so far as possible in accordance with Article 11, so that the phrase'member of a political party'be construed as narrowly as possible so as to be limited to mere membership and thus to permit expulsion for activities other than the mere fact of membership: it was not possible in that context to construe the term “ member of a political party ” so as to permit a union to expel a person just because he or she was a member of a political party. It only desisted in pursuing its submissions further orally after the EAT made clear that it was not inclined to decide the point and gave indications that ASLEF was in any event unlikely to be successful on the point. Furthermore, as the applicant had been successful in its appeal to the EAT no appeal could have been brought against that decision to the Court of Appeal.

Article 35 § 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but not that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.

It appears rather from the terms of the EAT judgment that, in face of that Tribunal's view that Article 11 was irrelevant and that they should seek to resolve the construction of the statute without reference to the competing rights under that provision, the applicant's counsel reserved his position. As, therefore, the issues were squarely raised before the EAT and indeed considered, the Court does not consider that on this basis the applicant has failed to exhaust domestic remedies. Nor is it persuaded that the applicant could, given the EAT ruling was in his favour on other grounds, have appealed to the Court of Appeal and applied in addition for a declaration of incompatibility, as it was in effect the winning party and appeal lies against orders not reasons or findings. While the Government asserted that the Court of Appeal could admit an appeal by a winning party in exceptional circumstances, there is no indication that this case fell within such a category.

Section 174 only imposed a limited restriction on expelling those with views inimical to the trade union's objectives; it was only the applicant's own error in approach that led to a problem as there was ample conduct by Mr Lee, going beyond mere membership of the BNP, which the applicant could have relied on in order to found an entirely lawful decision to expel him."

Finally, they relied on the wide margin of appreciation which applied when striking a balance between the autonomy of trade unions and the Articles 10 and 11 rights of individual members and prospective members."

There was no interference with Mr Lee's freedom of expression as expulsion did not interfere with his right to express his political views. In any event any sanction was minimal and did not take priority over its right, and its members'rights, to exercise their own freedom of association and expression. Mr Lee never claimed that he suffered any detriment from exclusion. It referred to Article 17 to the effect that Article 10 would not protect some-one engaged in destroying other rights and freedoms. Since it was committed to opposing race discrimination, it would interfere with its rights, and its members, to be forced to admit into membership a person who was a member of such a right wing organisation. It did not accept that section 174 imposed a limited restriction, pointing out that it simply did not wish to associate with those whom they regarded as fascists or members of extreme right wing parties, whether active or not. It claimed that it had the right to dissociate itself from those whose political membership they abhorred. While Mr Lee's status as an activist might furnish greater reason to expel him, this did not touch on the fundamental issue. It would be acceptable if section 174 were framed so as to limit exclusion to membership of a party the objectives of which were contrary to the objectives of the trade union."

Article 11 cannot be interpreted as imposing an obligation on associations or organisations to admit whosoever wishes to join. Where associations are formed by people, who, espousing particular values or ideals, intend to pursue common goals, it would run counter to the very effectiveness of the freedom at stake if they had no control over their membership. By way of example, it is uncontroversial that religious bodies and political parties can generally regulate their membership to include only those who share their beliefs and ideals. Similarly, the right to join a union “ for the protection of his interests ” cannot be interpreted as conferring a general right to join the union of one's choice irrespective of the rules of the union: in the exercise of their rights under Article 11 § 1 unions must remain free to decide, in accordance with union rules, questions concerning admission to and expulsion from the union ( Cheall, cited above; see also Article 5 of the European Social Charter and the Conclusions of the European Committee of Social Rights, Relevant International Materials, paragraphs 22-24 above )."

For the individual right to join a union to be effective, the State must nonetheless protect the individual against any abuse of a dominant position by trade unions (see Young, James and Webster judgment, cited above, § 63). Such abuse might occur, for example, where exclusion or expulsion from a trade union was not in accordance with union rules or where the rules were wholly unreasonable or arbitrary or where the consequences of exclusion or expulsion resulted in exceptional hardship (see Cheall, cited above, Johanssen v.

Taking due consideration of the Government's argument as to the importance of safeguarding fundamental individual rights, the Court is not persuaded however that the measure of expulsion impinged in any significant way on Mr Lee's exercise of freedom of expression or his lawful political activities. Nor is it apparent that Mr Lee suffered any particular detriment, save loss of membership itself in the union. As there was no closed shop agreement for example, there was no apparent prejudice suffered by Mr Lee in terms of his livelihood or in his conditions of employment. The Court has taken account of the fact that membership of a trade union is often regarded, in particular due to the trade union movement's historical background, as a fundamental safeguard for workers against employers'abuse and it has some sympathy with the notion that any worker should be able to join a trade union (subject to the exceptions set out in Article 11 § 2 in fine ). However, as pointed out by the applicant, ASLEF represents all workers in the collective bargaining context and there is nothing to suggest in the present case that Mr Lee is at any individual risk of, or is unprotected from, any arbitrary or unlawful action by his employer. Of more weight in the balance is the applicant's right to choose its members. Historically, trade unions in the United Kingdom, and elsewhere in Europe, were, and though perhaps to a lesser extent today are, commonly affiliated to political parties or movements, particularly those on the left. They are not bodies solely devoted to politically-neutral aspects of the well-being of their members, but are often ideological, with strongly held views on social and political issues. There was no hint in the domestic proceedings that the applicant erred in its conclusion that Mr Lee's political values and ideals clashed, fundamentally, with its own. There is no indication that the applicant had any public duty or role conferred on it, or has taken the advantage of state funding, such that it may reasonably be required to take on members to fulfil any other wider purposes."

Although compulsion to join a particular trade union may not always be contrary to the Convention, a form of such compulsion which, in the circumstances of the case, strikes at the very substance of the freedom of association guaranteed by Article 11, will constitute an interference with that freedom (see Gustafsson v.

However, it is difficult to decide this issue in the abstract since it is a matter that can only be properly addressed in the circumstances of a given case. At the same time, an individual cannot be considered to have renounced his negative right to freedom of association in situations where, in the knowledge that trade union membership is a precondition of securing a job, he accepts an offer of employment notwithstanding his opposition to the condition imposed. Accordingly, the distinction made between pre-entry closed ‑ shop agreements and post-entry closed-shop agreements in terms of the scope of the protection guaranteed by Article 11 is not tenable. At most, this distinction is to be seen as a consideration which will form part of the Court's assessment of the surrounding circumstances and the issue of their Convention compatibility."

Thus, in the view of the High Court, while taking into account the rights and obligations that may be inferred from the European Convention on Human Rights, Parliament still has considerable discretion when laying down Danish law.

                "The Agreement laid down five major principles:",
                "( 1 ) the right of employees to organise within trade unions;",
                "( 2 ) the right of employers to manage and control work;",

                "( 4 ) the embargo on industrial action, which means that no strikes are lawful during the term of a collective agreement; and",
                "( 5 ) the establishment of a special arbitration tribunal to deal with all violations of the September Agreement.",
                "The September Agreement is unique in that it has formed the basis of all subsequent general agreements between management and labour. Traditionally, the Danish legislature plays a minor role as regards the conditions governing wages, salaries and employment. Therefore, only to a certain extent does the Danish labour market have legislation which does not emanate from European Union directives, examples being the Salaried Employees'Act ( Funktionærloven ) and the Holiday Act ( Ferieloven ). Accordingly, rights imposed by statute in other countries have in Denmark been obtained by means of agreements between the labour - market partners. It is thus a characteristic feature of Danish law that the relationship between employers and employees is basically governed by a combination of agreements (collective and individual), labour-law principles, general statutes and rules laid down in pursuance of statutes. More than 80 % of all employees in Denmark are trade union members.",
                "From figures provided by Statistics Denmark ( Danmarks Statistikbank ) and the Ministry of Employment ( Beskæftigelsesministeriet ), in 2001 the Danish workforce consisted of 2,799,958 persons (inclusive of the unemployed). Of these, 1,611,715 were employed within the private sector and 937,826 within the public sector.",

                "The institution of closed-shop agreements is a long-standing practice in Denmark. Typically, a closed-shop agreement states that an employer has undertaken to hire and employ only members of the trade union that is party to the collective agreement concluded by the employer. Closed-shop agreements are unlawful in the public - sector labour market as they would be in conflict with the principle of equality under Danish administrative law. Also, they are not concluded in the part of the private - sector labour market covered by the general agreement between DA and LO, because DA considers the use of closed-shop provisions to be an interference with employers'managerial rights. Thus, closed-shop agreements are mainly of importance in collective agreements concluded with employers not affiliated to an employers'organisation.",
                "The precise number of employees covered by closed-shop agreements is unknown. However, from figures provided by DA and the Christian Trade Union, the Government estimate that approximately 220,000 wage earners are affected in some way by closed-shop agreements – that is, less than 10 % of all Danish employees on the labour market.

The mandate of the committee was to examine the scope of such clauses and other circumstances which required membership of specific associations as a precondition for access to certain professions, and also to assess the compliance of such clauses with Denmark's international commitments. The committee was also asked to draw up recommendations and proposals for initiatives which afforded greater protection of the negative right to freedom of association. The committee submitted a report in June 2002 ( Betænkning nr. 1419, Udvalget om eksklusivbestemmelser ) which proposed changes to the law concerning closed-shop agreements between employees'organisations and employers. The committee pointed out that general developments in society and the labour market could no longer justify, to the same extent as before, the need for closed-shop agreements, since strong and representative trade unions and organisations had now been established on the labour market. The committee further stated that the advantages relating to membership of a trade union should in themselves be strong enough reasons to be a member of a trade union. The committee considered that as closed-shop agreements only existed for a small part of the labour market, a change in the law would have only a marginal impact upon union density rates. The committee further stated that closed-shop agreements could have the effect of reducing the supply of labour, that freedom of contract on the labour market was not an immutable concept, and that restrictions existed in several fields as to the agreements that management and labour could lawfully conclude."

The Employers'Association of Agriculture and Forestry said that the whole market garden area is covered by closed ‑ shop provisions, and argued for changes in all negotiations for collective- bargaining agreements. SID consistently states that there is no price at which the clauses could be eliminated from collective ‑ bargaining agreements, so the question is not open to negotiation. In the market garden area the exclusivity agreements result in a decrease in the number of applicants for apprenticeships, recruitment problems and problems in hiring seasonal workers.

                "“The Minister is requested to explain the impact of the proposed bill in relation to the scope for trade unions to enforce collective ‑ bargaining agreements, especially in relation to non-organised employers. It appears from the annual reports of the Labour Court for the years 1999 and 2000 that during the years in question, 600 and 646 cases respectively were conducted against non-organised employers, which correspond to 77% and 82% respectively of the cases in the Labour Court instigated by employees in those years. All these cases were instigated by LO ... It is the opinion of LO that the removal of closed - shop provisions will to a large extent make the efficient enforcement of collective ‑ bargaining agreements against such employers more difficult. ”",
                "“I find it difficult to see how the annulment of closed - shop provisions in collective ‑ bargaining agreements with non-organised employers, which is estimated to cover around 120,000 employees, should make it more difficult for the organisations to secure the efficient enforcement of collective ‑ bargaining agreements. First and foremost the annulment of a closed - shop provision in a collective ‑ bargaining agreement with a non-organised employer would not change the fact that the collective ‑ bargaining agreement is still valid and must be complied with. That means that the employees or their representatives would still have the possibility of bringing to the attention of the union in question any problems in getting the agreement complied with. The possibilities for the trade union to take action in such a case would therefore be unaffected. If there is a problem in having the terms in a collective ‑ bargaining agreement complied with in a business, due to the fact that the trade union does not have any members in that business, that should be reason enough for the employees to join the trade union and get the trade union to complain of the lack of compliance.",
                "I do not believe that a trade union will get much help in enforcing a collective ‑ bargaining agreement from employees whose membership is not voluntary.",
                "I do believe that if a trade union makes an effort and spreads the message to all the employees in a business covered by a collective ‑ bargaining agreement that it is due to its efforts that there are orderly conditions in the business, some of those employees that are involuntary members today could become voluntary members, and all employees could then stand together to secure compliance with the collective- bargaining agreement. ”",
                "“Under Danish collective- labour law, an employer must comply with the terms of a collective agreement in respect of all employees doing work within the field of the collective-bargaining agreement. Does the Minister believe that it is fair that non ‑ organised employees should, in this way, enjoy benefits to which they have not contributed, and which have been obtained for them by the trade unions?”",
                "“ The principle that a collective ‑ bargaining agreement also applies in relation to the work performed by non-organised employees in a business covered by a collective ‑ bargaining agreement, is a principle which also applies to areas without closed ‑ shop provisions. It is a principle which follows from collective ‑ bargaining agreements themselves, and it is only the organisation which is a party to the collective ‑ bargaining agreement which may raise a claim, not the individual (non-organised) employee.",

I must therefore note that it is the trade unions themselves that have elected to follow this principle both in fields with and without closed - shop provisions. Whether this is fair or not, I will leave to the trade unions in question and to their members to consider.”"

                "“ Both the Association of Employers in Gardening and Danish Landscape Gardeners are parties to collective agreements with SID, pursuant to which the employers agree only to employ members of SID.",
                "This provision was agreed more than forty years ago and it is not clear why this was done. Thus, it is not apparent whether it was a mutual deal or whether it was the result of a strong trade union imposing the provision on a group of small employers.",
                "Briefly, the provision entails a number of drawbacks for Danish gardening of which the following may be mentioned:",
                "● It is difficult to get an inflow of apprentices to the trade. We need around 500 apprentices per year, but can only attract around 200. The closed - shop provision scares away young people. At the same time we have difficulty in securing qualified labour, since many capable employees do not want to work under an exclusivity agreement. Some of these may then try to circumvent the provision by establishing a relationship as a sub-contractor instead of as an actual employee.",
                "● The business of market gardening is characterised by seasonal work. Every year we need summer holiday casual workers, workers to pick vegetables, workers for Christmas production and the like. Typically, we are speaking of young students who would like to work for a few months – until the closed ‑ shop provision is mentioned.",
                "● Danish market gardens are in a very tough competitive situation in the European Union. No other country in the Union has closed - shop provisions similar to those for Danish gardeners. Therefore, there is unequal competition at European Union level.",
                "● Closed ‑ shop provisions may be an instrument for securing wages and employment terms in small, non-organised businesses. Danish market gardens are very large businesses (20-250 employees per business) and more than 90% are organised. The closed - shop provision has therefore been overtaken by the structural development of the business. In relation to businesses under the DA, the trade union movement accepts that the closed ‑ shop provisions are unnecessary; see the article in SID's periodical.",
                "● Danish market gardens are organised, from a business point of view, in the same way as Danish agriculture. The businesses in agriculture are not covered by closed ‑ shop provisions, and Danish market gardens should not be either.",
                "● The closed ‑ shop agreement with SID causes daily problems with employees who are members of other trade unions or who wish to join other unions. For example, it frustrates the desire of employees to be transferred to the Danish Association for Managers and Executives, to an organisation of artisans or to another unemployment fund.",
                "● As a labour-intensive export and home market business we need to attract the most competent workforce to Danish market gardens to maintain and expand our markets. The maintenance of the closed ‑ shop provision will inhibit our development, and the most competent employees elect for other professions.",
                "● The collective ‑ bargaining agreements between the Association of Employers in Gardening and Danish Landscape Gardeners respectively and SID will continue to apply for our employees (and be complied with), even if the closed ‑ shop provision is removed by law. The removal of the closed - shop provision would therefore not cause wage-dumping.",
                "● The introduction of closed ‑ shop provisions was not put in place as an equal deal, where both parties gained something. It does not appear anywhere that Danish market gardeners have received any compensation from SID for agreeing in the past to the closed ‑ shop provision. On the contrary, it is our opinion that the employers were forced to enter into the exclusivity agreement under strong pressure and the threat of industrial action.",
                "● In the last many negotiations for collective ‑ bargaining agreements we have tried to persuade SID to drop the exclusivity agreements. In these negotiations it has not been possible to buy ourselves out of the exclusivity agreement. SID has not even wanted to discuss the problem seriously.",
                "Closed ‑ shop agreements do not belong in a modern society. The individual citizen wants to make his own decisions about his relationship to the trade union movement, and must be expected to be able to do so rationally.",
                "Closed ‑ shop provisions arose at the end of the nineteenth century in a period when industrial action was the order of the day.",
                "Circumstances are now quite different, so closed ‑ shop provisions should be removed by law. This would not be State interference with the right of free negotiation on the labour market, but the necessary safeguarding of freedom of association.",
                "We therefore strongly recommend that the closed ‑ shop provisions be removed by law. ”"

                "The Government noted by way of introduction that no single source of statistical information was able to provide a complete picture and the various statistical sources were not immediately comparable. On the basis of the material available, however, the Government estimated that the total number of employed in the gardening and horticultural sector amounted to at least 20,800 persons. The relevant employers'organisations in the private sector had reported that around 11,000 persons were covered by closed-shop agreements, whereas the relevant trade unions had reported that 8,100 persons were covered. Thus, the Government estimated that less than 53 % but more than 39 % of persons were covered by closed ‑ shop agreements.",
                "The applicant Rasmussen submitted that the Government's calculation was misleading and irrelevant to an assessment of the possibility of him finding a job which was not covered by a closed ‑ shop agreement. He stressed that there were three different kinds of gardeners: landscape gardeners; greenhouse gardeners; and production gardeners. It was crucial to distinguish among the three kinds of gardening because job opportunities in the public sector almost exclusively related to landscape gardeners. Moreover, although the applicant Rasmussen possessed the qualifications to obtain a job at a nursery, this did not imply that he would be qualified to work in landscape gardening – be it in the public or private sector. A calculation should be made in respect of each of the three kinds of gardening. The percentages for greenhouse gardening and production gardening would then be seen to be higher, probably 80 % (11,000 employees covered by closed-shop provisions out of 13,700 in the three kinds of gardening in the private sector). Consequently, the percentage would be lower in respect of landscape gardeners. Accordingly, even if the Government were correct in stating that approximately every second job was not covered by closed ‑ shop agreements, it would be more pertinent to say that in the case of the applicant Rasmussen, only one out of five relevant jobs was not covered by a closed ‑ shop agreement.",

Accordingly, the negative right to freedom of association guaranteed by Article 11 afforded protection against dismissal or deprivation of a licence to work only in those situations where the requirement to join a trade union was imposed after the recruitment of the individual or following the issue of a licence to him. A decisive consideration was therefore the individual's knowledge at the relevant time. Turning to the present case, the applicant Sørensen was fully aware at the time of his recruitment as a holiday relief worker that his employment was conditional on membership of a trade union affiliated to LO.

Moreover, as regards labour-market policies there was no common political understanding among the member States and in Denmark even Parliament was divided on the question of closed-shop agreements.

Closed- shop agreements were of crucial importance for enforcing collective agreements, securing fair competition and combating undeclared and illegal work.

First and foremost, it would become difficult – and in many cases impossible – to enforce collective agreements vis-à-vis small, non-affiliated employers. To begin with, this would affect the relatively large number of employees who would lose the rights they had earned under the collective agreements with the consequence that they would risk being underpaid. Similarly, large enterprises could not be sure of peace in the workplace in the same way as when there was only one trade union movement. This might lead to unproductive battles between competing trade unions. Enterprises and employees would both stand to lose from such a situation. Furthermore, trades with special problems could not protect themselves against circumvention of their collective agreements. This was particularly the case for the hairdressing industry in which major problems were predicted. Overall, in the slightly longer term, an unavoidable practical consequence of a complete prohibition on closed ‑ shop clauses would be the impossibility of combating underpayment of employees in a number of areas and peace in the workplace."

                "52. In the somewhat longer term, the consequences of a complete prohibition on closed - shop clauses would be more difficult to predict. This hinged on a number of factors. Potentially, the consequences could be very far-reaching. The lack of possibilities of enforcing collective agreements – as regards small enterprises and special areas – would not only have a negative effect on the employees. This would also be considered unfair competition in relation to enterprises that had and observed collective agreements in force. The harm caused by this would obviously vary from one industry to the next, but in the long term it was certain that some affiliated enterprises, which observed collective agreements, would be unable to resist this unfair competition. If widespread, the consequences would increase. First and foremost, this would create a wage push from within the agreement area. This might have two different outcomes. Firstly, it would become more difficult to negotiate pay increases in connection with collective bargaining. Secondly, pay would – within the scope of the collective agreement – be close to the minimum wage compared with today where many areas are at levels that are considerably above the minimum pay stipulated by the collective agreement. This meant that pay trends would in effect be influenced by the intervention of the legislator – which was in contravention of the fundamental elements of the Danish model under which pay and working conditions evolved through self-regulation among the social partners. In addition, if unfair competition became as widespread as feared, the motivation to be a member of an employers'association would be reduced. It should therefore be considered a reasonable possibility that fewer employers would be affiliated. This would mean lower coverage of collective agreements. Furthermore, this would reduce the employees'motivation to join a trade union since the trade union movement's main service – conditions provided for by collective agreements – could no longer be offered to the same extent. Summarising the consequences of the complete prohibition of closed - shop clauses in the longer term, it became obvious that a regrettable and highly realistic risk existed that : it would affect the enforcement of collective agreements; it would affect the high unionisation rate; it would affect the high coverage of collective agreements; and pay trends would be interfered with."

The sum of these possible consequences meant that the foundation of the Danish model – which had had broad political backing for more than one hundred years – might begin to crumble. If so, to maintain the overall welfare level, Denmark would, within the foreseeable future, have to give up the extensive use of self-regulation and let Parliament handle the regulation of pay and employment conditions to a greater extent. Consequently, a judgment in favour of the applicants might, besides the immediate consequences for a number of employees, result in political intervention in the Danish labour - market model, which would fail to benefit employees, employers and Danish society in general."

The right to form and to join trade unions is a special aspect of freedom of association, and the notion of a freedom implies some measure of freedom of choice as to its exercise (see Young, James and Webster, cited above, § 52 ).

Sigurjónsson v. Iceland, 30 June 1993, § 35, Series A no. 264 ). Although compulsion to join a particular trade union may not always be contrary to the Convention, a form of such compulsion which, in the circumstances of the case, strikes at the very substance of the freedom of association guaranteed by Article 11, will constitute an interference with that freedom (see Gustafsson v.

At the same time, an individual cannot be considered to have renounced his negative right to freedom of association in situations where, in the knowledge that trade union membership is a precondition of securing a job, he accepts an offer of employment notwithstanding his opposition to the condition imposed. Accordingly, the distinction made between pre-entry closed ‑ shop agreements and post-entry closed-shop agreements in terms of the scope of the protection guaranteed by Article 11 is not tenable. At most, this distinction is to be seen as a consideration which will form part of the Court's assessment of the surrounding circumstances and the issue of their Convention compatibility."

It is further to be observed that, by virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, each Contracting Party “shall secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in ... [the] Convention”. The discharge of this general duty may entail positive obligations inherent in ensuring the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed by the Convention. Thus, in the context of Article 11, although the essential object is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the exercise of the rights protected, the national authorities may in certain circumstances be obliged to intervene in the relationship between private individuals by taking reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the effective enjoyment of those rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Young, James and Webster, § 49, and Gustafsson, § 45, both cited above; and Wilson, National Union of Journalists and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 30668/96, 30671/96 and 30678/96, § 41, ECHR 2002- V ).",

The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. Whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty on the State or in terms of interference by a public authority which needs to be justified, the criteria to be applied do not differ in substance. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 144, ECHR 2004 - V, and Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, §§ 98 et seq., ECHR 2003-VIII).",

Sweden, 6 February 19 7 6, § 39, Series A no. 20; Gustafsson, cited above, § 45; Schettini and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 29529/95, 9 November 2000; and Wilson, National Union of Journalists and Others, cited above, § 44). Thus, the Court has so far not found fault with a Contracting State's failure to impose on an employer an obligation to recognise a trade union or to provide for a system of compulsory collective bargaining (see Wilson, National Union of Journalists and Others, § 44, and cases cited therein).",
                "However, where the domestic law of a Contracting State permits the conclusion of closed-shop agreements between unions and employers which run counter to the freedom of choice of the individual inherent in Article 11, the margin of appreciation must be considered reduced. The Court reiterates in this connection that, although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see Young, James and Webster, cited above, § 63, and Chassagnou and Others, cited above, §§ 112- 13). In assessing whether a Contracting State has remained within its margin of appreciation in tolerating the existence of closed-shop agreements, particular weight must be attached to the justifications advanced by the authorities for them and, in any given case, the extent to which they impinge on the rights and interests protected by Article 11. Account must also be taken of changing perceptions of the relevance of closed-shop agreements for securing the effective enjoyment of trade union freedom.",

The Court will examine whether the applicants were in fact compelled to join a particular trade union and, in the affirmative, whether such compulsion struck at the very substance of the negative right to freedom of association guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention. It observes that the present case concerns the application of pre-entry closed-shop agreements to the applicants. They were both aware before taking up their respective jobs that an obligation existed to join SID, and that this was a condition for obtaining and retaining their employment. The Government have argued that the applicants'situation differs from those dealt with previously by the Court since the applicants could never have assumed the contrary. In the Court's view, however, the fact that the applicants accepted membership of SID as one of the terms of employment does not significantly alter the element of compulsion inherent in having to join a trade union against their will. Had they refused they would not have been recruited. In this connection, the Court can accept that individuals applying for employment often find themselves in a vulnerable situation and are only too eager to comply with the terms of employment offered."

Closed-shop agreements are unlawful in the public - sector labour market and are no longer concluded in the part of the private - sector labour market covered by the general agreement between DA and LO (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 25 above).

The Government have argued that his situation cannot be compared with the hardship and the serious consequences that arose for the applicants in, for example, the above-cited cases of Young, James and Webster and Sigurður A. Sigurjónsson. However, it must be observed that the applicant Sørensen was dismissed without notice as a direct result of his refusal to comply with the requirement to become a member of SID, a requirement which had no connection with his ability to perform the specific job or his capacity to adapt to the requirements of the workplace.

He had been a member of SID in the mid- 1 980s but resigned his membership and joined the Christian Trade Union instead. Following a period of unemployment, on 17 May 1999 he commenced his current employment at a nursery after rejoining SID, this being one of the conditions for the job. It is impossible to know whether he would have remained unemployed had he not at the relevant time accepted his current job which included obligatory membership of SID. It is speculative whether, if he were to resign his membership of SID, he could find employment elsewhere with an employer who had not entered into a closed-shop agreement. It is certain, however, that should the applicant Rasmussen resign from SID, he would be dismissed without the possibility of reinstatement or compensation since the dismissal would be in accordance with the Danish Freedom of Association Act. Moreover, although closed ‑ shop agreements do not extend to the entire horticultural sector, they are nevertheless very common (see paragraphs 22, 26, 30 and 32 above). In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the applicant Rasmussen can be considered to be individually and substantially affected by the application of the closed ‑ shop agreement to him."

Instead, the applicant Sørensen joined Denmark's Free Trade Union, and the applicant Rasmussen wishes to rejoin the Christian Trade Union. The Government have pointed out that the applicants had the possibility of subscribing to a form of “non-political membership” of SID or of any other trade union pursuant to the Private Contributions to Political Parties and Disclosure of the Accounts of Political Parties Act (see paragraph 21 above). However, it is to be observed that such “non-political membership” does not entail any reduction in the payment of the membership fee to the specific trade union.

In the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the government stated among other things (see paragraph 28 above) that they “consider that there should be freedom for an employee to decide whether to become a member of an association – just as there should be freedom to choose not to become a member of an association – without this leading to a risk of not being recruited or of being dismissed” and that they “find it unreasonable that a clause in a collective agreement may prevent an employee who does not wish to be a member of an association or a specific association from obtaining or keeping employment with an employer or may prevent an employer from considering the candidate's qualifications alone ”."

However, the Court considers that these concerns have been adequately addressed by the Minister for Employment in his reply to question no. 7 put by the parliamentary committee, namely that an annulment of a closed ‑ shop provision in a collective ‑ bargaining agreement with a non ‑ organised employer would not change the fact that the collective ‑ bargaining agreement is still valid and must be complied with (see paragraph 29 above).

Admittedly, at the 740 th meeting of the Ministers'Deputies in February 2001 the required majority was not obtained. However, shortly thereafter, in September 2002, the Danish government informed the Governmental Committee of the European Social Charter of their intention to introduce a bill prohibiting closed - shop agreements and the latter therefore decided to await the next assessment by the European Committee of Social Rights. Subsequently, when it had become clear that the bill had failed to secure the necessary majority in Parliament and was withdrawn, in its Conclusions XVII-1 of March 2004 the European Committee of Social Rights maintained that the Danish Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act infringed Article 5 of the Social Charter, in response to which the government stated that once the parliamentary situation was more favourable they would resubmit the draft legislation (see paragraph 35 above)."

Italy, cited above). In that judgment the Court found that the disciplinary sanction had had a basis in Italian law ( § 27) and that the “law” on which it was based had been accessible ( § 28). However, it considered that the condition of foreseeability had not been satisfied ( §§ 29-34).",

The law should be accessible to the persons concerned and formulated with sufficient precision to enable them – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, § 49; Larissis and Others v.

                "For domestic law to meet these requirements, it must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any such discretion and the manner of its exercise (see Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 84, ECHR 2000-XI, and N.F. v. Italy, cited above, § 29).",

It stated that from 1982 onwards it should have been possible to “have a clear idea of the loss of integrity resulting from membership of the Freemasons ... because of the degeneration brought about when a number of people came together within the P2 lodge with plans to take control of the public authorities and subvert democratic institutions, and because of the collusion of certain Masonic lodges with the Mafia and organised crime”. The disciplinary section added that the directives issued by the National Council of the Judiciary on 22 March 1990 and 14 July 1993 (see paragraphs 21 and 22 below), which emphasised – the second one in particular – the substantial conflict between membership of the Freemasons and membership of the judiciary, were to be seen in the context of such developments. The decision also stated that it was contrary to disciplinary rules for a judge to be a Freemason, for the following reasons: the incompatibility between the Masonic and judicial oaths, the hierarchical relationship between Freemasons, the “rejection” of State justice in favour of Masonic “ justice ” and, lastly, the indissoluble nature of the bond between Freemasons, even in the case of a member who wished to leave the organisation.",

The Constitutional Court, when asked to give a ruling as to whether Article 18 of the 1946 decree was compatible with Article 25 § 2 of the Constitution, held that, in disciplinary proceedings against judges, the principle of lawfulness applied as a fundamental requirement of the rule of law and was a necessary consequence of the role conferred on the judiciary by the Constitution (judgment no. 100 of 8 June 1981, § 4).",
                "However, with regard to the fact that Article 18 did not specify the types of conduct which might be regarded as unlawful, the Constitutional Court pointed out that it was not possible to give examples of every type of conduct which might undermine the values guaranteed by that provision: the trust and consideration which a judge must enjoy and the prestige of the judiciary. It considered that those values amounted to principles of professional conduct which could not be included in “ guidelines laid down in advance, because it [was] not possible to identify and classify every example of reprehensible conduct which might provoke a negative reaction in society” (ibid., § 5). The Constitutional Court subsequently reiterated that the earlier laws governing the same subject matter had included a provision of general scope alongside the provisions penalising specific conduct, that the proposals for reform in this field had always been worded in general terms and that the same was true for other professional categories. It concluded: “The provisions in this area cannot but be of general scope because specific guidelines would have the effect of legitimising types of conduct which were not expressly mentioned, but which nonetheless attracted society's opprobrium.” It added that those considerations justified the broad scope of the rule and the wide margin of appreciation conferred on a body which, acting within the guarantees inherent in any judicial procedure, was – by virtue of its composition – particularly well qualified to assess whether the conduct considered in each case did or did not undermine the protected values (ibid., § 5).",
                "The Constitutional Court considered, lastly, that such an interpretation was consistent with its case-law on the subject of lawfulness (ibid., § 6). It stated that, as it had previously held, “the principle of lawfulness [was] applicable not only by means of a rigorous and exhaustive description of individual cases, but sometimes also through the use of expressions that are sufficient to determine the rule with certainty and to ascertain whether a particular type of conduct has breached the principle”.",
                "It further held: “'open-ended'provisions which penalise unlawful types of conduct by reference to concepts based on common experience or objectively understandable ethical and social values are fully compatible with the principle of lawfulness. ”",
                "The Constitutional Court added that, with regard to the provisions in issue, such interpretation criteria appeared more valid in a disciplinary context because, in comparison with criminal offences, disciplinary offences aroused less of a reaction in society and had less of an impact on the personal situation of the individual concerned, and also because the possibility of conduct undermining the protected values was greater than in the case of criminal offences.",
                "It further stated that the reference in Article 18 to the trust and consideration which a judge must enjoy and to the prestige of the judiciary was not objectionable as those concepts could be determined according to general opinion.",

                "For domestic law to meet these requirements, it must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any such discretion and the manner of its exercise (see Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 84, ECHR 2000-XI, and N.F. v. Italy, cited above, § 29).",

The fact that both the disciplinary section of the National Council of the Judiciary and the Court of Cassation also referred in their reasoning to the 1993 directive, which was issued after the material events, is irrelevant. Article 18 and the first directive adopted by the National Council of the Judiciary in themselves constituted provisions that satisfied the condition of accessibility (see, mutatis mutandis, Autronic AG v.

The Court considers that, in the applicant's case, a distinction should be made between two periods: the period from 1981, when he joined the Freemasons, to 22 March 1990, when the National Council of the Judiciary adopted its first directive, and the period between that date and March 1993, when the applicant left the Freemasons. The directive adopted by the National Council of the Judiciary in 1990 stated that a judge's membership of lawful associations which, like the Freemasons, were governed by specific rules of conduct could be problematical for him or her (see paragraph 21 above)."

The fact that Italy passed a law in 1982 on the right of association – which also ordered the dissolution of the secret P2 lodge (see paragraph 20 above) and prohibited membership of secret associations – could not have enabled the applicant to foresee that a judge's membership of a legal Masonic lodge could give rise to a disciplinary issue."

                "However, although the title was unambiguous and the directive was primarily concerned with membership of the Freemasons, the debate held on 22 March 1990 before the National Council of the Judiciary sought to formulate, rather than solve, a problem.",
                "That is demonstrated by the fact that the directive was adopted after the major debate in Italy on the unlawfulness of the secret P2 lodge. Furthermore, the directive merely stated: “Naturally, members of the judiciary are prohibited by law from joining the associations proscribed by Law no. 17 of 1982. ” With regard to other associations, the directive contained the following passage: “the [National] Council [of the Judiciary] considers it necessary to suggest to the Minister of Justice that consideration be given to the advisability of proposing restrictions on judges'freedom of association, to include a reference to all associations which – on account of their organisation and ends – entail for their members particularly strong bonds of hierarchy and solidarity” (see paragraph 21 above)."

Lastly, the Court considers it important to emphasise that the debate of 22 March 1990 did not take place in the context of disciplinary supervision of judges, as was the case for the directive of 14 July 1993, but in the context of their career progression ( see paragraph 22 above). It is therefore clear from an overall examination of the debate that the National Council of the Judiciary was questioning whether it was advisable for a judge to be a Freemason, but there was no indication in the debate that membership of the Freemasons could constitute a disciplinary offence in every case."

If, on the other hand, national law does not allow – or allows only partial – reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate.

Secondly, it referred to Article 13 § 5 of the Constitution, banning the founding and functioning of public associations which advocated a violent change in the constitutional principles of the Russian Federation or destruction of its integrity, undermined the security of the State, created paramilitary formations, or caused social, racial, ethnic or religious division or conflict.

The Court refers to its settled case-law to the effect that, as enshrined in Article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a “democratic society” within the meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others v. Moldova, no. 45701/99, § 114, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII )."

While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies, inter alia, freedom to “manifest [one ’ s] religion” alone and in private or in community with others, in public and within the circle of those whose faith one shares. Since religious communities traditionally exist in the form of organised structures, Article 9 must be interpreted in the light of Article 11 of the Convention, which safeguards associative life against unjustified State interference. Seen in that perspective, the right of believers to freedom of religion, which includes the right to manifest one ’ s religion in community with others, encompasses the expectation that believers will be allowed to associate freely, without arbitrary State intervention. Indeed, the autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is thus an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 affords. The State ’ s duty of neutrality and impartiality, as defined in the Court ’ s case-law, is incompatible with any power on the State ’ s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others, cited above, §§ 118 and 123, and Hasan and Chaush v.

That citizens should be able to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned. Certainly States have a right to satisfy themselves that an association ’ s aim and activities are in conformity with the rules laid down in legislation, but they must do so in a manner compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions (see Sidiropoulos and Others v. Greece, 10 July 1998, § 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ IV )."

Democracy, the Court has stressed, is the only political model contemplated in the Convention and the only one compatible with it. By virtue of the wording of the second paragraph of Article 11, and likewise of Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Convention, the only necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of the rights enshrined in those Articles is one that may claim to spring from “democratic society” (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, §§ 43-45, Reports 1998- I, and Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, §§ 86-89, ECHR 2003 ‑ II )."

For pluralism is also built on the genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs, artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others v.

France, 25 June 1996, § 36, Reports 1996- III, and Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, § 44, ECHR 1999-VI). In the instant case the domestic authorities have not acknowledged that the refusal of re-registration amounted to a violation of the applicant ’ s Convention rights. In fact, the judicial decisions upholding the refusal have not been set aside and have remained in force to date. The rulings by the Constitutional Court and by the Taganskiy District Court, to which the Government referred, only concerned the proceedings for dissolution of the applicant branch and were of no consequence to its claim for re-registration."

This means that the inclusion of information on the applicant branch was solely linked to the establishment of a new register (the Unified State Register of Legal Entities) and to the shifting of registration competence from one authority to another following enactment of a new procedure for the registration of legal entities (see paragraph 45 above). In their statement of appeal, the Moscow Justice Department – that is, the authority with responsibility for registering religious associations – expressly confirmed that the entering of such information could not constitute “re-registration” for the purposes of the Religions Act (see paragraph 27 above)."

The Court has consistently held the view that a refusal by the domestic authorities to grant status as a legal entity to an association of individuals amounts to an interference with the applicants ’ exercise of their right to freedom of association (see Gorzelik and Others, cited above, § 52 et passim, and Sidiropoulos and Others, cited above, § 31 et passim ). Where the organisation of the religious community is in issue, a refusal to recognise it also constitutes interference with the applicants ’ right to freedom of religion under Article 9 of the Convention (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others, cited above, § 105). The believers ’ right to freedom of religion encompasses the expectation that the community will be allowed to function peacefully, free from arbitrary State intervention (see Hasan and Chaush, cited above, § 62)."

The procedure for “re-registration” was the same as for the initial registration of a religious organisation and the same grounds for refusing a registration application applied (see paragraphs 39 and 41 above). In addition, “re-registration” could be refused if grounds existed for dissolving a religious organisation or for banning its activities (see paragraph 43 above). A failure to obtain “re-registration” for whatever reason before the expiry of the time-limit exposed the religious organisation to a threat of dissolution by judicial decision (see paragraph 44 above)."

It was unable to obtain “re-registration” as required by the Religions Act and consequently became liable for dissolution by operation of law. After 6 December 2001, when it exhausted ordinary domestic remedies against the judicial decision ordering its dissolution, and until that decision was quashed by way of supervisory review on 1 August 2002, the applicant branch continuously ran the risk of having its accounts frozen and its assets seized (compare Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova (dec.), no. 28793/02, 22 March 2005). The Court accepts that that situation had an appreciably detrimental effect on its functioning and religious activities (see paragraphs 29-33 above). Even though the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling later removed the immediate threat of dissolution from the applicant branch, it is apparent that its legal capacity is not identical to that of other religious organisations that obtained re-registration certificates. The Court observes that in other cases the absence of re-registration was invoked by the Russian authorities as a ground for refusing registration of amendments to the articles of association or for staying the registration of a religious newspaper (see Church of Scientology Moscow and Others v.

As the Religions Act restricts the ability of a religious association without legal- entity status to exercise the full range of religious activities (see Kimlya and Others v.

It fails to see exactly how State sovereignty would be undermined by this factor alone. Moreover, it is striking that the above-mentioned guidelines – which, precisely, approach this question from the standpoint both of the need to ensure “democratic security” and of freedom of political association – do not indicate that there should be such a ban, whereas they emphasise the need to prohibit funding by “foreign enterprises”.",

In support of that approach, it notes that it appears from the opinion produced in the present case by the Venice Commission that the member States of the Council of Europe are divided on the financing of political parties from foreign sources (see paragraph 29 above), and that in Article 7 of Recommendation Rec (2003)4 of 8 April 2003 on common rules against corruption in the funding of political parties and electoral campaigns, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe recommended that the governments of member States “specifically limit, prohibit or otherwise regulate donations from foreign donors” (see paragraph 18 above).",

Section 11 -1, inserted into the Act of 11 March 1988 by the Act of 15 January 1990, provides that ‘ authorisation to act as a political party ’ s funding association shall be given by the National Commission on Election Campaign Accounts and Political Funding ’. It follows from the first subsection of section 11-6, inserted into the Act of 11 March 1988 by the Act of 15 January 1990, that the granting of authorisation is subject to the funding association ’ s compliance with the requirements of sections 11-1 and 11-4 of the Act. Among the requirements concerned are those set forth in the penultimate subsection of section 11-4, which provides: ‘ No funding association or financial agent of a political party may receive direct or indirect contributions or material assistance from a foreign State or a foreign legal entity. ’",

Foreign political parties, which belong to the category of foreign legal entities, fall within the purview of that prohibition. The amendments resulting from the Act of 19 January 1995 to the second subsection of section 11-4 with the effect, firstly, of prohibiting a legal entity from funding a party or a political group and, secondly, of excluding ‘ political parties and groups ’ from this prohibition on account of the role conferred on them by Article 4 of the Constitution of 4 October 1958 had neither the purpose nor the effect of exempting foreign political parties from the prohibition on the funding of a French political party by any foreign legal entity. Consequently, the applicant group has no basis for arguing that the impugned decision was based on an erroneous application of the provisions of the penultimate subsection of section 11-4 of the Act of 11 March 1988 in conjunction with the second subsection of that section.",

In prohibiting foreign States and foreign legal entities from funding national political parties, the legislature sought to preclude the possibility of creating a relationship of dependency which would be detrimental to the expression of national sovereignty. The aim thus pursued is linked to the ‘ prevention of disorder ’ within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention. On account of both the justification of this measure and the fact that the right to freedom of expression is affected only indirectly by the rules governing the funding of political parties, and in view of the margin of appreciation which Article 10, paragraph 2, affords the national legislature, the provisions of section 11-4 of the Act of 11 March 1988 are not incompatible either with the requirements of Article 10 of the Convention, or indeed with those of Article 14.",
                "The applicant group argues that since the resources obtained by the funding association whose authorisation has been refused stem from a political party with its registered office in a member State of the European Community, the provisions of the penultimate subsection of section 11-4 of the Act of 11 March 1988, in so far as they apply to a situation governed by Community law, are incompatible with a number of provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community.",
                "Thirdly, even supposing that the rules governing the funding of political parties may, in certain respects, have a bearing on the free movement of capital between member States as guaranteed by Article 56 of the EC Treaty, that Article, as Article 58 clearly indicates, does not affect the right of member States to ‘ take measures which are justified on grounds of ... public security ’. Regard being had both to the aim it pursues and to the limited impact it has on the free movement of capital, the prohibition set forth in the penultimate subsection of section 11-4 of the Act of 11 March 1988 is to be counted among the measures that may be taken by a member State under Article 58 of the Treaty. Accordingly, the submission that the Act is incompatible with Article 56 must be dismissed.",

They contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union. ’ Accordingly, and even supposing that Article 191 creates any rights in respect of private individuals, this submission must fail. ...”"

The second portion is distributed among parties and groups eligible for the first portion, in proportion to the number of members of parliament belonging to or attached to them (section 9 of the Act of 11 March 1988 as amended).",

Outside election campaign periods, political organisations represented by parliamentary groups in the National Assembly or the Senate are entitled to “ air time ”, allowing them to broadcast on public radio stations and television channels; they are also granted certain tax concessions (reduced-rate corporation tax) on some of their own income ( for example, from leasing out their buildings and undeveloped land).",

Except in the case of the election of département councillors in cantons with fewer than 9,000 inhabitants or municipal councillors in municipalities with fewer than 9,000 inhabitants, all candidates intending to receive donations for the organisation of their campaigns are required to do so through a financial agent, who is the sole person entitled to collect funds to cover campaign costs and the payment of expenses (except for those borne by a political party or group). Donations from individuals are capped at EUR 4,600 per candidate per campaign. Contributions from other legal entities, with the exception of political parties and groups, and from foreign States or foreign legal entities are prohibited (Articles L. 52-4 and L. 52 ‑ 8 of the Elections Code). Election expenditure is subject to a ceiling according to the number of inhabitants in the constituency concerned (Article L. 52-11 of the Elections Code). The financial agent must keep campaign accounts recording all receipts and expenditure relating to the election campaign. The accounts must be certified by an accountant and submitted to the scrutiny of the National Commission on Election Campaign Accounts and Political Funding, which approves or rejects them. If the accounts are approved, the State reimburses candidates who obtain at least 5% of the votes cast in the first round in the form of a lump sum of up to 50% of the maximum permitted expenditure in the constituency in question, within the limits of the amounts actually spent (see, in particular, Article L. 52-11-1 of the Elections Code).",

The Government submitted that the sole consequence of the decision by the National Commission on Election Campaign Accounts and Political Funding (CCFP) in the applicant party ’ s case had been to deprive it of entitlement to State funding and the financial benefits provided for in the Political Life (Financial Transparency) Act of 11 March 1988; if it put forward candidates in political elections, it would not be entitled to have any of its campaign expenses refunded. The decision did not have the effect of prohibiting the applicant party from carrying on its activities and resorting to other sources of funding. The Government accordingly concluded that there was no “interference” in the present case with the exercise of the rights protected by Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention."

                "22. As to the first point, the Government noted that the decision in issue had been based on sections 11-4 and 11-6 of the Act of 11 March 1988, by which political parties ’ funding associations were prohibited from receiving financial contributions from a “foreign legal entity” ( personne morale de droit étranger ), such as a foreign political party, the applicable penalty being loss of the authorisation entitling them to claim State funding. They submitted that it had been foreseeable that such authorisation would be denied in the applicant party ’ s case on the basis of those provisions since, although they expressly provided only for “ revocation ” of the authorisation, they were to be construed as giving the CCFP – whose discretion was limited – the possibility of refusing authorisation, even if that entailed granting and subsequently revoking it. Furthermore, it was not disputed that the applicant party had not satisfied the requirements of section 11-4 of the Act of 11 March 1988 and had received donations from a foreign legal entity. Lastly, there was settled case-law to the effect that it was possible to cite the grounds for revoking a permit or authorisation as a basis for refusing to grant such a permit or authorisation, seeing that the result was the same (the Government referred to the Aldana Barrena judgment of 8 January 1982 of the Conseil d ’ Etat, from which it appeared that the grounds for revoking refugee status were also capable of justifying a refusal to grant such status)."

                "23. As to the second point, the Government contended that the prohibition took into account “national security interests” in seeking to protect “the expression of national sovereignty”, to which political parties contributed under the French Constitution. The principle of national sovereignty was inextricably linked with that of national independence, which prohibited foreign interference in the operation of national politics. The aim pursued accordingly related not only to the “prevention of disorder”, as the Conseil d ’ Etat had emphasised in the instant case, but also to the “prevention of crime”, seeing that it was harder to verify the origin and legality of funds from abroad."

They pointed out that it did not undermine the applicant party ’ s legal validity, its freedom of expression or its participation in political life; its sole effect was to deny the party the opportunity to claim, through its funding association, public funding and the financial benefits laid down in the Act of 11 March 1988 (reimbursement of the campaign expenses of candidates in political elections) and thereby to bar it from receiving contributions that were subject to the tax concessions provided for by law. They added that, in compensation for the prohibition on certain sources of funding, sections 8 and 9 of the Act of 11 March 1988 afforded national political parties access to State funding, distributed among all parties in accordance with objective and transparent criteria, in proportion to their representation in Parliament or as a lump sum if the donations they had received from individuals reached a certain level. In that way, the law compensated by means of State funding for the acceptance of certain restrictions and contributed to promoting freedom of political expression by providing a balanced and reasonable response to the imperatives of national independence and transparency in political life.",

Nor was there anything to stop it from appointing an individual as its “financial agent” to that end. It would then have the possibility of collecting funds both from French political parties or groups and from individuals."

Referring to a study carried out by the Max Planck Institute at the Council of Europe ’ s request, it submitted that a precondition for the integration of minorities was their participation in political life, in particular through the formation of political parties; however, the prohibition of all funding from abroad particularly affected parties of this kind.

Furthermore, the second paragraph of Article L. 52 of the Elections Code expressly provided that “ legal entities, with the exception of political parties or groups, [could] not contribute to the funding of the election campaign ...” and section 11-4 (in its version as amended by the Act of 19 January 1995) of the Act of 11 March 1998 provided that “ legal entities, with the exception of political parties or groups, [could] not contribute to the funding of political parties or groups ...”, and there was no statutory provision excluding foreign political parties.

In any event, the principle of national sovereignty to which the Government referred would not be affected in the case of a political party that took part solely in local elections. The applicant party added that neither the Venice Commission ’ s guidelines on the financing of political parties nor Recommendation 1516 (2001) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the financing of political parties mentioned the need to prohibit contributions from foreign political parties. That observation also led it to reject the Government ’ s contention that the prohibition was necessary for the “prevention of crime” within the meaning of Articles 10 and 11; indeed, it emphasised that in the instant case the Spanish Basque Nationalist Party was subject to the machinery established under Spanish law for ensuring transparency and financial scrutiny."

As to whether the interference was proportionate, the applicant party pointed out that, as the CCFP had found, most of its resources stemmed from the Spanish Basque Nationalist Party, with the result that its inability to receive such funding had a considerable effect on its financial capacity. It emphasised that public funding would be negligible in its case, since such funding depended on results in national elections and, in practice, was distributed among the four main parties at national level. As regards reimbursement of election expenses, this presupposed that the party had funds available in advance, which was not possible without the contribution from the Spanish Basque Nationalist Party. In addition, it argued that there was a contradiction between the prohibition on funding by European parties and the possibility of funding by foreign individuals, given that it was easy to scrutinise funds from the former but not from the latter. In its submission, the prohibition in issue was not based on any “pressing social need”, seeing that it concerned contributions from a party registered in a member State of the European Union, and especially as it contravened the principle of the free movement of capital within the Union.",
                "Lastly, although the applicant party still had the possibility of appointing a financial agent and obtaining funds by that means, such funds could only take the form of donations from individuals or from French political parties. Yet the party ’ s own aims meant that its geographical sphere of activity was limited to a very small part of France, so that it could not expect any financial support from other French parties. Indeed, it pointed out that, as matters stood, either its resources would be limited to contributions from individuals, in which case it would no longer have the means to finance its political activities, or it would continue to receive contributions from the Spanish Basque Nationalist Party, in which case it would be prohibited from intervening in electoral matters in any way.",

            [
                "29. In its opinion, based in particular on a study of the domestic law in forty-four member States of the Council of Europe, the Venice Commission noted that twenty-eight of these States prohibited or substantially limited foreign donations to political parties and the other sixteen did not impose any such restrictions. It pointed out that national regulations on political parties resulted from history, political tradition and practice and hence differed greatly from one country to another. With regard to funding, approaches ranged from a total lack of regulations (for example, in Switzerland) or non-prohibition of foreign donations (for example, in Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Czech Republic and Hungary) to an explicit ban on foreign contributions and donations (as in France and the Russian Federation); intermediate solutions included imposing strict limitations (for example, in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova) or providing for exceptions to the rule, to a greater or lesser extent, in the case of funds originating from European Union member States (for example, in Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom – except Northern Ireland – and Lithuania). It concluded that each example of the prohibition of financing of political parties from foreign sources had to be considered separately in the light of the political system of the country concerned, its relations with its neighbours, its constitutional law and the general system it had adopted for the financing of political parties."
            ],
            [
                "30. The Venice Commission went on to point out that its guidelines on the financing of political parties emphasised the need to prohibit donations from foreign States and enterprises, and that Recommendation Rec (2003) 4 of the Committee of Ministers urged member States “specifically [to] limit, prohibit or otherwise regulate donations from foreign donors” (see paragraph 18 above). As to whether, in particular, it was “necessary in a democratic society” for this prohibition to cover funds from foreign political parties, the Venice Commission referred to the principles deriving from the Court ’ s case-law, as set out in The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others v. Bulgaria (no. 59491/0 0, §§ 57-62, 19 January 2006). An analysis of the domestic provisions containing such a prohibition indicated that the reasons varied from one country to another, particularly on account of their specific history and political and constitutional experiences. One such reason related to the internationalist policies of extremist parties between the two World Wars. A second stemmed from similar circumstances during the Cold War and the ensuing polarisation of the world. A third resulted from fear of separatist movements. A fourth concerned the implementation of a system of public funding of parties and the consequent desire for the funds thus allocated to remain within the country. It was more difficult, in the Venice Commission ’ s opinion, to identify why many States did not impose a prohibition of this kind (for example, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Finland ). In some countries, the reason was possibly that such a measure had never been thought necessary. Other countries appeared to have adopted this position in order to facilitate politically their own support of political movements in the Third World. A further group seemed reluctant to hinder legitimate cooperation between political parties in the context of the Parliamentary Assemblies of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, the European Parliament and cooperation organisations such as the Nordic Council."
            ],
            [
                "31. Having regard to the specific nature of the European Union and the “new legal order” it constituted, the Venice Commission found it “reasonable and appropriate” that the Union ’ s member States should adopt a specific approach to the financing of political parties by political parties established in other member States. It pointed out in particular that Article 191 of the Treaty of Rome provided that “ [p] olitical parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union. They contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union .” It added in this context that Regulation (EC) no. 2004/2003 of the European Parliament and the Council of 4 November 2003 on the regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding (see paragraph 27 above) afforded such parties the possibility of receiving donations from political parties which were members of them (Article 6), while Article 7 of the Regulation stated that their funding “from the general budget of the European Union or from any other source may not be used for the direct or indirect funding of other political parties, and in particular national political parties, which shall continue to be governed by national rules”. The Venice Commission observed that the very existence of the Regulation showed that cooperation and, to some extent, integration of financing systems were necessary for the functioning of political parties both at national level and at the level of the Union. It also referred to Article 56 of the Treaty, which enshrined the principle of the free movement of capital, pointing out that this notion in principle covered all transfers of funds from one member State to another, probably including those between political parties. Since this was a fundamental freedom enshrined in the Treaty, the member States were required to respect it. The Venice Commission thus concluded that rules adopted by member States for the funding of political parties had to observe this principle, although the European Union ’ s powers with regard to political parties were limited to the regulation of “political parties at European level”. The only exceptions permitted in this regard by Community law were those set out in the Treaty itself ( for example, in Article 58, which reserved the right of member States “to take measures which are justified on grounds of public policy or public security”) or identified by the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
            ],
            [
                "32. In conclusion, the Venice Commission observed that in the light of the varying approaches to the issue from one Council of Europe member State to another, there could be no single answer to the question whether the prohibition on the funding of political parties by foreign political parties was “necessary in a democratic society”. It considered, however, that the experience of cooperation between political parties within supranational European organisations and institutions supported a less restrictive approach; such cooperation was itself “necessary in a democratic society”, whereas it was not obvious that the same could be said about the imposition of obstacles to cooperation through the prohibition of all financial relations between political parties established in different countries. Various factors could nevertheless be capable of justifying the prohibition of contributions from foreign political parties: in particular, where contributions were used to pursue unlawful aims (for example, where the foreign party in question advocated discrimination or human rights violations), undermined the fairness or integrity of political competition, destabilised the electoral process, threatened the territorial integrity of the State concerned or hindered its democratic development, or where prohibition formed part of the State ’ s international obligations. Accordingly, in the Venice Commission ’ s opinion, to establish whether the prohibition on the financing of political parties by foreign political parties was compatible with the requirements of Article 11 of the Convention, each individual case had to be considered separately in the context of the general legislation applicable in the State concerned on the funding of political parties and of the State ’ s international obligations – including, where appropriate, those resulting from membership of the European Union."

As a preliminary point, the Court reiterates that political parties come within the scope of Article 11 of the Convention (see, for example, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 25, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, and Socialist Party and Others v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, § 29, Reports 1998-III).

In the instant case, contrary to what the applicant party maintained, the prohibition on the funding of French political parties by foreign political parties is prescribed by the Act of 11 March 1988. It follows from section 11 of the Act that political parties may receive funds only through a funding association or a financial agent (see also the CCFP ’ s decision of 2 July 1999), and from subsection 5 of section 11-4 that funding associations and financial agents cannot receive contributions from foreign legal entities. A political party established in another State is clearly a “foreign legal entity”. The fact that the second subsection of section 11-4, which lays down in more general terms the rule that donations from legal entities are prohibited, provides for an exception to this rule in the case of donations from “political parties or groups”, without specifying whether this concerns only French parties or groups, is not sufficient to cast doubt on the clarity of the law on this point."

                "42. The Court can, however, understand the applicant party ’ s doubts as to whether the refusal of its request for authorisation of the funding association it had set up was foreseeable. It notes that the Act of 11 March 1988 (section 11-1) envisages only two scenarios in which a request for authorisation can be refused: where the object of the association is not limited to the funding of a political party, and where its articles of association do not define the geographical area within which the association is to carry out its activities or do not contain an undertaking to open a single bank or post-office account into which all donations received for the funding of a political party are to be deposited. However, in the present case the refusal was not based on one of these grounds but on the finding that most of the applicant party ’ s resources derived from financial support from the Spanish Basque Nationalist Party. Admittedly, the Conseil d ’ Etat held in the instant case that “[ i ] t follows from the first subsection of section 11-6 ... that the granting of authorisation is subject to the funding association ’ s compliance with the requirements of sections 11-1 and 11-4 of the Act”. However, this is a somewhat extensive interpretation of that subsection, which is worded: “ The authorisation of any association that has failed to comply with the requirements laid down in sections 11-1 and 11-4 of this Act shall be revoked .” It appears that in reality this provision solely allows ex post facto scrutiny of funding associations that have obtained authorisation. It is therefore permissible to question whether the law, as interpreted by the Conseil d ’ Etat, was foreseeable in its effect.",
                "On this specific point, the Government maintained that there was settled case-law to the effect that it was possible to cite the grounds for revoking a permit or authorisation as a basis for refusing to grant such a permit or authorisation, seeing that the result was the same. They relied in that connection on the Conseil d ’ Etat ’ s Aldana Barrena judgment of 8 January 1982, from which it appeared that the grounds for revoking refugee status were also capable of justifying a refusal to grant such status. In the Court ’ s view, that judgment is not conclusive in that it simply set aside a decision by the Appeals Board on the ground that it had refused to take into consideration facts occurring after the refusal issued by the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons. The Court can, however, see the logic in the Conseil d ’ Etat ’ s interpretation of the above-mentioned provisions, given that a strict reading of them would mean granting and subsequently revoking authorisation, since the CCFP – as the Government submitted – has limited discretion. Accepting, therefore, that such an interpretation was foreseeable, the Court concludes that the interference in issue was “prescribed by law”."

            [
                "43. As to the “legitimate aim” pursued, the Conseil d ’ Etat referred to the “prevention of disorder”. It pointed out in that connection that political parties were “intended to contribute to the exercise of suffrage in the implementation of national sovereignty” and that “ [ i ] n prohibiting foreign States and foreign legal entities from funding national political parties, the legislature [had] sought to preclude the possibility of creating a relationship of dependency which would be detrimental to the expression of national sovereignty”; the aim pursued had thus related to the protection of the “institutional order”.",
                "The Court accepts that the concept of “order” within the meaning of the French version of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention encompasses the “institutional order”, although the expression “ défense de l ’ ordre ” (protection of order) refers essentially to the prevention of disorder, as can be seen from the English version of Articles 10 and 11, which uses that term.",
                "Having thus acknowledged the legitimacy of the aim pursued, the Court considers that, contrary to what the applicant party maintained, the fact that the prohibition also applies to contributions from political parties established in another member State of the European Union is not sufficient to call it into question; in the Court ’ s view, that particular factor must be taken into account in examining whether the interference was “necessary”."

The Court observes that that was not the Conseil d ’ Etat ’ s assessment in the present case, but considers it unnecessary to determine this question since it is sufficient that the interference in issue pursued just one of the legitimate aims listed. It will therefore confine itself to its above finding that the aim of the interference was the “prevention of disorder”.",

It would observe, firstly, that it is especially alert to the importance of such regulations “in a democratic society” as this has been highlighted by both the Venice Commission and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see paragraphs 16-17 above)."

That said, the Court reiterates that the exceptions set out in Article 11 are to be construed strictly; only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restrictions on the freedom of association. In determining whether a necessity within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 exists, States have only a limited margin of appreciation, which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, including those given by independent courts (see, for example, Sidiropoulos and Others v. Greece, 10 July 1998, § 40, Reports 1998-IV). That applies all the more in relation to political parties in view of the importance of their role in a “democratic society” (see, for example, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others, cited above, §§ 25, 43 and 46).",

This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court also has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, for example, Sidiropoulos and Others, loc. cit., and United Communist Party of Turkey and Others, cited above, § 47)."

In the instant case the Court has no difficulty in accepting that the prohibition on the funding of political parties by foreign States is necessary for the preservation of national sovereignty; indeed, the “Guidelines and Report on the financing of political parties ” adopted by the Venice Commission (see paragraph 16 above) state that financial contributions from foreign States should be prohibited.",
                "It is not so easily persuaded, however, with regard to the prohibition on funding by foreign political parties. It fails to see exactly how State sovereignty would be undermined by this factor alone. Moreover, it is striking that the above-mentioned guidelines – which, precisely, approach this question from the standpoint both of the need to ensure “democratic security” and of freedom of political association – do not indicate that there should be such a ban, whereas they emphasise the need to prohibit funding by “foreign enterprises”.",
                "The Court considers, however, that this matter falls within the residual margin of appreciation afforded to the Contracting States, which remain free to determine which sources of foreign funding may be received by political parties. In support of that approach, it notes that it appears from the opinion produced in the present case by the Venice Commission that the member States of the Council of Europe are divided on the financing of political parties from foreign sources (see paragraph 29 above), and that in Article 7 of Recommendation Rec (2003)4 of 8 April 2003 on common rules against corruption in the funding of political parties and electoral campaigns, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe recommended that the governments of member States “specifically limit, prohibit or otherwise regulate donations from foreign donors” (see paragraph 18 above).",

Indeed, this seems to be the approach taken by the Venice Commission, whose opinion stresses the value of financial cooperation between parties at European Union level and points out that the prohibition in issue might contravene the Community principle of the free movement of capital (see paragraph 31 above).",

Furthermore, there is nothing in law to prevent it from receiving funds from other French political parties or from taking advantage of the system of public funding instituted by the French legislature. It is true, as the applicant party pointed out, that these sources of funding appear somewhat hypothetical in its particular case. In view of its political aims, it is unlikely that it would attract the support of another French party; and in view of its geographical sphere of activity, it is likely to take part in local rather than parliamentary elections, so that it scarcely appears to be in a position to take advantage of the system of public funding (which is based on results in parliamentary elections).

Regarding the allegation of “coercion into destroying the family,” the District Court relied on the statements by seven family members of Jehovah's Witnesses – five of which were members of the Salvation Committee – who had been unhappy about their relatives'abidance by the religious norms, their active involvement in the applicant community and their estrangement from non-religious family members. Thus, one husband had blamed the applicant community for the collapse of his family life, claiming that since “his wife [ had ] joined the Jehovah's Witnesses, she fulfil [led] all their orders, [he] c [ould] not discuss anything with her, or even watch TV with her because of her comments on everybody, including the leadership of the country and the Orthodox Church”. Other witnesses complained that their adult children or, in one case, the daughter-in-law had spent less time caring for elderly relatives because they had been constantly busy within the community. The District Court further relied on the majority opinion of the expert study of 4 October 2000 which determined that “the texts of Jehovah's Witnesses do not contain direct coercion into destroying the family but apply and propose for application direct psychological pressure which risks causing the destruction of families ”. Assessing the opinion by the dissenting expert and the findings of the new study of 22 January 2004, which found no coercion into destroying the family, the District Court considered that these experts had limited the scope of their inquiry to publicly available literature of Jehovah's Witnesses and had not analysed the “actual activity of the Moscow community” or implementation of the religious commandments and recommendations “ in real life ” and their influence on family relations. The District Court rejected statements by the witnesses for the defence who had Jehovah's Witnesses in their families and the conclusions of a sociological study of 995 community members, randomly selected, conducted by the Department of Family Sociology at the Moscow State University on the ground that it had been based on the lists of respondents supplied by the community itself and failed to “report a single instance of an internal family confrontation which objectively existed ”."

As evidence of attempts to interfere with other people's private life, the District Court referred to the criminal conviction of a Mr K. for beating a female community member who had offered religious literature to his wife at their home. Moreover, in the District Court's view, the applicant community violated its members'right to a free choice of occupation as it recommended that they engage in part-time employment and provided applications for voluntary service at Bethel, the community centre near St Petersburg, where they only received a monthly living allowance and no salary."

It relied on the fact that there were pending custody disputes between parents in Moscow courts where religious education had been in issue. It noted that where a Witness parent had been represented in the custody dispute by a community-retained lawyer, this amounted to “a manifestation of interest in the outcome of the cases of the community itself and an interference with the family and private affairs of its members”. The District Court also relied on the opinions of three psychiatrist witnesses for the prosecution who stated that “the literal following of the Bible principles, as practised by Jehovah's Witnesses, restricted the person's independent thinking ... and arrested psychological development”. In their view, a child who did not celebrate holidays would become “a social outcast” and the community's teachings “hindered the development of patriotic feelings and love for the Motherland ”."

The District Court accepted the opinions of the prosecution experts and rejected the contrary conclusion in the expert study that the defence expert psychiatrist had conducted of 113 community members on the grounds that “participants had been selected from lists supplied by the organisations” and that the study “only concerned the community members whereas their relatives had not been examined”.

The District Court also had regard to a letter from the Moscow Health Protection Department that listed a number of instances in which patients had refused blood transfusions for themselves and, in one case, in respect of a newborn child. Even though the medical outcome of those cases was not specified, the District Court held that the proven fact of damage to the health of at least one individual was a sufficient ground for terminating the activities of the Moscow community. It further noted the opinions of medical experts who clarified that bloodless surgery was a prospective trend in medicine but that in case of certain diseases the transfusion of blood or its components was still indispensable. Finally, in the District Court's view, the “ No Blood ” card contravened the patient's right to take medical decisions for himself by delegating that right – in the eventuality of his being unconscious – to his fellow believers."

Prima facie every adult has the right and capacity to decide whether or not he will accept medical treatment, even if a refusal may risk permanent injury to his health or even lead to premature death. Furthermore, it matters not whether the reasons for the refusal were rational or irrational, unknown or even non-existent. This is so notwithstanding the very strong public interest in preserving the life and health of all citizens.

In some cases doctors will not only have to consider the capacity of the patient to refuse treatment, but also whether the refusal has been vitiated because it resulted not from the patient's will, but from the will of others. It matters not that those others sought, however strongly, to persuade the patient to refuse, so long as in the end the refusal represented the patient's independent decision. If, however, his will was overborne, the refusal will not have represented a true decision. In this context the relationship of the persuader to the patient – for example, spouse, parents or religious adviser – will be important, because some relationships more readily lend themselves to overbearing the patient's independent will than do others ... ”"

In United States law, the doctrine of informed consent required for any kind of medical treatment has been firmly entrenched since 1914 when Justice Cardozo, on the Court of Appeals of New York, described this doctrine as follows: “Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body, and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient's consent commits an assault” ( Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital, 211 N.Y. 125, 105 N.E. 92 ). The logical corollary of the doctrine of informed consent is that the patient generally possesses the right not to consent, that is, to refuse treatment ( Cruzan v. Director, MDH, 497 U.S. 261 (1990)). The following summary of the relevant case-law can be found in the case of Fosmire v. Nicoleau ( 75 N.Y.2d 218, 551 N.E.2d 77, 551 N.Y.S.2d 876 (1990):",

Wons, 541 So.2d 96, 98 [Fla.198 9, Ehrlich, Ch. J., concurring] ). When the individual's conduct threatens injury to others, the State's interest is manifest and the State can generally be expected to intervene. But the State rarely acts to protect individuals from themselves, indicating that the State's interest is less substantial when there is little or no risk of direct injury to the public. This is consistent with the primary function of the State to preserve and promote liberty and the personal autonomy of the individual ( Rivers v. Katz, supra). ... The State will intervene to prevent suicide ... but merely declining medical care, even essential treatment, is not considered a suicidal act or indication of incompetence ( Matter of Storar, supra, 52 N.Y.2d at 377-378, n. 6, 438 N.Y.S.2d 266, 420 N.E.2d 64). ”"

The law on freedom of religion of December 1990 has led to a considerable renewal of religious activities in Russia. According to religious organisations met in Moscow, this law has opened a new era, and led to a revitalisation of churches.

About 12 000 religious organisations and groups have been registered, and only 200 were refused their registration, most of them because they failed to produce a complete file. Many others have, for a variety of reasons, failed to register. The Minister of Justice, Mr Chaika strongly rejected allegations that the Orthodox Church had exerted pressure on the Ministry to prevent some religious organisations from obtaining their registration.

Nevertheless, the community in Moscow was forced completely underground and prevented from possessing properties and places of worship. The Moscow civil trial against Jehovah's Witnesses (since 1995) has been considered by many as an important test case. The co-rapporteurs thought then that the Moscow case has come to an end with a judgment issued on 23 February 2001, dismissing the charges against Jehovah's Witnesses. However, on 30 May 2001, the Moscow City Court set aside this ruling and ordered the Golovinskiy District Court to hear the case once again. The retrial started on 30 October 2001. Until a definitive ruling is reached, Jehovah's Witnesses in Moscow will be without registration and unable to profess their faith without hindrance. The co-rapporteurs regard the length of the judicial examination in this case as an example of harassment against a religious minority and believe that after six years of criminal and legal proceedings the trial should finally be halted.”"

The Court refers to its settled case-law to the effect that, as enshrined in Article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a “democratic society” within the meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others v. Moldova, no. 45701/99, § 114, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII ). While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies, inter alia, freedom to “manifest [one's] religion” alone and in private or in community with others, in public and within the circle of those whose faith one shares. Since religious communities traditionally exist in the form of organised structures, Article 9 must be interpreted in the light of Article 11 of the Convention, which safeguards associative life against unjustified State interference. Seen in that perspective, the right of believers to freedom of religion, which includes the right to manifest one's religion in community with others, encompasses the expectation that believers will be allowed to associate freely, without arbitrary State intervention. Indeed, the autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is thus an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 affords. The State's duty of neutrality and impartiality, as defined in the Court's case-law, is incompatible with any power on the State's part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia, cited above, §§ 118 and 123, and Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 62, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI )."

                "100. The Court further reiterates that the right to form an association is an inherent part of the right set forth in Article 11. That citizens should be able to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned. Certainly States have a right to satisfy themselves that an association's aim and activities are in conformity with the rules laid down in legislation, but they must do so in a manner compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions (see Sidiropoulos and Others v. Greece, judgment of 10 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ IV, § 40). The State's power to protect its institutions and citizens from associations that might jeopardise them must be used sparingly, as exceptions to the rule of freedom of association are to be construed strictly and only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restrictions on that freedom. Any interference must correspond to a “pressing social need”; thus, the notion “necessary” does not have the flexibility of such expressions as “useful” or “desirable” (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/ 98, §§ 94 95, 17 February 2004, with further references).",

                "101. The Court refers to its constant case-law to the effect that a refusal by the domestic authorities to grant legal-entity status to an association of individuals, religious or otherwise, amounts to an interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of association (see Gorzelik and Others, cited above, § 52 et passim, ECHR 2004-I, and Sidiropoulos and Others, cited above, § 31 et passim ). The authorities'refusal to register a group or their decision to dissolve it have been found by the Court to affect directly both the group itself and also its presidents, founders or individual members (see Association of Citizens Radko and Paunkovski v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, no. 74651/01, § 53, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...

Where the organisation of a religious community was at issue, a refusal to recognise it as a legal entity has also been found to constitute an interference with the right to freedom of religion under Article 9 of the Convention, as exercised by both the community itself and its individual members (see Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others, §§ 79-80, and Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others, § 105, both cited above). The same approach was applicable in the situation where a previously existing association has been dissolved by a decision of the domestic authorities (see Association of Citizens Radko and Paunkovski, cited above, and Tüm Haber Sen and Çınar v. Turkey, no. 28602/95, §§ 30-32, ECHR 2006 ‑ II, and Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, § 50, ECHR 2003 ‑ II)."

Moreover, in addition to the above-mentioned rights normally associated with legal-entity status, the Russian Religions Act reserved a panoply of rights to registered religious organisations and explicitly excluded the possibility of such rights being exercised by either non-registered religious groups or non-religious legal entities (see paragraphs 79 and 80 above). The exclusive rights of religious organisations included, in particular, such fundamental aspects of religious practice as the right to establish places of worship, the right to hold religious services in places accessible to the public, the right to produce, obtain and distribute religious literature, the right to create educational institutions, and the right to maintain contacts for international exchanges and conferences."

In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in the Convention and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v.

                "109. The first ground for banning the applicant community was the charge that it had forced the families of its members to break up. Witnesses for the prosecution had attributed to the applicant community a deterioration of their relationships with their relatives who had become community members, lived by the tenets of the Witnesses'faith, abstained from celebrating public and private holidays, and spent much of their free time within the community and with fellow believers. An extensive study of almost a thousand Witnesses families prepared by the defence had been rejected by the District Court on the ground that it had not reported any rifts in the Witnesses families which, in the District Court's view, must have “objectively existed ”."

                "110. The Court observes at the outset that the term “coercion” in its ordinary meaning implies an action directed at making an individual do something against his or her will by using force or intimidation to achieve compliance. The domestic courts did not give examples of any forceful or threatening action on the part of the applicant community calculated to break the families of its members apart. There was nothing to indicate that the applicant community had made any demands on its members as a condition for continuing their family relationship or, vice versa, that it had imposed any kind of condition or made any demands on non-Witness members of the families of its followers under threat of breaking up their family relationship. In fact, the prosecution experts acknowledged that the texts of Jehovah's Witnesses did not contain “direct coercion into destroying the family”. Although they opined that “direct psychological pressure” applied by the community carried with it the risk of family break ‑ ups, they were unable to identify any victims of the alleged psychological pressure."
            ],
            [
                "111. It further appears from the testimonies by witnesses that what was taken by the Russian courts to constitute “coercion into destroying the family” was the frustration that non-Witness family members experienced as a consequence of disagreements over the manner in which their Witness relatives decided to organise their lives in accordance with the religious precepts, and their increasing isolation resulting from having been left outside the life of the community to which their Witness relatives adhered. It is a known fact that a religious way of life requires from its followers both abidance by religious rules and self-dedication to religious work that can take up a significant portion of the believer's time and sometimes assume such extreme forms as monasticism, which is common to many Christian denominations and, to a lesser extent, also to Buddhism and Hinduism. Nevertheless, as long as self-dedication to religious matters is the product of the believer's independent and free decision and however unhappy his or her family members may be about that decision, the ensuing estrangement cannot be taken to mean that the religion caused the break-up in the family. Quite often, the opposite is true: it is the resistance and unwillingness of non-religious family members to accept and to respect their religious relative's freedom to manifest and practise his or her religion that is the source of conflict. It is true that friction often exists in marriages where the spouses belong to different religious denominations or one of the spouses is a non-believer. However, this situation is common to all mixed-belief marriages and Jehovah's Witnesses are no exception."

The District Court was able to identify only six instances of family conflicts in the families of seven witnesses, five of whom were members of the Salvation Committee, an interested party in the case. However, given that the Moscow community was some ten thousand members strong, their personal stories could not furnish a reasonable basis for the finding that the Witnesses teachings had been the cause of an increased number of conflicts in Witnesses families. Such a finding could be reasonably grounded, for example, on a statistical comparison between the number of broken families of non-religious people, the number of broken families of traditional – for example, Orthodox Christian – believers, and the number of broken Jehovah's Witnesses families. Only if the latter was significantly higher than the former ones would this prove a causal link between Jehovah's Witnesses'teachings and family break-ups.

Finally, the study prepared by the defence of the family life of almost a thousand community members was rejected for reasons that do not appear relevant or sufficient to the Court. Firstly, since the study was intended to cover families in which at least one person was a member of the applicant community, making the selection of respondents from the list of the community members was the only way to proceed. The risk of bias was eliminated by means of random selection of study participants. Secondly, the absence of reported family conflicts could not, in itself, vitiate the quality of the study or make it unreliable. However, the rejection of the study on that ground attested to the District Court's preconceived idea that such conflicts were inevitable in Jehovah's Witnesses families and revealed a bias in its assessment of the evidence."

It also extends further, comprising activities of a professional or business nature since it is, after all, in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant, if not the greatest, opportunity of developing relationships with the outside world (see Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, § 71, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV; Sidabras and Džiautas v.

In the light of these principles, the decisions of Jehovah's Witnesses whether to take full-time or part-time, paid or unpaid employment, whether and how to celebrate events significant to them, including religious and personal events such as wedding anniversaries, births, housewarmings, university admissions, were matters that fell within the sphere of “ private life ” of community members."

The Court emphasises that it is a common feature of many religions that they determine doctrinal standards of behaviour by which their followers must abide in their private lives. Religious precepts that govern the conduct of adherents in private life include, for instance, regular attendance at church services, performance of certain rituals such as communion or confession, observance of religious holidays or abstention from work on specific days of the week (see Casimiro and Ferreira v. Luxembourg (dec.), no. 44888/98, 27 April 1999, and Konttinen v. Finland, no. 24949/94, Commission decision of 3 December 1996 ), wearing specific clothes (see Leyla Şahin v.

France [GC], no. 27417/95, § 73, ECHR 2000-VII), and many others. Jehovah's Witnesses'regulations on allowing sufficient time for religious activities and abstaining from celebrating non-Witnesses or secular events were in that sense not fundamentally different from similar limitations that other religions impose on their followers'private lives. By obeying these precepts in their daily lives, believers manifested their desire to comply strictly with the religious beliefs they professed and their liberty to do so was guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention in the form of the freedom to manifest religion, alone and in private."

Accordingly, the State has a narrow margin of appreciation and must advance serious and compelling reasons for an interference with the choices that people may make in pursuance of the religious standard of behaviour within the sphere of their personal autonomy. An interference may be justified in the light of paragraph 2 of Article 9 if their choices are incompatible with the key principles underlying the Convention, such as, for example, polygamous or underage marriage (see Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 11579/85, Commission decision of 7 July 1986) or a flagrant breach of gender equality (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 115), or if they are imposed on the believers by force or coercion, against their will."

Jehovah's Witnesses who carried out religious service at the Bethel community centre were not employees of the centre but unpaid volunteers. For that reason, the provisions of labour law relating to standard working hours, paid holidays and professional orientation were not applicable to them, as they did not work there for material gain. It is also noteworthy that the Bethel community centre was located in the vicinity of St Petersburg and managed by the Administrative Centre of Jehovah's Witnesses, a federal religious organisation, but the domestic judgments did not give any reasons for the finding that the applicant community in Moscow should be responsible for the functioning of a centre outside its territorial and legal control."

In holding the applicant community responsible, the Russian courts did not point to any evidence showing that the community itself or any non-parent members of the community had resorted to improper methods for involving minors in its activities, whether against their own will or that of their parents.

Both parents, even in a situation where they adhere to differing doctrines or beliefs, have the same right to raise their children in accordance with their religious or non-religious convictions and any disagreements between them in relation to the necessity and extent of the children's participation in religious practices and education are private disputes that are to be resolved according to the procedure established in domestic family law."

This right acquires particular importance in a custody dispute where parental rights are at stake. It is understandable that Witness parents have often chosen to be represented by attorneys who have considerable relevant experience in similar cases and are also knowledgeable about the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses.

The Court observes at the outset that the Russian courts did not elaborate on the allegations of encouragement of suicide or give examples of such incitement in the doctrine or practices of the applicant community or name any community member who had terminated his or her life or sought to do so. In so far as the domestic judgments can be understood to consider that the refusal of a blood transfusion is tantamount to suicide, in the Court's view, this analogy does not hold, for the situation of a patient seeking a hastening of death through discontinuation of treatment is different from that of patients who – like Jehovah's Witnesses – just make a choice of medical procedures but still wish to get well and do not exclude treatment altogether. As the charge of encouragement to suicide did not have any basis in fact, the Court's task will be confined to reviewing the second allegation, namely, that, at the instigation of the community, its members declined medical assistance by refusing the transfusion of blood or its components."

It is generally known that Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Bible prohibits ingesting blood, which is sacred to God, and that this prohibition extends to transfusion of any blood or blood components that are not the patient's own. The religious prohibition permits of no exceptions and is applicable even in cases where a blood transfusion is deemed to be necessary in the best clinical judgment to avoid irreparable damage to the patient's health or even to save his or her life. Some Jehovah's Witnesses, including members of the applicant community, carry an advance medical directive – known in Russia as a “No Blood” card (see paragraph 68 above) – stating that they refuse blood transfusions under any circumstances as a matter of religious belief. A few members of the applicant community who had been admitted to hospitals had firmly refused a blood transfusion against the advice of medical specialists who strongly recommended it. These elements had been correctly established by the domestic courts and were not contested by the applicants."

The Court recognises that the refusal of potentially life-saving medical treatment on religious grounds is a problem of considerable legal complexity, involving as it does a conflict between the State's interest in protecting the lives and health of its citizens and the individual's right to personal autonomy in the sphere of physical integrity and religious beliefs (see, mutatis mutandis, Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 62 et seq., ECHR 2002 ‑ III). The impugned provision of the Russian Religious Act was apparently designed to protect individuals from religious influence which could lead them to make choices that are considered irrational or unwise as a matter of public policy, such as the decision to refuse medical treatment that is generally regarded as beneficial. It was based on the assumption that the State's power to protect people from the harmful consequences of their chosen lifestyle ought to override the rights of believers to respect for their private life and to freedom to manifest their religion in practice and observance. That assumption made it unnecessary for the Russian courts to carry out a balancing exercise which would have allowed them to weigh considerations of public health and safety against the countervailing principle of personal autonomy and religious freedom ( compare Pretty, cited above, § 74). Accordingly, it falls to the Court to verify whether or not the balance has been upset."

The ability to conduct one's life in a manner of one's own choosing includes the opportunity to pursue activities perceived to be of a physically harmful or dangerous nature for the individual concerned. In the sphere of medical assistance, even where the refusal to accept a particular treatment might lead to a fatal outcome, the imposition of medical treatment without the consent of a mentally competent adult patient would interfere with his or her right to physical integrity and impinge on the rights protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see Pretty, cited above, §§ 62 and 63, and Acmanne and Others v. Belgium, no. 10435/83, Commission decision of 10 December 1984)."

                "136. The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, is vital to the principles of self-determination and personal autonomy. A competent adult patient is free to decide, for instance, whether or not to undergo surgery or treatment or, by the same token, to have a blood transfusion. However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others. Many established jurisdictions have examined the cases of Jehovah's Witnesses who had refused a blood transfusion and found that, although the public interest in preserving the life or health of a patient was undoubtedly legitimate and very strong, it had to yield to the patient's stronger interest in directing the course of his or her own life ( see the judgments cited in paragraphs 85 to 88 above). It was emphasised that free choice and self-determination were themselves fundamental constituents of life and that, absent any indication of the need to protect third parties – for example, mandatory vaccination during an epidemic, the State must abstain from interfering with the individual freedom of choice in the sphere of health care, for such interference can only lessen and not enhance the value of life (see the Malette v. Shulman and Fosmire v. Nicoleau judgments, cited in paragraphs 85 and 87 above)."

            [
                "137. This position is echoed in the Russian law which safeguards the patients'freedom of choice. The Fundamentals of Russian Legislation on Health Protection explicitly provide for the patient's right to refuse medical treatment or to request its discontinuation on condition that they have received full and accessible information about the possible consequences of that decision. Patients are not required to give reasons for the refusal. The refusal may only be overridden in three specific situations : prevention of spreading of contagious diseases, treatment of grave mental disorders and mandatory treatment of offenders (see paragraphs 81 and 83 above). Additionally, the parents'decision to refuse treatment of a child may be reversed by means of judicial intervention (see paragraph 82 above). It follows that Russian law protects the individual's freedom of choice in respect to their health care decisions as long as the patient is a competent adult and there is no danger to innocent third parties. These provisions had been repeatedly invoked by the applicants in the first-instance and appeal proceedings but were not mentioned or analysed in the domestic judgments. The Court notes, however, that they were prima facie applicable in the instant case because all the refusals of blood transfusions which had been described in the domestic judgments had been formulated by adult Jehovah's Witnesses having capacity to make medical decisions for themselves. In the only case involving a minor, the hospital did not apply for judicial authorisation of a blood transfusion, although such a possibility was explicitly provided for in law (see paragraph 82 above), which indicates that authorisation was considered unnecessary for medical or other reasons."

                "138. Furthermore, even though the Jehovah's Witnesses whose opposition to blood transfusions was cited in evidence were adults having legal capacity to refuse that form of treatment, the findings of the Russian courts can be understood to mean that their refusals had not been an expression of their true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on them by the applicant community. The Court accepts that, given that health and possibly life itself are at stake in such situations, the authenticity of the patient's refusal of medical treatment is a legitimate concern. In the landmark case In re T. (Adult: Refusal of Treatment), Donaldson L.J., on the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, indicated that the refusal may have been vitiated because it resulted not from the patient's will, but from the will of others. If the patient's will was overborne, the refusal will not have represented a true decision (see the judgment, § 5, paragraph 86 above). Staughton L.J. added that “for an apparent refusal or consent to be less than a true consent or refusal, there must be such a degree of external influence as to persuade the patient to depart from her own wishes, to an extent that the law regards it as undue”."
            ],
            [
                "139. The Court reiterates that, although the arguments based on religious beliefs may be extremely persuasive and compelling, the right “to try to convince one's neighbour” is an essential element of religious freedom (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31, and Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I). In the Larissis case the Court drew a distinction between the position of servicemen who found it difficult to withdraw from religious conversations initiated by the applicants, who had been their superiors, and that of civilians who were not subject to pressures and constraints of the same kind as military personnel. The former could be viewed as a form of harassment or the application of improper pressure, whereas the latter would be seen as an innocuous exchange of ideas (see Larissis, §§ 51, 54, and 59). Turning to the instant case, the Court finds nothing in the domestic judgments to suggest that any form of improper pressure or undue influence was applied. On the contrary, it appears that many Jehovah's Witnesses have made a deliberate choice to refuse blood transfusions in advance, free from time constraints of an emergency situation, which is borne out by the fact that they had prepared for emergencies by filling out “ No Blood ” cards and carrying them in their purses. There is no evidence that they wavered in their refusal of a blood transfusion upon admission to hospital. Accordingly, there is no factual basis supporting the finding that their will was overborne or that the refusal of a blood transfer did not represent their true decision."

                "140. The District Court's finding that the “ No Blood ” card permitted the patient's fellow believers to take medical decisions in his or her stead was also at variance with the actual contents of the card ( as reproduced in paragraph 68 above ). Designed as an advance medical directive, the card merely certified the choice that the patient had already made for himself or herself, namely, to refuse any transfusion of blood or its components. It did not delegate the right to make any other medical decision to anyone else, but designated the patient's legal representative who could ensure, in case of the patient's unconsciousness or inability to communicate, that his or her choice of medical treatment be known to, and respected by, the medical personnel. Representation of the patient in medical matters was provided for in Article 33 of the Fundamentals on Health Protection (see paragraph 81 above). The identity of the representative was of no legal significance, as the law did not vest any special rights in the next-of-kin. The patient was free to choose as his representative another fellow believer or a member of the Hospital Liaison Committee in the applicant community who would have the added benefit of detailed knowledge of the Jehovah's Witnesses doctrine on the issue of blood transfusion and could advise the medical personnel on compatibility of the contemplated procedure with the patient's religious beliefs."

The fact that the applicant community had preached the doctrinal importance of abstaining from blood transfusions in its religious literature and distributed blank “No Blood” cards among its members was in itself sufficient to trigger the banning of its activities. This finding had the effect of making the part of the Jehovah's Witnesses teachings concerning the refusal of medical treatment unlawful and amounted to a declaration that their religious beliefs relating to the sacred nature of blood were illegitimate. However, the Court reiterates that the State does not have the right under the Convention to decide what beliefs may or may not be taught because the right to freedom of religion as guaranteed under the Convention excludes any discretion on the part of the State to determine whether religious beliefs or the means used to express such beliefs are legitimate (see Manoussakis and Others, cited above, § 47)."

It does not appear that the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses include any such contentious practices. What is more important, by contrast with the provision that penalised the mere act of encouraging the refusal of medical assistance, the accusation of causing damage to the health of citizens required proof of actual harm to health as defined by law. However, the domestic judgments did not identify any member of the applicant community whose health had been harmed or cite any forensic study assessing the extent of the harm and establishing a causal link between that harm and the activities of the applicant community. The medical outcomes in the reported cases of refusals of blood transfusions were not specified and those reports were not accompanied by medical studies capable of demonstrating that a blood transfusion would have actually benefited the patient. Furthermore, as the Court has found above, the refusal of blood transfusion was an expression of the free will of the individual community members who exercised their right to personal autonomy in the sphere of health care protected both under the Convention and in Russian law."

On the other hand, Jehovah's Witnesses agree to carry out alternative civilian service on the condition it is not connected with military organisations (see Faizov v. Russia (dec.), no. 19820/04, 15 January 2009). The Russian Constitution (Article 59 § 3) and the Russian Religions Act (section 3 § 4) explicitly acknowledge the right of Russian nationals to conscientious objection to military service, in which case it has to be substituted with alternative civilian service. The right to alternative civilian service has been consistently upheld by the Russian courts, including in cases where it was exercised by a Jehovah's Witness (see Faizov, cited above).

In the light of the general principles outlined above, the ability to establish a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The Court has expressed the view that a refusal by the domestic authorities to grant legal-entity status to an association of individuals may amount to an interference with the applicants'exercise of their right to freedom of association (see Gorzelik, cited above, § 52 et passim, and Sidiropoulos, cited above, § 31 et passim ). Where the organisation of the religious community is at issue, a refusal to recognise it also constitutes an interference with the applicants'right to freedom of religion under Article 9 of the Convention (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia, cited above, § 105). The believers'right to freedom of religion encompasses the expectation that the community will be allowed to function peacefully, free from arbitrary State intervention (see Hasan and Chaush v.

In 1997 the respondent State enacted a new Religions Act which required all religious organisations that had been previously granted legal-entity status to amend their founding documents in conformity with the new Act and to have them “re-registered” within a specific time-period. Several applications for re-registration filed by the applicant community before the established time-limit were rejected, which had the effect of barring the possibility of filing further applications for re-registration."

The Court has already found in two similar cases that, contrary to the Government's submission, the entering of information concerning the religious association into the Unified State Register of Legal Entities did not constitute “re-registration” required under the Religious Act, as it was solely linked to the establishment of that register and to the transfer of registration competence from one authority to another following enactment of a new procedure for registration of legal entities (see The Moscow Branch of The Salvation Army, § 67, and Church of Scientology Moscow, § 78, both cited above). Furthermore, the Court found in those same cases that the refusal of re-registration disclosed an interference with the religious organisation's right to freedom of association and also with its right to freedom of religion in so far as the Religions Act restricted the ability of a religious association without legal-entity status to exercise the full range of religious activities and also to introduce amendments to its own articles of association (see The Moscow Branch of The Salvation Army, § 74, and Church of Scientology Moscow, § 83, both cited above ).

However, the Presnenskiy District Court found that there had been no legal basis for such request (see paragraph 48 above). The fourth application was rejected because of textual discrepancies between the charter and the Religions Act (see paragraph 41 above). The fifth and final application was rejected with reference to the proceedings for dissolution of the applicant community pending before the Golovinskiy District Court (see paragraph 43 above). This ground was endorsed by the Buryrskiy District and Moscow City Courts (see paragraphs 47 and 49 above). Finally, the Presnenskiy District and Moscow City Courts dismissed the complaint brought by the second applicant, Mr Chaykovskiy, on the basis of a new ground, namely, the introduction of new registration forms in 2002 (see paragraphs 48 and 49 above)."

Responding to a written inquiry by the applicant community, the deputy head of the Department claimed that it was under no legal obligation to list the missing documents (see paragraph 40 above). The Court has already found, in a similar case involving the Moscow Justice Department, that not only did such an approach deprive the applicant of an opportunity to remedy the supposed defects of the applications and re-submit them, but it also ran counter to the express requirement of the domestic law that any refusal must be reasoned (see Church of Scientology Moscow, cited above, § 91). By not stating clear reasons for rejecting the applications for re-registration submitted by the applicant community, the Moscow Justice Department acted in an arbitrary manner.

In any event, neither the domestic authorities, nor the Government in their observations, were able to specify by operation of which legal provisions the applicant community could still resubmit an application for re-registration after such application had obviously become belated following the expiry of the extended time-limit on 31 December 2000 (compare Church of Scientology Moscow, cited above, § 79)."

A further consideration relevant for the Court's assessment of the justification for the interference is that by the time the re-registration requirement was introduced, the applicant had lawfully existed and operated in Moscow as an independent religious community for many years. At the relevant time there existed no judicial or administrative decision by which the applicant community as a whole or its individual members had been found to have breached any domestic law or regulation governing associative life and religious activities. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the reasons for refusing re-registration should have been particularly weighty and compelling (see Church of Scientology Moscow, and The Moscow Branch of The Salvation Army, both cited above, § 96). In the present case no such reasons have been put forward by the domestic authorities."

The applicants were thus compelled to deploy substantial resources for defending the interests of the community and their fellow believers in Moscow. The dissolution proceedings had undoubtedly been complex and lasted for a formidable 116 court days, which led the Court to find a separate violation of the reasonable-time guarantee under Article 6 of the Convention. In these circumstances, the Court accepts that these proceedings generated a substantial amount of legal costs and expenses. Nevertheless, it considers that the amount of counsel's fees excessive. Making a global assessment of costs and expenses, the Court awards the applicants jointly EUR 50,000, plus any tax that may be chargeable to them on that amount."

Genuine and effective respect for freedom of association and assembly cannot be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere; a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the purpose of Article 11 nor with that of the Convention in general. There may thus be positive obligations to secure the effective enjoyment of these freedoms (see Wilson & the National Union of Journalists and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 30668/96, 30671/96 and 30678/96, § 41, ECHR 2002 ‑ V, and Ouranio Toxo v.

The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others v.

This provision complements the other substantive provisions of the Convention and the Protocols. It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded by those provisions. Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions – and to this extent it is autonomous – there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of the latter (see, among many other authorities, Van Raalte v. Netherlands, judgment of 21 February 1997, Reports 1997 ‑ I, p. 184, § 33, and Gaygusuz v. Austria, judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ IV, § 36)."

These decisions focused on technical aspects of the organisation of the assemblies and on compliance with the relevant requirements (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). It has been established that in the proceedings before the Traffic Officer the applicants were required to submit a “traffic organisation plan ” and that their request was refused because of their failure to submit such a plan. At the same time, the Court notes that it has not been shown or argued that other organisers were likewise required to do this."

On 9 June 2005 the municipal authorities, acting on the Mayor's behalf, gave decisions banning the stationary assemblies to be organised by the first five applicants, referring to the need to avoid any possible violent clashes between participants in the various demonstrations to be held on 11 June 2005.

The Court reiterates that there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on questions of public interest, in particular as regards politicians themselves (see Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV, and Castells v. Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236 ). However, the exercise of freedom of expression by elected politicians who at the same time are holders of public offices in the executive branch of government entails particular responsibility. In certain situations it is a normal part of the duties of such public officials personally to take administrative decisions which are likely to affect the exercise of individual rights, or that such decisions are given by public servants acting in their name. Hence, the exercise of freedom of expression by such officials may unduly impinge on the enjoyment of other rights guaranteed by the Convention (as regards statements by public officials, amounting to declarations of a person's guilt, pending criminal proceedings, see Butkevičius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, § 53, ECHR 2002 ‑ II (extracts); see also Allenet de Ribemont v. France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 16, §§ 35-36, and Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, §§ 41 ‑ 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ X). When exercising their freedom of expression they may be required to show restraint, bearing in mind that their views can be regarded as instructions by civil servants whose employment and careers depend on their approval."

These two principles are not contradictory but are correlated.

Under Article 2 of its constitution, the trade union ’ s objective is to promote democratic trade unionism and thereby assist its members in their aspirations and claims. Its head office is located in Istanbul."

In arriving at this conclusion, the Court of Cassation took into account the special relationship between civil servants and the public administration as regards recruitment, the nature and scope of the work concerned, and the privileges and guarantees afforded to officials by virtue of their status. It considered that this relationship was different from that which existed between employers and ordinary contractual staff (that is to say, employees in the private sector together with manual workers employed by a public administration). As a result, Law no. 2322, governing collective agreements and the right to take strike or lock-out action, could not apply to relations between civil servants and a public administration.

As regards the right of civil servants to enter into collective agreements, the court considered that, even if there was an omission in Turkish law on this point, the court to which a dispute was referred had an obligation, under Article 1 of the Civil Code, to make good the omission itself and to adjudicate the case. In the court ’ s view, the same obligation also arose from Article 36 of the Turkish Constitution, under which everyone was afforded the right of access to a court. In this context the relevant provisions of the ILO conventions ratified by Turkey had to be applied in the case, even though the specific national laws had not yet been enacted by the legislature. Directly applying the relevant provisions of these international instruments ratified by Turkey, the court considered that the applicant trade union did have the right to enter into collective agreements."

As to the question whether the validity of the collective agreement in question was affected by the fact that it had not been provided for by any legislation at the time it was entered into, the court considered that, since it concerned employer-employee relations, the agreement was of a private-law nature. In the context of the limits imposed by Articles 19 and 20 of the Code of Obligations, namely compliance with statutory provisions, customary law, morals and public order, the parties had been freely entitled to determine the content of this collective agreement. An examination of the text of the collective agreement in question did not reveal any contradiction with those requirements.

As there was no specific law on the subject, the existence of such a legal entity could not be recognised. According to the Court of Cassation, this finding was not at odds with the principles of “the rule of law” and “democracy” mentioned in the Constitution, since supervision of legal entities by the State, in order to ensure public usefulness, was necessary in any democratic legal system."

The Audit Court, in a number of decisions that it gave as the court of last resort in respect of the collective agreements entered into by the trade union, pointed out that the rules applicable to civil servants, including the salaries and allowances to which they were entitled, were laid down by law. It further considered that, since the amendment on 23 July 1995 of Article 53 of the Turkish Constitution and the enactment on 25 June 2001 of Law no. 4688 on civil servants ’ trade unions, such unions were admittedly entitled to engage in collective bargaining under certain conditions of representation, but were not entitled to enter into valid collective agreements directly with the authorities concerned, unlike trade unions of ordinary contractual employees who could enter into such agreements with their employers. If an agreement was entered into between the employing authority and the trade union concerned, it could only become binding following its approval by the Council of Ministers. The Audit Court, after finding that the collective agreement entered into by the applicant trade union had not fulfilled these conditions, decided that the accountants who had authorised higher payments than those provided for by law should reimburse the surplus amounts to the State ’ s budget."

Secondly, it considered that the fact that the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment prohibited the extradition of a person to another State where he would be in danger of being subjected to torture did not mean that an essentially similar obligation was not already inherent in the general terms of Article 3 of the European Convention."

The Convention makes no distinction between the functions of a Contracting State as holder of public power and its responsibilities as employer. Article 11 is no exception to that rule. On the contrary, § 2 in fine of this provision clearly indicates that the State is bound to respect freedom of assembly and association, subject to the possible imposition of “lawful restrictions” in the case of members of its armed forces, police or administration ( see Tüm Haber Sen and Çınar, cited above, § 29).

Consequently, the Court considers that, having regard to the developments in labour law, both international and national, and to the practice of Contracting States in such matters, the right to bargain collectively with the employer has, in principle, become one of the essential elements of the “right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of [one ’ s] interests” set forth in Article 11 of the Convention, it being understood that States remain free to organise their system so as, if appropriate, to grant special status to representative trade unions. Like other workers, civil servants, except in very specific cases, should enjoy such rights, but without prejudice to the effects of any “lawful restrictions ” that may have to be imposed on “members of the administration of the State” within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 – a category to which the applicants in the present case do not, however, belong ( see paragraphs 10 6-07 above ).",

In the light of the foregoing principles, the Court considers that the trade union Tüm Bel Sen, already at the material time, enjoyed the right to engage in collective bargaining with the employing authority, which had moreover not disputed that fact. This right constituted one of the inherent elements of the right to engage in trade-union activities, as secured to that union by Article 11 of the Convention."

Accordingly, the Court observes that the collective bargaining in the present case and the resulting collective agreement constituted, for the trade union concerned, an essential means to promote and secure the interests of its members. The absence of the legislation necessary to give effect to the provisions of the international labour conventions already ratified by Turkey, and the Court of Cassation judgment of 6 December 1995 based on that absence, with the resulting de facto annulment ex tunc of the collective agreement in question, constituted interference with the applicants ’ trade-union freedom as protected by Article 11 of the Convention."

As to the question whether the validity of the collective agreement in question was affected by the fact that it had not been provided for by any legislation at the time it was entered into, the court considered that, since it concerned employer-employee relations, the agreement was of a private-law nature. In the context of the limits imposed by Articles 19 and 20 of the Code of Obligations, namely compliance with statutory provisions, customary law, morals and public order, the parties had been freely entitled to determine the content of this collective agreement. An examination of the text of the collective agreement in question did not reveal any contradiction with those requirements.

It found that certain rights and freedoms mentioned in the Turkish Constitution were directly applicable to litigants, whereas others were not. In fact, the Constitution, by the indication “the exercise of this right shall be governed by legislation ” clearly earmarked the rights and freedoms which, to be used and applied, required the enactment of specific legislation.

According to the Court of Cassation, this finding was not at odds with the principles of “the rule of law” and “democracy” mentioned in the Constitution, since supervision of legal entities by the State, in order to ensure public usefulness, was necessary in any democratic legal system."

The Audit Court, in a number of decisions that it gave as the court of last resort in respect of the collective agreements entered into by the trade union, pointed out that the rules applicable to civil servants, including the salaries and allowances to which they were entitled, were laid down by law. It further considered that, since the amendment on 23 July 1995 of Article 53 of the Turkish Constitution and the enactment on 25 June 2001 of Law no. 4688 on civil servants ’ trade unions, such unions were admittedly entitled to engage in collective bargaining under certain conditions of representation, but were not entitled to enter into valid collective agreements directly with the authorities concerned, unlike trade unions of ordinary contractual employees who could enter into such agreements with their employers. If an agreement was entered into between the employing authority and the trade union concerned, it could only become binding following its approval by the Council of Ministers. The Audit Court, after finding that the collective agreement entered into by the applicant trade union had not fulfilled these conditions, decided that the accountants who had authorised higher payments than those provided for by law should reimburse the surplus amounts to the State ’ s budget."

In particular, considering that the Chamber had attached great importance to the European Social Charter (Articles 5 and 6 of which had not been ratified by Turkey) and to the case-law of its supervisory organ, they requested the Grand Chamber to declare the application inadmissible as being incompatible ratione materiae with the Convention, in view of the impossibility of relying against the Government on international instruments that Turkey had not ratified."

That being said, the Court notes that, even if there had been estoppel, it could not have avoided examining this issue, which goes to its jurisdiction, the extent of which is determined by the Convention itself, in particular by Article 32, and not by the parties ’ submissions in a particular case (see, mutatis mutandis, Blečić v.

Civil servants, whether they work for central government or a local authority, are generally entitled to join the trade union of their choosing. The Court also takes note of the fact that the density of trade-union membership is generally higher in the public sector than in the private sector, which constitutes a manifest indication of a favourable legal and administrative environment created by member States. In the majority of member States, the few restrictions that can be found are limited to judicial offices, the police and the fire services, with the most stringent restrictions, culminating in the prohibition of union membership, being reserved for members of the armed forces."

As to the substance of the right of association enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention, the Court has taken the view that § 1 of that Article affords members of a trade union a right, in order to protect their interests, that the trade union should be heard, but has left each State a free choice of the means to be used towards this end. What the Convention requires, in the Court ’ s view, is that under national law trade unions should be enabled, in conditions not at variance with Article 11, to strive for the protection of their members ’ interests ( see National Union of Belgian Police, cited above, § 39; Swedish Engine Drivers ’ Union, cited above, § 40; and Schmidt and Dahlström, cited above, § 36)."

Subsequently, in the case of Wilson, National Union of Journalists and Others, the Court considered that even if collective bargaining was not indispensable for the effective enjoyment of trade-union freedom, it might be one of the ways by which trade unions could be enabled to protect their members ’ interests. The union had to be free, in one way or another, to seek to persuade the employer to listen to what it had to say on behalf of its members ( ibid., § 44)."

As a result of the foregoing, the evolution of case-law as to the substance of the right of association enshrined in Article 11 is marked by two guiding principles : firstly, the Court takes into consideration the totality of the measures taken by the State concerned in order to secure trade-union freedom, subject to its margin of appreciation; secondly, the Court does not accept restrictions that affect the essential elements of trade-union freedom, without which that freedom would become devoid of substance. These two principles are not contradictory but are correlated. This correlation implies that the Contracting State in question, while in principle being free to decide what measures it wishes to take in order to ensure compliance with Article 11, is under an obligation to take account of the elements regarded as essential by the Court ’ s case-law."

In other words, limitations to rights must be construed restrictively, in a manner which gives practical and effective protection to human rights ( see, mutatis mutandis, Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v.

Adopted in 1949, this text, which is one of the fundamental instruments concerning international labour standards, was ratified by Turkey in 1952. It states in Article 6 that it does not deal with the position of “ public servants engaged in the administration of the State ”. However, the ILO Committee of Experts interpreted this provision as excluding only those officials whose activities were specific to the administration of the State. With that exception, all other persons employed by government, by public enterprises or by autonomous public institutions should benefit, according to the Committee, from the guarantees provided for in Convention No. 98 in the same manner as other employees, and consequently should be able to engage in collective bargaining in respect of their conditions of employment, including wages ( see paragraph 43 above )."

In addition, the provisions of Convention No. 151, under its Article 1 § 1, cannot be used to reduce the extent of the guarantees provided for in Convention No. 98 (see paragraph 44 above )."

As to European instruments, the Court finds that the European Social Charter, in its Article 6 § 2 ( which Turkey has not ratified ), affords to all workers, and to all trade unions, the right to bargain collectively, thus imposing on the public authorities the corresponding obligation to promote actively a culture of dialogue and negotiation in the economy, so as to ensure broad coverage for collective agreements. The Court observes, however, that this obligation does not oblige authorities to enter into collective agreements. According to the meaning attributed by the ECSR to Article 6 § 2 of the Charter, which in fact fully applies to public officials, States which impose restrictions on collective bargaining in the public sector have an obligation, in order to comply with this provision, to arrange for the involvement of staff representatives in the drafting of the applicable employment regulations."

In particular, the right of public servants employed by local authorities and not holding State powers to engage in collective bargaining in order to determine their wages and working conditions has been recognised in the majority of Contracting States.

While it is in the interests of legal certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law that the Court should not depart, without good reason, from precedents established in previous cases, a failure by the Court to maintain a dynamic and evolutive approach would risk rendering it a bar to reform or improvement (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, § 56 )."

It was then not able to pursue an appeal against the EAT for ignoring that claim. In particular, the applicant did not require the EAT to apply section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998, by seeking to construe the legislation so as to make it compatible with its Convention right. It was only concerned to ensure that it could rely on Mr Lee's various activities as the basis for expelling him; it did not propose any construction of section 174 which would have accorded with its case before this Court, namely that it had an Article 11 right to determine its own membership.

Cyprus [GC], no. 56679/00, § 38, ECHR 2004 ‑ III ). They asserted that, if the applicant had pressed its submission that Article 11 entitled it to choose its own membership save where exclusion or expulsion caused loss of livelihood and that submission had been accepted, there was ample scope for a creative interpretation of section 174 which would have given effect to that conclusion, including the possibility of reading in a clause “ save as necessary to avoid breach of Convention rights”."

Counsel did rely on section 3 submitting that section 174 should be construed so far as possible in accordance with Article 11, so that the phrase'member of a political party'be construed as narrowly as possible so as to be limited to mere membership and thus to permit expulsion for activities other than the mere fact of membership: it was not possible in that context to construe the term “ member of a political party ” so as to permit a union to expel a person just because he or she was a member of a political party. It only desisted in pursuing its submissions further orally after the EAT made clear that it was not inclined to decide the point and gave indications that ASLEF was in any event unlikely to be successful on the point. Furthermore, as the applicant had been successful in its appeal to the EAT no appeal could have been brought against that decision to the Court of Appeal.

Article 35 § 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but not that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.

The argument was, the Government conceded, made before the EAT; however the Court cannot accept the Government's assertion that the applicant somehow waived or dropped this part of his case. It appears rather from the terms of the EAT judgment that, in face of that Tribunal's view that Article 11 was irrelevant and that they should seek to resolve the construction of the statute without reference to the competing rights under that provision, the applicant's counsel reserved his position. As, therefore, the issues were squarely raised before the EAT and indeed considered, the Court does not consider that on this basis the applicant has failed to exhaust domestic remedies. Nor is it persuaded that the applicant could, given the EAT ruling was in his favour on other grounds, have appealed to the Court of Appeal and applied in addition for a declaration of incompatibility, as it was in effect the winning party and appeal lies against orders not reasons or findings. While the Government asserted that the Court of Appeal could admit an appeal by a winning party in exceptional circumstances, there is no indication that this case fell within such a category.

They relied on the importance of the countervailing rights of trade union members and prospective members to freedom of expression and freedom of association which would be engaged by expulsion from a trade union. Those rights were at the very foundation of democratic society, not least as the case concerned sanctions in respect of membership of a political party. They also claimed that a wide discretion remained for trade unions to expel or exclude on grounds of political activities. Section 174 only imposed a limited restriction on expelling those with views inimical to the trade union's objectives; it was only the applicant's own error in approach that led to a problem as there was ample conduct by Mr Lee, going beyond mere membership of the BNP, which the applicant could have relied on in order to found an entirely lawful decision to expel him."

In any event any sanction was minimal and did not take priority over its right, and its members'rights, to exercise their own freedom of association and expression. Mr Lee never claimed that he suffered any detriment from exclusion. It referred to Article 17 to the effect that Article 10 would not protect some-one engaged in destroying other rights and freedoms. Since it was committed to opposing race discrimination, it would interfere with its rights, and its members, to be forced to admit into membership a person who was a member of such a right wing organisation. It did not accept that section 174 imposed a limited restriction, pointing out that it simply did not wish to associate with those whom they regarded as fascists or members of extreme right wing parties, whether active or not. It claimed that it had the right to dissociate itself from those whose political membership they abhorred. While Mr Lee's status as an activist might furnish greater reason to expel him, this did not touch on the fundamental issue.

Such trade union rights are explicitly recognised in Articles 3 and 5 of ILO Convention No. 87, the provisions of which have been taken into account by the Convention organs in previous cases (see e.g. Cheall v. the United Kingdom, no. 10550/83, Comm. Dec. 13.5.85, D.R. 42, p. 178; Wilson & the National Union of Journalists and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 30668/96, 30671/96 and 30678/96, § 34, ECHR 2002 ‑ V ).

Article 11 cannot be interpreted as imposing an obligation on associations or organisations to admit whosoever wishes to join. Where associations are formed by people, who, espousing particular values or ideals, intend to pursue common goals, it would run counter to the very effectiveness of the freedom at stake if they had no control over their membership. By way of example, it is uncontroversial that religious bodies and political parties can generally regulate their membership to include only those who share their beliefs and ideals. Similarly, the right to join a union “ for the protection of his interests ” cannot be interpreted as conferring a general right to join the union of one's choice irrespective of the rules of the union: in the exercise of their rights under Article 11 § 1 unions must remain free to decide, in accordance with union rules, questions concerning admission to and expulsion from the union ( Cheall, cited above; see also Article 5 of the European Social Charter and the Conclusions of the European Committee of Social Rights, Relevant International Materials, paragraphs 22-24 above )."

For the individual right to join a union to be effective, the State must nonetheless protect the individual against any abuse of a dominant position by trade unions (see Young, James and Webster judgment, cited above, § 63). Such abuse might occur, for example, where exclusion or expulsion from a trade union was not in accordance with union rules or where the rules were wholly unreasonable or arbitrary or where the consequences of exclusion or expulsion resulted in exceptional hardship (see Cheall, cited above, Johanssen v.

Taking due consideration of the Government's argument as to the importance of safeguarding fundamental individual rights, the Court is not persuaded however that the measure of expulsion impinged in any significant way on Mr Lee's exercise of freedom of expression or his lawful political activities. Nor is it apparent that Mr Lee suffered any particular detriment, save loss of membership itself in the union. As there was no closed shop agreement for example, there was no apparent prejudice suffered by Mr Lee in terms of his livelihood or in his conditions of employment. The Court has taken account of the fact that membership of a trade union is often regarded, in particular due to the trade union movement's historical background, as a fundamental safeguard for workers against employers'abuse and it has some sympathy with the notion that any worker should be able to join a trade union (subject to the exceptions set out in Article 11 § 2 in fine ). However, as pointed out by the applicant, ASLEF represents all workers in the collective bargaining context and there is nothing to suggest in the present case that Mr Lee is at any individual risk of, or is unprotected from, any arbitrary or unlawful action by his employer. Of more weight in the balance is the applicant's right to choose its members. Historically, trade unions in the United Kingdom, and elsewhere in Europe, were, and though perhaps to a lesser extent today are, commonly affiliated to political parties or movements, particularly those on the left. They are not bodies solely devoted to politically-neutral aspects of the well-being of their members, but are often ideological, with strongly held views on social and political issues. There was no hint in the domestic proceedings that the applicant erred in its conclusion that Mr Lee's political values and ideals clashed, fundamentally, with its own. There is no indication that the applicant had any public duty or role conferred on it, or has taken the advantage of state funding, such that it may reasonably be required to take on members to fulfil any other wider purposes."

The applicants and NALGO (the predecessor of UNISON, the trade union of which the applicants are members and which represents public-sector workers) applied for and were granted leave to apply for judicial review of the Regulations. The application was dismissed on 20 December 1991. The judge, Mr Justice Hutchison, considered that he was bound by the recent decision of the House of Lords in the case of R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind and Others regarding the status of Article 10 of the Convention in domestic law. In connection with the test of “Wednesbury” unreasonableness, the judge referred to an affidavit submitted by Mr Simcock, a senior civil servant at the Department of the Environment, in which Mr Simcock explained how the Widdicombe Committee (see paragraph 8 above) had been set up in 1985 to inquire into local authority practices and procedures with particular reference to the respective roles of elected members and officers. Mr Simcock also described the consultation process between the publication of the Widdicombe Report and the making of the Regulations, in which NALGO was involved, and how the Regulations were in some respects less restrictive than the Widdicombe Committee’s proposals. Referring to senior officers, the Widdicombe Committee had said:",
                "“... It is part of their job to advise councillors, and to adjudicate on matters of propriety, and in so doing they must command the respect and trust of all political parties. There might well be some senior officers who are politically active but who are nevertheless totally able to detach themselves from such activity in carrying out their duties as neutral officers. Nevertheless we believe there will always be a very significant risk that they are viewed with suspicion by councillors of other parties, and that as a consequence the performance of their duties towards the council as a whole will be impaired.”",

Thus, in the Schedule references to apparent intention (paragraphs 6 and 7) and to publication in circumstances likely to create an impression (paragraphs 9 and 10) are objectionable, as is paragraph 4 of the Regulations themselves.",
                "(d) The consequence of the vice mentioned in the previous paragraph is that employees are likely to be treated inconsistently by different employers, by reason of there being room for undue latitude in interpreting the restrictions.",

The arguments summarised in (c) and (d) are to the effect that the Regulations are uncertain and incapable of consistent and fair application. As a Wednesbury argument, this contention could not avail the applicants – at least unless the Regulations were void for uncertainty (this would be a distinct ground for challenge) which plainly they are not. Finally, the argument mentioned in (f) is in my view misconceived: the Regulations do not prohibit the kind of activities there mentioned.

Read as a whole and having regard in particular to the terms of regulation 4, the Regulations satisfied in the Commission’s opinion the test of foreseeability for the purposes of the “prescribed by law” requirement of paragraph 2 of Article 10."

The Court notes that the impugned Regulations were designed to lay down a framework of rules restricting the participation of a substantial number of local government officers within the categories defined in the parent legislation in certain kinds of political activities which might impair the duty of impartiality which they owed to their local authorities. It is inevitable that conduct which may call into question an officer’s impartiality in the eyes of third parties cannot be defined with absolute precision. For this reason, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Schedule to the Regulations define types of conduct which have the potential to undermine an officer’s impartiality. Even accepting that it may be difficult on occasions for an officer to assess whether a given action may or may not fall foul of the Regulations, it is nevertheless open to him or her to seek advice beforehand either from the employer or from the union or other source. It must also be stressed that the scope and application of paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Schedule, like the Regulations as a whole, have to be considered in the light of the vice which the parent legislation sought to avoid. To that end, regulation 4 (see paragraph 33 above) must be considered a helpful aid to gauging the acceptability of a particular course of action from the standpoint of paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Schedule to the Regulations."

The Court does not accept the applicants’ argument that the protection of effective democracy can only be invoked as a justification for limitations on the rights guaranteed under Article 10 in circumstances where there is a threat to the stability of the constitutional or political order. To limit this notion to that context would be to overlook both the interests served by democratic institutions such as local authorities and the need to make provision to secure their proper functioning where this is considered necessary to safeguard those interests. The Court recalls in this respect that democracy is a fundamental feature of the European public order. That is apparent from the Preamble to the Convention, which establishes a very clear connection between the Convention and democracy by stating that the maintenance and further realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms are best ensured on the one hand by an effective political democracy and on the other by a common understanding and observance of human rights (see, mutatis mutandis, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, pp. 21–22, § 45). For the Court this notion of effective political democracy is just as applicable to the local level as it is to the national level bearing in mind the extent of decision-making entrusted to local authorities and the proximity of the local electorate to the policies which their local politicians adopt. It also notes in this respect that the Preamble to the Council of Europe’s European Charter of Local Self-Government (European Treaty Series no. 122) proclaims that “local authorities are one of the main foundations of any democratic regime”."

The Court observes that the local government system of the respondent State has long rested on a bond of trust between elected members and a permanent corps of local government officers who both advise them on policy and assume responsibility for the implementation of the policies adopted. That relationship of trust stems from the right of council members to expect that they are being assisted in their functions by officers who are politically neutral and whose loyalty is to the council as a whole. Members of the public also have a right to expect that the members whom they voted into office will discharge their mandate in accordance with the commitments they made during an electoral campaign and that the pursuit of that mandate will not founder on the political opposition of their members’ own advisers; it is also to be noted that members of the public are equally entitled to expect that in their own dealings with local government departments they will be advised by politically neutral officers who are detached from the political fray.",

Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. Freedom of expression, as enshrined in Article 10, is subject to a number of exceptions which, however, must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any exceptions must be convincingly established.",
                "(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court’s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully or in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it is “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts."

They repeated in this context their criticism of the way in which paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Schedule were framed (see paragraph 43 above) and how they may be at risk of sanction for expressing views on trade union concerns as well as on social, economic, and other controversial issues, including local ones, which may be considered by a member of the public as endorsement of a party political line on a particular topic.",

Further, the severity of the restrictions was not mitigated by the role of the adjudicator (see paragraph 32 above). In the first place, category one officers such as Mr Bentley and Mr Brough were not entitled to exemption. Secondly, whether or not the adjudicator exempted an officer in the second and third categories was to a large extent determined by the opinion of the local authority employer who has put the officer’s post on the list of politically restricted posts, as was shown by Mr Ahmed’s experience (see paragraph 14 above)."

The Government did not deny that the political impartiality of the applicants had never been called into question as a result of their participation in political activities.

In the Commission’s view, there had never been any suggestion that the applicants’ professionalism and impartiality had been compromised by their pursuit of political activities.

In so doing it must also have regard to the fact that whenever the right to freedom of expression of public servants such as the applicants is in issue the “duties and responsibilities” referred to in Article 10 § 2 assume a special significance, which justifies leaving to the authorities of the respondent State a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate to the aim as stated (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Vogt judgment, p. 26, § 53)."

It is to be observed at the outset that the Widdicombe Committee reported back to the government at the time that it had found specific instances of abuse of power by certain local government officers. The Committee was concerned both about the impact which the increase in confrontational politics in local government affairs would have on the maintenance of the long-standing tradition of political neutrality of senior officers whose advice and guidance were relied on by the members elected to local councils as well as about the increased potential for more widespread abuse by senior officers of their key positions in a changed political context. Those concerns emerged from the Committee’s detailed analysis of the state of local government at the time and its wide-ranging rounds of consultations with interested parties (see paragraph 23 above). There was a consensus among those consulted on the need for action to strengthen the tradition of political neutrality either through legislation or modification of the terms and conditions of officers’ contracts of employment (see paragraphs 8–10 above).",

The adoption of the Regulations restricting the participation of certain categories of local government officers, distinguished by the sensitivity of their duties, in forms of political activity can be considered a valid response by the legislature to addressing that need and one which was within the respondent State’s margin of appreciation. It is to be observed in this regard that the organisation of local democracy and the arrangements for securing the functioning, funding and accountability of local authorities are matters which can vary from State to State having regard to national traditions. Such is no doubt also the case with respect to the regulation of the political activities of local government officers where these are perceived to present a risk to the effective operation of local democracy, especially so where, as in the respondent State, the system is historically based on the role of a permanent corps of politically neutral advisers, managers and arbitrators above factional politics and loyal to the council as a whole."

As to whether the aim of the legislature in enacting the Regulations was pursued with minimum impairment of the applicants’ rights under Article 10 the Court notes that the measures were directed at the need to preserve the impartiality of carefully defined categories of officers whose duties involve the provision of advice to a local authority council or to its operational committees or who represent the council in dealings with the media. In the Court’s view, the parent legislation has attempted to define the officers affected by the restrictions in as focused a manner as possible and to allow through the exemption procedure optimum opportunity for an officer in either the second or third categories to seek exemption from the restrictions which, by the nature of the duties performed, are presumed to attach to the post-holder (cf. the above-mentioned Vogt judgment, p. 28, § 59). It is to be observed also that the functions-based approach retained in the Regulations resulted in fewer officers being subject to restrictions than would have been the case had the measures been modelled on the Widdicombe Committee’s proposal to apply them to principal officers and above as a general class and irrespective of the duties performed (see paragraph 10 above).",
                "It is also to be recalled that the requirement of political neutrality owed by the officers such as the applicants to the council members extends also to the members of the local electorate given that they have cast their votes to enable the political complexion of the council to reflect their view of what policies are best suited to their area (see paragraph 53 above). Hence, it is equally in their interests that officers with influence in the day-to-day running of local government business do not engage in activities which may be wrongly interpreted not only by council members but also by the public as impairing that process. For this reason, the restrictions imposed by the Schedule to the Regulations can reasonably constitute a justified response to the maintenance of the impartiality of officers such as the applicants.",
                "It is also to be noted that paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Schedule to the Regulations were not designed to silence all comment on political matters, whether controversial or not. The Court reiterates in this respect that the vice which they are intended to avoid is comment of a partisan nature which judged reasonably can be considered as espousing or opposing a party political view (see paragraph 33 above). The same conclusion can be drawn in respect of the restrictions which are imposed on the activities of officers by reason of their membership of political parties. As with speech and writing of a partisan nature, paragraph 4 of Part I of the Schedule (see paragraph 33 above) is directed at precluding participation in only those types of activity which, on account of their visibility, would be likely to link a politically restricted post-holder in the eyes of the public or council members with a particular party political line. There is no restriction on the applicants’ rights to join a political party or to engage in activities within that party other than the limited restrictions identified by paragraph 4 of the Schedule.",
                "For the Court, the reasons advanced by the respondent State to justify the restrictions contained in Parts I and II of the Schedule may be considered both relevant and sufficient. Further, those restrictions apply in such a way as to make an appropriate distinction between the duties and responsibilities which the applicants owed to their local authorities and the pursuit by them of their own personal activities (cf. the above-mentioned Vogt judgment, p. 28, § 59). The Court also notes in this context that the current government since coming to office have conducted a review of the restrictions introduced when they were in opposition. That review has shown that the maintenance in force of the restrictions continues to be justified (see paragraph 34 above)."
