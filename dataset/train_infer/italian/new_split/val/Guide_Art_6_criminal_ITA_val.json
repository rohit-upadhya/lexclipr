The principles and standards applicable to criminal proceedings must therefore be laid down with particular clarity and precision. Lastly, whereas in civil proceedings the rights of one party may conflict with the rights of the other party, no such considerations stand in the way of measures taken in favour of persons who have been accused, charged or convicted, notwithstanding the rights which the victims of offences might seek to uphold before the domestic courts.",

The Court of Appeal ’ s re-examination of that question should therefore have comprised a full rehearing of the applicant ...",

                "“ 41. The Court firstly considers that when, as in the instant case, an individual has been convicted after proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, a retrial or the reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation. In that regard, it notes that Article 449 of the Portuguese Code of Criminal Procedure permits the reopening of proceedings at domestic level where the Court has found a violation of a person ’ s fundamental rights and freedoms. However, the specific remedial measures, if any, required of a respondent State in order to discharge its obligations under the Convention must depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case and be determined in the light of the terms of the Court ’ s judgment in that case ( see Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 210, ECHR 2005-IV, and Panasenko v. Portugal, no. 10418/03, § 78, 22 July 2008). In the present case, the only point at issue is the fact that the applicant was not given a hearing by the Court of Appeal.",
                "42. Secondly, the Court notes that in the present case the only applicable basis for an award of just satisfaction lies in the fact that the applicant was not afforded the safeguards of Article 6. In that regard, it does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged, and rejects this claim. The Court cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal would have been if it had examined the applicant at a public hearing ( see Igual Coll v. Spain, no. 37496/04, § 51, 10 March 2009). On the other hand, it considers it appropriate to award the applicant EUR 2, 400 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. ”",

On the other hand, the procedure followed by the Court of Appeal in holding the hearing at the close of which the appeal was determined was incompatible with what the European Court has deemed vital in order to guarantee the rights of the defence.",

In the light of Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 of the Committee of Ministers, it held that the reopening of proceedings was necessary “ where a decision of the European Court of Human Rights had concluded that a domestic judgment was contrary to the Convention or where there had been procedural errors or shortcomings of such gravity as to cast serious doubt on the decision ( fortes dúvidas sobre a decisão ) adopted at the close of the proceedings, and, simultaneously, where the injured party continued to suffer very serious adverse effects as a result of the national decision, those effects could not be remedied by the just satisfaction awarded by the Court and restitutio in integrum could only be achieved by means of a retrial or the reopening of the proceedings ”.",

At this stage of the proceedings, the Supreme Court ’ s sole task – I repeat – is to determine whether this formal condition for granting a review is present. It will be for the body conducting the review to deliver a new judgment (Articles 460 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure) entailing the execution of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights.”"

Examples of situations aimed at under item (a) are criminal convictions violating Article 10 because the statements characterised as criminal by the national authorities constitute legitimate exercise of the injured party ’ s freedom of expression or violating Article 9 because the behaviour characterised as criminal is a legitimate exercise of freedom of religion. Examples of situations aimed at under item (b) are where the injured party did not have the time and facilities to prepare his or her defence in criminal proceedings, where the conviction was based on statements extracted under torture or on material which the injured party had no possibility of verifying, or where in civil proceedings the parties were not treated with due respect for the principle of equality of arms.

The principles set out by the Court in those judgments and that decision may be summarised as follows :",
                "( a) Findings of a violation in its judgments are essentially declaratory and, by Article 46 of the Convention, the High Contracting Parties undertook to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they were parties, execution being supervised by the Committee of Ministers ( see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz ( VgT ) (no. 2), cited above, § 6 1 ).",
                "( b) The Committee of Ministers ’ role in this sphere does not mean, however, that measures taken by a respondent State to remedy a violation found by the Court cannot raise a new issue undecided by the judgment and, as such, form the subject of a new application that may be dealt with by the Court. In other words, the Court may entertain a complaint that a retrial at domestic level by way of implementation of one of its judgments gave rise to a new breach of the Convention ( ibid, § 62; see also Bochan (no. 2), cited above, § 33, and Egmez, cited above, § 51).",
                "( c) On that basis, the Court has found that it had the competence to entertain complaints in a number of follow-up cases, for example where the domestic authorities had carried out a fresh examination of the case by way of implementation of one of the Court ’ s judgments, whether by reopening the proceedings or by initiating an entirely new set of proceedings ( see Egmez, cited above, § 52, and the references therein ).",
                "( d) It transpires from the Court ’ s case-law that the determination of the existence of a “new issue” very much depends on the specific circumstances of a given case and that distinctions between cases are not always clear-cut ( see Bochan (no. 2), cited above, § 34, and, for an examination of that case-law, Egmez, cited above, § 54). The powers assigned to the Committee of Ministers by Article 46 to supervise the execution of the Court ’ s judgments and assess the implementation of measures adopted by States under that Article are not encroached on where the Court has to deal with relevant new information in the context of a fresh application ( see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz ( VgT ) (no. 2), cited above, § 67)."

Nevertheless, as stated in Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 of the Committee of Ministers, the practice of the Committee of Ministers in supervising the execution of the Court ’ s judgments shows that in exceptional circumstances the re-examination of a case or the reopening of proceedings has proved the most efficient, if not the only, means of achieving restitutio in integrum, that is to say ensuring that the injured party is restored, as far as possible, to the situation which he or she enjoyed prior to the violation of the Convention.

For example, in the specific context of cases concerning the independence and impartiality of the Turkish national security courts, the Court has held that, in principle, the most appropriate form of redress would be for the applicant to be given a retrial by an independent and impartial tribunal (see Gençel v.

The respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its obligation to put the applicant, as far as possible, in the position he would have been in had the requirements of the Convention not been disregarded, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment and with the rights of the defence."

The Court reiterates that in Bochan (no. 2) ( cited above ) it considered the issue of the applicability of Article 6 to remedies concerning the reopening of civil proceedings which had been concluded by final judicial decisions. The principles set out by the Court in that case may be summarised as follows :",
                "( a) According to long - standing and established case-law, the Convention does not guarantee a right to have a terminated case reopened. Extraordinary remedies by which the reopening of terminated judicial proceedings may be sought do not normally involve the determination of “civil rights and obligations” or of “any criminal charge” and therefore Article 6 is deemed inapplicable to them. This approach has also been followed in cases where the reopening of terminated domestic judicial proceedings has been sought on the ground of a finding by the Court of a violation of the Convention ( ibid ., §§ 44 ‑ 45, with the references therein).",
                "( b ) However, should an extraordinary remedy lead automatically or in the specific circumstances to a full reconsideration of the case, Article 6 applies in the usual way to the “reconsideration” proceedings. Moreover, Article 6 has also been found to be applicable in certain instances where the proceedings, although characterised as “extraordinary” or “exceptional” in domestic law, were deemed to be similar in nature and scope to ordinary appeal proceedings, the national characterisation of the proceedings not being regarded as decisive for the issue of applicability ( ibid ., §§ 46-47).",
                "( c) In sum, while Article 6 § 1 is not normally applicable to extraordinary remedies by which the reopening of terminated judicial proceedings may be sought, the nature, scope and specific features of the relevant procedure in the legal system concerned may be such as to bring the procedure within the ambit of Article 6 § 1 and of the safeguards of a fair trial which that provision affords to litigants ( ibid ., § 50)."

As regards criminal proceedings, the Court has found that Article 6 is not applicable to applications for their reopening, given that a person who, having been convicted with final effect, submits such an application is not “ charged with a criminal offence ” within the meaning of that Article. Likewise, Article 6 is not applicable to a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law, brought with the aim of quashing a final conviction following a finding by the Court of a violation, as the person concerned is likewise not “ charged with a criminal offence ” in such proceedings (see, for example, Fischer v. Austria ( dec. ), no. 27569/02, ECHR 2003 -VI, and Öcalan v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 5980/07, 6 July 2010)."

            [
                "62. Still in the criminal-law sphere, the Court has held that the requirements of legal certainty are not absolute. Considerations such as the emergence of new facts, the discovery of a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings that could affect the outcome of the case, or the need to afford redress, particularly in the context of the execution of the Court ’ s judgments, all militate in favour of the reopening of proceedings. Accordingly, the Court has held that the mere possibility of reopening a criminal case is prima facie compatible with the Convention (see Nikitin v. Russia, no. 50178/99, §§ 55-57, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII). However, it has emphasised that higher courts ’ power of review should only be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, and not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Bujniţa v. Moldova, no. 36492/02, § 20, 16 January 2007, and Bota v. Romania, no. 16382/03, § § 33 and 34, 4 November 2008 )."

Similarly, the Court has found that the upholding, after review proceedings, of a conviction which breached the right to a fair trial amounted to an error of assessment which perpetuated that breach (see Yaremenko v. Ukraine (no. 2), no. 66338/09, §§ 52-56 and 64-67, 30 April 2015). On the other hand, the arbitrary reopening of criminal proceedings, in particular to the detriment of a convicted person, infringes the right to a fair trial (see Savinskiy v. Ukraine, no. 6965/02, § 25, 28 February 2006; Radchikov v. Russia, no. 65582/01, § 48, 24 May 2007; and Ştefan v. Romania, no. 28319/03, § 18, 6 April 2010)."

The Court has also considered other stages in criminal proceedings where the applicants were no longer “persons charged with a criminal offence” but persons “convicted ” as a result of judicial decisions deemed final under domestic law. Given that “criminal charge” is an autonomous notion and having regard to the impact which the procedure for examining an appeal on points of law may have upon the determination of a criminal charge, including the possibility of correcting errors of law, the Court has found that such a procedure is covered by the safeguards of Article 6 (see Meftah and Others v. France [GC], nos. 32911/96, 35237/97 and 34595/97, § 40, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII), even where it is treated as an extraordinary remedy in domestic law and concerns a judgment against which no ordinary appeal lies. By the same token, the Court has held that the safeguards of Article 6 are applicable to criminal proceedings in which the competent court began by examining the admissibility of an application for leave to appeal with a view to having a conviction quashed (see Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 54, Series A no. 115)."

In the present case, it notes that domestic law, in particular Article 449 § 1 (g) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, provided the applicant with a remedy entailing the possibility of a review, in adversarial proceedings, of the compatibility of her conviction by the Court of Appeal with the Court ’ s findings in its 2011 judgment ( compare Bochan (no. 2), cited above, § 5 4 )."

They relate either to the emergence of new material or to breaches of substantive or procedural rules. In the latter eventuality, the Supreme Court must adjudicate on the conformity with substantive law of the decision delivered or on the lawfulness of the procedure followed, and decide whether or not the defects noted justify reopening the proceedings.",
                "In particular, in the context of the examination provided for in Article 449 § 1 (g) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Supreme Court ’ s task is to consider the conduct and the outcome of the terminated domestic proceedings in relation to the findings of the Court or of another international authority and, where appropriate, order the re-examination of the case with a view to securing a fresh determination of the criminal charge against the injured party. Furthermore, under Article 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Supreme Court may, if it decides to grant a review, suspend the execution of the sentence or security measure should it deem this necessary.",

The examination on the basis of Article 449 § 1 (g) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is therefore likely to be decisive for the determination of a criminal charge, and in that respect has some features in common with an appeal on points of law ( compare Maresti v.

The principles set forth by the Court in that case may be summarised as follows.",
                "( a) It is not for the Court to deal with alleged errors of law or fact committed by the national courts unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention, for instance where, in exceptional cases, such errors may be said to constitute “unfairness” incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention (ibid. , § 61).",
                "( b) Article 6 § 1 of the Convention does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way in which evidence should be assessed, these being primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts. Normally, issues such as the weight attached by the national courts to particular items of evidence or to findings or assessments submitted to them for consideration are not for the Court to review. The Court should not act as a fourth - instance body and will therefore not question under Article 6 § 1 the national courts ’ assessment, unless their findings can be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (ibid., § 61; see also the cases cited therein: Dulaurans v. France, no. 34553/97, §§ 33-34 and 38, 21 March 2000; Khamidov v. Russia, no. 72118/01, § 170, 15 November 2007; and Anđelković v.

                "84. The Court also reiterates that according to its established case-law reflecting a principle linked to the proper administration of justice, judgments of courts and tribunals should adequately state the reasons on which they are based. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case ( see García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 26, ECHR 1999 ‑ I). Without requiring a detailed answer to every argument advanced by the complainant, this obligation presupposes that parties to judicial proceedings can expect to receive a specific and explicit reply to the arguments which are decisive for the outcome of those proceedings ( see, among other authorities, Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 1994, §§ 29-30, Series A no. 303 ‑ A, and Higgins and Others v. France, 19 February 1998, §§ 42-43, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I). Moreover, in cases relating to interference with rights secured under the Convention, the Court seeks to establish whether the reasons provided for decisions given by the domestic courts are automatic or stereotypical ( see, mutatis mutandis, Paradiso and Campanelli v. Italy [GC], no. 25358/12, § 210, ECHR 2017). Furthermore, the Convention does not require jurors to give reasons for their decision and Article 6 does not preclude a defendant from being tried by a lay jury even where reasons are not given for the verdict. Nevertheless, for the requirements of a fair trial to be satisfied, the public, and above all the accused, must be able to understand the verdict that has been given ( see Lhermitte v. Belgium [GC], no. 34238/09, § § 66 and 67, ECHR 2016 ).",

In addition, the third criterion had not been met.

Russia, (dec.), 29 January 2004, no. 31697/03, with further references). Consequently, it is irrelevant whether or not the applicant raised his arguments in a supervisory review appeal."

Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 158, ECHR-XI). The impugned ruling concerned only the applicant ’ s detention pending trial. Therefore, an appeal directed against that ruling would have been limited to matters of detention. By contrast, the thrust of the applicant ’ s complaint before the court of appeal in Russia and before the Court was quite different : he attacked the judgment as a whole, claiming that the outcome of the trial had been predetermined. The ruling of 30 November 2001, therefore, was not a separate object of appeal but a proof of the bias of the trial court. The Court concludes that the avenue indicated by the Government was not capable of “providing adequate redress” for the applicant ’ s grievance under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The Government did not claim that the issue of the alleged partiality should have been raised by the applicant earlier, at the trial stage.

Personal impartiality is presumed unless there is evidence to the contrary” (see Padovani v. Italy, 26 February 1993, § 26, Series A no. 257 B, and Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 30, ECHR 2000 X). The Court may also employ an objective approach, that is, determine whether the judge offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of his impartiality (see Piersack v. Belgium, 1 October 1982, § 30, Series A no. 53, and Grieves v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 57067/00, § 69, ECHR 2003-XII). The Court is mindful that there is no watertight division between the two notions, and that the same act or statement by a judge may be analysed through the prism of a “subjective” or “objective” test (see Olujić v. Croatia, no. 22330/05, §§ 57 et seq., 5 February 2009). The Court further reiterates that “in maintaining confidence in the ... impartiality of a tribunal, appearances may be important” ( Brudnicka and Others v. Poland, no. 54723/00, § 41, ECHR 2005 II). Finally, the Court has always stressed the importance of “national procedures for ensuring impartiality” which are directed, inter alia, “at removing any appearance of partiality and so serve to promote the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public” (see Mežnarić v. Croatia, no. 71615/01, § 27, 15 July 2005, and Huseyn and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 3 5485/05, 45553/05, 35680/05 and 36085/05, § 162, 26 July 2011)."

It is perfectly normal that a judge may consider and dismiss an application for release lodged by a detained defendant. In doing so the judge is required, under both the Convention and the domestic law, to establish the existence of a “reasonable suspicion” against the defendant. The mere fact that a trial judge has already taken pre-trial decisions in the case, including decisions relating to detention, cannot in itself justify fears as to his impartiality; only special circumstances may warrant a different conclusion (see Hauschildt v. Denmark, 24 May 1989, § 51, Series A no. 154, and Sainte-Marie v. France, no. 12981/87, § 32, 16 December 1992). That being said, while deciding on an application for release lodged by a defendant, the court must not assess whether or not the defendant is guilty (see Gultyayeva v. Russia, no. 67413/01, § 197, 1 April 2010). The court ’ s role is limited to establishing the state of suspicion, which may be insufficient to prove the defendant ’ s guilt beyond reasonable doubt, but which connects the defendant, his actions, whereabouts, and so on, to the actus reus of the case. “Suspicion and formal finding of guilt are not to be treated as being the same” ( Jasiński v.

In the proceedings against his co-accused C1, C2, C3 and C4 the Regional Court had included the same president, X, and senior judge ( oudste rechter ), Y, who were to sit on the bench that would deal with his case.

X and Y did not stand down, and on the day of the hearing a formal challenge application ( wrakingsverzoek ) was lodged on behalf of the applicant. The Challenge Chamber ( wrakingskamer ) dismissed the application, considering that the mere fact that two members of the trial chamber had convicted a number of co-accused of offences relating to the offences with which the applicant had been charged did not as such entail that those members were biased in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. According to the Challenge Chamber, the arguments adduced by counsel for the applicant did not admit of the conclusion that the judges concerned had already formed an opinion on any role which the applicant might have played in the commission of those offences, and neither did they reveal any extraordinary circumstances indicating bias against the applicant on the part of those judges or indicating that the applicant ’ s fear of bias was objectively justified."

The Court considers that the work of criminal courts would be rendered impossible if, by that fact alone, a judge ’ s impartiality could be called into question. However, in proceedings originating in an individual application the Court has to confine itself, as far as possible, to an examination of the concrete case before it. Moreover, the Court reiterates that the Contracting States are under the obligation to organise their legal systems so as to ensure compliance with the requirements of Article 6 § 1, impartiality being unquestionably one of the foremost of those requirements.

In this respect even appearances are of importance since justice must not just be done but must be seen to be done. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public. This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the perception of the accused is important but not decisive.

There is no specific qualification of the involvement of the applicant or of acts committed by him, criminal or otherwise.

The mere fact that experts are employed by one of the parties does not suffice to render the proceedings unfair. Although this fact may give rise to apprehensions as to the neutrality of the experts, such apprehensions, while having a certain importance, are not decisive. The requirements of impartiality and independence enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention do not apply to experts. What is decisive, however, is the position occupied by the experts throughout the proceedings, the manner in which they performed their functions and the way the judges assessed the expert opinion (see Zarb v. Malta (dec.), no. 16631/04, 27 September 2005, and Lasmane v. Latvia (dec.), no. 43293/98, 6 June 2002). In ascertaining the expert ’ s procedural position and his role in the proceedings, one must not lose sight of the fact that the opinion given by a court-appointed expert is likely to carry significant weight in the court ’ s assessment of the issues within that expert ’ s competence (see Sara Lind Eggertsdóttir v.

The Court is therefore convinced that there was reliable and objective medical evidence showing that the applicant was of unsound mind.

The order of 16 February 1999 was provisional in nature and was not attended by procedural guarantees. In particular, it was issued by a court without hearing the applicant or her representative. Its validity was limited to five days and its aim was to allow a period of time for the court to prepare for a hearing and an in-depth examination of the hospital ’ s application with the participation of both parties. It could therefore serve as a basis for the applicant ’ s detention only for five days after it had been issued. The Government did not point to any legal provision which permitted the applicant ’ s detention after its expiry. It follows that the applicant ’ s detention after the expiry of the five-day time-limit established in section 34 of the Psychiatric Treatment Act and until 26 March 1999 did not have a legal basis in domestic law. This conclusion is supported by the prosecutor ’ s letter of 1 February 2000 acknowledging that the applicant ’ s detention from 16 to 26 March 1999 had been unlawful (see paragraph 16 above)."

As to the Government ’ s argument that the application for confinement could not be examined due to the applicant ’ s serious mental condition, which prevented her from participating in the hearing or appointing a representative, the Court notes that the Psychiatric Treatment Act envisaged situations where a person was too ill to participate in the hearing. It did not permit the courts to adjourn the hearing indefinitely, as was done in the applicant ’ s case, but required them to provide for a representative and to hold a hearing on the hospital premises (see paragraph 31 above). The domestic authorities did not comply with the procedure prescribed by the Psychiatric Treatment Act."

In the Government ’ s opinion, the mere fact that the experts who had given the expert opinion of 30 July 2002 had been employees of the hospital where the applicant had received treatment had not violated the principle of equality of arms. The panel had not included any of the experts who had examined the applicant on 12 February 1999. Moreover, the expert report of 30 July 2002 had not been the only piece of evidence before the court.

Thus, in the Aerts v. Belgium case the applicant had been detained under Article 5 § 1 (e) as a person of unsound mind. Following his release, he instituted proceedings to review the lawfulness of his detention and sought compensation. The Court found that Article 6 § 1 applied under its civil head to the proceedings because “the right to liberty is a civil right” (see Aerts v. Belgium, judgment of 30 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ V, § 59). In two subsequent cases, which also concerned proceedings relating to the lawfulness of detention in psychiatric institutions, the Court found Article 6 to be applicable under its civil head with reference to the Aerts judgment. It dismissed the Government ’ s objection of incompatibility ratione materiae despite the fact that the proceedings at issue concerned only the lawfulness of the detention without involving any related pecuniary claims (see Vermeersch v. France (dec.), no. 39277 /98, 30 January 2001, and Laidin v. France (no. 2), no. 39282/98, § § 73-76, 7 January 2003 )."

Therefore, her civil right to liberty was at stake. In addition, she sought compensation for unlawful detention. The Court reiterates in this respect that the right to compensation is, by its very nature, of a civil character even where derived from public law (see Georgiadis v. Greece, judgment of 29 May 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ III, § 35, where the claims for compensation for unlawful detention were found to be civil in nature).

                "62. The Court reiterates that the appointment of experts is relevant in assessing whether the principle of equality of arms has been complied with. The mere fact that experts are employed by one of the parties does not suffice to render the proceedings unfair. Although this fact may give rise to apprehensions as to the neutrality of the experts, such apprehensions, while having a certain importance, are not decisive. The requirements of impartiality and independence enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention do not apply to experts. What is decisive, however, is the position occupied by the experts throughout the proceedings, the manner in which they performed their functions and the way the judges assessed the expert opinion (see Zarb v. Malta (dec.), no. 16631/04, 27 September 2005, and Lasmane v. Latvia (dec.), no. 43293/98, 6 June 2002). In ascertaining the expert ’ s procedural position and his role in the proceedings, one must not lose sight of the fact that the opinion given by a court-appointed expert is likely to carry significant weight in the court ’ s assessment of the issues within that expert ’ s competence (see Sara Lind Eggertsdóttir v. Iceland, no. 31930/04, § 47, ECHR 2007 ‑ ..., and Bönisch v. Austria, 6 May 1985, § 33, Series A no. 92 )."

She contested the diagnosis given by the hospital psychiatrists and their findings as to the necessity of her confinement. The domestic courts appointed the psychiatrists employed by the same hospital as experts instructed to assess the correctness of their colleagues ’ findings. The court subsequently relied on their opinion when rejecting the applicant ’ s claim."

            [
                "64. The Court has already examined a similar situation in the case of Sara Lind Eggertsdóttir v. Iceland ( cited above). In that case the applicant sued a hospital for medical negligence. The court ordered an expert examination, asking the employees of that hospital to assess the performance of their colleagues and determine whether they had been medically negligent in their treatment of the applicant. When rejecting the applicant ’ s claim, the court relied on the experts ’ finding that their colleagues had not been negligent. The Court found a violation of Article 6 § 1 on account of non-compliance with the principle of equality of arms. It took account of three factors : the nature of the task entrusted to the experts, the experts ’ hierarchical position in the respondent hospital, and their role in the proceedings, in particular the weight attached by the court to their opinion. As to the first factor, the Court observed that the experts were called upon to assist the court in determining the question of their employer ’ s liability. As to the second factor, the Court noted that the experts ’ superiors had taken a clear stance on the issue by denying the hospital ’ s responsibility. This fact could justifiably give rise to the fear that the experts would be unable to act with proper neutrality. As to the third factor, the Court found that the opinion given by the experts was decisive evidence in the proceedings. It concluded that as a result of the appointment of the respondent ’ s employees as experts who played a dominant role in the proceedings, the applicant ’ s position had not been on a par with that of the respondent hospital in the manner required by the principle of equality of arms (see Sara Lind Eggertsdóttir, cited above, §§ 47-55)."

            [
                "65. A similar situation obtains in the present case. Indeed, the experts appointed by the court were employees of the respondent hospital and owed a general duty of obedience and loyalty to their employer. They were asked to assess the accuracy of the diagnosis given by their colleagues and to review their finding as to the necessity of the applicant ’ s involuntary confinement. They were thereby required to analyse the performance of their colleagues with the view to assisting the court in the determination of their employer ’ s liability. Given that the hospital ’ s representative had clearly expressed the hospital ’ s position that the medical findings in the applicant ’ s case had been correct and that the applicant ’ s claims had been unfounded, the applicant ’ s apprehension as to the experts ’ neutrality can be considered as objectively justified."

            [

As regards the experts ’ role in the proceedings, the Court observes that the main issue in the case was whether the findings of the medical panels of 10 and 12 February 1999 as to the necessity of the applicant ’ s involuntary confinement had been correct. As the applicant contested those findings, the court appointed experts to review them. Having no medical qualifications, the judges of the court were bound to attach significant weight to the experts ’ opinion on the medical issue decisive for the outcome of the case. Indeed, the experts ’ opinion was the only evidence confirming the accuracy of the diagnosis made on 10 and 12 February 1999. It follows that the experts played a dominant role in the proceedings."

Accordingly, there were no obstacles to finding independent experts (see, by contrast, Zarb, decision cited above, and Emmanuello v. Italy (dec.), no. 35791/97, 31 August 1999)."

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest.

Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Rowe and Davis, cited above, § 61, with references to the above-cited cases of Doorson and Van Mechelen )."

The Court is of the opinion that in the present case the thrust of the applicant ’ s complaints in the domestic proceedings and before this Court was not directed against the investigative organs ’ activities as such, as he did not challenge their activities in the context of, for example, his right to respect for his private life. Rather, he complained of the lack of a fair trial on account of the review of the lawfulness of the surveillance activities (whether they were conducted in accordance with the authorisations ) and about the parties ’ equal access to the information gathered in the course of the application of the surveillance measures."

The Court notes that the County Court took steps to remedy the situation when it granted the applicant ’ s access requests. Furthermore, neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeal suggested that the applicant should have challenged any decisions of the prosecutor or the police. Instead, the courts analysed the lawfulness of the surveillance activities and the question of whether the applicant should have had access to the materials of the surveillance file was addressed, rather than dismissed on procedural grounds."

In his submission, access to the surveillance information had been required, firstly, since the defence wished to make its own choice of evidence to be relied on in the criminal proceedings, in addition to the choice made by the prosecutor. Secondly, access to the surveillance information would have allowed the defence to assess whether it had been obtained lawfully, that is to challenge the admissibility of the evidence adduced by the prosecution."

Furthermore, during the applicant ’ s trial the County Court had examined these authorisations, as well as the conformity of the actual surveillance activities to the authorisations. In the Government ’ s submission, the conclusions of the trial court had been recorded in the records of the court hearings of 12 February and 15 October 2007 and in the judgments. The fact that the court had examined the contents of the surveillance file was also proved by its statement in the record of the hearing that no surveillance activities had been carried out on the basis of the authorisation dated 9 June 2005."

In respect of the restrictions on access to the surveillance file, the Government considered that surveillance was secret by its nature and it would lose its utility if all the information in a surveillance file, including about the persons participating in surveillance, came to be disclosed. Certain information was protected as a State secret pursuant to the State Secrets Act; however, as a balancing measure, judges had access to such information. In the Government ’ s view, the judicial review of surveillance authorisations and the activities performed on the basis of them should be considered as adequate review, as it guaranteed the protection of the rights of the accused, on the one hand, and the secrecy of surveillance, on the other. In the present case, the judge of the County Court had examined the whole surveillance file. Therefore, it had been guaranteed that the file had not contained evidence vindicating the applicant which the prosecutor could have concealed. The Government also noted that the applicant had failed to explain exactly what he wanted to prove by the undisclosed materials of the surveillance file or exactly what materials he wanted to obtain from that file."

In the circumstances of the case, it finds it unnecessary to examine the applicant ’ s allegations separately from the standpoint of paragraph 3 (b), since they amount to a complaint that he did not receive a fair trial. It will therefore confine its examination to the question of whether the proceedings in their entirety were fair (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16 December 1992, §§ 33-34, Series A no. 247 ‑ B, and Rowe and Davis v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28901/95, § 59, ECHR 2000 ‑ II )."

It is a fundamental aspect of the right to a fair trial that criminal proceedings, including the elements of such proceedings which relate to procedure, should be adversarial and that there should be equality of arms between the prosecution and defence. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party ( Brandstetter v. Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66-67, Series A no. 211). In addition, Article 6 § 1 requires that the prosecution authorities disclose to the defence all material evidence in their possession for or against the accused (see, mutatis mutandis, Rowe and Davis, cited above, § 60 )."
            ],
            [
                "78. However, the entitlement to disclosure of relevant evidence is not an absolute right. In any criminal proceedings there may be competing interests, such as national security or the need to protect witnesses at risk of reprisals or keep secret police methods of investigation of crime, which must be weighed against the rights of the accused ( Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, § 70, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ II ). In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 § 1 (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 58, Reports 1997 ‑ III ). Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Rowe and Davis, cited above, § 61, with references to the above-cited cases of Doorson and Van Mechelen )."

                "79. In cases where evidence has been withheld from the defence on public interest grounds, it is not the role of this Court to decide whether or not such non-disclosure was strictly necessary since, as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them (see Edwards, cited above, § 34). In any event, in many cases, such as the present one, where the evidence in question has never been revealed, it would not be possible for the Court to attempt to weigh the public interest in non-disclosure against that of the accused in having sight of the material. It must therefore scrutinise the decision-making procedure to ensure that, as far as possible, it complied with the requirements to provide adversarial proceedings and equality of arms and incorporated adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the accused (see Fitt v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29777/96, § 46, ECHR 2000 ‑ II, and Jasper v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27052/95, § 53, 16 February 2000)."

More specifically, Article 6 § 3 (b) guarantees the accused “adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence” and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on his behalf may comprise everything which is “necessary” to prepare the main trial. The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the possibility to put all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings ( see Connolly v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 27245/95, 26 June 1996, and Moiseyev v. Russia, no. 62936/00, § 220, 9 October 2008 ). Furthermore, the facilities which should be enjoyed by everyone charged with a criminal offence include the opportunity to acquaint himself, for the purposes of preparing his defence, with the results of investigations carried out throughout the proceedings (see C.G.P. v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29835/96, 15 January 1997, and Foucher v. France, 18 March 1997, §§ 26 ‑ 38, Reports 1997 ‑ II). The issue of adequacy of time and facilities afforded to an accused must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of each particular case (see Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § 84, 15 November 2007, and Dolenec v. Croatia, no. 25282/06, § 208, 26 November 2009 )."

The accused may, however, be expected to give specific reasons for his request (see Bendenoun v. France, 24 February 1994, § 52, Series A no. 284 ) and the domestic courts are entitled to examine the validity of these reasons (see C.G.P., cited above; Natunen v.

Firstly, he sought to establish whether the use of the surveillance measures had been lawful and, secondly, he argued that the principle of the equality of arms had required that he had the same opportunity as the prosecution to choose evidence from the surveillance file. Furthermore, it transpires from the applicant ’ s arguments that he had certain concerns as to whether L. had in fact received instructions from the police, which would have amounted to unlawful surveillance and could have resulted in parts of the evidence being inadmissible."

The County Court ’ s and the Court of Appeal ’ s judgments do not add much clarity to this matter. Furthermore, the Court notes that the domestic courts gave no clear reasons as to why it had been acceptable for the applicant to have been denied access to the undisclosed information in the surveillance file. Indeed, the Court recalls that the County Court initially authorised such access – an authorisation which was not fully complied with by the police – whereas the Court of Appeal in its judgment, on the one hand, considered that there was no reason to overload the criminal case file with irrelevant information, and, on the other hand, referred to the secrecy of the surveillance materials. However, the Court considers that these observations by the Court of Appeal were of a general nature, as it does not appear and it has not been argued that the appellate court itself examined the surveillance file."

The Court finds that the present case is different from, for example, the above-cited cases of Fitt and Jasper, where the Court was satisfied that the defence were kept informed and were permitted to make submissions and participate in the decision-making process as far as possible and noted that the need for disclosure was at all times under the assessment of the trial judge, providing a further, important, safeguard. In those cases the Court found no violation under Article 6 § 1. In the present case, in contrast, the applicant only retroactively learned from the prosecutor that the County Court had examined the surveillance materials. Moreover, he was neither informed of the reasons for non-disclosure nor of the nature of the undisclosed materials nor, indeed, of whether the surveillance file did include any undisclosed material evidence. The Court considers that the procedure followed by the judicial authorities in the present case failed to adequately counterbalance the difficulties caused to the defence by its restricted access to the surveillance materials. The defence were not informed in an adequate manner of the County Court ’ s position on why it had been strictly necessary to restrict their rights and they had no possibility of presenting their counterarguments to any such considerations. The Court also takes note, in this regard, of the Supreme Court ’ s subsequent case-law, according to which a trial court, even if it was prevented from disclosing materials in a surveillance file, may disclose its opinion on the lawfulness of the surveillance, which opinion must be recorded in the record of the hearing and, if necessary, in a judgment."

The Court firstly considers that when, as in the instant case, an individual has been convicted after proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, a retrial or the reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation. In that regard, it notes that Article 449 of the Portuguese Code of Criminal Procedure permits the reopening of proceedings at domestic level where the Court has found a violation of a person ’ s fundamental rights and freedoms. However, the specific remedial measures, if any, required of a respondent State in order to discharge its obligations under the Convention must depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case and be determined in the light of the terms of the Court ’ s judgment in that case ( see Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 210, ECHR 2005-IV, and Panasenko v. Portugal, no. 10418/03, § 78, 22 July 2008). In the present case, the only point at issue is the fact that the applicant was not given a hearing by the Court of Appeal.",
                "42. Secondly, the Court notes that in the present case the only applicable basis for an award of just satisfaction lies in the fact that the applicant was not afforded the safeguards of Article 6. In that regard, it does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged, and rejects this claim. The Court cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal would have been if it had examined the applicant at a public hearing ( see Igual Coll v. Spain, no. 37496/04, § 51, 10 March 2009). On the other hand, it considers it appropriate to award the applicant EUR 2, 400 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. ”",

In the light of Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 of the Committee of Ministers, it held that the reopening of proceedings was necessary “ where a decision of the European Court of Human Rights had concluded that a domestic judgment was contrary to the Convention or where there had been procedural errors or shortcomings of such gravity as to cast serious doubt on the decision ( fortes dúvidas sobre a decisão ) adopted at the close of the proceedings, and, simultaneously, where the injured party continued to suffer very serious adverse effects as a result of the national decision, those effects could not be remedied by the just satisfaction awarded by the Court and restitutio in integrum could only be achieved by means of a retrial or the reopening of the proceedings ”.",

At this stage of the proceedings, the Supreme Court ’ s sole task – I repeat – is to determine whether this formal condition for granting a review is present.

Switzerland (no. 2) ([GC], no. 32772/02, ECHR 2009 ) and its decision in Egmez v.

The principles set out by the Court in those judgments and that decision may be summarised as follows :",
                "( a) Findings of a violation in its judgments are essentially declaratory and, by Article 46 of the Convention, the High Contracting Parties undertook to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they were parties, execution being supervised by the Committee of Ministers ( see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz ( VgT ) (no. 2), cited above, § 6 1 ).",
                "( b) The Committee of Ministers ’ role in this sphere does not mean, however, that measures taken by a respondent State to remedy a violation found by the Court cannot raise a new issue undecided by the judgment and, as such, form the subject of a new application that may be dealt with by the Court. In other words, the Court may entertain a complaint that a retrial at domestic level by way of implementation of one of its judgments gave rise to a new breach of the Convention ( ibid, § 62; see also Bochan (no. 2), cited above, § 33, and Egmez, cited above, § 51).",
                "( c) On that basis, the Court has found that it had the competence to entertain complaints in a number of follow-up cases, for example where the domestic authorities had carried out a fresh examination of the case by way of implementation of one of the Court ’ s judgments, whether by reopening the proceedings or by initiating an entirely new set of proceedings ( see Egmez, cited above, § 52, and the references therein ).",
                "( d) It transpires from the Court ’ s case-law that the determination of the existence of a “new issue” very much depends on the specific circumstances of a given case and that distinctions between cases are not always clear-cut ( see Bochan (no. 2), cited above, § 34, and, for an examination of that case-law, Egmez, cited above, § 54). The powers assigned to the Committee of Ministers by Article 46 to supervise the execution of the Court ’ s judgments and assess the implementation of measures adopted by States under that Article are not encroached on where the Court has to deal with relevant new information in the context of a fresh application ( see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz ( VgT ) (no. 2), cited above, § 67)."

Nevertheless, as stated in Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 of the Committee of Ministers, the practice of the Committee of Ministers in supervising the execution of the Court ’ s judgments shows that in exceptional circumstances the re-examination of a case or the reopening of proceedings has proved the most efficient, if not the only, means of achieving restitutio in integrum, that is to say ensuring that the injured party is restored, as far as possible, to the situation which he or she enjoyed prior to the violation of the Convention. Among the cases in which the Court finds a violation, re-examination or reopening will be of particular importance in the field of criminal law, according to the explanatory memorandum to the Recommendation ( see paragraphs 32 and 33 above )."

However, where an individual has been convicted following proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, the Court may indicate that a retrial or the reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation ( see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz ( VgT ) (no. 2), cited above, § 89). For example, in the specific context of cases concerning the independence and impartiality of the Turkish national security courts, the Court has held that, in principle, the most appropriate form of redress would be for the applicant to be given a retrial by an independent and impartial tribunal (see Gençel v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, § 27, 23 October 2003)."

                "( a) Where an individual has been convicted following proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, a retrial or the reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation. However, the specific remedial measures, if any, required of a respondent State in order for it to discharge its obligations under the Convention must depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case and be determined in the light of the Court ’ s judgment in that case, and with due regard to the Court ’ s case-law.",
                "( b) In particular, it is not for the Court to indicate how any new trial is to proceed and what form it is to take. The respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its obligation to put the applicant, as far as possible, in the position he would have been in had the requirements of the Convention not been disregarded, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment and with the rights of the defence."

Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, §§ 202 and 203, ECHR 2004 ‑ II, and Del Río Prada v. Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, §§ 138 and 139, ECHR 2013).

It also observes that in most of those States the reopening of proceedings is not automatic and is subject to admissibility criteria, whose observance is supervised by the domestic courts, which have a broader margin of appreciation in that sphere ( see paragraphs 34 et seq. above )."

That being so, the question whether the procedure for considering the application for review was compatible with the fair - trial standards deriving from Article 6 of the Convention can be examined separately from the aspects relating to the execution of the judgment delivered by the Court in 2011 (see, mutatis mutandis, Bochan (no. 2), cited above, § 37)."

The Court reiterates that in Bochan (no. 2) ( cited above ) it considered the issue of the applicability of Article 6 to remedies concerning the reopening of civil proceedings which had been concluded by final judicial decisions. The principles set out by the Court in that case may be summarised as follows :",
                "( a) According to long - standing and established case-law, the Convention does not guarantee a right to have a terminated case reopened. Extraordinary remedies by which the reopening of terminated judicial proceedings may be sought do not normally involve the determination of “civil rights and obligations” or of “any criminal charge” and therefore Article 6 is deemed inapplicable to them. This approach has also been followed in cases where the reopening of terminated domestic judicial proceedings has been sought on the ground of a finding by the Court of a violation of the Convention ( ibid ., §§ 44 ‑ 45, with the references therein).",
                "( b ) However, should an extraordinary remedy lead automatically or in the specific circumstances to a full reconsideration of the case, Article 6 applies in the usual way to the “reconsideration” proceedings. Moreover, Article 6 has also been found to be applicable in certain instances where the proceedings, although characterised as “extraordinary” or “exceptional” in domestic law, were deemed to be similar in nature and scope to ordinary appeal proceedings, the national characterisation of the proceedings not being regarded as decisive for the issue of applicability ( ibid ., §§ 46-47).",
                "( c) In sum, while Article 6 § 1 is not normally applicable to extraordinary remedies by which the reopening of terminated judicial proceedings may be sought, the nature, scope and specific features of the relevant procedure in the legal system concerned may be such as to bring the procedure within the ambit of Article 6 § 1 and of the safeguards of a fair trial which that provision affords to litigants ( ibid ., § 50)."

            [
                "61. As regards criminal proceedings, the Court has found that Article 6 is not applicable to applications for their reopening, given that a person who, having been convicted with final effect, submits such an application is not “ charged with a criminal offence ” within the meaning of that Article. Likewise, Article 6 is not applicable to a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law, brought with the aim of quashing a final conviction following a finding by the Court of a violation, as the person concerned is likewise not “ charged with a criminal offence ” in such proceedings (see, for example, Fischer v. Austria ( dec. ), no. 27569/02, ECHR 2003 -VI, and Öcalan v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 5980/07, 6 July 2010)."

            [
                "62. Still in the criminal-law sphere, the Court has held that the requirements of legal certainty are not absolute. Considerations such as the emergence of new facts, the discovery of a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings that could affect the outcome of the case, or the need to afford redress, particularly in the context of the execution of the Court ’ s judgments, all militate in favour of the reopening of proceedings. Accordingly, the Court has held that the mere possibility of reopening a criminal case is prima facie compatible with the Convention (see Nikitin v. Russia, no. 50178/99, §§ 55-57, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII). However, it has emphasised that higher courts ’ power of review should only be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, and not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Bujniţa v. Moldova, no. 36492/02, § 20, 16 January 2007, and Bota v. Romania, no. 16382/03, § § 33 and 34, 4 November 2008 )."

Similarly, the Court has found that the upholding, after review proceedings, of a conviction which breached the right to a fair trial amounted to an error of assessment which perpetuated that breach (see Yaremenko v. Ukraine (no. 2), no. 66338/09, §§ 52-56 and 64-67, 30 April 2015). On the other hand, the arbitrary reopening of criminal proceedings, in particular to the detriment of a convicted person, infringes the right to a fair trial (see Savinskiy v. Ukraine, no. 6965/02, § 25, 28 February 2006; Radchikov v. Russia, no. 65582/01, § 48, 24 May 2007; and Ştefan v. Romania, no. 28319/03, § 18, 6 April 2010)."

The Court has also considered other stages in criminal proceedings where the applicants were no longer “persons charged with a criminal offence” but persons “convicted ” as a result of judicial decisions deemed final under domestic law. Given that “criminal charge” is an autonomous notion and having regard to the impact which the procedure for examining an appeal on points of law may have upon the determination of a criminal charge, including the possibility of correcting errors of law, the Court has found that such a procedure is covered by the safeguards of Article 6 (see Meftah and Others v. France [GC], nos. 32911/96, 35237/97 and 34595/97, § 40, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII), even where it is treated as an extraordinary remedy in domestic law and concerns a judgment against which no ordinary appeal lies. By the same token, the Court has held that the safeguards of Article 6 are applicable to criminal proceedings in which the competent court began by examining the admissibility of an application for leave to appeal with a view to having a conviction quashed (see Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 54, Series A no. 115)."

In the latter eventuality, the Supreme Court must adjudicate on the conformity with substantive law of the decision delivered or on the lawfulness of the procedure followed, and decide whether or not the defects noted justify reopening the proceedings.",

A mere doubt as to the validity of a conviction, or a simple procedural irregularity, was therefore an insufficient ground for granting a review, and only defects which had tainted the decision to such an extent as to make it intolerable to society in general could justify reopening the proceedings."

The Court reiterates that in its Bochan (no. 2) judgment ( cited above ) it considered, under the civil head of Article 6 of the Convention, the issue of unfairness resulting from the reasoning adopted by the domestic courts. The principles set forth by the Court in that case may be summarised as follows.",
                "( a) It is not for the Court to deal with alleged errors of law or fact committed by the national courts unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention, for instance where, in exceptional cases, such errors may be said to constitute “unfairness” incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention (ibid. , § 61).",
                "( b) Article 6 § 1 of the Convention does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way in which evidence should be assessed, these being primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts. Normally, issues such as the weight attached by the national courts to particular items of evidence or to findings or assessments submitted to them for consideration are not for the Court to review. The Court should not act as a fourth - instance body and will therefore not question under Article 6 § 1 the national courts ’ assessment, unless their findings can be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (ibid., § 61; see also the cases cited therein: Dulaurans v. France, no. 34553/97, §§ 33-34 and 38, 21 March 2000; Khamidov v. Russia, no. 72118/01, § 170, 15 November 2007; and Anđelković v. Serbia, no. 1401/08, § 24, 9 April 2013; as well as the application of this case-law in more recent judgments: Pavlović and Others v. Croatia, no. 13274/11, § 49, 2 April 2015; Yaremenko (no. 2), cited above, §§ 64 ‑ 67; and Tsanova-Gecheva v. Bulgaria, no. 43800/12, § 91, 15 September 2015)."

                "84. The Court also reiterates that according to its established case-law reflecting a principle linked to the proper administration of justice, judgments of courts and tribunals should adequately state the reasons on which they are based. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case ( see García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 26, ECHR 1999 ‑ I). Without requiring a detailed answer to every argument advanced by the complainant, this obligation presupposes that parties to judicial proceedings can expect to receive a specific and explicit reply to the arguments which are decisive for the outcome of those proceedings ( see, among other authorities, Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 1994, §§ 29-30, Series A no. 303 ‑ A, and Higgins and Others v. France, 19 February 1998, §§ 42-43, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I). Moreover, in cases relating to interference with rights secured under the Convention, the Court seeks to establish whether the reasons provided for decisions given by the domestic courts are automatic or stereotypical ( see, mutatis mutandis, Paradiso and Campanelli v. Italy [GC], no. 25358/12, § 210, ECHR 2017). Furthermore, the Convention does not require jurors to give reasons for their decision and Article 6 does not preclude a defendant from being tried by a lay jury even where reasons are not given for the verdict. Nevertheless, for the requirements of a fair trial to be satisfied, the public, and above all the accused, must be able to understand the verdict that has been given ( see Lhermitte v. Belgium [GC], no. 34238/09, § § 66 and 67, ECHR 2016 ).",

Moreover, the Court reiterates that a finding of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention does not generally create an continuing situation and does not impose on the respondent State a continuing procedural obligation ( contrast Jeronovičs v.

A retrial or the reopening of the proceedings was thus described as an appropriate solution, but not a necessary or exclusive one.

As regards the privilege against self-incrimination or the right to remain silent, the Court reiterates that these are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of a fair procedure. Their aim is to provide an accused person with protection against improper compulsion by the authorities and thus to avoid miscarriages of justice and secure the aims of Article 6 (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, § 45, Reports 1996-I). The right not to incriminate oneself is primarily concerned with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent and presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seeks to prove the case against the accused without resorting to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, §§ 68 ‑ 69, Reports 1996-VI; Allan, cited above, § 44; Jalloh, cited above, §§ 94-117; and O'Halloran and Francis v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 15809/02 and 25624/02, §§ 53-63, ECHR 2007-... ). In examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court must examine the nature and degree of the compulsion, the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures and the use to which any material so obtained is put (see, for example, Heaney and McGuinness v. Ireland, no. 34720/97, §§ 54-55, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and J.B. v. Switzerland, no. 31827/96, ECHR 2001-III)."

The persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but with the lapse of time this no longer suffices and the Court must then establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were “relevant” and “sufficient”, the Court must also be satisfied that the national authorities displayed “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings (see, among other authorities, Letellier v. France, 26 June 1991, § 35, Series A no. 207, and Yağcı and Sargın v. Turkey, 8 June 1995, § 50, Series A no. 319-A).

In this period the courts examined the applicant's application for release at least ten times, each time refusing it on the grounds of the gravity of the charges and the likelihood of his fleeing, obstructing the course of justice and exerting pressure on witnesses. However, the judicial decisions did not go any further than listing these grounds, omitting to substantiate them with relevant and sufficient reasons. The Court also notes that with the passing of time the courts'reasoning did not evolve to reflect the developing situation and to verify whether these grounds remained valid at the advanced stage of the proceedings. Moreover, from 7 September 2001 the decisions extending the applicant's detention no longer indicated any time-limits, thus implying that he would remain in detention until the end of the trial."

It reiterates that where circumstances that could have warranted a person's detention may have existed but were not mentioned in the domestic decisions it is not the Court's task to establish them and to take the place of the national authorities which ruled on the applicant's detention (see Panchenko v.

The first - instance court found that there had been no “intrusion” or breach of the applicant's privacy because of the absence of objections to V.'s entry into the premises and because of the “non-private” purpose of these premises. The prosecutor's office, in addition to that, maintained that the covert operation had been lawful because it had not involved any activity subject to special legal requirements and the police had thus remained within the domain of their own discretion."

The Court observes that the Operational-Search Activities Act is expressly intended to protect individual privacy by requiring judicial authorisation for any operational-search activities that could interfere with it. The Act specifies two types of protected privacy: firstly, privacy of communications by wire or mail services and, secondly, privacy of the home. As regards the latter, the domestic authorities, notably the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow, argued that V.'s entering the “guest house” with the applicant's consent did not constitute an intrusion amounting to interference with the privacy of the applicant's home. As to the question of privacy of communications, it was only addressed as a separate issue in the prosecutor's decision dismissing the applicant's complaint. In his opinion, the applicant's conversation with V. remained outside the scope of protection offered by the Act because it did not involve the use of “wire or mail services”. The same argument was put forward by the Government, who considered that the requirement of judicial authorisation did not extend to the use of the radio ‑ transmitting device and that the covert operation could not therefore be said to have breached domestic law."

The measure was considered to be an investigative step within the domain of the investigating authorities'own discretion."

The Court reiterates that the phrase “in accordance with the law” not only requires compliance with domestic law but also relates to the quality of that law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law. In the context of covert surveillance by public authorities, in this instance the police, domestic law must provide protection against arbitrary interference with an individual's right under Article 8. Moreover, the law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are entitled to resort to such covert measures (see Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, § 26, ECHR 2000-V)."

While the law itself did not define what measures such “experiments ” could involve, the national authorities took the view that there existed no statutory system in Russian law regulating the interception or recording of private communications through a radio ‑ transmitting device. The Government argued that the existing regulations on telephone tapping were not applicable to radio ‑ transmitting devices and could not be extended to them by analogy. On the contrary, they emphasised the difference between the two by indicating that no judicial authorisation for the use of a radio ‑ transmitting device was required, for the reason that this technology fell outside the scope of any existing regulations. Thus, the Government considered that the use of technology not listed in section 8 of the Operational-Search Activities Act for the interception was not subject to the formal requirements imposed by the Act."

The Court has consistently held that when it comes to the interception of communications for the purpose of a police investigation, “the law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to this secret and potentially dangerous interference with the right to respect for private life and correspondence” (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, § 67, Series A no. 82 ). In particular, in order to comply with the requirement of the “quality of the law”, a law which confers discretion must indicate the scope of that discretion, although the detailed procedures and conditions to be observed do not necessarily have to be incorporated in rules of substantive law. The degree of precision required of the “ law ” in this connection will depend upon the particular subject-matter. Since the implementation in practice of measures of secret surveillance of communications is not open to scrutiny by the individuals concerned or the public at large, it would be contrary to the rule of law for the legal discretion granted to the executive – or to a judge – to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, among other authorities, Huvig v. France, 24 April 1990, § § 29 and 32, Series A no. 176 ‑ B; Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 56, ECHR 2000 ‑ II; and Valenzuela Contreras v.

This involves an examination of the “unlawfulness” in question and, where a violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see, among other authorities, Khan, cited above, § 34; P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 76, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX; Heglas v. the Czech Republic, no. 5935/02, §§ 89-92, 1 March 2007; and Allan, cited above, § 42)."

Their aim is to provide an accused person with protection against improper compulsion by the authorities and thus to avoid miscarriages of justice and secure the aims of Article 6 (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, § 45, Reports 1996-I). The right not to incriminate oneself is primarily concerned with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent and presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seeks to prove the case against the accused without resorting to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, §§ 68 ‑ 69, Reports 1996-VI; Allan, cited above, § 44; Jalloh, cited above, §§ 94-117; and O'Halloran and Francis v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 15809/02 and 25624/02, §§ 53-63, ECHR 2007-... ). In examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court must examine the nature and degree of the compulsion, the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures and the use to which any material so obtained is put (see, for example, Heaney and McGuinness v. Ireland, no. 34720/97, §§ 54-55, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and J.B. v. Switzerland, no. 31827/96, ECHR 2001-III)."

Unlike the applicant in the Allan case (cited above), the applicant was not detained on remand but was at liberty on his own premises attended by security and other personnel. The nature of his relations with V. – subordination of the latter to the applicant – did not impose any particular form of behaviour on him. In other words, the applicant was free to see V. and to talk to him, or to refuse to do so. It appears that he was willing to continue the conversation started by V. because its subject matter was of personal interest to him. Thus, the Court is not convinced that the obtaining of evidence was tainted with the element of coercion or oppression which in the Allan case the Court found to amount to a breach of the applicant's right to remain silent."

Spain [GC], nos. 1874/13 and 8567/13, § 149, 17 October 2019). The Court notes, however, that there is a distinction between the admissibility of evidence ( that is to say the question of which elements of proof may be submitted to the relevant court for its consideration ) and the rights of the defence in respect of evidence which in fact has been submitted to the court (see SA-Capital Oy v. Finland, no. 5556/10, § 74, 14 February 2019 and the references therein). There is also a distinction between the latter ( that is to say whether the rights of defence have been properly ensured in respect of the evidence taken ) and the subsequent assessment of that evidence by the court once the proceedings have been concluded. From the perspective of the rights of the defence, issues under Article 6 may therefore arise in terms of whether the evidence produced for or against the defendant was presented in such a way as to ensure a fair trial (see, for instance, Horvatić v. Croatia, no. 36044/09, § 78, 17 October 2013, and Barım v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 34536/97, 12 January 1999)."

In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy (see Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, § 90, 10 March 2009; Zhang v. Ukraine, no. 6970/15, § 57, 13 November 2018; and Erkapić v. Croatia, no. 51198/08, § 72, 25 April 2013).

Malta, no. 24221/13, § 65, 29 November 2016, with further references therein, and Fodor v. Romania, no. 45266/07, § 28, 16 September 2014). In examining the fairness of criminal proceedings, the Court has also held in particular that by ignoring a specific, pertinent and important point made by the accused, domestic courts fall short of their obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Nechiporuk and Yonkalo v.

Having said that, the Court does not lose sight of the difficulties associated with the fight against terrorism and the challenges that States face in the light of the changing methods and tactics used in the commission of terrorist offences (see Parmak and Bakır v.

However, both the public prosecutor and the trial court had been informed by the prison authorities that the impugned recordings had been erased. In his view, the fact that the public prosecutor had taken further writing samples from him illustrated that the samples taken and assessed by the police had been insufficient.

The Diyarbakır public prosecutor filed two different bills of indictment against the applicant on 9 February 2005 and 19 January 2006, respectively.

In the second bill of indictment, which was filed following the discovery of the notes on the applicant ’ s person in prison, the public prosecutor requested that the applicant be tried and convicted under Article 125 of the then Criminal Code on one count on the basis of the material found during the search of his house on 6 April 2005 (see paragraph 61 above). Neither of the two bills of indictment contained any accusation against the applicant concerning his alleged involvement in or criminal liability for the attempted bombing of the 30 August 2004 Victory Day parade."

The Court furthermore observes that while the trial court acquitted the applicant in respect of incidents 1 and 2, it found the applicant guilty under Article 125 of the then Criminal Code for attempting to bring about the secession of part of the national territory on the basis of two incidents: firstly, it held that the applicant had taken through coercion M.Ç. ’ s identity card, SIM card (no. 0535 786 91 30) and telephone no.4 ( with the IMEI no. 351 342 804 139 450) on behalf of the illegal organisation on 13 August 2004; secondly, it held that another Nokia 3310 ( telephone no.2 with the IMEI no. 350 101 912 604 260) and another SIM card (no. 0537 551 59 35) had been purchased and used in the mobile telephone-operated bomb apparatus at the 30 August 2004 Victory Day parade, which had later been deactivated on the spot; lastly, when concluding that those acts had been capable of realising the aims proscribed by Article 125 of the then Criminal Code (a material element of the offence defined therein), the trial court also referred to the weapons, detonators, explosives and other material seized during the second of the searches of the applicant ’ s home in Istanbul on 6 April 2005, which had been conducted on the basis of the two small hand-written notes found on his person following the body search conducted on him on 5 April 2005 in prison prior to his mother ’ s visit."

In the instant case, the domestic courts not only acquitted the applicant of the killing of two police officers but also found that the applicant ’ s secretly recorded interview with the police officers had been unlawful and thus excluded it from its examination on the merits of the case.

Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no. 19867/12, § 83, 11 July 2017, and Nemtsov, cited above, § 92).

Finland, no. 5556/10, § 74, 14 February 2019 and the references therein). There is also a distinction between the latter ( that is to say whether the rights of defence have been properly ensured in respect of the evidence taken ) and the subsequent assessment of that evidence by the court once the proceedings have been concluded. From the perspective of the rights of the defence, issues under Article 6 may therefore arise in terms of whether the evidence produced for or against the defendant was presented in such a way as to ensure a fair trial (see, for instance, Horvatić v. Croatia, no. 36044/09, § 78, 17 October 2013, and Barım v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 34536/97, 12 January 1999)."

Having said that, the Court does not lose sight of the difficulties associated with the fight against terrorism and the challenges that States face in the light of the changing methods and tactics used in the commission of terrorist offences (see Parmak and Bakır v.

When invited to shed light on these two mutually contradictory reports (prepared by the police at the Istanbul Security Directorate on 29 and 30 October 2004, respectively) regarding the arrival of the Bar-appointed lawyer, the Government submitted that upon the applicant requesting legal assistance following his placement in custody, the lawyer had been appointed by the Istanbul Bar Association on 29 October 2004 at around 9 p.m. and that he had subsequently arrived at the Security Directorate; however, the applicant had not been able to meet with his lawyer as he had been taken to the house that was being searched.

At this juncture, the Court reiterates its well-established case-law that any conversation between a detained criminal suspect and the police must be treated as formal contact and cannot be characterised as informal questioning or interview ( mülakat ), as was indicated in the search-and-seizure report dated 29 October 2004 in the instant case (see Titarenko v.

In that connection, the Court furthermore notes that the warrant issued by the deputy director of the Istanbul Security Directorate Anti- terrorism Branch only contained scant reasoning as to why it was imperative to carry out the search so urgently, without prior judicial scrutiny. Indeed, the reasoning used in the warrant – that is to say, “Tampering with evidence” (see paragraph 20 above), without any individualised assessment of the circumstances of the case – is not sufficient to demonstrate the exigency of the situation, and hence constitutes far from satisfactory justification for dispensing with any judicial scrutiny prior to the search (see Özgün Öztunç v.

As far as the authenticity of the notes and the question as to whether they were written by the applicant are concerned, the Court reiterates that it is not its task to review in abstracto the manner in which forensic evidence is assessed by the domestic courts (see Rostomashvili v.

Moreover, it is a matter for the domestic judge to assess the relevance and evidentiary value of all available evidence (including expert opinions), the Court ’ s competence in this area is very limited (see Mirilashvili, cited above, § 174 in fine ). Thus, the mere fact that the trial court preferred the opinion of a particular expert does not reveal any “unfairness”, within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that despite the national courts ’ discretion when choosing arguments in a particular case and admitting evidence in support of parties ’ submissions, an authority is obliged to justify its activities by giving reasons for its decisions (see Shabelnik v.

However, the Forensic Medicine Institute, which also had in its possession the photocopies of the same writing samples provided by the applicant as those that were examined by the police criminal laboratory, concluded that, to make an accurate finding, the originals of the writing samples that the applicant had given during his time in custody, as well as more material and samples, would be needed. In that connection, it requested samples of the applicant ’ s previous “sincere” handwriting, such as that he had used in exams, petitions, or personal letters.

Indeed, according to the search-and-seizure record dated 6 April 2005, the mayor of the neighbourhood and the locksmith employed to gain access to the applicant ’ s home were present at the time of the search (see paragraph 45 above). In the Court ’ s view, that was particularly important, given that their testimony could have shed light on the applicant ’ s argument that the material had been planted by the police.

In other words, the Court is of the view that the trial court did not exert efforts to shed light on the facts before it, and thus failed in its duty to properly examine the submissions of the parties and the evidence, thereby failing to establish the relevant facts in so far as they concern the applicant ’ s association with telephone no.2.

Similarly, the trial court failed in its duty to give reasons as to whether (and why) it had found the applicant guilty of the attempted bombing of the 30 August 2004 Victory Day parade and to properly carry out an examination of the parties ’ submissions and the evidence, notably in relation to the facts regarding the applicant being linked to telephone no.2.

Russia ([GC], no. 4378/02, §§ 88-93, 10 March 2009).

In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see ibid. § 90; see also Lisica v.

As to whether the interference was in accordance with law, the Court notes that the search was conducted in the context of a criminal investigation opened following allegations of possession and sale of unlawful drugs. The “search in urgent circumstances” was regulated by Articles 13 and 290 §§ 2 and 4 of the CCP as in force at the material time (see paragraph 36 above). It follows that it had a basis in the relevant domestic law. As to the applicant’s argument that the search had breached Article 328 of the CCP in as much as it had been conducted without the consent of the head of a diplomatic mission, the Court observes that, as noted by the domestic courts, that provision explicitly stated that it regulated the procedure for searches on the premises of diplomatic missions and, therefore, did not concern the applicant’s case (see paragraph 37 above)."

It refers in this connection to the preparatory works ( travaux préparatoires ) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, according to which the two categories of consular officials, namely career consular officials and honorary consular officials, have a different legal status so far as consular privileges and immunities are concerned. The honorary consuls who are nationals of the receiving State, according to the preparatory works, do not enjoy any consular immunities other than immunity from jurisdiction in respect of official acts performed in the exercise of their functions. As to the premises of a consulate headed by an honorary consul, it should be noted that while the text of the preliminary draft Convention provided for the inviolability of such premises if they were exclusively used for the exercise of consular functions, the relevant provision was eventually removed from the draft."

Germany, § 36, Gerashchenko, § 128, and Smirnov, § 40, all cited above). It remains to be examined whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”.

Starting with the decision to conduct a search, in the current case the search was conducted in the absence of a prior judicial warrant, on the basis of a decision issued by the head of the relevant police department on 25 August 2005. That decision did not refer to any relevant facts and was not drawn up in precise terms. There was no reference whatsoever to the items, for example drugs, being looked for; no information was provided about a possible link between the case under investigation and the consular premises (compare Modestou, cited above, § 46). In addition, the decision did not set out the pressing circumstances which allegedly necessitated an urgent search without a prior judicial warrant (see in this respect Article 290 § 3 of the CCP as cited in paragraph 36 above). In the Court’s view, the absence of a judicial warrant in the current case remains particularly problematic. It is noteworthy that the relevant investigative authorities considered it appropriate to make inquiries about the status of the consular premises with the MFA on the day prior to the search (see paragraph 7 above). Over the same period, however, they failed, for reasons which remain unclear, to seek a judicial warrant for the search. In the Court’s view, the Government failed, in the circumstances of the current case, to justify the recourse to urgent procedure (compare Dragoş Ioan Rusu v. Romania, no. 22767/08, § 41, 31 October 2017)."

Thus, the police officers were accompanied by a representative of the MFA, who was allowed to be present throughout the investigative measure. It was recorded on a video, which was shown in court; and the applicant was present throughout the search. Also, at no point did the applicant argue that any other items, particularly those related to his work, had been seized during the search (contrast Smirnov, cited above, § 48)."

                "66. As to the issue of judicial scrutiny, the Court notes that the absence of a prior judicial warrant for a search may be counterbalanced by the availability of an ex post factum judicial review (see Heino v. Finland, no. 56720/09, § 45, 15 February 2011). This review must, however, be effective in the particular circumstances of the case in question (see Smirnov, cited above, § 45 in fine ). In the present case, the ex post factum judicial review was conducted promptly, on 26 August 2005 (see paragraph 14 above). However, the Court notes that it has already found in its judgments against Georgia, albeit in the context of the examination of the fairness of criminal proceedings under Article 6 of the Convention, that post-search judicial reviews are not adequate and sufficient for the purposes of establishing the circumstances of a search (see Kobiashvili v. Georgia, no. 36416/06, §§ 67-69, 14 March 2019, and Megrelishvili v. Georgia [Committee], no. 30364/09, § 35, 7 May 2020). The Court considers that a similar conclusion is warranted under Article 8 of the Convention in this case. Thus, the domestic court did not elaborate in its decision on the issue of the necessity of a search in urgent circumstances (see Stoyanov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 55388/10, § 130, 31 March 2016). Nor did it examine whether the measure had been “necessary in a democratic society” and whether it had been proportionate (see paragraph 15 above; compare with Doroż v. Poland, no. 71205/11, § 28, 29 October 2020; see also, mutatis mutandis, Hambardzumyan v. Armenia, no. 43478/11, § 46, 5 December 2019, and Zubkov and Others v. Russia, nos. 29431/05 and 2 others, §§ 97 ‑ 98, 7 November 2017). It seems that the domestic court was required to do so, as Article 13 § 2 of the CCP explicitly provided for the assessment of the lawfulness and reasonableness of a search and seizure carried out in the absence of a judicial order (see Article 13 § 2 of the CCP as cited in paragraph 36 above; contrast Ivashchenko v.

Russia ([GC], no. 4378/02, §§ 88-93, 10 March 2009). In particular, in determining whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, regard must also be had to whether the rights of the defence were respected. It must be examined, in particular, whether the applicant was given the opportunity of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see ibid. § 90; see also Lisica v. Croatia, no. 20100/06, § 49, 25 February 2010; Gäfgen v. Germany ([GC], no. 22978/05, § 162-165, ECHR 2010; Prade v.

The Court has already found in the particular circumstances of various cases that the fact that domestic courts had relied on evidence which had been deemed to have been unlawfully obtained for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention did not conflict with the requirements of fairness enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Bykov, cited above, §§ 94-98; see also Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, §§ 34-40, ECHR 2000-V; P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, §§ 76-81, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX; Valentino Acatrinei v. Romania, no. 18540/04, §§ 73-77, 25 June 2013; and Hambardzumyan, cited above, §§ 78-81). As to the present case, the Court considers, in view of the relevant principles established in Bykov (cited above, §§ 89-90), that the applicant was able to challenge the lawfulness and the authenticity of the evidence obtained as a result of the impugned search in the adversarial procedure before the trial court and the appeal court. While the post-search judicial review was tainted by inadequacy and insufficiency (see the relevant reasoning under Article 8 of the Convention in paragraph 66 above) his arguments about the circumstances of the search and the reliability of the evidence obtained as a result were addressed by the courts and dismissed in reasoned decisions in the course of his criminal trial. It notes in this connection that the applicant made no complaints in relation to the alleged breach of his defence rights."

As to the quality of the evidence, starting with the circumstances of the search, the Court notes that the search of the consular premises in the current case was triggered by the incriminating evidence given by A.I. In addition to his pre-trial confrontation with the applicant, the latter was examined before the trial and appeal courts, with the participation of the defence. In this respect the present case is different from previous cases against Georgia where the Court found that the searches conducted on the basis of the operational information, which had never been examined by any of the domestic courts, had been tainted by arbitrariness (see Kobiashvili, §§ 61-65 and Megrelishvili, § 33, both cited above; and Bakradze v. Georgia [Committee], no. 21074/09, § 26, 10 December 2020). Furthermore, the circumstances of the search of the consular premises were confirmed by a video recording and by the statements of a representative of the MFA. The Court finds it problematic that the search of the consular premises was conducted in a manner which precluded subsequent dactyloscopic examination of the evidence seized. It considers that the police should have taken adequate precautions in order to prevent possible contamination of the evidence. Nevertheless, this failure did not, in the circumstances of the current case, call into question the reliability of the evidence that the substance seized belonged to the applicant. It is noteworthy that the applicant admitted to possessing the ampoules of morphine. Moreover, the drugs were seized from a safe and desk in the applicant’s office."

The applicant’s conviction was further based on other court-tested evidence, notably, the video recording of the search, the statement of a representative of the MFA, and the statements of the police officers who had conducted the search."

Georgia, no. 12391/06, § 175, 14 May 2020; Kobiashvili, cited above, § 76; Kuparadze v. Georgia, no. 30742/09, §§ 75-77, 21 September 2017; and Tchaghiashvili v. Georgia (dec.), no. 19312/07, § 34, 2 September 2014). In the present case, according to the applicant, this was the first time that the Supreme Court had been seized with a case dealing with the issue of consular immunity and that it was therefore important for the cassation court, for the purpose of developing uniform judicial practice, to admit the case and decide it on the merits. The Court notes, however, that the applicant had had the benefit of fully adversarial proceedings on the merits before the first and appellate instances. In view of the thorough examination of the applicant’s relevant arguments by the first two instances, the Court considers that the fact that the applicant’s appeal on points of law was declared inadmissible cannot be viewed as an unreasonable and disproportionate limitation of the right to have access to court. Nor does the limited reasoning given by the Supreme Court in its decision of 18 February 2008 for the rejection of the applicant’s appeal raise an arguable issue (see, among many other cases, Nersesyan v.

The applicant was ‘ set up ’ by a journalist, a private individual, who was not an agent of the State: he was not acting for the police on their instructions or otherwise under their control. The police had no prior knowledge of M ’ s operation, being presented with the audio and video recordings after the event. The Court therefore considers that the situation in the instant case is different from that examined in the Court ’ s judgment in the Teixeira [ Teixeira de Castro, cited above] case.”"

                "45. Later, in the cases of Milinienė v. Lithuania (no. 74355/01, 24 June 2008 ) and Gorgievski v. “ the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ” ( no. 18002/02, §§ 52 and 53, 16 July 2009 ), the Court, confronted with situations involving private individuals, confirmed its approach and also found that there had been no entrapment. The relevant finding in the Milinienė case reads as follows :",
                "“ 37. ... the initiative in the case was taken by SŠ, a private individual, who, when he understood that the applicant would require a bribe to reach a favourable outcome in his case, complained to the police. Thereafter the police approached the Deputy Prosecutor General who authorised and followed the further investigation within the legal framework of a criminal conduct simulation model, affording immunity from prosecution to SŠ in exchange for securing evidence against the suspected offender.",
                "38. To the extent that SŠ had police backing to offer the applicant considerable financial inducements and was given technical equipment to record their conversations, it is clear that the police influenced the course of events. However, the Court does not find that police role to have been abusive, given their obligation to verify criminal complaints and the importance of thwarting the corrosive effect of judicial corruption on the rule of law in a democratic society. Nor does it find that the police role was the determinative factor. The determinative factor was the conduct of SŠ and the applicant. To this extent, the Court accepts that, on balance, the police may be said to have ‘ joined ’ the criminal activity rather than to have initiated it. Their actions thus remained within the bounds of undercover work rather than that of agents provocateurs in possible breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention .. .”"
            ],
            [
                "46. Applying the same criterion, in the case of Malininas ( cited above ) the Court established that the covert operation in question involved entrapment:",
                "“ 37. The Court observes that it was Officer V who took the initiative when he first approached the applicant, asking where he could acquire illegal drugs. The applicant then offered to supply them himself. As the transaction progressed, the applicant was offered a significant sum of money – USD 3,000 – to supply a large amount of narcotics. This obviously represented an inducement to produce the goods. The first instance court recognised the determinative part played by the police ... These elements in the present case, in the Court ’ s view, extended the police ’ s role beyond that of undercover agents to that of ‘ agents provocateurs ’. They did not merely ‘ join ’ an on-going offence; they instigated it. The necessary inference from these circumstances is that the police did not confine themselves to investigating the applicant ’ s criminal activity in an essentially passive manner, but exercised an influence such as to incite the commission of the offence ... ”"
            ],
            [
                "47. When drawing the line between legitimate infiltration by an undercover agent and instigation of a crime the Court will examine the question whether the applicant was subjected to pressure to commit the offence. It has found the abandonment of a passive attitude by the investigating authorities to be associated with such conduct as taking the initiative in contacting the applicant, renewing the offer despite his initial refusal, insistent prompting, raising the price beyond average ( see, among other cases, Malininas, cited above, § 37) or appealing to the applicant ’ s compassion by mentioning withdrawal symptoms ( see Vanyan, cited above, § § 11 and 49 ). The relevant finding in the Ramanauskas case (cited above, § 67) reads as follows :",
                "“ Secondly, as is shown by the recordings of telephone calls, all the meetings between the applicant and AZ took place on the latter ’ s initiative, a fact that appears to contradict the Government ’ s argument that the authorities did not subject the applicant to any pressure or threats. On the contrary, through the contact established on the initiative of AZ and VS, the applicant seems to have been subjected to blatant prompting on their part to perform criminal acts, although there was no objective evidence – other than rumours – to suggest that he had been intending to engage in such activity. ”"

            [
                "48. When applying the above criteria, the Court places the burden of proof on the authorities. To that end it has held that “it falls to the prosecution to prove that there was no incitement, provided that the defendant ’ s allegations are not wholly improbable ” (see Ramanauskas, cited above, § 70). In practice, the authorities may be prevented from discharging this burden by the absence of formal authorisation and supervision of the undercover operation. In this context, in the case of Teixeira de Castro (cited above, § 38) the Court found that the undercover agent ’ s activity was not part of an operation ordered and supervised by a judge, distinguishing it on this ground from the case of Lüdi ( cited above ), where the police officer concerned had been sworn in, the investigating judge had been aware of his task and a preliminary investigation had been opened."

In cases against Russia ( Vanyan, cited above, §§ 46 and 4 7, and Khudobin, cited above, § 135) the Court has also emphasised the need for a clear and foreseeable procedure for authorising investigative measures, as well as for their proper supervision. In the latter case the Court found a violation, having observed, in particular, that the police operation had been authorised by a simple administrative decision by the body which later carried out the operation; the decision contained very little information as to the reasons for and purposes of the planned test purchase, and the operation was not subjected to judicial review or any other independent supervision (ibid.)."

To that end, they should have established in particular the reasons why the operation had been mounted, the extent of the police ’ s involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant had been subjected. ...

The Court, while recognising that the right to a fair criminal trial under Article 6 includes a right to disclosure of all material evidence in the possession of the prosecution, both for and against the accused, has nevertheless accepted that there may be restrictions on the right to a fully adversarial procedure where strictly necessary in the light of a strong countervailing public interest, such as national security, the need to keep secret certain police methods of investigation or the protection of the fundamental rights of another person. There will not be a fair trial, however, unless any difficulties caused to the defendant by a limitation on his rights are sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see, for example, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, § 70, Reports 1996-II; Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 58, Reports 1997-III; Jasper v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27052/95, §§ 51-53, ECHR 2000-II; S.N. v.

Therefore, in public - interest immunity cases the Court has considered it essential to examine the procedure whereby the plea of incitement was determined in order to ensure that the rights of the defence were adequately protected, in particular the right to adversarial proceedings and to equality of arms (see Edwards and Lewis, cited above, §§ 46-48, and, mutatis mutandis, Jasper, cited above, §§ 50 and 58). The procedure in the cases in question consisted of the following. The public - interest immunity material was made available to the trial judge in the ex parte procedure, and the judge would decide whether any of the confidential material would assist the defence, in particular to argue the point of entrapment, in which case it would be obliged to order its disclosure. The Court found, in particular, that the issue of entrapment, if determined by the trial judge who also decided upon the guilt or innocence of the accused, was too closely related to the essence of criminal charges to exclude the defence from full knowledge of all material to which the prosecution had access (ibid.). Subsequently, the Court examined (in the context primarily of Article 5 § 4, but also of Article 6) the possibility of using special advocates to counterbalance the procedural unfairness caused by lack of full disclosure in national - security cases but also found such an approach to be capable of upsetting equality of arms, depending on the importance of the undisclosed material to the outcome of the trial ( see A. and Others, cited above, § § 205 et seq.)."

Finland, § § 76 et seq.; and Khudobin, § 133, all cited above ). Even if the information in question was not part of the prosecution file and had not been admitted as evidence, the court ’ s duty to examine the incitement plea and ensure the overall fairness of the trial requires that all relevant information, particularly regarding the purported suspicions about the applicant ’ s previous conduct, be put openly before the trial court or tested in an adversarial manner (see V. v.

In addressing this question, the Court will apply the substantive test of incitement set out in paragraphs 37 - 50 above; its ability to make a substantive finding on this point will depend, however, on whether or not the case file contains sufficient information on the undercover activities preceding the offence, in particular the details of encounters between the State agents and the applicant before the test purchase. If the substantive test is inconclusive owing to the lack of information in the file, the Court will proceed to the second step of its examination, whereby it will assess the procedure by which the plea of incitement was determined by the domestic courts in the light of the criteria set out in paragraphs 51 - 65 above."

Until 28 January 2005 the applicant was preparing the sale, acting as an intermediary between S., the supplier, and Vladimir. According to the applicant ’ s own testimonies in court, her first encounter with the FSB undercover agent B. took place on 29 January 2005, immediately before the test purchase. By that stage the FSB already possessed recordings of her conversations with S., which had taken place between 23 and 27 January 2005, concerning the ongoing drug sale. It follows from that account that the FSB agent B. stepped into the transaction when it was already under way.

The special investigative measures ... applied in the case at issue are not provided for under the [ OSCOC Act ] and therefore the [investigating judge ’ s] orders could have been based only on the Code of Criminal Procedure. Had the investigating judge authorised any of the measures provided for in section 41 ( 1 ) of the [ OSCOC Act ], he would have been obliged to rely on that Act.",

U-III-857/ 2 008] to the effect that the orders must be sufficiently reasoned, are also ill- founded ...",
                "This court considers that mere flaws in the reasoning of the secret surveillance orders do not make the results of such measures unlawfully obtained evidence. This is because Article 9 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that unlawfully obtained evidence is evidence which has been obtained in breach of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and is expressly provided for by the [Code of Criminal Procedure].",

That is to say, evidence which is obtained without a warrant issued by the investigating judge, or if the [police] acted contrary to Articles 180 and 182 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but [this does not concern] the evidence obtained contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that the order [authorising special investigative measures ] should, inter alia, refer to the facts which warrant the application of such measures, specifically that there is a reasonable suspicion that an individual has committed a criminal offence and that the investigation could not have been carried out by other means or that [to do so] would have been extremely difficult.",
                "Article 182 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is compatible with the legal nature of [ special investigation ] orders. Such orders [made by the investigating judge] are transmitted to the State Attorney, who is authorised to request them, and they are executed by the police. There is no legal avenue [to challenge] such orders since the [State Attorney] has no legal interest in challenging them. The police were therefore, moreover, not allowed to challenge the orders. If the argument of the appellants that secret surveillance orders would be unlawful when they are not sufficiently reasoned were to be accepted, it would call into doubt the [use of] secret surveillance measures, particularly in situations where all other legal conditions had been met but the order was merely not sufficiently reasoned, which would be absolutely unacceptable.”"

One such investigative method is the use of undercover agents under Article 180 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The precondition for their use, the competency for their authorisation and supervision, as well as the duration [of their use], and the assessment of the results for the purpose of their use [in the proceedings] is set out in detail in that law ...",
                "[In the case at issue] the evidence clearly shows, as the lower courts correctly established, that the statement of the undercover agent, according to which the appellant would be paid a certain sum of money for the delivered drugs, could not be considered – either objectively or subjectively – as incitement under Article 37 of the Criminal Code because [such an] invitatio ad offerendum was only a general, abstract expression of the readiness of the undercover agent to pay a certain sum of money for the delivered drugs, after which the appellant voluntarily continued communicating with him so as to draw personal benefit from the abstract readiness of the “buyer” [to buy the drugs].",

On the contrary, the first-instance court and the Supreme Court found that, even without [the undercover agent ’ s statement] he had been predisposed to commit the offence for which he had been convicted ( ‘ ... predisposed to commit offence. .. ’, the ECHR judgment of 9 April 1998 in the case of Teixeira de Castro v.

Accordingly, in the Government ’ s view, the six-month time-limit had started running from that time and there had been no reason for the applicant to wait for the outcome of the criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the Government argued that the applicant had failed to raise his Article 8 complaints in his appeal to the Supreme Court and his constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court, and had therefore failed to properly exhaust the domestic remedies. The Government pointed out that the document, purportedly showing that J.K. had worked as a police officer, which the applicant had submitted with his observations to the Court of 31 December 2013, was a forgery. They provided a letter of the Ministry of the Interior of 27 January 2014 indicating that the document in question had never been issued in respect of J.K. The Government therefore considered that the applicant ’ s representative should be excluded from the proceedings under Rule 44D of the Rules of Court because she had provided falsified documents to the Court and had also provided certain confidential documents from other, unrelated, proceedings at the domestic level.

Indeed, a lack of procedural safeguards in the ordering of an undercover operation generates a risk of arbitrariness and police entrapment (see Nosko and Nefedov v.

In other words, the Court must examine whether or not the prosecuting authorities confined themselves to “investigating criminal activity in an essentially passive manner” in the present case (see Ramanauskas, cited above, §§ 66-67; and Milinienė v.

The Court firstly notes that although there was no clear evidence that the applicant had committed any offences beforehand, in particular corruption-related offences, an investigation carried out by the prosecuting authorities into alleged corruption in the Fund suggested that the applicant might have been involved in illegal activities (see paragraphs 7-9 above). The first concrete allegations of the applicant ’ s corruption were made by J.K., who on 3 April 2007 contacted the State Attorney ’ s Office; the same day he was granted informant status concerning the matter (see paragraphs 10-12 above)."

In this connection it should be also noted that the applicant ’ s allegations that J.K. had previously worked as a police agent were based on far-fetched and fabricated evidence (see paragraphs 105 - 106 above). In fact, there is nothing suggesting that at his initial contact with the applicant J.K. was acting as an agent of the State or that he was acting for the prosecuting authorities on their instructions or otherwise under their control. The prosecuting authorities only instructed J.K. to act as an informant after he had reported the applicant ’ s corrupt offers. The Court sees nothing inadequate or arbitrary in that decision (see Gorgievski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 18002/02, § 52, 16 July 2009)."

In this connection the Court also cannot accept the applicant ’ s argument that there were not sufficient safeguards against abuse by informants in the domestic system at the relevant time. The Code of Criminal Procedure provided the relevant procedural and substantive requirements for recourse to informants in the investigation of crime and explicitly prohibited incitement. It also mandated judicial assessment of an arguable plea of entrapment and sanctioned the incitement by the exclusion of evidence so obtained from the proceedings (see paragraph 84 above), which the Court has already accepted as an appropriate remedy with regard to a successful plea of incitement (see Bannikova, cited above, § 56)."

It was he who explained to J.K. the modalities of the illegal activity, including the payments that should be carried out for the realisation of the project. He also insisted that those payments would not represent a significant financial burden for the investor and he explained the reasons why it was justified to ask for a percentage of the investment (see paragraph 68 above)."

Nor does the Court find that the prosecuting authorities ’ role was the determining factor. The determining factor was the conduct of the applicant in his contact with J.K. The Court therefore accepts that, on balance, the prosecuting authorities may be said to have “joined” the criminal activity rather than to have initiated it. Their actions thus remained within the bounds of undercover work rather than that of agents provocateurs in possible breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (compare Milinienė, cited above, § 38)."

The undercover measure thus did not amount to incitement, as defined in the Court ’ s case-law relating to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

The applicant stressed that any justification of the denial of his right to access the recordings by the necessity to protect the rights of others had been vague and unclear. In fact, the domestic authorities had allowed the recordings of his conversation with J.K. to leak into the public and those recordings could still be found today on the Internet.

The Government further argued that all the evidence on which the applicant ’ s conviction had been based had been accessible to the defence. The recordings which had been examined at trial had been transcribed by an expert and the transcripts had been made available to the defence. On the other hand, in the Government ’ s view, there had been no reason to allow the defence to have access to the secret surveillance recordings of individuals who had not been accused in the proceedings. Moreover, it had not been possible to allow the defence access to or copies of such recordings as that could have endangered the rights of third parties.

In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see, amongst many other authorities, Bykov v.

Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66-67, Series A no. 211). In addition, Article 6 § 1 requires that the prosecution authorities disclose to the defence all material evidence in their possession for or against the accused (see Natunen v.

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 § 1 (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 58, Reports 1997 ‑ III ). Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities ( see Natunen, cited above, § 40, and Leas, cited above, § 78)."

The Court noted that the judge had been aware of both the contents of the withheld evidence and the nature of the applicant ’ s case, and had thus been able to weigh the applicant ’ s interest in disclosure against the public interest in concealment (see, by contrast, Edwards and Lewis, cited above, § 46)."

In this context, importance is attached to appearances as well as to the increased sensitivity to the fair administration of justice.

It cannot be therefore held against the applicant that he did not make a specific application to access to that particular part of the recordings. Indeed, the applicant ’ s application for access to the recordings was not denied because he had failed to substantiate it or because he had failed to provide acceptable reasons for his application.

Instead, as already noted above, it dismissed the applicant ’ s application for access to the recordings at issue on the grounds that he had no right of access to those recordings. The Supreme Court thereby held that it was of no relevance whether the State Attorney, when making his selection of the secret surveillance material to be submitted to the court, excluded certain evidence in favour of the accused since the State Attorney had been in a position to make a selection of the evidence to be used in the proceeding (see paragraph 73 above)."

In the case at issue, the decision regarding the undisclosed evidence was made by the prosecuting authorities without providing the defence with the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process (compare Natunen, cited above, § 48). It would appear that the contested measure stemmed from the position of the Supreme Court which was, as already observed above, at variance with the relevant Convention standards (see paragraph 1 8 1 above)."

It also finds that the domestic courts failed to provide convincing reasons based on a balancing of the relevant interests that would justify the restriction on the applicant ’ s defence rights."

Although, as already found above, the available material in the case file shows, with a sufficient degree of certainty, that the applicant was not incited to commit the offences at issue (see paragraph 1 46 above), the fact remains that he was prevented from having a procedure whereby it could be established whether the evidence in the possession of the prosecution that had been excluded from the file might have reduced his sentence or put into doubt the scope of his alleged criminal activity."

However, having regard to the relevant criminal materials, the Court observes that the Prosecutor ’ s Office did not make any argument throughout the proceedings in an attempt to refute the applicant ’ s allegations of entrapment. This total silence on the part the Prosecutor ’ s Office could be explained by the objective impossibility of discharging the requisite burden of proof on account of the absence of any formal authorisation and supervision of the undercover operation in question ( see Vanyan, cited above, §§ 46 and 47, and Khudobin, cited above, § 135). Thus, the Court observes that the DCS sending Ms K., the infiltrated agent, to the applicant on an undercover mission was never ordered or supervised either by a court, which is considered by the Court ’ s case-law as the most appropriate form of supervision in such matters, or any other independent public authority competent in criminal matters (contrast Lüdi, cited above; also compare, among many other authorities, Teixeira de Castro, cited above, § 38, and Milinienė, cited above, § 39). Indeed, under section 7 §§ 3 ‑ 7 of the Act on Special Investigative Activity, it was not required that infiltration by an undercover agent – unlike certain other investigative techniques – be ordered and supervised by a court (see paragraph 39 above).

The applicant submitted that, as a matter of fact, Ms K. had not been an ordinary private individual but a paid undercover agent of the DCS who had collaborated with the latter authority in respect of a number of other unrelated criminal cases. He emphasised the fact that Ms K. had already been a police agent by the time she had first approached him. Ms N. , another protagonist in the criminal case against the applicant, had apparently been another undercover agent of the DCS, whom he had had no possibility to question in court. The applicant stated that the domestic courts had not even mentioned the fact that she had been an undercover agent, let alone giving any meaningful answer to his plea of entrapment. The applicant also suggested that Ms K. had herself become the target of pressure from the authorities – in the form of the criminal proceedings instituted against her – after she had partly testified in his favour during the trial (see paragraph 19 above)."

            [
                "44. While the Court has consistently accepted the use of undercover agents as a legitimate investigative technique for combating serious crimes, this technique still requires that clear, adequate and sufficient procedural safeguards set permissible police conduct aside from entrapment, as the public interest cannot justify the use of evidence obtained as a result of police entrapment (see Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, 9 June 1998, § 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ IV, and Nosko and Nefedov v. Russia, nos. 5753/09 and 11789/10, § 50, 30 October 2014 ). In this respect, the Court ’ s examination of complaints of entrapment has developed on the basis of two tests: the substantive test and the procedural test of incitement (see, for instance, Bannikova v. Russia no. 18757/06, §§ 37 and 51, 4 November 2010). Under the substantive test, when examining an applicant ’ s arguable plea of entrapment, the Court will enquire, as a first step, into whether the authorities had good reasons for mounting a covert operation. In particular, they must show that they were in possession of concrete, objective and verifiable evidence showing that initial steps have been taken to commit the acts constituting the offence, and that the criminal act was already underway at the time when the police intervened (see, generally, Shannon v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 67537/01, ECHR 2004-IV; Eurofinacom v. France (dec.), no. 58753/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ VII; and Furcht v. Germany, no. 54648/09, § 51, 23 October 2014 ). This principle rules out, in particular, any conduct that may be interpreted as inciting the applicant to commit an offence that would otherwise not have been committed, such as taking the initiative in contacting the applicant, repeating an offer despite having received an initial refusal, insistent prompting, the promise of financial gain, or appealing to the applicant ’ s sense of compassion ( compare, among other cases, Ramanauskas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 74420/01, § 67, ECHR 2008; Malininas v. Lithuania, no. 10071/04, § 37, 1 July 2008; and Vanyan v. Russia, no. 53203/99, § § 11 and 49, 15 December 2005 )."
            ],
            [
                "45. Where the authorities claim that they acted upon information received from a private individual, the Court draws a distinction between an individual complaint and information coming from a police collaborator or informant (see, among many others, Shannon, cited above; Gorgievski v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, no. 18002/02, §§ 52 and 53, 16 July 2009; and Milinienė v. Lithuania, no. 74 355/01, §§ 37-38, 24 June 2008 ). A collaborator or informant would run a significant risk of extending their role to that of agents provocateurs, in possible breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, if they were to take part in a police ‑ supervised operation. It is therefore crucial in each case to establish if the criminal act was already under way at the time when the source began collaboration with the police ( compare Eurofinacom and Vanyan, both cited above, §§ 4 7-49 ). In assessing a plea of entrapment, it is also important to analyse whether the private individual who informed the authorities of the applicant ’ s allegedly unlawful conduct might have had any ulterior motives (see Milinienė, cited above, § 39 ). The Court has found that the line between legitimate infiltration by an undercover agent and the instigation of a crime is more likely to be crossed if no clear and foreseeable procedure was set up under the domestic law for authorising and implementing undercover operations – all the more so if they were also not properly supervised. It has considered judicial supervision as the most appropriate means in cases involving covert operations (see Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, § 135, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII (extracts); Furcht, cited above, § 53; and Bannikova, also cited above, §§ 49 and 50). A lack of procedural safeguards in the ordering of an undercover operation generates a risk of arbitrariness and police entrapment (see Nosko and Nefedov, cited above, § 64 )."
            ],
            [
                "46. In cases where the lack of file disclosure or the controversy of the parties ’ interpretation of events precludes the Court from establishing with a sufficient degree of certainty whether the applicant was subjected to police incitement, the procedural aspect becomes decisive. In examining the procedure followed by the domestic courts the Court has had regard to the potential outcome of a successful plea of incitement (see Bannikova, cited above, §§ 5 2 and 53, with further references). As the starting point, the Court will therefore verify whether an arguable complaint of incitement constitutes a substantive defence under domestic law, or gives grounds for the exclusion of evidence, or leads to similar consequences (see Khudobin, cited above, §§ 133-135). Although the Court will generally leave it to the domestic authorities to decide what procedure must be followed by the judiciary when faced with a plea of incitement, it requires such a procedure to be adversarial, thorough, comprehensive and conclusive on the issue of entrapment, with the burden of proof on the relevant prosecution authority to demonstrate that there was no incitement. The scope of the domestic judicial review must include the reasons why the undercover operation was mounted, the extent of the law enforcement authorities ’ involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant was subjected ( see, among other authorities, Ramanauskas, cited above, § § 70 and 71, and Bannikova, cited above, § 48). The domestic courts ’ duty to ensure the overall fairness of the trial requires, inter alia, that the undercover agents and other witnesses who could testify on the issue of incitement should be heard in court and be cross-examined by the defence, or at least that detailed reasons should be given for a failure to do so (compare Lüdi v. Switzerland, 15 June 1992, § 49, Series A no. 238; Bulfinsky v. Romania, no. 28823/04, § 45, 1 June 2010; and Kuzmickaja v. Lithuania (dec.), no. 27968/03, 10 June 2008). The Court ’ s findings under the procedural test will become of decisive significance for the finding of whether or not impugned criminal proceedings have been conducted in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention ( compare, for instance, Sepil v. Turkey, no. 17711/07, § 37-40, 12 November 2013, and Constantin and Stoian v. Romania, nos. 23782/06 and 46629/06, § 64, 29 September 2009 ).",

Having regard to the limits of its international supervision, notably that it is not a court of fourth instance empowered to call into question the findings of the domestic courts as regards the commission of the offence in question, the Court notes that, in the examination of the present case, it must be guided by the relevant factual findings established at the domestic level. Thus, the Court will base its assessment on the fact – established by the domestic courts – that the applicant indeed accepted a bribe from Ms K. in exchange for a promise to assist her in the implementation of a business plan (compare, mutatis mutandis, Matanović v. Croatia, no. 2742/12, § 136 ). The only major procedural lacuna that was apparently left open at the domestic level – despite the fact of its being at the core of the question of whether or not the applicant was given a fair trial – is the latter ’ s claim that he was the victim of police entrapment and the domestic courts ’ failure to address this allegation. The Court is therefore called on to address this particular procedural defence."
            ],
            [
                "48. In this respect, the principal issue to be examined by the Court is whether the actions of the law-enforcement authority – the DCS – remained within the bounds of undercover work rather than inciting the applicant into taking a bribe. In other words, the Court must ascertain whether the DCS confined itself to “investigating criminal activity in an essentially passive manner” (see, for instance, Ramanauskas, cited above, §§ 66-67). Its ability to make a substantive finding on this point will depend, however, on whether or not the case file contains sufficient information on the undercover activities. If the substantive test is inconclusive owing to the lack of information in the file, the Court will proceed to the second step of its examination, whereby it will assess the procedure by which the plea of incitement was determined by the domestic courts in the light of the criteria set out in paragraph 46 above. Although there was no evidence that the applicant had committed any offences, in particular corruption-related ones, before the incident in question, the absence of a criminal record could not in itself, detached from the other circumstances of the case, be understood as an indication of bad faith in the law-enforcement authority ’ s decision to mount an undercover operation against him after Ms K. had reported his alleged request for a bribe. Nor can the subsequent technical and financial backing given by the DCS to the person who had purportedly received the request for a bribe – so that the latter could record the commission of the offence – be equated with the transgression by the police of the bounds of its undercover investigative work (compare, for instance, Matanović, cited above, § 138, and Milinienė, cited above, § § 37 and 38)."
            ],
            [
                "49. What starts to taint the legality of the police operation mounted against the applicant is the fact that Ms K. was hardly an ordinary private individual. The criminal file against the applicant contained material which confirmed the fact that that person had been the DCS ’ s usual collaborator in a number of unrelated criminal investigations. Ms K. conceded herself during the applicant ’ s trial that when she had approached the applicant for the first time on 1 December 2005, she had already been acting under the DCS ’ s instructions. On the other hand, however, the Court observes that, according to the official version of the events, it was not Ms K. who had proposed a bribe to the applicant. On the contrary, it was the latter who had been the first one to request a pay-off from her in the amount of USD 30,000. Although, the applicant claimed before the domestic courts that he had had no intention to retain any part of the received money for his personal benefit, this allegation is no valid excuse for his taking the initiative and raising financial aspects in the conversation with Ms K. (see paragraphs 7, 17, 18, 24 and 25 above ). In such circumstances, the Court cannot determine with sufficient certainty, only on the basis of the materials available in the case file, that Ms K. took an active and decisive role in the creation of the stratagem that instigated the commission of the bribe offence in question. Thus, the Court ’ s substantive test is inconclusive."
            ],
            [
                "50. Consequently, the Court has to proceed to the procedural test and to examine whether the applicant was able to raise the issue of police entrapment effectively in the domestic proceedings (see the general principles cited in paragraph 46 as well as paragraph 48 above ). In this regard, the Court is satisfied that the applicant basing his defence before the trial court on the grounds of alleged police entrapment was a valid course of action, as it could have resulted in the exclusion of the evidence obtained as a result of such an investigative technique (compare Matanović, cited above, § 140, and Bannikova, cited above, § 56 ). In particular, under sections 3, 6 and 7 of the Act on Special Investigative Activity it was outlawed for an investigative technique involving the infiltration of an undercover agent to be implemented with methods based on “deceit” and “inducement”, and a person concerned by these illicit methods of investigation was entitled to complain before a court. Furthermore, Article 111 § 1 (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure directly mandated a criminal court to exclude from the relevant case file evidence obtained as a result of any “illegal activity” or “unlawful method” (see paragraphs 36-38 above). Consequently, and given that the applicant had an arguable claim of entrapment, the Prosecutor ’ s Office should have assumed the burden of proving that there had been no incitement contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Bannikova, cited above, § 48)."
            ],
            [
                "51. However, having regard to the relevant criminal materials, the Court observes that the Prosecutor ’ s Office did not make any argument throughout the proceedings in an attempt to refute the applicant ’ s allegations of entrapment. This total silence on the part the Prosecutor ’ s Office could be explained by the objective impossibility of discharging the requisite burden of proof on account of the absence of any formal authorisation and supervision of the undercover operation in question ( see Vanyan, cited above, §§ 46 and 47, and Khudobin, cited above, § 135). Thus, the Court observes that the DCS sending Ms K., the infiltrated agent, to the applicant on an undercover mission was never ordered or supervised either by a court, which is considered by the Court ’ s case-law as the most appropriate form of supervision in such matters, or any other independent public authority competent in criminal matters (contrast Lüdi, cited above; also compare, among many other authorities, Teixeira de Castro, cited above, § 38, and Milinienė, cited above, § 39). Indeed, under section 7 §§ 3 ‑ 7 of the Act on Special Investigative Activity, it was not required that infiltration by an undercover agent – unlike certain other investigative techniques – be ordered and supervised by a court (see paragraph 39 above). In other words, the domestic law did not provide for the adequate regulation of the conduct of such a covert operation (compare, for instance, Veselov and Others v. Russia, nos. 23200/10 and 2 others, § 111, 2 October 2012 )."
            ],
            [
                "52. Lastly, even if the Prosecutor ’ s Office had failed to discharge the requisite burden of proof, that omission could not have excused the domestic courts from the need to address effectively the applicant ’ s plea of entrapment. The effectiveness of the judicial review should be assessed by having due regard to the reasons contained in the domestic courts ’ decisions. The courts were expected to establish, after having conducted adversarial proceedings, the reasons why the undercover operation had been mounted against the applicant, the extent of the DCS ’ s involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant had been subjected (see, for instance, Ramanauskas, cited above, § 71). However, the Court observes that the domestic courts, confronted with the applicant ’ s well ‑ substantiated allegations, did not provide any single reason in their decisions as to why those allegations ought to be dismissed (see paragraphs 27 and 33 above). The Court further notes the domestic courts ’ failure to secure the attendance and examination of another key witness, Ms N., who, according to the applicant and Ms K., was probably another undercover agent engaged by the DCS to entrap the applicant (see paragraphs 25-26 and 29-32). In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the judicial review of the allegations of entrapment was either conducted with sufficient respect for the principle of adversarial proceedings or that it established adequate reasons for dismissing the applicant ’ s defence."

Having regard to all the above considerations – the absence of sufficient legislative framework of the mounting of the undercover operation against the applicant, the undercover agent ’ s failure to remain strictly passive in her activity, the failure of the Prosecutor ’ s Office to discharge its burden of proof, and the insufficiency of the judicial review of the applicant ’ s well-substantiated allegations of entrapment – the Court concludes that the conduct of the criminal proceedings against the applicant was incompatible with the notion of a fair trial.

He does, on the other hand, submit, under an interpretation of Articles 293 and 32 of the Criminal Code in the light of the principles inferred from Article 10 ECHR by the European Court of Human Rights, that having received that information in good faith without obtaining it unlawfully, he had the duty as a professional journalist, under Article 32 of the Criminal Code, to publish it owing to what he sees as the obvious interest of the so-called ‘ Lausanne Bridge ’ case to the general public in French-speaking Switzerland.",

In accordance with Article 293 of the Criminal Code (Publication of secret official deliberations), anyone who, without being entitled to do so, makes public all or part of the documents, investigations or deliberations of an authority which are secret by law or by virtue of a decision taken by that authority, acting within its powers, will be punished by a fine (paragraph 1). Complicity in such acts is also punishable (see paragraph 2). The court may decide not to impose any penalties if the secret thus made public is of minor importance (see paragraph 3).",
                "According to case-law, this provision proceeds from a formal conception of secrecy. It is sufficient that the documents, deliberations or investigations in question have been declared secret by law or by virtue of a decision taken by the authority, or in other words that there has been an intention to keep them from becoming public, regardless of the type of classification selected (for example, top secret or confidential). On the other hand, strict secrecy presupposes that the holder of the specific information wishes to keep it secret, that there is a legitimate interest at stake, and that the information is known or accessible only to a select group of persons (see ATF [Judgments of the Swiss Federal Court] 126 IV 236, point 2a, p. 242, and 2c/aa, p. 244). This state of affairs was not altered by the entry into force of paragraph 3 of this Article on 1 April 1998 (RO [ Recueil officiel – Official Collection of Federal Statutes] 1998 852 856; FF [ Feuille fédérale ] 1996 IV 533). That rule concerns not secrets in the substantive sense but rather instances of futile, petty or excessive concealment (see ATF 126 IV 236, point 2c/bb, p. 246). In order to exclude the application of paragraph 3, the court must therefore first of all examine the reasons for classifying the information as secret. It must, however, do so with restraint, without interfering with the discretionary power wielded by the authority which declared the information secret. It is sufficient that this declaration should nonetheless appear tenable vis-à-vis the content of the documents, investigations or deliberations in issue. Moreover, the journalists ’ viewpoint on the interest in publishing the information is irrelevant (see ATF 126 IV 236, point 2d, p. 246). In its Stoll v. Switzerland judgment of 10 December 2007, the European Court of Human Rights confirmed that this formal conception of secrecy was not contrary to Article 10 ECHR inasmuch as it did not prevent the Federal Court from determining whether the interference in issue was compatible with Article 10 ECHR, by assessing, in the context of its examination of Article 293, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code, the justification for classifying a given piece of information as secret, on the one hand, and weighing up the interests at stake, on the other (see Stoll v. Switzerland [GC], no. 69698/01, §§ 138-39, ECHR 2007-V).",

                "In pursuance of Article 184 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Canton of Vaud (CPP/VD), all investigations must remain secret until their final conclusion (see paragraph 1). The secrecy requirement relates to all the evidence uncovered by the investigation itself as well as all non-public decisions and investigative measures (see paragraph 2). The law also specifies that the following are bound by secrecy vis-à-vis anyone who does not have access to the case file: the judges and judicial staff (save in cases where disclosure would facilitate the investigation or is justified on public-order, administrative or judicial grounds; see Article 185 CPP/VD), and also the parties, their friends and relatives, their lawyers, the latter ’ s associates, consultants and staff, and any experts and witnesses. However, disclosure to friends or relatives by the parties or their lawyer is not punishable (see Article 185a CPP/VD). Lastly, the law provides for a range of exceptions. As an exception to Article 185, the cantonal investigating judge and, with the latter ’ s agreement, the judge responsible for the preliminary inquiry or senior police officers specially appointed by the cantonal government [ Conseil d ’ État ] (see Article 168, paragraph 3) may inform the press, radio or television about a pending investigation if so required by the public interest or considerations of fairness, particularly where public cooperation is required to shed light on an offence, in cases which are particularly serious or are already known to the general public, or where erroneous information must be corrected or the general public reassured (see Article 185b, paragraph 1, CPP/VD).",
                "The present case therefore concerns secrecy imposed by the law rather than by an official decision.",
                "7.3. As a general rule, the reason for the confidentiality of judicial investigations, which applies to most sets of cantonal criminal proceedings, is the need to protect the interests of the criminal proceedings by anticipating risks of collusion and the danger of evidence being tampered with or destroyed. Nevertheless, the interests of the accused must not be disregarded either, particularly vis-à-vis the presumption of innocence and, more broadly, the accused ’ s personal relations and interests (see Hauser, Schweri and Hartmann, Schweizerisches Strafprozessrecht, 6th ed., 2005, § 52, no. 6, p. 235; Gérard Piquerez, op. cit., § 134, no. 1066, p. 678; Gérard Piquerez, Procédure pénale suisse: manuel, 2nd ed., 2007, no. 849, pp. 559 et seq.), as well as the need to protect the opinion-forming process and the decision-making process within a State authority, as protected, precisely, by Article 293 of the Criminal Code (see ATF 126 IV 236, point 2c/aa, p. 245). The European Court of Human Rights has already had occasion to deem such a purpose legitimate in itself. The aim is to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary in accordance with the wording of Article 10 § 2 ECHR, which also mentions the protection of the reputation or rights of others (see Weber v. Switzerland, 22 May 1990, § 45, Series A no. 177, and Dupuis and Others v. France, no. 1914/02, § 32, 7 June 2007).",
                "Furthermore, in so far as the impugned publication concerned excerpts from records of interviews of the accused and reproduced certain letters sent by the latter to the investigating judge, this evidence can validly be classified secret, by prohibiting public access to it, as provided by the legislation of the Canton of Vaud. This is the inescapable conclusion as regards the records of interviews of the accused, as it would be inadmissible to allow such documents to be analysed in the public sphere, before the conclusion of the investigation, before the trial and out of context, in a manner liable to influence the decisions taken by the investigating judge and the trial court. It is also the only possible conclusion as regards the letters sent by the accused to the investigating judge, which focused on practical problems and criticisms of his lawyer (see Police Court judgment, point 4, p. 7). We might point out here that it appears from the impugned publication – which the cantonal authorities did not reproduce in full in their decisions, although they did refer to it and its content is not disputed – that the aforementioned practical problems concerned requests for temporary release and for access to personal effects (letters of 11 July 2003), for a change of cell (letter of 7 August 2003) and for authorisation to use the telephone (letter of 6 August 2003). Regardless of the guarantee of the presumption of innocence and the inferences concerning the detainee ’ s character which might be drawn during the criminal proceedings from such correspondence, the detainee, whose liberty is considerably restricted, even in respect of everyday acts relating to his private life, or indeed intimate sphere, can expect the authority restricting his liberty to protect him from public exposure of the practical details of his life as a remand prisoner and as a person facing charges (see Article 13 of the Constitution).",
                "It follows that in the instant case the information published by the appellant, in so far as it concerned the content of the records of his interviews and his correspondence with the investigating judge, cannot be described as a secret of minor importance for the purposes of Article 293, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code. That being so, the impugned publication constituted the factual elements of the offence provided for in Article 293, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code.",
                "7.4. Moreover, the information in question may be described as being secret in substantive terms because it was only accessible to a restricted number of persons (the investigating judge and the parties to the proceedings). Furthermore, the investigating authority was desirous to keep them secret, with not only a legitimate interest in doing so but an obligation under the Cantonal Code of Criminal Procedure, the justification for which was mentioned above (see point 7.3 above).",
                "7.5. Therefore, the only remaining point at issue is the existence of justification.",
                "8. In short, the appellant submits that he had the professional duty (under former Article 32 of the Criminal Code) as a journalist to publish the information in question because of what he describes as the obvious interest in the ‘ Lausanne Bridge ’ case for the population of French-speaking Switzerland. He considers that in the light of European case-law, the basic assumption should be that publication is justified in principle unless there is a pressing social need to maintain secrecy. From the standpoint of good faith, he submits that Article 32 should apply to journalists who are not responsible for the indiscretion committed by a third party and who receive information without committing any offence themselves other than the breach of secrecy stemming from the publication. Lastly, he contends that the mode of publication is not a relevant criterion.",
                "8.1. As regards the former point, the cantonal court found that while the accident of 8 July 2003, the circumstances of which were undoubtedly unusual, had triggered a great deal of public emotion, it had nevertheless, in legal terms, been simply a road accident with fatal consequences, and did not in itself entail any obvious public interest. It was not a case of collective trauma on the part of the Lausanne population, which would have justified reassuring the citizens and keeping them informed of the progress of the investigation (see judgment appealed against, point 2, p. 9).",
                "It is true that the ‘ Lausanne Bridge case ’ attracted extensive media coverage (see Police Court judgment, point 4, p. 8, to which the cantonal judgment refers (judgment appealed against, point B, p. 2)). However, this circumstance alone, alongside the unusual nature of the accident, is insufficient to substantiate a major public interest in publishing the confidential information in question. Unless it can be justified per se, the interest aroused among the public by media coverage of events cannot constitute a public interest in the disclosure of classified information, because that would mean that it would be sufficient to spark the public ’ s interest in a certain event in order to justify the subsequent publication of confidential information likely to maintain that interest. Furthermore, such a public interest is manifestly lacking as regards the letters that were published. As we have seen above (see point 7.3 above), these letters virtually exclusively concerned criticisms levelled by the accused against his lawyer and such practical problems as requests for temporary release, for access to personal effects, to change cells and to use the telephone. This type of information provides no relevant insights into the accident or the circumstances surrounding it. It relates to the private life, or indeed intimate sphere, of the person in custody, and it is difficult to see any interest which its publication could satisfy other than a certain kind of voyeurism. The same applies to the appellant ’ s requests to the investigating judge in relation to his choice of defence lawyer. Nor is it clear, as regards the records of his interviews, what political question or matter of public interest would have arisen or been worth debating in the public sphere, and the cantonal authorities explicitly ruled out the existence of any collective trauma which might have justified reassuring or informing the population. This finding of fact, which the appellant has not disputed in his public-law appeal, is binding on this court (see section 277 bis of the Federal Criminal Procedure Act). That being the case, the appellant fails to demonstrate the ‘ obvious ’ interest to the general public of the information published, and the cantonal court cannot be criticised for having concluded that at the very most, such an interest involved satisfying an unhealthy curiosity.",
                "8.2. The other two factors relied upon by the appellant concern his behaviour (good faith in access to information and mode of publication).",
                "8.2.1. It should first of all be noted that Article 293 of the Criminal Code punishes only the disclosure of information, irrespective of how the perpetrator obtained it. Moreover, even under Article 10 ECHR, the European Court does not attach decisive importance to this fact when considering whether applicants have fulfilled their duties and responsibilities. The determining fact is rather that they could not claim in good faith to be unaware that disclosure of the information was punishable by law (see Stoll, cited above, § 144, and Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ I). This point is well-established in the present case (see section B above).",
                "8.2.2. On the other hand, the mode of publication can play a more important role in the context of safeguarding freedom of expression. While the European Court of Human Rights reiterates that neither it, nor the domestic courts for that matter, should substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists, in weighing up the interests at stake it nevertheless takes account of the content, vocabulary and format of the publication, and of the headings and sub-headings (whether chosen by the journalist or the editors), and the accuracy of the information (see Stoll, cited above, §§ 146 et seq., especially 146, 147 and 149).",
                "In the instant case the cantonal court ruled that the tone adopted by the appellant in his article showed that his main concern was not, as he claims, to inform the general public about the State ’ s conduct of the criminal investigation. The headline of the article ( ‘ Questioning of the mad driver ’, ‘ the reckless driver ’ s version ’ ) already lacked objectivity. It suggested that the case had already been tried in the author ’ s view, in the sense that the fatalities on the Lausanne Bridge had been caused not by an ordinary motorist but by a ‘ mad driver ’, a man ‘ oblivious to the events and all the hubbub around him ’. The journalist concluded by wondering whether the driver was in fact doing his best to ‘ make himself impossible to defend ’. The manner in which he quoted the excerpts from the records of interviews and reproduced the letters sent by the defendant to the judge pointed to the motives of the author of the impugned article: he confined himself to sensationalism, his modus operandi being exclusively geared to satisfying the relatively unhealthy curiosity which anyone is liable to feel about this type of case. Readers of this highly biased publication would have formed an opinion and subjectively prejudged the future action to be taken by the courts regarding this case, without the least respect for the principle of presumption of innocence (see judgment appealed against, point 2, pp. 9 et seq.). The cantonal court concluded that this factor did not indicate that the public interest in receiving information prevailed. That court cannot be criticised on that account.",
                "8.3. The appellant also submitted that the records of interviews and the letters would in any case be mentioned in subsequent public hearings. He inferred from this that preserving the confidentiality of this information could therefore not be justified by any ‘ pressing social need ’.",
                "However, the mere possibility that the secrecy of criminal investigations might be lifted during a subsequent phase of proceedings, particularly during the trial, which is generally subject to the publicity principle, does not undermine the justification for keeping judicial investigations confidential, because the primary aim is to protect the opinion-forming and decision-making processes on the part not only of the trial court but also of the investigating authority, until the completion of this secret phase of proceedings. Moreover, far from being neutral and comprehensive, the publication in issue included comments and assessments which presented the information in issue in a particular light, without providing the opportunities for adversarial argument which are the very essence of proceedings in trial courts.",
                "8.4. Lastly, the appellant did not explicitly criticise the amount of the fine imposed on him. Nor did he challenge the refusal to grant him a probationary period after which the fine would be struck out (former Article 49, point 4, in conjunction with former Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code) under Swiss law. From the angle of weighing up the interest in the interference, we might simply note that the fine imposed, the amount of which took into account a previous conviction dating back to 1998 (imposition of a CHF 2,000 fine, which could be struck out after a two-year probationary period, for coercion and defamation), does not exceed half the amount of the appellant ’ s monthly income at the material time (see Police Court judgment, point 1, p. 5), and there is nothing to suggest that his freelance status at the time of the first-instance judgment led to any significant drop in his earnings. It should also be pointed out that at CHF 4,000 the amount of the fine is below the statutory maximum set out in former Article 106, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (as in force until 31 December 2006), and that this maximum amount, set by the legislature more than thirty years ago, was not revised until the entry into force of the new general section of the Criminal Code, which now sets a figure of CHF 10,000 (see Article 106, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code as in force since 1 January 2007). Furthermore, the sanction for the offence with which the appellant is charged did not prevent him from expressing his views, since it was imposed after the article had been published (see Stoll, cited above, § 156). That being the case, it is unclear, in view of the nature of the offence charged (the least serious in the classification set out in the Swiss Criminal Code), the amount of the fine and the time of its imposition, how the sanction imposed on the applicant could be regarded as a form of censorship.",
                "8.5. It follows from the foregoing that the appellant disclosed a secret within the meaning of Article 293, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code and that he cannot rely on any justifying factor in his favour. The decision appealed against does not violate federal law as interpreted in the light of the Convention provisions relied upon by the appellant.”",

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",

This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ...”"

It emphasises that the secrecy of investigations is geared to protecting, on the one hand, the interests of the criminal proceedings by anticipating risks of collusion and the danger of evidence being tampered with or destroyed and, on the other, the interests of the accused, notably from the angle of presumption of innocence and, more generally, his or her personal relations and interests.

France, no. 64915/01, § 70, ECHR 2004 ‑ VI; Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v. Spain, no. 34147/06 § 40, 21 September 2010; and Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 83 ). The concept of “private life” is a broad term which is not susceptible to exhaustive definition. It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person, and can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the person ’ s identity such as, for example, gender identification, sexual orientation, name and elements relating to a person ’ s right to his or her image (see S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 66, ECHR 2008). It covers personal information which individuals can legitimately expect should not be published without their consent (see Flinkkilä and Others v. Finland, no. 25576/04, § 75, 6 April 2010, and Saaristo and Others v. Finland, no. 184/06, § 61, 12 October 2010). In order for Article 8 to come into play, however, an attack on a person ’ s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be carried out in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 83)."

Although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private or family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, § 23, Series A no. 91; Armonienė v. Lithuania, no. 36919/02, § 36, 25 November 2008; Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 98; and Söderman v. Sweden [GC], no. 5786/08, § 78, ECHR 2013). That also applies to the protection of a person ’ s picture against abuse by third parties (see Schüssel v. Austria (dec.), no. 42409/98, 21 February 2002; Von Hannover, cited above, § 57; Reklos and Davourlis v. Greece, no. 1234/05, § 35, 15 January 2009; and Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 98)."

When examining the necessity of that restriction in a democratic society in the interests of the “protection of the reputation or rights of others”, the Court may be required to verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the Convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases, namely, on the one hand, freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 and, on the other, the right to respect for private life as enshrined in Article 8 (see Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS ), § 41; MGN Limited, § 142; and Axel Springer AG, § 84, all cited above)."

The Court takes the view that this type of information called for the highest level of protection under Article 8; that finding is especially important as the accused was not known to the public and the mere fact that he was the subject of a criminal investigation, albeit for a very serious offence, did not justify treating him in the same manner as a public figure, who voluntarily exposes himself to publicity (see, mutatis mutandis, and by contrast, Fressoz and Roire, cited above, § 50, and Egeland and Hanseid v.

Moreover, there is nothing in the case file to suggest that he was informed of the publication of the article and of the nature of the information it provided. In addition, he was probably suffering from mental disorders, thus increasing his vulnerability. In those circumstances, the cantonal authorities cannot be blamed for considering that, in order to fulfil their positive obligation to protect M.B. ’ s right to respect for his private life, they could not simply wait for M.B. himself to take the initiative in bringing civil proceedings against the applicant, and for consequently opting for an active approach, even one involving prosecution.",

Furthermore, the Court must be satisfied that the penalty does not amount to a form of censorship intended to discourage the press from expressing criticism. In the context of a debate on a topic of public interest, such a sanction is likely to deter journalists from contributing to public discussion of issues affecting the life of the community. By the same token, it is liable to hamper the press in performing its task as purveyor of information and public watchdog. In that connection, the fact of a person ’ s conviction may in some cases be more important than the minor nature of the penalty imposed (ibid., § 154)."

The applicant was originally given a suspended sentence of one month ’ s imprisonment (see paragraph 13 above). His sentence was subsequently commuted to a fine of CHF 4,000, which was set having regard to the applicant ’ s previous record and was not paid by the applicant but was advanced by his employer (see paragraph 14 above).

Where the effect of plea ‑ bargaining is that a criminal charge against the accused is determined in an accelerated form of judicial examination, this amounts, in substance, to a waiver of a number of procedural rights.

The applicants contended that there had been no obligation to disjoin the proceedings, and that it had been done with the aim of compelling X to give false evidence against them. They pointed out that they had not been party to the proceedings against X and could not have challenged the decisions or the evidence relating to that case. Despite this, the judgment against X had formed the basis of their conviction. Moreover, the testimony of X, the key witness in their case, had been unreliable because he had previously entered into plea-bargaining in the same criminal case and had had a vested interest in the outcome of the applicants ’ proceedings. In particular, his sentence could have been reversed in accordance with Article 317 § 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, if it had transpired that he had made false statements during his plea-bargaining. At the applicants ’ trial, in his capacity as a witness, he had had no choice but to reiterate the statements he had previously made as an accused when not under oath.

The applicants submitted that, contrary to the Government ’ s claim, the court which had examined their case had been bound by the earlier judgment in X ’ s case, which, by operation of Article 90 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was res judicata irrespective of whether the court had expressly referred to it as such."

When the cases had been disjoined no list of the material transferred had been drawn up. Accordingly, the applicants had had no knowledge as to what evidence had been attached to X ’ s file. They suggested that some exonerating evidence could have been concealed from them. They specifically referred to the collection of telephone-tapping records that had been incomplete in their own case files but had been fully disclosed in X ’ s file; the trial court had refused to allow them to access or examine the missing records."

The applicants also complained that the trial court had allowed X ’ s and other witness statements given during the investigation to be read out before the defence had had the opportunity to cross-examine them. The applicants submitted that those statements had reflected the investigators ’, not the witnesses ’ own accounts; reading them out during the applicants ’ trial had thus served to “remind” the witnesses of the official interpretation. The applicants had insisted at the trial on having a chance to cross-examine the relevant witnesses before the earlier statements had been read out, but the court had decided otherwise."

They maintained, in particular, that VLK had entered into a lawful transaction with Kirovles, and that the parties had concluded, implemented and terminated the contract freely and in accordance with their discretion and commercial interests. This transaction had not been challenged as invalid, a sham, or irregular. In essence, the second applicant had been prosecuted for carrying out the ordinary activities of a commercial intermediary, and the first applicant for advising the parties to the transaction.

The Court accepts that in complex criminal proceedings involving several persons who cannot be tried together, references by the trial court to the participation of third parties, who may later be tried separately, may be indispensable for the assessment of the guilt of those on trial. Criminal courts are obliged to establish the facts of the case relevant for the assessment of the legal responsibility of the accused as accurately and precisely as possible, and they cannot present established facts as mere allegations or suspicions. This also applies to facts related to the involvement of third parties, though if such facts have to be introduced, the court should avoid giving more information than necessary for the assessment of the legal responsibility of those accused in the trial before it. Even if the law expressly states that no inferences about the guilt of a person can be drawn from criminal proceedings in which he or she has not participated, judicial decisions must be worded so as to avoid any potential pre ‑ judgment about the third party ’ s guilt in order not to jeopardise the fair examination of the charges in the separate proceedings (see Karaman, cited above, §§ 64 ‑ 65 )."

Where the effect of plea ‑ bargaining is that a criminal charge against the accused is determined in an accelerated form of judicial examination, this amounts, in substance, to a waiver of a number of procedural rights. To be effective for Convention purposes, therefore, any waiver of procedural rights must always be established in an unequivocal manner, must be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance and must not run counter to any important public interest (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 135, 17 September 2009, and Natsvlishvili and Togonidze v. Georgia, no. 9043/05, § § 90-91, ECHR 2014 (extracts ), with further references )."

The Court observes that the applicants ’ complaints about the manner in which evidence was admitted and assessed and the way the witnesses were examined converge on the same underlying allegation that the criminal proceedings against X and the two applicants had been structured in a way which rendered the proceedings as a whole unfair. They effectively alleged that X ’ s conviction in separate accelerated proceedings had been instrumental in circumventing important guarantees they would have been entitled to if all three co-accused had been tried together. Likewise, the complaint lodged under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention about the formulae used in the judgment against X and the prejudicial impact which that had on the applicants ’ sentence, essentially refers to the same underlying issue. It follows that even though each of the complaints under Article 6 §§ 1, 2 and 3(d) of the Convention would in principle be capable of raising a separate issue under the Convention, in the present case it is appropriate to treat the specific allegations as elements of general fairness."

In the present case, the criminal charges against the applicants were based on the same facts as those against X, and the three individuals were accused of conspiring to steal the same assets. It is therefore undeniable that any facts established in the proceedings against X and any legal findings made therein would have been directly relevant to the applicants ’ case. In such circumstances, it was essential for safeguards to be in place to ensure that the procedural steps and decisions taken in the proceedings against X would not undermine the fairness of the hearing in the subsequent proceedings against the applicants. This was particularly so, given that the applicants were legally precluded from any form of participation in the disjoined proceedings as they had not been granted any status which would have allowed them to challenge the decisions and findings made therein."

The Court has previously highlighted the first and most obvious guarantee to be secured when co-accused are tried in separate sets of proceedings, notably the courts ’ obligation to refrain from any statements that may have a prejudicial effect on the pending proceedings, even if they are not binding (see Karaman, cited above, §§ 42-43 and 64-56 ). If the nature of the charges makes it unavoidable for the involvement of third parties to be established in one set of proceedings and those findings would be consequential on the assessment of the legal responsibility of the third parties tried separately, this should be considered as a serious obstacle for disjoining the cases. Any decision to examine cases with such strong factual ties in separate criminal proceedings must be based on a careful assessment of all countervailing interests, and the co-accused must be given an opportunity to object to the cases being separated."

The second requirement for the conduct of concurrent proceedings is that the quality of res judicata would not be attached to facts admitted in a case to which the individuals were not party. The state of the evidence admitted in one case must remain purely relative and its effect strictly limited to that particular set of proceedings. In other words, in the present case no finding of fact made in the proceedings against X could have been admitted in the applicants ’ case without full and proper examination at the applicants ’ trial. Moreover, the procedure followed by the court in X ’ s case had been accelerated, and the establishment of facts had been a result of plea-bargaining, not the judicial examination of evidence. Consequently, the facts relied on in that case had been legally assumed rather than proven. As such, they could not have been transposed to another set of criminal proceedings without their admissibility and credibility being scrutinised and validated in those other proceedings, in an adversarial manner, like all other evidence."

The Court accepts the applicants ’ argument that the Leninskiy District Court of Kirov had worded its judgment of 24 December 2012 as regards X so that no doubt could remain either about their identities or involvement in the crime of which X had been convicted. Although the said District Court, as the Government rightly pointed out, could not find the applicants guilty in those proceedings, it expressed its findings of fact and opinion about their participation in the offence in such terms which could not be defined as anything but prejudicial."

Turning to the question of res judicata, the Court takes cognisance of the Government ’ s argument that the courts adjudicating the applicants ’ criminal case had not been bound by the judgment in X ’ s case. It notes, however, that Article 90 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as worded at the material time, expressly afforded the force of res judicata to judgments even if issued in accelerated proceedings (see paragraph 79 above). Moreover, by stating that “ Circumstances established in a judgment ... shall be accepted by a court ... without additional verification”, it set forth the rule whereby not only a finding of guilt of an accused but also findings of fact would formally have potential prejudicial effect. Even though in accordance with Article 90, a judgment cannot predetermine the guilt of those who have not participated in the criminal case under consideration, the fact that the circumstances established in the judgment against X had the force of res judicata in effect contravened that prohibition."

                "108. The Government argued that in the applicants ’ case the trial court had been obliged to examine all evidence and witnesses and to base its assessment exclusively on the material and testimony presented at the hearing. Even so, the Court considers that in the circumstances, the courts acting in concurrent proceedings had an obvious incentive to remain concordant, because any conflicting findings made in related cases could undermine the validity of both judgments issued by the same court. The Court considers that in the present case, the risk of issuing contradictory judgments was a factor that discouraged the judges from finding out the truth and diminished their capacity to administer justice, thus causing irreparable damage to the court ’ s independence, impartiality and, more generally, its ability to ensure a fair hearing. In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that the judgment of 24 December 2012 had a prejudicial effect on the criminal proceedings against the applicants, and reference to that judgment in the applicants ’ sentence, even without express reliance on it, accentuated that effect."
            ],
            [
                "109. In the same vein, the Court considers that the separation of the cases, particularly X ’ s conviction with the use of plea-bargaining and accelerated proceedings, compromised his competence as a witness in the applicants ’ case. As noted above, his conviction was based on the version of events formulated by the prosecution and the accused in the plea-bargaining process, and it was not required that that account be verified or corroborated by other evidence. Standing later as a witness, X was compelled to repeat his statements made as an accused during plea-bargaining. Indeed, if during the applicants ’ trial X ’ s earlier statement had been exposed as false, the judgment issued on the basis of his plea-bargaining agreement could have been reversed, thus depriving him of the negotiated reduction of his sentence. Moreover, by allowing X ’ s earlier statements to be read out at the trial before the defence could cross-examine him as a witness, the court could give an independent observer the impression that it had encouraged the witness to maintain a particular version of events. Everything above confirms the applicants ’ argument that the procedure in which evidence had been obtained from X and used in their trial had been suggestive of manipulation incompatible with the notion of a fair hearing."

Turning to the point of the allegedly arbitrary application of criminal law, the Court observes that the second applicant, Mr Ofitserov, was convicted of facilitating embezzlement committed by X. The acts imputable to him consisted of setting up a timber trading company VLK, concluding on behalf of that company a framework contract with a timber supplier, Kirovles, and buying Kirovles ’ timber and reselling it to customers at 7% commission, in accordance with the framework contract and its annexes containing specific sales contracts based on its heads of terms. The first applicant, Mr Navalnyy, was convicted of introducing the second applicant to X, Kirovles ’ director, and of fostering commercial ties between VLK and Kirovles, acts defined as organising embezzlement."

In the original charges, these acts had been defined as deception or abuse of trust, an offence under Article 165 of the Criminal Code, allegedly committed against X, but those charges were dropped for lack of corpus delicti. Subsequently, the prosecution and the courts decided that it had been X who had embezzled Kirovles ’ assets by entering into a loss ‑ making transaction, and the applicants were assigned the roles of his accomplices."

            [
                "112. The Court observes that under Russian law, limited liability companies such as VLK are defined as commercial entities whose main purpose is deriving profits (Article 50 of the Civil Code). The Court also notes that the domestic courts did not establish, and it was not even argued, that VLK by signing the contract and charging commission had pursued a goal other than deriving profit from timber resale. Moreover, neither the validity of the sales contract between VLK and Kirovles, nor its legal nature, were called into question. It had not been imputed to either X or the applicants that they had concluded a sham transaction or that it had implied a money laundering, tax evasion or kick-back scheme, or that the parties had conspired in advance to turn the proceeds from VLK ’ s commission to some other unlawful or dubious purpose. On the contrary, it transpires from the material in the case file that the two parties to the contract had pursued commercial goals independently of each other and that those goals were precisely those that had been stipulated in the contract. It is also noteworthy that when the court referred to Article 10 § 1 of the Civil Code and found that the transaction had caused damage to Kirovles, it had not established that doing so had been the applicants ’ exclusive goal, or that they had acted in bad faith or in breach of fair competition rules, contrary to that Article."

            [
                "113. As regards Kirovles ’ losses imputed to VLK and, ultimately, the applicants, the Court observes that neither the nature of the transaction nor the context in which it was concluded imposed or implied a requirement that the buyer, VLK, would have to exercise a special duty of care towards the seller, Kirovles, to ensure that the latter sold the timber at the best possible price. Such a requirement would have indeed been an exception to the principle that each party carries the risks associated with a transaction in accordance with the terms of contract. In the present case, there was no basis for such an exception or legal obstacle for the parties to agree on VLK ’ s commission and set it out in the contract the way they did."

It may be derived from X ’ s statements at the applicants ’ trial that he concluded the contract with VLK because he was under the impression that he was obliged to do so by the first applicant because he had associated him with the Governor ’ s team. However, the trial court also found that the first applicant had no mandate to compel X to choose VLK as a commercial partner and had not made any false representations to the contrary. Accordingly, even if X ’ s assertions were true and he had indeed entered into an unprofitable transaction for the wrong reasons, no causal link was established between the applicants ’ conduct and Kirovles ’ losses, if any. Moreover, the losses of Kirovles were not established on the basis of VLK ’ s commission, inter alia, but were found to constitute the total amount payable for the timber under the contract."

The Court considers that in the present case the questions of interpretation and application of national law go beyond a regular assessment of the applicants ’ individual criminal responsibility or the establishment of corpus delicti, matters which are primarily within the domestic courts ’ domain. It is confronted with a situation where the acts described as criminal fell entirely outside the scope of the provision under which the applicants were convicted and were not concordant with its intended aim. In other words, the criminal law was arbitrarily and unforeseeably construed to the detriment of the applicants, leading to a manifestly unreasonable outcome of the trial."

The Court observes that the anti-corruption campaign run by the first applicant gained its momentum in the course of 2010; that year it targeted high-ranking officials, including the President of the Russian Federation, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chief of the Investigative Committee. Mr Navalnyy ’ s investigations attracted the increasing attention of his Internet blog followers, but also a wider audience through other media republishing the blog content and giving him airtime. Irrespective of whether the officials concerned acknowledged the publications, and whether or not they contested the allegations, they undoubtedly found them unwelcome. Furthermore, it was becoming clear that the first applicant would not confine his revelations to the audience of a niche press, but that his aspiration was to become an acting politician at the national level, capable of reaching out to a wider public. Since the conviction came into force he has been ineligible to stand for elections and has been restricted in his freedom of movement. It is also relevant that his criminal record has been relied on to justify his house arrest, the terms of which included, among other restrictions, a ban on making public statements, even those unrelated to the criminal proceedings."

Even so, it is impossible to overlook that the first Kirovles inquiry was opened on 9 December 2010, three weeks after the publication of the big-time financial scandal relating to the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline project and implicating Russia ’ s top officials. Over the next two years the inquiry stopped and restarted several times, but in 2012 it was resolutely reopened under the direct orders of Mr Bastrykin, the Chief of the Investigative Committee. This upsurge came at a period when the first applicant was investigating Mr Bastrykin ’ s own off-duty activities; this investigation resulted in the publication of 26 July 2012 exposing Mr Bastrykin ’ s business and residence status as incompatible with his office (see paragraph 31 above). The criminal case was reopened under Mr Bastrykin ’ s direct orders, and this was reflected in his speech of 5 July 2012 when he deplored its termination and unequivocally pledged to take disciplinary action against any investigator failing to pursue the first applicant."

It was therefore the duty of the domestic courts to scrutinise his allegations of political pressure and to decide whether, despite that link, there had been a genuine cause for bringing him to justice. The same goes for the second applicant who had an arguable claim that he was only targeted as a vehicle for also bringing the first applicant into the orbit of the criminal case, a reason equally unrelated to the true purposes of a criminal prosecution. Having omitted to address these allegations the courts have themselves heightened the concerns that the real reason for the applicants ’ prosecution and conviction was a political one."

It is the Convention organs'case ‑ law that the requirement of Article 5 § 1 (a) that a person be lawfully detained after “ conviction by a competent court ” does not imply that the Court has to subject the proceedings leading to that conviction to a comprehensive scrutiny and verify whether they have fully complied with all the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see Drozd and Janousek v. France and Spain, judgment of 26 June 1992, Series A no. 240, pp. 34 ‑ 35, § 110, and Iribarne Pérez v. France, no. 16462/90, Commission decision of 19 January 1994, Decisions and Reports 76, p. 18 ). However, the Court has also held that if a “ conviction ” is the result of proceedings which were a “flagrant denial of justice”, i.e. were “manifestly contrary to the provisions of Article 6 or the principles embodied therein”, the resulting deprivation of liberty would not be justified under Article 5 § 1 (a) (see Drozd and Janousek, cited above, ibid., and, more recently, Ilaşcu and Others v.

His detention therefore falls within the ambit of Article 5 § 1 (a). There can be no question that the sentence of imprisonment was lawful under Bulgarian law. Neither can it be said that the applicant's detention is not in conformity with the purposes of the deprivation of liberty permitted by Article 5 § 1 (a). Finally, there is no indication that his conviction had no factual basis or was arbitrary."

The issue is therefore whether the requirement of Article 6 to ensure the right of the accused to be present during the proceedings against him or her is so basic as to render proceedings conducted in absentia and whose reopening has been refused a “flagrant denial of justice”, i.e. “manifestly contrary to the provisions of Article 6 or the principles embodied therein”."

                "55. In the case of Einhorn v. France ((dec.), no. 71555/01, ECHR 2001 ‑ XI) the Court had an occasion to address the issue whether criminal proceedings conducted in absentia represent a “denial of justice”. In that case the United States of America were seeking the extradition from France of a person convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia. The Court held that “a denial of justice undoubtedly occurs where a person convicted in absentia is unable subsequently to obtain from a court which has heard him a fresh determination of the merits of the charge, in respect of both law and fact, where it has not been unequivocally established that he has waived his right to appear and to defend himself” ( see § 33 of the decision ). This conclusion is in line with the established case-law confirming that the right of an accused to participate in person in the proceedings is a fundamental element of a fair trial (see Colozza v. Italy, judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, p. 14, § 27, F.C.B. v. Italy, judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 208 ‑ B, p. 21, § 33, T. v. Italy, judgment of 12 October 1992, Series A no. 245 ‑ C, p. 41, § 26, Yavuz v. Austria, no. 46549/99, § 45, 27 May 2004, and Novoselov v. Russia (dec.), no. 66460/01, 8 July 2004 ). It is of capital importance that a criminal defendant should appear, both because of his or her right to a hearing and because of the need to verify the accuracy of his or her statements and compare them with those of the victim – whose interests need to be protected – and of the witnesses (see Poitrimol v. France, judgment of 23 November 1993, Series A no. 277 ‑ A, p. 15, § 35, and Krombach v. France, no. 29731/96, § 86, ECHR 2001 ‑ II ). For these reasons the Court has consistently held that when domestic law permits a trial to be held notwithstanding the absence of a person “charged with a criminal offence” that person should, once he or she becomes aware of the proceedings, be able to obtain from a court which has heard him or her a fresh determination of the merits of the charge (see Colozza, cited above, p. 15, § 29, Poitrimol, cited above, pp. 13-14, § 31, Medenica v. Switzerland, no. 20491/92, § 54, ECHR 2001 ‑ VI, and Krombach, cited above, § 85 ). The only situation where it is open to question whether this requirement applies is when the accused has waived his or her right to appear and to defend himself or herself, but at all events such a waiver must, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance ( see Poitrimol, cited above, ibid.)."

                "56. It may thus be considered that the duty to guarantee the right of a criminal defendant to be present in the courtroom – either during the original proceedings or in a retrial after he or she emerges – ranks as one of the essential requirements of Article 6 and is deeply entrenched in that provision. Therefore, criminal proceedings which have been held in absentia and whose reopening has been subsequently refused, without any indication that the accused has waived his or her right to be present during the trial, may fairly be described as “ manifestly contrary to the provisions of Article 6 or the principles embodied therein ”."

There is no indication – and it has not been argued by the respondent Government – that he has waived, either expressly or tacitly, his right to appear and defend himself. Therefore, in order for the proceedings leading to his conviction to not represent a “ denial of justice”, he should have had the opportunity to have them reopened and the merits of the rape charges against him determined in his presence. Since 1 January 2000 Bulgarian law expressly provides for such a possibility (see paragraph 36 above). However, when the applicant requested reopening on the basis of the new Article 362a of the CCP in February 2001 – approximately one year after his arrest –, the Supreme Court of Cassation refused, essentially on the ground that the case ‑ file of the original proceedings had been destroyed in 1997, which, in its view, rendered a rehearing impossible in practice (see paragraph 33 above). In this connection, it is noteworthy that the applicant subsequently requested the restoration of the case ‑ file by the Pernik District Court, but has apparently received no reply to his request (see paragraph 34 above). The applicant was thus deprived of the possibility to obtain from a court, which has heard him, a fresh determination of the merits of the charges on which he was convicted."

Therefore, while his initial deprivation of liberty in February 2000 may be deemed justified under Article 5 § 1 (a), having been effected for the purpose of enforcing a lawful sentence, it ceased to be so after 19 July 2001, when the Supreme Court of Cassation refused reopening of the proceedings.

For instance, in a series of cases against the United Kingdom concerning indeterminate prison sentences, Article 5 § 4 was considered applicable even after a conviction, because the legality of the detention depended on factors which were not incorporated in the original conviction and sentence (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114, pp. 28 ‑ 29, § § 5 5 ‑ 59, Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 October 1990, Series A no. 190 ‑ A, pp. 25 ‑ 30, § § 65 ‑ 78, Hussain v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ I, pp. 267 ‑ 70, § § 47 ‑ 54, and V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24888/94, § 119, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX).

Belgium (judgment of 24 June 1982, Series A no. 50, pp. 23 ‑ 27, § § 44 ‑ 49 ), in respect of the Belgian system of placing recidivists and habitual offenders at the Government's disposal."

                "66. In the instant case, the applicant was arrested more than ten years after the entry into force of his sentence (see paragraphs 16 and 23 above). Bulgarian law contains a statute of limitations for the enforcement of sentences, which in the applicant's case is ten years (see paragraph 37 above). Thus, after the expiry of the limitation period imprisonment is no longer possible, unless the running of the period has been interrupted. The applicant's objection was met exactly with that argument (see paragraphs 25, 27, 29 and 31 above). There was, therefore, an issue of fact determinative of the legality of his detention, which was independent of, and distinct from, the subject ‑ matter of his 1989 conviction and sentence. Accordingly, the applicant should have been able to have it resolved by a court meeting the requirements of Article 5 § 4. However, under Bulgarian law all issues affecting the legality of execution of sentences of imprisonment are entrusted to the competent prosecutor (see paragraph 38 above). There is no provision expressly providing for judicial review of these issues (ibid.) and there exists no general habeas corpus procedure applying to all kinds of deprivation of liberty. The Government argued that the applicant could have relied on Article 373 § 1 (1) of the CCP to obtain a judicial determination of the legality of his imprisonment. They submitted that this provision empowered the court which had delivered the sentence to review the legality of the applicant's detention imposed allegedly in spite of the expiry of the limitation period. However, the Court is not persuaded that this is indeed the case, for the following reasons: (i) Article 373 § 1 (1) of the CCP deals with the interpretation of the trial court's judgment if it is for some reason unclear, not with issues affecting the subsequent legality of the deprivation of liberty (see paragraph 38 above); (ii) the Government have not identified and, indeed, there is, to the Court's knowledge, no reported case ‑ law or doctrine opinions supporting the Government's averment. The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 § 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see Vachev v.

                "30. In its decision no. U-III/543/1999 of 26 November 2008 the Constitutional Court held, in so far as relevant, as follows:",
                "“6. The question before the Constitutional Court is whether there was a second trial concerning an event constituting the offence for which the General Amnesty Act was applied, and thus whether the proceedings concerned a ‘ same offence ’ in respect of which, under Article 31 § 2 of the Constitution, it is not possible to institute a new, separate and unrelated set of proceedings. Such proceedings would infringe [the principle of] legal certainty and permit multiple sanctions to be imposed for one and the same conduct which may be the subject of only one criminal sanction. In answering this question, the Constitutional Court should examine two issues: (a) the similarity between the descriptions of the events constituting the offences with which the appellant was charged in the first and second set of proceedings, in order to verify whether the decision on the application of amnesty and the final conviction in the subsequent proceedings concern the same subject, that is, the same ‘ criminal quantity ’, irrespective of whether they concern the same historical events; and after that ... (b) whether the case in issue concerns a situation in which it was not possible to bring fresh charges in relation to the facts already adjudicated in the first decisions of the courts (applying the amnesty), but in which, under Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution, it was possible to seek the reopening of the proceedings as provided for by the relevant law. Article 406 § 1 (5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows for the reopening of proceedings which were terminated by a final judgment dismissing the charges, where ‘ it has been established that amnesty, pardon, statutory limitation or other circumstances excluding criminal prosecution are not applicable to the criminal offence referred to in the judgment dismissing the charges ’.",
                "6.1. The Constitutional Court can examine the similarity between the descriptions of the events constituting the offences only by reference to the normative standards. In so doing it is bound, just like the lower courts, by the constituent elements of the offences, irrespective of their legal classification. The descriptions of the events forming the basis for the charges in the judgment of the Bjelovar Military Court (no. K-85/95-24) and the Supreme Court (no. IKž-257/96), and the impugned judgments of the Sisak County Court (no. K-108/97) and the Supreme Court (no. I Kž-211/1998-3), undoubtedly suggest that they concern the same events, which were merely given different legal classifications. All the relevant facts had been established by the Bjelovar Military Court (which finally terminated the proceedings) and no other new facts were established in the subsequent proceedings before the Sisak County Court. The only difference in the description of the charges was in the time of the commission of the offences, which does not suggest that the events were different but rather that the courts were unable to establish the exact time of the offences. As regards the identical nature of the events, it is also relevant to note that the Supreme Court emphasised in the impugned judgment that the events were the same, so there is no doubt about this aspect.",
                "6.2. In the impugned judgment the Supreme Court held that the conduct in issue constituted not only the offence of armed rebellion under Article 235 § 1 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia, in respect of which the judgment dismissing the charges was adopted, but also the offence of war crimes against the civilian population under Article 120 §§ 1 and 2 of the Basic Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia, the offence of which [the appellant] was later convicted. It follows from this reasoning of the Supreme Court that the same conduct constituted the elements of two offences and that the situation was one of a single act constituting various offences.",
                "6.3. The Constitutional Court finds that in the impugned judgment the Supreme Court erred in finding that the same perpetrator, after a final judgment had been adopted in respect of a single act constituting one offence, could be tried again in the new set of proceedings for the same act constituting another offence. Under Article 336 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the court is not bound by the prosecutor ’ s classification of the offence. The Bjelovar Military Court, if it considered that the facts underlying the charges constituted the offence of war crimes against the civilian population under Article 120 § 1 of the Basic Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia, should therefore have found that it had no competence to determine the case (because it had no competence to try war crimes), and should have forwarded the case to the competent court, which could have convicted [the appellant] of the offence of war crimes against the civilian population, in respect of which no amnesty could be applied. Since the Bjelovar Military Court did not act in such a manner, it follows that, owing to the final nature of its judgment, the decision dismissing the charges became res judicata. The subsequent conviction in this case is a violation of the ne bis in idem rule, irrespective of the fact that the operative part of the first judgment did not concern ‘ the merits ’, sometimes understood simply as a resolution of the question whether the accused committed the offence or not. The formal distinction between an acquittal and a judgment dismissing the charges cannot be the only criterion for the resolution of the question whether a new and unrelated set of criminal proceedings may be instituted in respect of the same ‘ criminal quantity ’ : although it is contained in the judgment dismissing the charges, the decision on the application of amnesty, in the legal sense, creates the same legal consequences as an acquittal, and in both judgments a factual issue remains unproven.",
                "6.4. Therefore the Constitutional Court cannot accept the reasoning of the Supreme Court ’ s judgment no. I Kž-211/1998-3 of 1 April 1999, according to which the judgment or ruling on the discontinuance of the proceedings for the offence of armed rebellion concerning the same event does not exclude the possibility of a subsequent prosecution and conviction for the offence of war crimes against the civilian population on the ground that the latter offence endangers not only the values of the Republic of Croatia but also humanity in general and international law. In any event, the Supreme Court later departed from that position in case no. I Kž-8/00-3 of 18 September 2002, finding that the judgment dismissing the charges ‘ without any doubt concerns the same event, in terms of the time, place and manner of commission; the event was simply given a different classification in the impugned judgment than in the ruling of the Zagreb Military Court ’. It also stated the following: ‘ When, as in the case in issue, the criminal proceedings have been discontinued in respect of the offence under Article 244 § 2 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia, and where the actions ... are identical to those of which [the accused] was found guilty in the impugned judgment ... under the ne bis in idem principle provided for in Article 32 § 2 of the Constitution, new criminal proceedings cannot be instituted because the matter has been adjudicated. ’"

These obligations arise notably in respect of those violations recognized as criminal under either domestic or international law, such as torture and similar cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment (article 7), summary and arbitrary killing (article 6) and enforced disappearance (articles 7 and 9 and, frequently, 6). Indeed, the problem of impunity for these violations, a matter of sustained concern by the Committee, may well be an important contributing element in the recurrence of the violations.

At the inter-state level, it serves to internationally de-legitimise any legislative, administrative or judicial act authorising torture. It would be senseless to argue, on the one hand, that on account of the jus cogens value of the prohibition against torture, treaties or customary rules providing for torture would be null and void ab initio, and then be unmindful of a State say, taking national measures authorising or condoning torture or absolving its perpetrators through an amnesty law. If such a situation were to arise, the national measures, violating the general principle and any relevant treaty provision, would produce the legal effects discussed above and in addition would not be accorded international legal recognition. Proceedings could be initiated by potential victims if they had locus standi before a competent international or national judicial body with a view to asking it to hold the national measure to be internationally unlawful; or the victim could bring a civil suit for damage in a foreign court, which would therefore be asked inter alia to disregard the legal value of the national authorising act. What is even more important is that perpetrators of torture acting upon or benefiting from those national measures may nevertheless be held criminally responsible for torture, whether in a foreign State, or in their own State under a subsequent regime. In short, in spite of possible national authorisation by legislative or judicial bodies to violate the principle banning torture, individuals remain bound to comply with that principle.

With regard to the ne bis in idem principle, although it is acknowledged as a human right in Article 8(4) of the American Convention, it is not an absolute right, and therefore, is not applicable where: i ) the intervention of the court that heard the case and decided to dismiss it or to acquit a person responsible for violating human rights or international law, was intended to shield the accused party from criminal responsibility; ii) the proceedings were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with due procedural guarantees, or iii) there was no real intent to bring those responsible to justice. A judgment rendered in the foregoing circumstances produces an ‘ apparent ’ or ‘ fraudulent ’ res judicata case. On the other hand, the Court believes that if there appear new facts or evidence that make it possible to ascertain the identity of those responsible for human rights violations or for crimes against humanity, investigations can be reopened, even if the case ended in an acquittal with the authority of a final judgment, since the dictates of justice, the rights of the victims, and the spirit and the wording of the American Convention supersedes the protection of the ne bis in idem principle.",

In addition, the State asserted that ‘ involving other people who might be criminally liable is subject to any new conclusions reached by the Ministerio Público [General Attorney ’ s Office] and the Judiciary in investigating the events and meting out punishments ’, and that ‘ the military court ’ s decision to dismiss the case has no legal value for the General Attorney ’ s Office ’ s preliminary investigation.

Similarly, the Special Court for Sierra Leone considered that the amnesty laws of said country were not applicable to serious international crimes.

This is because amnesties or similar mechanisms have been one of the obstacles cited by States in order not to comply with their obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish, as appropriate, those responsible for grave human rights violations. Also, several States Parties of the Organization of American States, through their highest courts of justice, have incorporated the said standards, observing their international obligations in good faith. Consequently, for purposes of this case, the Court reiterates the inadmissibility of ‘ amnesty provisions, provisions on prescription, and the establishment of exclusions of responsibility that seek to prevent the investigation and punishment of those responsible for grave human rights violations such as torture, summary, extrajudicial or arbitrary execution, and forced disappearance, all of which are prohibited because they violate non- derogable rights recognized by international human rights law. ’",

However, contrary to the cases examined previously by this Court, the instant case deals with a general amnesty law that relates to acts committed in the context of an internal armed conflict. Therefore, the Court finds it pertinent, when analyzing the compatibility of the Law of General Amnesty for the Consolidation of Peace with the international obligations arising from the American Convention and its application to the case of the Massacres of El Mozote and Nearby Places, to do so also in light of the provisions of Protocol II Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, as well as of the specific terms in which it was agreed to end hostilities, which put an end to the conflict in El Salvador and, in particular, of Chapter I ( ‘ Armed Forces ’ ), section 5 ( ‘ End to impunity ’ ), of the Peace Accord of January 16, 1992.",

Consequently, it may be understood that article 6(5) of Additional Protocol II refers to extensive amnesties in relation to those who have taken part in the non-international armed conflict or who are deprived of liberty for reasons related to the armed conflict, provided that this does not involve facts, such as those of the instant case, that can be categorized as war crimes, and even crimes against humanity. ”",

Insofar as genocide, torture and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions are concerned, the grant of an amnesty, without any prosecution and punishment, would infringe upon Cambodia ’ s treaty obligations to prosecute and punish the authors of such crimes, as set out in the Genocide Convention, the Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions. Cambodia, which has ratified the ICCPR, also had and continues to have an obligation to ensure that victims of crimes against humanity which, by definition, cause serious violations of human rights, were and are afforded an effective remedy. This obligation would generally require the State to prosecute and punish the authors of violations. The grant of an amnesty, which implies abolition and forgetfulness of the offence for crimes against humanity, would not have conformed with Cambodia ’ s obligation under the ICCPR to prosecute and punish authors of serious violations of human rights or otherwise provide an effective remedy to the victims.

The submission by the Prosecution that there is a ‘ crystallising international norm that a government cannot grant amnesty for serious violations of crimes under international law ’ is amply supported by materials placed before this Court. The opinion of both amici curiae that it has crystallised may not be entirely correct, but that is no reason why this court in forming its own opinion should ignore the strength of their argument and the weight of materials they place before the Court. It is accepted that such a norm is developing under international law. Counsel for Kallon submitted that there is, as yet, no universal acceptance that amnesties are unlawful under international law, but, as amply pointed out by Professor Orentlicher, there are several treaties requiring prosecution for such crimes. These include the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the four Geneva conventions. There are also quite a number of resolutions of the UN General Assembly and the Security Council reaffirming a state obligation to prosecute or bring to justice. Redress has appended to its written submissions materials which include relevant conclusions of the Committee against torture, findings of the Human Rights Commission, and relevant judgments of the Inter-American Court.",

The Court reiterates that there are two tests for assessing whether a tribunal is impartial within the meaning of Article 6 § 1: the first consists in seeking to determine the personal conviction of a particular judge in a given case and the second in ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see, among other authorities, Gautrin and Others v. France, § 58, 20 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III).",
                "44. As regards the subjective test, the Court first notes that the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see Wettstein v. Switzerland, no. 33958/96, § 43, ECHR 2000-XII). In the instant case, the Court is not convinced that there is sufficient evidence to establish that any personal bias was shown by judge M.K. when he sat as a member of the Osijek County Court which found the applicant guilty of war crimes against the civilian population and sentenced him to fourteen years ’ imprisonment.",
                "45. As regards the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge ’ s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise justified doubts as to his or her impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Ferrantelli and Santangelo v. Italy, 7 August 1996, § 58, Reports 1996-III; Wettstein, cited above, § 44; and Micallef v. Malta, no. 17056/06, § 74, 15 January 2008). In this respect even appearances may be of a certain importance or, in other words, ‘ justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done ’ (see De Cubber v.

The charges against the applicant in these two sets of proceedings overlapped to a certain extent (see § 66 below).",

The first set of proceedings was terminated on the basis of the General Amnesty Act, since the trial court found that the charges against the applicant fell within the scope of the general amnesty. In those proceedings the facts of the case were not assessed, nor was the question of the applicant ’ s guilt examined.

In this connection the Court reiterates at the outset that the requirements of paragraph 3 of Article 6 are to be seen as particular aspects of the right to a fair trial guaranteed by paragraph 1 (see, among other authorities, Balliu v. Albania, no. 74727/01, § 25, 16 June 2005). On the whole, the Court is called upon to examine whether the criminal proceedings against the applicant, in their entirety, were fair (see, among other authorities, Imbrioscia v.

However, where the accused disturbs order in the courtroom the trial court cannot be expected to remain passive and to allow such behaviour. It is a normal duty of the trial panel to maintain order in the courtroom and the rules envisaged for that purpose apply equally to all present, including the accused.",

The interpretation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) of Article 6 § 5 of the second Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions suggested that States might not grant amnesty to persons suspected of, accused of or sentenced for war crimes. However, an analysis of the travaux préparatoires of that Article showed that the only States which had referred to the question of perpetrators of international crimes, the former USSR and some of its satellite States, had linked that issue to that of foreign mercenaries. It was curious that the ICRC had interpreted Article 6 § 5 as excluding only war criminals and not perpetrators of other international crimes from its ambit, since the statements of the former USSR on which the ICRC relied had specifically provided for the prosecution of perpetrators of crimes against humanity and crimes against peace. It was difficult to see what arguments would justify the exclusion of war criminals but not of perpetrators of genocide and crimes against humanity from the potential scope of application of an amnesty. Furthermore, the ICRC referred to instances of non-international conflicts such as those in South Africa, Afghanistan, Sudan and Tajikistan. However, the amnesties associated with those conflicts had all included at least one international crime."

The basis for such a conclusion, according to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, is found in the obligations of the States under international law to investigate and prosecute war crimes.

                "a. Institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs",
                "41. Since 1998, when it first visited Moldova, the CPT has serious concern for the conditions of detention in the institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.",
                "The CPT notes that 32 out of 39 EDPs have been subjected to “cosmetic” repair and that 30 have been equipped with places for daily walks. Nevertheless, the 2004 visit did not allow the concern of the Committee to be alleviated. In fact, most recommendations made have not been implemented.",
                "42. Whether one refers to the police stations or EDPs visited, the material conditions are invariably subject to the same criticism as in the past. Detention cells had no access to daylight or a very limited access; artificial light – with rare exceptions – was mediocre. Nowhere did the persons obliged to spend the night in detention receive mattresses and blankets, even those detained for prolonged periods. Those who had such items could only have obtained them from their relatives...",
                "45. As for food ... in the EDPs the arrangements made were the same as those criticised in 2001 (see paragraph 57 of the report on that visit): generally three modest distributions of food per day including tea and a slice of bread in the morning, a bowl of cereal at noon and tea or warm water in the evening. Sometimes there was only one distribution of food per day. Fortunately, the rules for receiving parcels have been relaxed, which allowed detainees with relatives outside to slightly improve these meagre daily portions.",
                "47. In sum, the material conditions remain problematic in the police stations; they remain disastrous in EDPs, continuing in many aspects to amount, for the detainees, to inhuman and degrading treatment.”",

                "... - EDP of Chişinău Police Inspectorate [1]",
                "53. In its report on the 1998 visit (paragraph 56), the CPT was forced to conclude that material conditions of detention in the remand centres ( EDPs ) visited amounted in many respects to inhuman and degrading treatment and, in addition, constituted a significant risk to the health of persons detained. While recognising that it was not possible to transform the current situation in these establishments overnight, the CPT recommended a certain number of immediate palliative measures to guarantee basic conditions of detention that respect the fundamental requirements of life and human dignity.",
                "54. Unfortunately, during the 2001 visit, the delegation found barely any traces of such palliative measures, in fact quite the opposite. For example, the renovation and reconstruction of the cells of the EDP of the Department for the fight against organised crime and corruption in Chişinău (reopened in 2000), which were supposed to reflect the CPT's 1998 recommendations, turned out to have had quite the contrary effect. All the conceptual and organisational shortcomings highlighted by the CPT at the time had been faithfully reproduced: cells without access to natural light, artificial lighting of low intensity and permanently switched on, inadequate ventilation and furnishings consisting exclusively of platforms without mattresses (although certain prisoners did have their own blankets). A similar conclusion can be drawn about the new section of the Bălţi EDP set aside for administrative detainees.",
                "55. One can only regret that in their efforts to renovate these premises - which under the current economic circumstances deserve praise - the Moldovan authorities have paid no attention to the CPT recommendations. In fact, this state of affairs strongly suggests that, setting aside economic considerations, the issue of material conditions of detention in police establishments remains influenced by an outdated concept of deprivation of liberty.",
                "56. Turning to the other EDPs visited across Moldova, with very few exceptions the delegation observed the same types of disastrous and insalubrious material conditions. A detailed description is superfluous, since it has all been highlighted already in paragraphs 53 to 55 of the report on the 1998 visit.",
                "In Chişinău EDP, these conditions were exacerbated by serious overcrowding. At the time of the visit, there were 248 prisoners for 80 places, requiring nine persons to cram into a cell measuring 7 m² and between eleven and fourteen persons into cells of 10 to 15 m².",
                "57. The delegation also received numerous complaints about the quantity of food in the EDPs visited. This normally comprised tea without sugar and a slice of bread in the morning, cereal porridge at lunch time and hot water in the evening. In some establishments, food was served just once a day and was confined to a piece of bread and soup. ...",
                "... Concerning the issue of access to toilets in due time, the CPT wishes to stress that it considers that the practice according to which detainees comply with the needs of nature by using receptacles in the presence of one or several other persons, in a confined space such as the EDP cells which also serve as their living space, is in itself degrading, not only for the individual concerned but also for those forced to witness what is happening. Consequently, the CPT recommends that clear instructions be given to surveillance staff that detainees placed in cells without toilets should – if they so request – be taken out of their cell without delay during the day in order to go to the toilet.",
                "59. The CPT also recommends that steps be taken to:",
                "- reduce the overcrowding in Chişinău EDP as rapidly as possible and to comply with the official occupancy level;",
                "- supply persons in custody with clean mattresses and clean blankets;",
                "- authorise persons detained in all EDPs to receive packages from the outset of their custody and to have access to reading matter.",
                "In the light of certain observations made, particularly in the EDP of the Chişinău Police Inspectorate, the CPT also reiterates its recommendation concerning strict compliance, in all circumstances, with the rules governing separation of adults and minors.”",

In particular, the court found that the applicant and other co-accused were subjected to torture and pressure in order to confess to the offences imputed to them or to incriminate other co-accused. In finding the above, the court relied on witness testimonies to the effect that G.D. had signs of violence on his body during the court hearings. The allegations of ill-treatment were consistent with reports of German and International bodies specialised in the protection of human rights. The court relied, inter alia, on a report of the German Government concerning the Republic of Moldova, in which it was stated that the Moldovan justice system lacked independence from the Government and that ill-treatment and torture by police was a wide spread practice in Moldova.

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards the accused as guilty. In this regard the Court emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of an offence (see Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 41, ECHR 2000 ‑ X )."

However, even assuming that the name Micu had been used as the denomination of the criminal organisation but not as the applicant's name, as suggested by the Government, the result remains the same. A statement that a criminal organisation bears one's name constitutes an implicit accusation that the initial bearer of the name (the person) is somehow involved with the gang. Otherwise there would simply be no reason for the gang to bear his name. Accordingly, Mr Gurbulea's statement was clearly a declaration of the applicant's guilt which, firstly, encouraged the public to believe him guilty and, secondly, prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority.

                "\"In the morning of 18 April 1987 [the applicant] was informed by Ms Karin Ree, nurse [at the Station], that the captain of M/S Polarbas had been in contact with Jan Mayen radio and requested that Mr Asbjørn Olufsen [the injured fisherman] be taken ashore at Jan Mayen so that the nurse could have a look at his wrist injury. The [applicant] responded in a positive manner to the request, but said that they would have to ascertain conditions in [the bay of] Båtvika before receiving Mr Olufsen. The nurse and the Chief Engineer, Arne Svendsen, were willing to participate in the operation. Mr Svendsen went down to Båtvika to check the conditions and reported back to [the applicant] that they were satisfactory. [The applicant] then contacted the Polarbas and agreed that the patient should be brought by a launch close to the beach in Båtvika and that a rubber dinghy ... would meet them there. It was further agreed that the transfer of the patient would take place approximately twenty minutes after the conversation between the Polarbas and the Station. They also agreed on a radio frequency on which the parties would communicate.",
                "While driving to Båtvika, the [applicant] discovered that he had forgotten his camera. He wondered whether he should return to pick it up, but the nurse insisted that they had no time to lose and that they should therefore drive on. She then offered to collect the camera later, but the [applicant] told her that she should not do so.",
                "On arriving at Båtvika they found the [rubber dinghy] already there, the Maintenance Chief Officer having fetched it and driven it down to the beach. The Maintenance Chief Officer said that the dinghy ought to be pumped up. The Chief Engineer, however, thought that it was better to leave the dinghy as it was and so do nothing to it. The [applicant] and Mr Svendsen sat down in the dinghy after having put on survival suits. However, neither of them put on their hoods. They took no radio equipment with them in the dinghy, but Ms Ree had a radio for the purpose of communicating with the Polarbas and its launch.",
                "As they left the beach, the Polarbas launch with the injured fisherman on board was far out in the approaches to Båtvika. Some time after the dinghy had left, the nurse ... returned to the beach with the [applicant's] camera which she had gone back to collect at the administration building ...",
                "Mr Svendsen rowed the dinghy out from the beach. After having rowed some forty to sixty metres from the shore they waited a while, trying to get the launch to approach them. However, they did not obtain any response from the persons in the launch.",
                "[Mr Svendsen] was tired and he and [the applicant] changed places, the [applicant] taking over the rowing. They tried several times to contact the launch, but to no avail. They realised that something had gone wrong. They therefore rowed further towards the launch which was still lying far out in the approaches to Båtvika. As they came up to the launch they were told that the engine had broken down and that a sea anchor had been deployed. The men in the launch were anxious since, despite the sea anchor, the launch was drifting towards the rocks. None of the persons in the launch were wearing life-jackets or survival suits. Nor was such equipment available in the launch.",

They did not have life-jackets.",

Although the applicant was in principle under no duty to receive the injured fisherman, such a duty arose from the fact that he agreed to do so. In determining whether the applicant had been guilty of neglect or carelessness in the landing operation or in its preparations, it had to be ascertained whether he had breached any applicable instructions. Gross breaches or several recurring breaches of instructions could amount to neglect or carelessness within the meaning of Article 78 para. 1 of the Military Penal Code. The public prosecutor had argued that the applicant had acted in breach of his duties in seven instances, of which those indicated below were the subject of argument in the present case:",
                "\"1. It was the duty of the defendant to use the dory once he had decided to receive a patient.",

                "The City Court was of the view that the instructions imposing duties on military and civilian personnel on Jan Mayen, in particular Instruction C 14 containing General Rules on Traffic on and around Jan Mayen, were for various reasons unclear. Moreover, many of the provisions in question were designed for the loading and discharging of supply vessels. The relevant instructions could therefore apply to rescue operations only in so far as was appropriate.",
                "As to the above-mentioned item 4 of the prosecutor's allegations, the City Court held:",
                "\"... the [applicant] cannot be blamed for the fact that the nurse did not remain on the shore throughout the operation. The Court is satisfied that Botten did not know that she had returned to the Station to fetch his camera. Moreover, the Court is satisfied that he did not order her to fetch the camera. Anyway, her absence was quite short, lasting only a few minutes. The [applicant] knew, however, that [the] nurse ... did not bring along first-aid equipment to the shore. In that respect therefore, there is a breach of Instruction B 13, section 3.6. The Court points out, however, that there are no serious violations of the instructions. The object of the operation was merely to fetch a fisherman who was only suffering from a wrist injury and it would moreover take only a short time to go up to the Station buildings to collect the necessary equipment.\"",
                "With regard to item 7, the City Court made, inter alia, the following observations:",
                "\"... the City Court agrees in principle with the prosecutor that it was unsafe to row the rubber dinghy right out to the launch. However, the [City] Court takes into account the fact that the [applicant] and [Mr Svendsen], while on their way, admittedly after they had passed the point where they had intended to meet the launch, but while they were still in fairly calm waters, discovered that there were problems on board the launch. Accordingly, the [City] Court cannot see here either that the [applicant] committed any breach of the instructions since it was highly probable, and gradually became quite obvious, that the launch was in a critical situation.\"",
                "Finally, with regard to item 1, the members of the City Court were divided:",
                "\"Assessor Terje Henriksen considers that section 2 of Instruction C 14 lays down an obligation for the defendant to use the dory, since the penultimate paragraph of section 2 ... provides that this rule applies to all personnel on Jan Mayen. The President of the Court considers that ... section 2, which applies to sea traffic, must be applied wherever appropriate. Regarding this special case, where the [applicant] was to take ashore a fisherman with an injured wrist, the President cannot find any circumstances which could justify setting aside the general obligation to use the dory. The operation was not conducted under such heavy pressure that this provision could be disregarded. Assessor Tordis Kvarv is of the opinion that the provision does not apply in a rescue operation of the kind in issue and that the matter must therefore be assessed in terms of general requirements of care.",
                "Assessor Terje Henriksen considers that the breach of this provision under the very special weather conditions which exist in the ocean area off Jan Mayen is so serious that it qualifies as `neglect or carelessness' within the meaning of Article 78 para. 1 of the Military Penal Code. He has therefore arrived at the conclusion that the defendant should be convicted for violation of Article 78 para. 1 ...",
                "The President ... is of the opinion that even if this instruction has been disregarded, it must nevertheless be considered in applying Article 78 para. 1 ... whether the choice made by [the applicant] made the situation worse than would have been the case had he chosen the dory. If it did not, a violation of this instruction cannot be described as neglect or carelessness. The majority of the Court (Assessor Tordis Kvarv and the President) have found that the use of the dinghy instead of the dory did not lead to reduced safety, having regard to the purpose which the boat was originally supposed to serve. Particular weight is attached to the fact that the parties had agreed to meet close to the beach. Although the precise meeting point had not been agreed, it must at least be accepted that they did not intend to go much further out than about 100 metres from the beach. In this area the waters are calm. Moreover, reference is made to the testimony of the prosecution expert witness, Mr Alv Håkon Klepsvik, Commander. He testified in court that he saw no safety problems in using the rubber dinghy in, or just outside, Båtvika provided it was kept away from breakers or wave peaks. He considered that, if one stayed in the middle of Båtvika or on the lee side, using the dinghy did not give rise to any problems. Nor would he have had any hesitation in using the dinghy to receive a person from another boat. He further testified that there was less risk of injury in transferring a person from a boat to another when the second was a rubber dinghy, and he thought that it would be preferable to use a rubber dinghy rather than a dory for that purpose. As regards the fact that the dinghy was not fully pumped up, he stated that it was better to use a dinghy that was not fully inflated. Nor did this reduce the dinghy's seaworthiness.",
                "The majority of the Court agrees with the minority that the essential point in this case is whether there was a duty to use the dory and whether any breach of this duty led to reduced safety. The ... majority has accordingly come to the conclusion that such is not the case and that the defendant should therefore be acquitted, ... finding him not guilty of neglect or carelessness as described in the charge.\"",

                "14. On 12 April 1989 the public prosecutor appealed from the judgment of the City Court to the Supreme Court (Høyesterett). In the first place he maintained that the City Court's decision was flawed in that it had applied too narrow an interpretation of the statutory offence of neglect in the performance of official duties. In the view of the prosecution, the breach of the duty to use a dory was so serious that it amounted to neglect. The City Court's view that using a rubber dinghy instead of a dory did not lead to reduced safety was not a sufficient reason for holding otherwise. The instructions had been laid down on the basis of several years' experience and with a view to the particular conditions at Jan Mayen and the fact that the Station officers are not necessarily accustomed to the sea and are only stationed there for a limited period. These considerations suggested that, save in exceptional circumstances, the Station officer was strictly required to exercise care and to follow the instructions. In the prosecution's opinion, the instruction could be departed from only if there was an emergency or if the service might thereby be carried out in a better or safer manner; that, however, was not the situation in the applicant's case.",

The judgment failed to describe the sea conditions prevailing at the time when the applicant set out in the dinghy and also when he realised that the lifeboat would not arrive at the agreed meeting point, and the distance between the lifeboat and the shore at those times. Nor did the judgment mention what the applicant thought had gone wrong with the lifeboat, which alternatives he had to taking the dinghy further out or how much time it would have taken to prepare the dory for the operation."

The grounds cited for this are that he disregarded applicable instructions on several points as specified in the indictment. The City Court's judgment lists seven matters which, taken together, are claimed to constitute neglect. Several of these points have not been pursued before the Supreme Court.",
                "The instructions applying to Jan Mayen are comprehensive. This must be viewed in the light of the demanding conditions for those serving there. I would note that the preamble to the instructions for Jan Mayen, which were issued in August 1986 by the Norwegian Defence Communications and Data Services Administration and which are relevant to the present case, states: 'Written instructions are more necessary on Jan Mayen, where there is a constant turnover of personnel, than elsewhere.'",
                "The 'General Provisions concerning Traffic on and around Jan Mayen', which form part of the said instructions, figure centrally in the case. Section 1 ..., entitled 'Purpose', reads: 'These are general provisions which are intended as guidelines for both official and leisure traffic on and around Jan Mayen.' Even though the provisions initially give the impression of setting out 'guidelines', it is clear that they include binding rules, as shown by section 2 on sea traffic, the first paragraph of which reads: 'Excursions by boat in the sea around Jan Mayen without seagoing support vessel are generally prohibited.' However, the rule goes on to list various exceptions. I would point out that the provisions on sea traffic clearly must cover the operation launched to receive the injured fisherman on that occasion, even though it was presumed that the transfer would be conducted relatively close to the shore. I also find it clear that the provisions must apply to the landing operation, even though there is no mention of assistance to the fishing fleet here or elsewhere in the instructions for Jan Mayen.",
                "Section 2 ... includes, inter alia, the following two clauses: `",
                "- Ensure that both dories are used on trips if no other boat is close to the island, or no other boat has been made ready to assist if necessary.",
                "- When the weather conditions are deemed to be satisfactory, the other dory may be replaced by the dinghy, which may be taken aboard the dory or drawn behind it.'",
                "In my view, it follows from the rules that there is a requirement to use a dory on occasions such as the one in question here, and that a dinghy could not replace a dory in this situation. It is true that a dinghy could be used in certain circumstances, but only as a backup. I therefore agree with the President of the City Court and the one lay judge who, admittedly on somewhat different grounds, found that the provisions imposed an official duty on the [applicant] to use a dory instead of a dinghy.",
                "The President of the [City] Court was however of '... the opinion that even if this instruction has been disregarded, it must nevertheless be considered in applying Article 78 para. 1 ... whether the choice made by the [applicant] made the situation worse than would have been the case had he used a dory. If it did not, a violation of this instruction cannot be described as neglect or carelessness'.",
                "I do not agree with this interpretation of the law.",
                "In my opinion, the duty to use a dory is of such key significance in the provisions relating to traffic that an assessment such as that mentioned by the President is insufficient. I refer to the fact that the duty was imposed in the light of experience and is intended to protect life and health in an area characterised by quite extraordinary weather conditions and in difficult waters, and that it is thus particularly important that the instruction is complied with on this point. The assessment referred to by the President of the City Court cannot therefore be decisive for whether there was neglect.",
                "The second lay judge, who together with the President of the City Court constituted the majority voting in favour of acquittal, likewise based her decision on an erroneous application of the law. In her opinion, the duty to use a dory did not apply 'to a rescue operation of this kind, and the matter must therefore be considered on the basis of a general assessment of the duty of care'. I find that she was of the opinion that there was no duty to use a dory, and therefore no neglect within the meaning of Article 78 para. 1.",
                "The majority of the City Court ... found that using a rubber dinghy instead of a dory on the occasion did not have the effect of reducing safety given the use for which the dinghy was initially intended, namely reception of the injured fisherman from the shrimp trawler's lifeboat not 'much further than about 100 metres from shore'. However, according to the regulations, this is not decisive.",
                "Thus the [applicant's] acquittal is based on an erroneous application of the law. In the present case, however, this does not warrant quashing the City Court's judgment, since I agree with the prosecution's submission in the notice of appeal that the conditions are satisfied for pronouncing a new judgment convicting [the applicant] pursuant to Article 362 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In this connection, I refer to the City Court's account of the facts.",
                "I also refer to what I previously said about the background to and the specific contents of the provisions concerning traffic on and around Jan Mayen, in particular the duty to use a dory. Given the difficult conditions on the island, it is particularly important that rules of this kind are complied with. The [applicant] is at fault for having decided, despite the requirement set out in the instruction, to use the rubber dinghy on that occasion and for having done so. I would point out, however, that the situation had changed at the subsequent stages of the operation, when it was clear that the persons in the approaching lifeboat were in danger. In my opinion, however, what had already happened in the earlier stages constitutes such a serious matter that it must be deemed to constitute neglect under Article 78 para. 1. I would note that counsel for the defence has contended before the Supreme Court that the duty to use a dory could not apply when a lifeboat was launched from the shrimp trawler. I do not find that this [argument] can be accorded decisive weight in the present case, as it is clear from the City Court's judgment that the dinghy was not simply used as a backup on this occasion. Nor could the defendant know whether or not the lifeboat was properly equipped, as subsequently turned out not to be the case.",
                "As previously indicated, the prosecution has also brought up other matters which, in its opinion, constitute breaches of the applicable instructions. Some of these matters which were submitted to the City Court have not been pursued before the Supreme Court.",
                "The City Court unanimously concluded that there was a breach of the instruction on account of the fact that the nurse had not brought first-aid equipment down to the shore and that the [applicant] was aware of this fact. I find this to be the case. However, the failure to use a dory in the landing operation is the predominant factor in relation to Article 78 para. 1.",
                "As regards sentencing, I find it appropriate to sentence [the applicant] to twenty days' military custody suspended for a probation period of two years, in addition to an unconditional fine of NOK 5,000 or, in default of payment, military custody for fifteen days. In this connection, I have attached importance to the fact that the defendant is only at fault in respect of his conduct during the preliminary stages of the landing operation.\""

A copy of the appeal was served on the applicant and his lawyer and both of them were summoned to the Court of Appeal hearing. However, the applicant informed the court in writing of his wish not to take part and asked for the case to be examined in his absence. The Court notes that it has not been argued that the applicant – who was not in detention – was hindered from seeking legal advice concerning the nature of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal or their possible outcome, including the possibility that the first-instance acquittal judgment would be overturned and the applicant convicted by the Court of Appeal as requested by the prosecutor. The Court further notes that, according to the record of the Court of Appeal hearing, the applicant ’ s lawyer – who was present – submitted that he was aware of the applicant ’ s wish not to take part. The Court thus considers that the applicant unequivocally waived his right to take part in the hearing before the Court of Appeal (see, generally, Hermi, cited above, § 73, with further references; compare and contrast Popovici, cited above, § 73, where the Government failed to adduce any evidence in support of their submission that the applicant had refused to attend the hearing in question). The Court does not therefore need to further examine the question of whether the special features of the proceedings concerned would have allowed an appellate court to decide the case without a direct assessment of the evidence given by the applicant in person. In that respect the present case differs from a number of cases the Court has dealt with where the defendant in criminal proceedings had not been heard by an appellate jurisdiction since no oral hearing had been held at all (see Igual Coll v. Spain, no. 37496/04, § 7, 10 March 2009; Marcos Barrios v. Spain, no. 17122/07, § 10, 21 September 2010; and García Hernández v.

Spain, no. 23002/07, § 10, 22 November 2011) or had been able to address the court but had not been heard during the trial (see Constantinescu v. Romania, no. 28871/95, § 58, ECHR 2000-VIII, and Popa and Tănăsescu v. Romania, no. 19946/04, §§ 28 and 50, 10 April 2012)."

The applicant was equally aware of the Court of Appeal ’ s powers to convict him. In this context, the Court considers it significant that the applicant did not request in any manner the examination of witnesses at the appellate court ’ s hearing ( compare Destrehem v. France, no. 56651/00, §§ 45-47, 18 May 2004, where the Court, in finding a violation, relied on the fact that the applicant had requested summoning the witnesses but in spite of that request the court of appeal nevertheless had overturned the first-instance judgment without summoning the witnesses; contrast with Flueraş v.

Notably, the Court of Appeal considered that the County Court had not been justified in rejecting K.A. ’ s, K.S. ’ s and K.M ’ s statements and identification reports as evidence. In respect of K.S., it noted that at the identification procedure she had recognised the applicant by his eyes and eyebrows. The fact that she could not describe his clothing did not discredit her evidence. The court found that it could not be required of a witness to note everything necessary for criminal proceedings. A person could only focus on a single detail rather than on the full picture. Nor was her evidence discredited by her failure to recognise the applicant at the court hearing, as at court hearings witnesses were in a particularly stressful situation. Similar considerations were applied to K.M., who, moreover, had recognised the applicant at the County Court hearing. The fact that K.M. and T.S. (another witness) – who had been together at the time of the events – had taken note of different aspects of the events did not render those statements unreliable; rather, it reflected the fact that the perception and memory of different people differed. Nor did the different expressions used by K.M. at the identification procedure and in court render her statements unreliable. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal found no radical differences between K.A. ’ s statements in the identification report and in court, and therefore considered that the rejection of his statements as evidence had been not justified either. In conclusion, the Court of Appeal considered that K.A. ’ s, K.S. ’ s and K.M. ’ s statements, as well as their identification reports, had to be taken into account and assessed together with the other evidence."

It also noted that the applicant, S.G. and I.J. had been friends, whereas the other witnesses had had no connection with them. Considering a number of statements by independent witnesses, the court found that I.J. had not been credible in assuming full responsibility and noted that there was no way of finding out why he had done so. It also noted that the applicant ’ s statements had been inconsistent. He had said during the preliminary investigation that he had seen I.J. hitting L., whereas in court he had said that he had been further away from the scene and denied having seen anything. The court also referred in that connection to the words heard by witnesses from a person whose appearance corresponded to that of the applicant: “Why then did he come to start a quarrel ?” If the applicant had arrived at the scene after L. had been knocked down, he would have known nothing about the reasons and initial stages of the conflict and would have had no reason to express himself in such a way."

That meant, inter alia, direct examination of witnesses and victims at a court hearing as the rule, and disclosure of testimony given during the pre-trial investigation as the exception. Although under the Code of Criminal Procedure an appellate court was in principle entitled to examine and assess evidence to the same extent as a county court, and it could not be ruled out that witnesses would be directly examined during the appeal proceedings, Article 15 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided that an appellate court, unlike a county court, could also base its judgment only on evidence examined by the county court and disclosed in the appeal proceedings.

The Government considered that in the present case the Court of Appeal had very precisely observed the guidelines of the Supreme Court and explained in detail in its judgment why it had assessed differently the statements of individual witnesses given in the County Court as well as the statements as a whole."

France, 23 November 1993, § 35, Series A no. 277 ‑ A; Lala v. the Netherlands, 22 September 1994, § 33, Series A no. 297 ‑ A; and De Lorenzo v. Italy (dec.), no. 69264/01, 12 February 2004), and the duty to guarantee the right of a criminal defendant to be present in the courtroom – either during the original proceedings or in a retrial – ranks as one of the essential requirements of Article 6 (see Stoichkov v. Bulgaria, no. 9808/02, § 56, 24 March 2005, and Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 58, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII )."

Austria, 19 December 1989, § 106, Series A no. 168 ). The manner of application of Article 6 to proceedings before courts of appeal depends on the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein (see Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 56, Series A no. 115; Ekbatani v. Sweden, 26 May 1988, § 27, Series A no. 134; and Hermi, cited above, § 60 ). Nevertheless, the Court has held that where an appellate court is called upon to examine a case as to the facts and the law and to make a full assessment of the question of the applicant ’ s guilt or innocence, it cannot, as a matter of fair trial, properly determine those issues without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused who claims that he has not committed the act alleged to constitute a criminal offence (see Ekbatani, cited above, § 32, and Popovici v. Moldova, nos. 289/04 and 41194/04, § 68, 27 November 2007 )."

Furthermore, the Court reiterates that the guarantees in paragraph 3 (d) of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair hearing set forth in paragraph 1 of that provision, which must be taken into account in any assessment of the fairness of proceedings. In addition, the Court ’ s primary concern under Article 6 § 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, § 84, ECHR 2010, and Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06, § 118, ECHR 2011)."

While Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national legislation and the domestic courts (see, amongst others, Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1988, §§ 45-46, Series A no. 140, and García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, ECHR 1999-I). The Court ’ s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 162, ECHR 2010, with further references, and Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 118 )."

There are exceptions to this principle, however. As a general rule, paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6 cannot be interpreted as requiring in all cases that questions be put directly by the accused or his lawyer, whether by means of cross-examination or by any other means, but rather that the accused must be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when the witness makes his statement or at a later stage (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 118 ). The use in evidence of statements obtained at the police inquiry and judicial investigation stages is not in itself inconsistent with the provisions cited above, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected (see Saïdi v.

Lastly, the Court reiterates that neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 of the Convention prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or tacitly, the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial (see Kwiatkowska v. Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000). However, such a waiver must, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance (see Poitrimol, cited above, § 35 ). In addition, it must not run counter to any important public interest (see Håkansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, 21 February 1990, § 66, Series A no. 171 ‑ A; Hermi, cited above, § 73; and Sejdovic v.

                "44. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant, assisted by a lawyer, took part in the hearing at first instance. He was heard at the County Court hearing where all relevant witnesses were also examined. It is not in dispute that the defence could and did put questions to the witnesses before the County Court."

            [
                "45. Furthermore, the Court notes that after the applicant ’ s acquittal by the first-instance court the prosecutor lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal. A copy of the appeal was served on the applicant and his lawyer and both of them were summoned to the Court of Appeal hearing. However, the applicant informed the court in writing of his wish not to take part and asked for the case to be examined in his absence. The Court notes that it has not been argued that the applicant – who was not in detention – was hindered from seeking legal advice concerning the nature of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal or their possible outcome, including the possibility that the first-instance acquittal judgment would be overturned and the applicant convicted by the Court of Appeal as requested by the prosecutor. The Court further notes that, according to the record of the Court of Appeal hearing, the applicant ’ s lawyer – who was present – submitted that he was aware of the applicant ’ s wish not to take part. The Court thus considers that the applicant unequivocally waived his right to take part in the hearing before the Court of Appeal (see, generally, Hermi, cited above, § 73, with further references; compare and contrast Popovici, cited above, § 73, where the Government failed to adduce any evidence in support of their submission that the applicant had refused to attend the hearing in question). The Court does not therefore need to further examine the question of whether the special features of the proceedings concerned would have allowed an appellate court to decide the case without a direct assessment of the evidence given by the applicant in person. In that respect the present case differs from a number of cases the Court has dealt with where the defendant in criminal proceedings had not been heard by an appellate jurisdiction since no oral hearing had been held at all (see Igual Coll v. Spain, no. 37496/04, § 7, 10 March 2009; Marcos Barrios v. Spain, no. 17122/07, § 10, 21 September 2010; and García Hernández v. Spain, no. 15256/07, § 8, 16 November 2010), had not been heard in person regardless of the hearing having taken place (see Lacadena Calero v. Spain, no. 23002/07, § 10, 22 November 2011) or had been able to address the court but had not been heard during the trial (see Constantinescu v. Romania, no. 28871/95, § 58, ECHR 2000-VIII, and Popa and Tănăsescu v. Romania, no. 19946/04, §§ 28 and 50, 10 April 2012)."

                "46. As regards the question of whether the Court of Appeal was required to re-examine the witnesses – who had already been examined at the County Court hearing – in person, the Court underlines again that the applicant, who was assisted by a lawyer, was aware of the content of the prosecutor ’ s appeal (see paragraph 12 above). The applicant was equally aware of the Court of Appeal ’ s powers to convict him. In this context, the Court considers it significant that the applicant did not request in any manner the examination of witnesses at the appellate court ’ s hearing ( compare Destrehem v. France, no. 56651/00, §§ 45-47, 18 May 2004, where the Court, in finding a violation, relied on the fact that the applicant had requested summoning the witnesses but in spite of that request the court of appeal nevertheless had overturned the first-instance judgment without summoning the witnesses; contrast with Flueraş v. Romania, no. 17520/04, § 60, 9 April 2013 )."
            ],
            [
                "47. It is true that the Court has found that one of the requirements of a fair trial is the possibility for the accused to confront the witnesses in the presence of a judge who must ultimately decide the case, because the judge ’ s observations on the demeanour and credibility of a certain witness may have consequences for the accused (see Hanu v. Romania, no. 10890/04, § 40, 4 June 2013). At the same time, according to the Court ’ s settled case-law, the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed are primarily matters for regulation by national legislation and the domestic courts (see among many other authorities, Al-Khawaja and Tahery, § 118; García Ruiz, § 28; and Schenk, §§ 45-46, all cited above). Exceptions to the principle that all evidence against the accused must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Solakov v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, no. 47023/99, § 57, ECHR 2001-X, and Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 118, with further references to Lucà v. Italy, no. 33354/96, § 39, ECHR 2001-II). The Court considers that if it has been accepted that the defendant ’ s ability to put questions to witnesses against him during the pre-trial proceedings can meet the requirements of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) and that the testimony of such witnesses can be admissible as evidence, those requirements are, a fortiori, met when the witnesses in question have been examined before the first-instance court in the presence of the defendant who could put questions to them and the appellate court admits those statements as evidence. The Court notes that it has not been argued that the proceedings before the first-instance court in the present case did not meet the fair trial requirements of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d)."
            ],
            [
                "48. Furthermore, the Court has had regard, in the present case, to the reasoning related to the radically different assessment of the witness statements by the domestic courts. It reiterates in this connection that it is not its task to act as an appellate court or, as is sometimes said, as a court of fourth instance, for the decisions of domestic courts. It is the role of the domestic courts to interpret and apply the relevant rules of procedural or substantive law. The domestic courts are best placed to assess the credibility of witnesses and the relevance of evidence to the issues in the case (see, among many other authorities, Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, § 32, Series A no. 235-B; Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16 December 1992, § 34, Series A no. 247-B; Melnychuk v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 28743/03, ECHR 2005-IX; and Karpenko v. Russia, no. 5605/04, § 80, 13 March 2012). In the instant case, the Court notes that there is nothing in the case file which might lead to the conclusion that the domestic courts acted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner in assessing the evidence, establishing the facts or interpreting the domestic law. On the contrary, the Court considers that adequate safeguards against arbitrariness were in place in the proceedings against the applicant. The Court notes that the difference in the County Court ’ s and Court of Appeal ’ s assessment of the evidence mainly resulted from the courts ’ different approach to the coherence or discrepancies within and between the testimony of individual witnesses and their interpretation of the circumstances of the offence as a whole. The Court also notes in this connection that the Court of Appeal, following the Supreme Court ’ s pertinent case-law (see paragraph 24 above), provided – as required by the Supreme Court – particularly thorough reasoning as to why it had come to a conclusion different from that of the County Court, and indicated what mistakes the latter had made, in the Court of Appeal ’ s view, in assessing the evidence. The Court observes, in particular, that the Court of Appeal disagreed with the County Court ’ s rejection of certain witness statements and identification reports as evidence and, having taken into account that evidence, arrived at a conclusion different from that of the County Court (see paragraphs 10 and 15 et seq. above)."

                "49. The Court further notes that an appeal against the Court of Appeal judgment could be lodged with the Supreme Court. The applicant, through his lawyer, made use of that possibility and the Supreme Court was thus able to verify whether its case-law in that area had been followed by the Court of Appeal. While deciding whether to examine the applicant ’ s appeal, it had in substance a possibility to assess the appellate court ’ s approach. The Court considers that the requirements deriving from the Supreme Court ’ s case-law and its verification in the present case that those requirements had been met constituted further safeguards for the applicant ’ s defence rights."

The Court considers that the Contracting States dispose in principle of a wide margin of appreciation to determine how the right secured by Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention is to be exercised. Thus, the review by a higher court of a conviction or sentence may concern both points of fact and points of law or be confined solely to points of law. In several member States of the Council of Europe such a review is limited to questions of law or may require the person wishing to appeal to apply for leave to do so (see, for example, Pesti and Frodl v. Austria (dec.), nos. 27618/95 and 27619/95, ECHR 2000-I (extracts); Kristjansson and Boasson v. Iceland (dec.), no. 24945/04, 10 April 2007; and Dorado Baúlde v. Spain (dec.), no. 23486/12, 1 September 2015). Moreover, the second paragraph of Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 specifically refers to exceptions to the right to appeal in criminal matters in cases where the person concerned was convicted following an appeal against acquittal. The Court finds therefore that there is no appearance of a violation of the provision cited. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

The Court notes that, according to its own words, the Supreme Court did not reassess the testimony received nor the facts established by the Court of Appeal but only gave a different legal meaning to these facts. This different legal assessment led to a different outcome to that of the Court of Appeal. It is true that, in the circumstances of the instant case, the issue in question was not the credibility of the witness statements as such but rather how they were legally interpreted. The Supreme Court ’ s examination thus focused mainly on legal questions without modifying the facts established by the Court of Appeal. The Court considers, however, that in cases like the present one, the facts and the legal interpretation can be intertwined to an extent that it is difficult to separate the two from each other. Although the Supreme Court examined the case mainly from the legal point of view and despite the fact that the facts established by the Court of Appeal were not disputed, the Supreme Court had to some extent to make its own assessment for the purposes of determining whether the facts provided a sufficient basis for convicting the applicant. This is especially true with regard to the question of intent which was expressly examined only by the Supreme Court. Moreover, when deciding on sentence, the Supreme Court did not even have the benefit of having a prior assessment of the question by the lower court which had heard the applicant directly (see Botten v.

The money in question had been intended expressly as financial support for the applicant (the navigator) and another policeman (the driver) in the rally. The prosecutor took the view that successful competing abroad would not have been possible without such financial support and therefore it was to be considered a benefit within the meaning of the Penal Code. There was no information as to how the financial support had affected the applicant ’ s performance of his duties but this personal benefit had been conducive to weakening confidence in the impartiality of the authority ’ s activities because the applicant could, due to his position, have influenced the police department ’ s use of funds and acquisitions, at least for projects for which he had been responsible.

It noted that on the applicant ’ s request the company had, via the club, on the basis of advertising and co-operation contracts paid FIM 18,000 to him, who had held a post as senior crime inspector in the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior. The money had been used to cover costs incurred by the applicant and his rally partner in their police rally activities, carried out chiefly during their spare time.

The Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior had, between 1996 and 1998, acquired at least FIM 200,000 (approximately EUR 40,500) worth of IT equipment from the company.

According to the first-mentioned provision, an official must be convicted, if the act is not punishable as the acceptance or aggravated acceptance of a bribe, of a bribery violation if he demands, receives or accepts a gift or other benefit meant for himself or for another person or demands or accepts a promise or offer to that effect which is conducive to weakening confidence in the impartiality of the authority ’ s activities. The applicability of the provision on negligent violation of official duty requires that a public official, when acting in his or her office, has through carelessness violated his or her official duty based on the provisions or regulations to be followed in official functions, and the act, when assessed as a whole and taking into consideration its detrimental and harmful effect and the other circumstances connected with the act, is not of a trivial nature. The prosecutor considers that the applicant has breached Section 15 of the State Civil Servant Act. It provides that “[ a ] public official may not demand, accept or receive financial or other benefit which may weaken confidence in the official or the authority.”",

From the applicant ’ s point of view, the essential content of the advertising contracts has been to obtain financial support to cover costs resulting from his leisure activity. This comes down to a benefit within the meaning of Section 15 of the State Civil Servant Act and Chapter 40, Section 3, of the Penal Code. The question of how much of his own assets the applicant has used for his hobby lacks significance in this assessment.",

As the Court of Appeal has also noted, the bribery provisions may also cover benefits received by an official in his or her spare time or benefits meant to be used for such a purpose. It has been clear to the parties to the advertising and co-operation contracts that they have amounted to contributions to the rally activities of policemen, in which the applicant has been engaged. The financial support acquired by the applicant for his hobby from [the company], which has been doing business with his office, is linked in such a way to the applicant ’ s position as to be sufficient for the purposes of the penal provision concerning a bribery violation. Whether or not the applicant has sent to [the company] written co-operation offers explicitly disclosing his official title or office is not decisive.",
                "The application of the penal provision concerning a bribery violation requires that the benefit received has been conducive to weakening confidence in the impartiality of the authority ’ s activities. Thus it does not require, as does acceptance of a bribe within the meaning of Chapter 40, Section 1, of the Penal Code, that the official has demanded or received the benefit for an action taken in office, nor that through the benefit [someone] has influenced or tried to influence that action or that the benefit would have been conducive to influencing that action. What is relevant for the purposes of a bribery violation is whether the demanding, receipt or acceptance of the benefit typically has been such that it normally, from an outsider ’ s viewpoint, weakens confidence in the impartiality of the authority ’ s activities. By “an authority ’ s activities” in this context is meant the activities carried out in general in the position in question. What the provision aims to ensure is that an official does not act in a manner conducive to arousing suspicion of the existence of inappropriate motives in the authority ’ s activities. In the assessment of an activity, regard must be had to the fact that confidence in an authority ’ s activities may be particularly vulnerable to weakening.",
                "Due to the nature of police activity, the neutrality and impartiality of the police and an individual policeman are required to meet especially high standards. The applicant has held a significant post as a senior crime inspector in the police activity unit of the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior and as the person responsible for projects, to which position, from an outsider ’ s viewpoint, is attached an extensive possibility to influence. The fact that the applicant has repeatedly accepted financial support from a company with which his department has had a continuous business relationship, is likely to raise suspicion in outsiders as to the impartiality of the handling of purchases connected with police activity. In the assessment of the case the extent to which the applicant has de facto influenced the coming about or the continuation of the business relationship is not decisive. Having regard to the aforementioned position of the applicant within the Police Department, and the relationship between it and the provider of the benefit, the applicant ’ s actions have been conducive to weakening confidence in the impartiality of the authority ’ s activities for the purposes of the penal provision on bribery violation.",
                "The above-mentioned actions by the applicant fulfil the constituent elements of a bribery violation only if it can be judged that he has acted with intent. As the case concerns the receipt of personal financial benefits which are connected with the authority ’ s activity, the non-existence of regulations on fund-raising for the police associations or the knowledge of the applicant ’ s superiors of his police rally hobby have no relevance in the assessment of intent. Nor can actions of an official be assessed on the same basis as regards fund-raising of motorsports or clubs. Having regard to the applicant ’ s position, training and duties, the Supreme Court considers that he must have understood that his acts were conducive to weakening confidence in the impartiality of the authority ’ s activities.",

Although the Supreme Court examined the case mainly from the legal point of view and despite the fact that the facts established by the Court of Appeal were not disputed, the Supreme Court had to some extent to make its own assessment for the purposes of determining whether the facts provided a sufficient basis for convicting the applicant. This is especially true with regard to the question of intent which was expressly examined only by the Supreme Court.

The Court of Appeal proceedings had thus been conducted speedily, as requested by both State Prosecutors. The proceedings before the Supreme Court had lasted almost one year and ten months. The national legislation did not impose a similar urgency requirement on the Supreme Court as was applicable to the courts of appeal but nevertheless these proceedings had been compatible with the “reasonable time” requirement. There had thus not been any unnecessary periods of inactivity attributable to the courts or other national authorities. As to the complexity, the Government pointed out that cases like the present one involving a high-ranking public official, the public interest and the need to maintain confidence in the activities of public authorities required particularly careful investigation.

As regards the security concerns proffered by the trial court as a ground for closure of the trial, the Court reiterates that security problems are a common feature of many criminal proceedings, but cases in which security concerns alone justify excluding the public from a trial are nevertheless rare ( see Riepan v. Austria, no. 35115/97, § 34, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII ). Admittedly, it was incumbent on the domestic judicial authorities to protect the safety and security of the persons present in the courtroom and to respond to the threat of D.'s assassination. However, in the Court's view, the security measures should be narrowly tailored and comply with the principle of necessity. The judicial authorities should thoroughly consider all possible alternatives to ensure safety and security in the courtroom and give preference to a less strict measure over a stricter one when it can achieve the same purpose. The Court notes that it is regrettable that in the present case no such effort was made by the trial court. It did not explain why such measures as, for instance, installation of metal detectors or screening of the public entering the courtroom were insufficient in the circumstances of the case. Nor did it find that the state security system in place at the courthouse was inadequate to such an extent that an assassination attempt could not be prevented other than by completely closing the trial to the public."

This is apparent from the text of Article 6 § 1 itself, which contains the provision that “the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of ... national security in a democratic society, ... or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice”. Thus, it may on occasion be necessary under Article 6 to limit the open and public nature of proceedings in order, for example, to protect the safety or privacy of witnesses, or to promote the free exchange of information and opinion in the pursuit of justice (see B. and P. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 36337/97 and 35974/97, § 37, ECHR 2001-III, with further references)."

When deciding on that issue, the trial court referred to the need “to ensure the safety of ... all parties to the proceedings, the employees of the Supreme Court ... and other persons ” and protection of privacy. Accordingly, the question before the Court in the present case is whether the trial court's decision to dispense with the public hearing of the applicant's case was justified."

As regards the security concerns proffered by the trial court as a ground for closure of the trial, the Court reiterates that security problems are a common feature of many criminal proceedings, but cases in which security concerns alone justify excluding the public from a trial are nevertheless rare ( see Riepan v. Austria, no. 35115/97, § 34, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII ). Admittedly, it was incumbent on the domestic judicial authorities to protect the safety and security of the persons present in the courtroom and to respond to the threat of D.'s assassination. However, in the Court's view, the security measures should be narrowly tailored and comply with the principle of necessity. The judicial authorities should thoroughly consider all possible alternatives to ensure safety and security in the courtroom and give preference to a less strict measure over a stricter one when it can achieve the same purpose. The Court notes that it is regrettable that in the present case no such effort was made by the trial court. It did not explain why such measures as, for instance, installation of metal detectors or screening of the public entering the courtroom were insufficient in the circumstances of the case. Nor did it find that the state security system in place at the courthouse was inadequate to such an extent that an assassination attempt could not be prevented other than by completely closing the trial to the public."

There is nothing in the trial court's decision to suggest that those considerations were of any concern to the trial court."

The Court concedes that the sensitive content of the testimony to be provided by the witnesses in question might call for certain limitations of the applicant's right to a public hearing. Nevertheless, it was the duty of the court to restrict the rights of the accused as little as possible. In the present case the Court discerns nothing in the materials in its possession to suggest that closing only part of the hearing, during which the witnesses would testify, would have jeopardised or impacted negatively on the clarity and accuracy of their testimony or infringed their privacy."

                "30. When assessing whether the proceedings had been excessively long, the Supreme Court firstly observed that the case had been rather complex as regards the issues of law, and very complex from an evidentiary perspective. Nine persons had been accused, two of whom had been Members of Parliament whose immunity had had to be lifted (see paragraph 15 above). Complex schemes had been used to commit the offences in question, and the activities of the accused had involved a high level of conspiracy. This had made the collection of evidence concerning the offences difficult and the analysis of the ( circumstancial ) evidence time-consuming. Numerous witnesses had been heard during the pre-trial proceedings and in court (see paragraphs 13 and 17 above). The proceedings before the court of first instance had entailed hearings over the course of ninety-two days, and this also indicated how many questions had needed to be addressed and how complex the questions had been."

                "31. Secondly, the Supreme Court stated that there had been no delays during the pre-trial and trial stage of the proceedings. Rather, the lower courts had attempted to guarantee that the proceedings would not last an excessively long time. Some procedural flexibility had been lost due to the fact that the first-instance court had allowed the accused who had not been directly concerned by particular questions and evidence to be absent from the hearings altogether (see paragraph 17 above). At the same time, this had alleviated the effect of the proceedings on the accused, and had therefore been justified. The Supreme Court admitted that the organisation of the court hearings at first instance (not planning hearings sufficiently far in advance and not deciding on procedural matters quickly enough, thus allowing for long disputes between the parties ), the volume and structure of the criminal file, and the presentation of the statement of charges (which had entailed unnecessary repetition and the structure of which had been illogical to some extent ) might have added to the duration of the proceedings. However, the court noted that the defence representatives had opposed hearings being planned in advance, and in that regard they too had to be considered responsible. Furthermore, although it might have been reasonable for the prosecution to remove some of the material from the criminal file, the Supreme Court also considered that it had been for the defence representatives and not for the prosecution to decide whether some of the evidence in the criminal file was relevant from the perspective of the defence. The presentation of the statement of charges had not hindered defence rights either. As for separating the criminal case of E.T. from the rest of the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 79 below), the Supreme Court considered that this had related to only one of the charges against the third applicant and the first applicant company, and the latter ’ s counsel had not objected to the separation. Accordingly, the decision not to separate the case of E.T. from the rest of the proceedings could not be considered justified. In conclusion, the Supreme Court found that although some time might have been lost owing to the above-mentioned issues, the overall loss of time had been relatively insignificant in the context of the total duration of the proceedings."

In that regard, it noted that the defence representatives could not have been expected to preventively clear their timetables for possible appeal hearings in autumn 2012. Therefore, the fact that, at the appeal stage, hearings had only taken place six months after the Court of Appeal had started planning the relevant dates (see paragraph 21 above) could not be held against the applicants. Although the applicants could not be reproached for the fact that hearings had had to be cancelled or adjourned owing to their health and other personal reasons (see paragraph 17 above), such delays could not be attributed to the State either."

Moreover, on 17 February 2010 the first-instance court had annulled a restriction imposed on the first, the second and the third applicants not to leave their place of residence."

Firstly, it noted that, in accordance with Article 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Kriminaalmenetluse seadustik, hereinafter “the CCrP ”, see paragraph 49 below) all court decisions, including decisions authorising secret surveillance activities, had to be reasoned. That meant that, in accordance with Article 110 § 1 of the CCrP (see paragraph 45 below), authorisation decisions had to contain reasoning as to why the issuing court found that there was probable cause to believe that an offence had been committed, and why it was impossible, or especially complicated, to collect evidence by other means (the principle of ultima ratio ). That reasoning could not be merely declaratory. The necessary reasoning could, however, rely on general criminological knowledge, for example knowledge concerning the nature of organised crime, the high level of conspiracy involved in the case in question, a presumed lack of witnesses willing to give statements, and so on. In any event, the reasoning had to be linked to the evidence in that particular case. Owing to time pressure and the likely fragmentary nature of information available at the time, the duty to provide reasons was less extensive when authorising secret surveillance than when deciding to convict a person."

                "37. The Supreme Court then noted that the preliminary investigation judges ’ decisions (see paragraph 12 above) had not complied with the requirement of being reasoned. However, the lack of reasoning did not amount to a lack of authorisation, and did not mean that the surveillance activities had been conducted arbitrarily and beyond judicial control. This was so because the investigating authority was not competent to assess the adequacy of reasoning. It had the right to rely on the operative part of a decision authorising surveillance activities. Therefore, the failure to give proper reasons for a decision authorising surveillance activities did not result in the inadmissibility of evidence thereby collected. The Supreme Court reasoned that it was not only during the authorisation stage that the ultima ratio nature of the secret surveillance measures could be examined. In fact, regardless of the existence of earlier decisions authorising surveillance activities, courts subsequently hearing a criminal case also had an obligation to examine whether the substantive conditions for granting the authorisation decisions had been fulfilled at the time the decisions had been issued. If necessary, the courts could then declare the evidence thereby obtained inadmissible. A lack of requisite reasoning in an initial authorisation decision required the subsequent examination to be conducted with special diligence."

The Supreme Court went on to note that it had directly examined the material in the surveillance file, including the prosecutors ’ applications for authorisation of surveillance activities. Based on that material, it had concluded that the substantive conditions for authorising surveillance activities had been fulfilled at the time the authorisation decisions had been issued. The Supreme Court was convinced that at that time there had been probable cause to believe that offences had been committed, and that it had been impossible to collect evidence by other means to verify that suspicion. In support of its findings, the Supreme Court referred to the nature of the crimes and the high level of conspiracy involved, and considered that it was unlikely that written or electronic evidence could have been collected or that witnesses could have been found without the proceedings being jeopardised."

It then reiterated its position outlined above regarding the decisions issued by a preliminary investigation judge authorising surveillance activities.

Up until that judgment, it had been established case-law that, in accordance with Article 111 of the CCrP, violating the ultima ratio principle when issuing secret surveillance authorisations also inevitably meant that the evidence thereby obtained was inadmissible. In the instant case, the Supreme Court had distinguished between “granting authorisation for secret surveillance activities” and “obtaining evidence via secret surveillance activities”, and had stated that a violation of law during the authorisation stage could not affect the admissibility of evidence.",

Against that background, the legislature had created a system of safeguards. The central part of those safeguards was the requirement that measures which interfered with fundamental rights particularly severely (those mentioned in Articles 116, 118 and 119 of the CCrP ) be taken only when authorised under Article 114 of the CCrP by a preliminary investigation judge.

In a judgment of 13 June 2016, the Supreme Court found that as the surveillance activities in question had already been declared unlawful, the damage caused by them fell under section 7 ( 1 ) of the Act on Compensation for Damage Caused in Criminal Proceedings. The violation of a person ’ s home or private life or the confidentiality of his or her messages constituted grounds for compensating for non-pecuniary damage (section 11 ( 2 ) of the same Act). Non-pecuniary damage was presumed (first sentence of section 11 ( 3 ) of the same Act). The Supreme Court also stressed that in the event that a criminal court had already adjudicated upon the ( un) lawfulness of certain measures taken in criminal proceedings and that judgment had become final, such conclusions were binding for the administrative court deciding on compensation. The court reiterated that it was only in exceptional circumstances, where a person had not had the opportunity to ask for the lawfulness of procedural measures to be assessed in the so-called main proceedings, that a court adjudicating upon the compensation claim was competent to assess the lawfulness of actions or orders taken in criminal proceedings."

Not only did it involve several accused, but it concerned the “hidden offences” of offering and accepting gratuities, characterised by a high level of conspiracy and complex patterns of conduct between various people, which thus rendered it difficult to gather and present evidence of the alleged crimes. Moreover, the case involved the examination of a number of witnesses. Against that background, it is understandable that the investigation, the analysis and presentation of evidence and the ensuing court proceedings were time-consuming. The Court finds that, in a situation where criminal proceedings involve closely interlinked acts of several of the accused, and where separating the cases would not be attainable or procedurally reasonable (including from the perspective of defence rights – see paragraph 18 above), the complexity of the case must be assessed as a whole, not from the perspective of every single accused person."

Furthermore, as regards the proceedings before the first-instance court, although the first and the second applicants claimed that there had been periods of inactivity during that stage, they did not specify when exactly those periods had occurred, and owing to which circumstances. As for the applicants ’ criticism about the delay resulting from the failure to schedule hearings at appellate level, the Court notes that the Supreme Court specifically explained that it had not been possible to find hearing dates that suited all of the applicants ’ representatives (see paragraphs 21 and 32 above). The Court takes into account that scheduling a trial of such magnitude depends not only on the courts; there must also be due regard for representatives and their availability."

The Court takes particular note of the critical comments of the Supreme Court concerning the presentation of the statement of charges, the composition and structure of the criminal file, and the planning and management of the hearings before the first-instance court (see paragraph 31 above). At the same time, it notes that although the Harju County Court – being aware of the risk of excessively long proceedings – took steps to speed up the proceedings (see paragraph 17 above regarding hearing witnesses ), the decisions to limit hearings to three days a week, not to plan hearings more than a year in advance and to grant flexibility to the defence representatives as regards appearing in court were taken either at the request of the applicants or in their interests. As to the criticism expressed regarding the quality of the statement of charges, the composition of the criminal file and – as raised by the applicants – the reclassification of the offence as offering and accepting gratuities rather than bribery, the Court does not find that any of these acts, viewed against the wider background of the proceedings, contributed to the length of the proceedings to such an extent as to be decisive on their own. Although separating E.T. ’ s case from the proceedings (see paragraph 31 above) would feasibly have had an impact on the length of the proceedings against her, the Court cannot speculate about the possible impact this could have had on the duration of the proceedings against the applicants. As noted above, the separation of the first applicant ’ s case from the rest of the proceedings was opposed by other applicants ’ representatives (see paragraphs 18 above).

As the decisions in question had not been sufficiently reasoned, the interference with the applicants ’ rights could not have been “in accordance with the law” and had failed to satisfy the foreseeability requirement. In that regard, it was of no relevance that the Supreme Court ’ s decision had been taken only after the Court ’ s judgment in the case of Dragojević. Furthermore, referring to the dissenting opinion of Judge Kergandberg, the Supreme Court judge (see paragraph 41 above), they argued that the Supreme Court ’ s solution of retrospectively providing reasoning for authorisation decisions opened a door to arbitrariness, and had been a radical reversal of the Supreme Court ’ s previous approach."

This, in turn, meant that the authorisations had not been in accordance with the law. In support of his argument, he pointed to the modification of the relevant regulation as of 1 January 2013 (see paragraph 53 above), a modification which meant that having insufficient reasoning when granting secret surveillance authorisations would result in evidence being declared inadmissible. The second applicant disagreed with the Supreme Court ’ s line of argument that insufficient reasoning in authorisation decisions could not be equated to a lack of authorisation as such. He considered that this departed from the Supreme Court ’ s previous case- law. In that regard, he relied on the dissenting opinion of Judge Kergandberg (see paragraph 41 above). In the Dragojević case, there had been no established domestic case-law on the matter in Croatia. However, in the instant case, despite the fact that there had been domestic case-law, the Supreme Court had started to retrospectively justify the necessity of secret surveillance. The second applicant doubted the necessity of the secret surveillance in his case, and doubted that the Supreme Court had considered the private life aspect when assessing the admissibility of evidence obtained via secret surveillance.

It stressed in particular that ex post facto reviews of the lawfulness of secret surveillance – which allowed verification of whether compulsory ex ante reviews had indeed been carried out – had proved to be effective in Estonia. This applied to cases where the courts were called upon to verify whether the preconditions for authorising surveillance measures had been fulfilled (for example by assessing whether there had been written authorisation, see paragraph 60 above), or where the courts performed checks on whether the surveillance activities carried out had indeed been in accordance with such authorisation. The Government pointed to the domestic case-law whereby the Supreme Court had declared secret surveillance authorisations unlawful once it had found – as a result of an ex post facto review – that at the time the authorisations had been granted, the ultima ratio principle had not been complied with (see paragraph 62 above). The relevant authorities were aware that insufficient reasoning in authorisations could render the ex post facto verification of adherence to the ultima ratio principle impossible, and thus result in the inadmissibility of evidence. In the light of that fact, the use of ex post facto reviews did not open the door to arbitrariness."

In any event, the Dragojević judgment, which had been the first judgment of the Court to deal with the consequences of insufficiently reasoned surveillance authorisations, had been rendered after the final judgment in the present case, and thus its conclusions could not have been taken into account by the Estonian Supreme Court at the relevant time."

The aim of Article 110 of the CCrP was to ensure that interferences arising from secret surveillance were compatible with the right to privacy. Also, the Supreme Court had confirmed that the preconditions set out in Article 110 CCrP were meant to guarantee suspects ’ privacy as well as their right of defence (see paragraphs 35 and 58 above ). However, the Government pointed out that the applicants themselves had raised the issue of insufficient reasoning in authorisations, primarily in connection with the admissibility of evidence, and thus this had been the issue that the domestic courts had had to solve. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court, also acting as a constitutional court, had assessed the compatibility of the domestic regulation of secret surveillance with the guarantees provided by the Constitution and the Convention (see paragraph 40 above).

The Government confirmed that such remedies existed in Estonia. It had been open to the applicants to contest the relevant authorisations themselves, as well as the activities carried out on the basis of those authorisations, once they had been notified of the secret surveillance or had otherwise become aware of it (that is, at the latest, when the criminal file had been presented to them ). This could have been done in the pre-trial proceedings ( as regards the prosecutors ’ authorisations, see paragraphs 50, 51 and 54 above ) or alternatively during the court proceedings ( as regards both the prosecutors ’ authorisations and those issued by the preliminary investigation judge). The domestic courts could then have declared either the authorisations or the actions based on the authorisations unlawful, and the applicants could have lodged an application for compensation for non-pecuniary damage with an administrative court (before 1 May 2015, see paragraphs 66 to 68 above) or with a county court (after 1 May 2015, under the Act on Compensation for Damage Caused in Criminal Proceedings, see paragraphs 68 and 69 above ). It was admittedly difficult to predict the potential success of a damages claim which concerned only a procedural error, namely authorisations having insufficient reasoning.

In view of the risk that a system of secret surveillance for the protection of national security may undermine or even destroy democracy under the cloak of defending it, the Court must be satisfied that there exist guarantees against abuse which are adequate and effective. This assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to permit, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 232). Review and supervision of secret surveillance measures may come into play at three stages: when the surveillance is first ordered, while it is being carried out, or after it has been terminated. As regards the first two stages, the very nature and logic of secret surveillance dictate that not only the surveillance itself but also the accompanying review should be effected without the individual ’ s knowledge. Consequently, since the individual will necessarily be prevented from seeking an effective remedy of his or her own accord or from taking a direct part in any review proceedings, it is essential that the procedures established should themselves provide adequate and equivalent guarantees safeguarding his or her rights ( see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 233)."

It was exactly this practice of circumventing the requirement to provide reasons at the initial authorisation stage and accepting that they could also be provided later during the proceedings which opened a door to arbitrariness contrary to the guarantees under Article 8 of the Convention.

X was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. The Supreme Court ( Højesteret ) upheld the sentence in 1983.

Both requests were refused by the City Court of Gladsaxe ( retten i Gladsaxe ) on 28 May 1993. In June 1993 the prosecution appealed against the decision on seizure and the applicants appealed against the decision on venue. At the request of one of the applicants' counsel, an oral hearing was scheduled to take place in the High Court of Eastern Denmark ( Østre Landsret ) on 15 November 1993. However, on 7 October 1993 counsel challenged one of the judges in the High Court alleging disqualification and requested an oral hearing on the issue. The High Court decided on 15 October 1993 to refuse an oral hearing and on 11 November 1993 that the judge in question was not disqualified. It appears that counsel requested leave to appeal against this decision to the Supreme Court ( Højesteret ), but to no avail. As to the appeal against non-seizure and the question of venue, hearings were held in the High Court on 6 January and 7 March 1994, and by a decision of 21 March 1994 the High Court upheld the City Court's decisions.

This impression was strengthened by the first of the concluding questions: '... why did the vital part of the taxi driver's explanation disappear and who, in the police or public prosecutor's office, should carry the responsibility for this?'. In connection with the scenes about the two police officers they pose two questions in the commentator's narrative, to which the indictment relates; irrespective of the kind of question, viewers undoubtedly received a clear impression that a report had been made about the taxi driver's statement that she had seen X at the relevant time on 12 December 1981; that this report had subsequently been suppressed; and that such suppression had been decided upon either by the named Chief Superintendent alone or by him and the Chief Inspector of the Flying Squad jointly. The subsequent questions in the commentator's narrative do not weaken this impression, and neither does the question as to whether the Chief Constable or the Public Prosecutor were aware of the taxi driver's statement. On this basis we find that in the programme 'The Blind Eye of the Police' the applicants made allegations against the named Superintendent which were intended to discredit him in the eyes of his peers, as described in Article 267, subsection 1 of the Penal Code ( Straffeloven ). We find further that it must have been clear to the applicants that they were, by way of their presentation, making such allegations.",

Even though being in the public eye is a natural part of a police officer's duties, consideration should also be given to his good name and reputation.",

In consequence of the ongoing proceedings for reopening the case, the applicants could not count on the Chief Superintendent and the two police officers, who had interviewed the taxi driver in 1981, being prepared to participate in the programme and hence possibly anticipate proceedings in the Court of Revision. Making the allegations cannot accordingly be justified by lack of police participation in the programme.",

            ],
            [
                "63. The Court reiterates its well-established case-law, whereby the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the Court to determine whether the “interference” complained of corresponded to a “pressing social need”, whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient (see the Sunday Times (no. 1) v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 38, § 62). In assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. Thus, the Court's task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation (see, among many other authorities, Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, § 45, Reports 1999-I)."
            ],
            [
                "64. One factor of particular importance for the Court's determination in the present case is the distinction between statements of fact and value judgments. While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see. e.g. Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 28, § 46 and Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A, no. 204, p. 27, § 63). However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive ( Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, § 43, 27.2.2001)."
            ],
            [
                "65. Another factor of particular relevance to the present case is the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society. Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest (see the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 27, § 63; the Jersild v. Denmark judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 23, § 31 and the De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, pp. 233-34, § 37). In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see the Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 313, p. 19, § 38). Thus, the national margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of a democratic society in enabling the press to exercise its vital role of “public watchdog” in imparting information of serious public concern (see the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports 1996-II, p. 500, § 39)."

                "66. Finally, the court reiterates that limits of acceptable criticism in respect of civil servants exercising their powers may admittedly in some circumstances be wider than in relation to private individuals. However, it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent to which politicians do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with the latter when it comes to the criticism of their actions. Moreover, civil servants must enjoy public confidence in conditions free of undue perturbation if they are to be successful in performing their tasks and it may therefore prove necessary to protect them from offensive and abusive verbal attacks when on duty. Public prosecutors and superior police officers are civil servants whose task it is to contribute to the proper administration of justice. In this respect they form part of the judicial machinery in the broader sense of this term. It is in the general interest that they, like judicial officers, should enjoy public confidence. It may therefore be necessary for the State to protect them from accusations that are unfounded (see Lesnik v. Slovakia, no. 35640/97, §§ 53 and 54, 11 March 2003 ).",

The Court notes in particular that the applicants did not leave it open, or at least included an appropriate question, whether the taxi driver in 1981 actually had given the explanation to the police that she nine years later alleged to have done."

Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 28, § 46 and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, ECHR 1999-III)."

It must therefore be examined whether they acted in good faith and complied with the ordinary obligation to verify a factual statement. In this respect the Court recalls that Article 10 of the Convention protects journalists' right to divulge information on issues of general interest provided that they are acting in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide “reliable and precise” information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see e.g. the Fressoz and Roire judgment § 54; the Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas judgment § 58, and the Prager and Oberschlick judgment § 37, all cited above). Accordingly, Article 10 of the Convention does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern. Under the terms of paragraph 2 of the Article the exercise of this freedom carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the press. These “duties and responsibilities” are liable to assume significance when, as in the present case, there is a question of attacking the reputation of a named individual and infringing the “rights of others”. Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention individuals have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proven guilty (see inter alia Worm v. Austria, judgment of 29 August 1997, Reports 1997-V, § 50 and Du Roy and Malaurie v. France, no. 34000/96, § 34, ECHR 2000 ‑ X)."

Consequently, on 20 December 1991, i.e. eight months after the broadcasting of the programme “The Blind Eye of the Police” the Prosecutor General found this non-compliance unfortunate and open to criticism.

Only two judges out of five found that new testimonial evidence had been produced on which X might have been acquitted, had it been available at the trial.

The Supreme Court clearly recognised that the applicants' intentions, in the programme, of undertaking a critical assessment of the police's investigation was a proper part of the role of the media in acting as a public watchdog.

As it had already explained at length in an earlier decision, Article 6 (art. 6) protected the individual only from possible hazards in civil or criminal trials. This was clear beyond a peradventure from the wording of the provision itself. There was no reason to give Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2) a broad interpretation such as would extend its application to other proceedings. The Article (art. 6-2) consequently could not apply to proceedings in connection with \"regulatory offences\", as these had been excluded from the category of criminal offences, and procedure relating to them was quite distinct from criminal procedure. On the basis that Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2) was not applicable, the District Court had therefore been right to order the defendant to bear his own necessary costs and expenses (under Article 467 § 3, second sentence, sub-paragraph 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure) because had the prosecution not been statute-barred, \"the defendant would almost certainly ( mit annähernder Sicherheit ) have been found guilty of an offence\". He had himself admitted to the police that he was not expecting the car which was moving out to the left onto the road in front of him to make a U-turn; and that he had consequently attempted to overtake it but had been unable to avoid a collision despite his efforts to brake. Mr. Lutz had thus broken the basic rule in Regulation 1(2) of the Road Traffic Regulations and, in particular, had disregarded his duty under Regulation 5(3)(1) not to overtake where the traffic situation was unclear. The court held that in such circumstances it would have been unjust to award the defendant ’ s necessary costs and expenses against the Treasury, especially as the prosecution had become time-barred only during the course of the court proceedings, so that until that moment the defendant was rightly being proceeded against."

However strong the suspicions, the presumption of innocence precluded taking measures against a defendant ( Beschuldigter ) that amounted in effect to a penalty (Strafe) in anticipation of a penalty ( im Vorgriff auf die Strafe).

The judgment continued:",

Furthermore, the decision as to costs and expenses pursuant to Article 467 § 3, sub-paragraph 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure and section 46(1) of the Act on ‘ regulatory offences ’ does not make any finding that the person concerned is guilty: it derives merely from the suspicion falling on him, which had given rise to his being prosecuted for a ‘ regulatory offence ’.

By a judgment delivered on 26 March 1987, the Federal Constitutional Court quashed, as contravening the principle, two decisions by district courts and one decision by a regional court whereby the courts, having held the guilt of the defendants to be insignificant ( gering ), had stayed the private prosecutions brought against them but had awarded the costs of the proceedings against the defendants, including the costs and expenses of the complainants (cases 2 Bvr 589/79, 2 Bvr 740/81 and 2 Bvr 284/85, Europäische Grundrechte-Zeitschrift 1987, pp. 203-209).",

It pointed out that the principle of the presumption of innocence derived from the principle of the rule of law, and it also referred to Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention. The Convention did not have the status of constitutional law in the Federal Republic, but regard should be had to it and to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in interpreting the principles and fundamental rights enshrined in the Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ).",

The Court added that this principle requires that guilt be proved according to law before it can be held against the person concerned. A finding of guilt will accordingly not be legitimate for this purpose unless it is pronounced at the close of a trial which has reached the stage at which a verdict can be given.",

Under the legislation of 1968/1975, which \"decriminalised\" petty offences, including road traffic offences in particular, the charges against Mr. Lutz constituted merely a \"regulatory offence\" ( Ordnungswidrigkeit ). Such an offence, the Government claimed, differed from a criminal offence both in its legal characteristics and consequences and in the procedure to be followed. The judgment delivered by the Court on 21 February 1984 in the Öztürk case was confined to the issue of the free assistance of an interpreter (Article 6 § 3 (e)) (art. 6-3-e) in the circumstances of that applicant and had not, the Government maintained, in any way already decided the applicability of Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2) to the present case.",

In German law, this was not a criminal offence ( Straftat ) but a \"regulatory offence\". The question accordingly arises whether this classification is decisive for the purposes of the Convention."

Admittedly, the only point it was determining was whether sub-paragraph (e) (art. 6-3-e) gave the applicant a right to the free assistance of an interpreter in the domestic proceedings complained of. However, with regard to the introductory sentence of paragraph 3 (art. 6-3), the Court referred to paragraph 1 of the same Article (art. 6-1), the reason being that it had consistently held paragraph 1 (art. 6-1) to embody the basic rule of which paragraphs 2 and 3 (art. 6-2, art. 6-3) represented specific applications (see the Öztürk judgment previously cited, p. 17, § 47). After affirming the \"autonomy\" of the concept of \"criminal\" in Article 6 (art. 6), the Court concluded that the contravention with which Mr. Öztürk was charged \"was criminal\" for the purposes of that Article (art. 6) (ibid., pp. 18 and 21, §§ 50 and 54).",
                "The Court thus proceeded on the basis that in using the terms \"criminal charge\" (accusation en matière pénale ) and \"charged with a criminal offence\" ( accusé, accusé d ’ une infraction) the three paragraphs of Article 6 (art. 6-1, art. 6-2, art. 6-3) referred to identical situations. It had previously adopted a similar approach to Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2), albeit in a context that was undeniably a criminal one under the domestic law (see the Adolf judgment of 26 March 1982, Series A no. 49, p. 15, § 30, and the Minelli judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62, p. 15, § 27).

It summarised them as follows:",
                "\"The first matter to be ascertained is whether or not the text defining the offence in issue belongs, according to the legal system of the respondent State, to criminal law; next, the nature of the offence and, finally, the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risked incurring must be examined, having regard to the object and purpose of Article 6 (art. 6), to the ordinary meaning of the terms of that Article (art. 6) and to the laws of the Contracting States.\" (Öztürk judgment, Series A no. 73, p. 18, § 50)",

It held that there was consequently no need to examine Mr. Öztürk ’ s contravention \"also in the light of the final criterion stated ...\", for \"the relative lack of seriousness of the penalty at stake ... cannot divest an offence of its inherently criminal character\" (ibid., p. 21, § 54).",

This decision also settled the question of costs, as required under Articles 464 and 467 of the Code of Criminal Procedure taken together with section 46 of the Act on \"regulatory offences\", and left the applicant to bear his own necessary costs and expenses. Apportionment of the costs was a consequence and necessary concomitant of the stay of proceedings (Article 464 of the Code of Criminal Procedure - see paragraph 37 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, the Minelli judgment previously cited, Series A no. 62, p. 16, § 30).

Having regard to the large number of minor offences - notably in relation to road traffic - which are not so discreditable that the offenders deserve the stigma of a criminal penalty, a Contracting State may have good reasons for introducing a system which relieves its courts of the task of dealing with the great majority of them.

This provision sets forth one of the exceptions to the rule in German law that, where criminal proceedings are discontinued, the necessary costs and expenses of the person \"charged with a criminal offence\" are to be awarded against the Treasury (Article 467 § 1).

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards that person as guilty (see Allenet de Ribemont v.

Ukraine, no. 11901/02, § 67, 29 June 2006). Moreover, the principle of the presumption of innocence may be infringed not only by a judge or court but also by other public authorities (see Virabyan v.

However, in the Court ’ s view, the decision taken by the Budapest main police department is inseparable from the enactment of the Amnesty Act and can be understood as a “single procedural act effected in several stages” (see, mutatis mutandis, Adolf v. Austria, 26 March 1982, § 32, Series A no. 49). The prosecuting authorities ’ recourse to the Act cannot affect the existence, or retroactively alter the nature, of procedures conducted prior to the prosecution decision terminating the proceedings. Furthermore, Article 6 applies whenever a person is charged with any criminal offence, irrespective of whether the criminal offence was unpunished or non-punishable, in particular as a result of the decriminalisation of acts of a trivial nature (see Adolf, cited above, § 33)."

In such circumstances it can be said that the decisions of the national courts did not observe the basic requirement of criminal justice that the prosecution has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and were not in accordance with one of the fundamental principles of criminal law, namely, in dubio pro reo (see, mutatis mutandis, Barberà, Messegué and Jabardo v.

When Nedjeljko Ajdarić came into the room he exchanged greetings with M.G. and their conversation gave me the impression that they had known each other for years. ...",
                "M.G. and Nedjeljko Ajdarić had secret conversations for days. They sat on their beds and talked and since my bed was next to theirs, although they were talking in lowered voices, I could hear what they were saying. I heard Nedjeljko Ajdarić saying that he had prospered from that money and that his business was going well, and I heard M.G. saying: ‘We did it all well, only I made a mistake by placing the money into a container’, but he did not explain what container. They also mentioned that about 960,000 Croatian kuna (HRK) had been found in the house, some in foreign currency, and some in HRK. I heard Nedjeljko Ajdarić saying that he had been afraid to go to the border crossing between Stara Gradiška and Bosanska Gradiška and that in the end he had crossed [the State border] in Davor, and he also mentioned that he had been accompanied by a woman, but I could not understand whether it had been his wife or the wife of M.G.",

Nedjeljko Ajdarić also mentioned that he had gone to a hill known as ‘Veseli Brijeg’ in order to send the signal, but he had not succeeded [...] and in the end had sent a signal from the ‘Motajica’ mountain. When they talked about sending that signal from a mobile telephone, I heard M.G. telling Nedjeljko Ajdarić that if anything happened, Nedjeljko would testify that he had been in Bosnia and from their conversation I concluded that Nedjeljko Ajdarić had gone to Bosnia with the mobile telephone of M.G. and that he, by making some telephone calls, had created an alibi for M.G., [in other words], that he had been in Bosnia.",
                "When I listened to these secret conversations between [M.]G. and Ajdarić I also heard them mentioning how they had been surprised to find three people in the house and that they had not expected a third person, and that therefore they had waited for a long time in front of the house for someone to come out and take the children away. They also mentioned that they had seen a woman taking the children out of the house, but I did not hear whether they referred to one child only or to more than one.",

                "From the above-mentioned secret conversations between [M.]G. and Ajdarić, in the course of which they mentioned that they had been surprised to find a third person in the house, I concluded that a financial transaction had taken place in that house and that a third person was involved.",

I also remember that they mentioned that in a container in [M.]G.’s [house] the sum of HRK 460,000 had been found, while the rest of the money had ended up with Ajdarić. Nedjeljko Ajdarić also told [M.]G. that he had spent his part of the money on opening his car-dealing business in Banja Luka. I also heard Nedjeljko Ajdarić telling [M.]G. that his company had sold stolen cars and had been involved in life insurance and car insurance and that the wife of Nedjeljko Ajdarić was also employed there and that there were other employees. I also heard Ajdarić telling [M.]G. that it was possible to obtain a car through his company, with all the documents, without going to the police.",

Owing to health problems I was sent to Zagreb Prison Hospital where I was placed in room no. 206 between the end of November 2005 and 13 January 2006.",

Before that he had been in the surgical ward and was transferred to a non-smoking room. I do not recall the exact date when he was transferred to my room, but I remember that it was sometime in December 2005, and as a result we spent a lot of time in the same room. Immediately upon his arrival we started to get to know each other and to talk and I told him right away for which criminal offence I was detained, but at the beginning he did not want to tell me what he was accused of. In our discussions we had an argument about a defence lawyer in the present case, since the same counsel was defending us both, and I did not like the fact that the accused had criticised her.",
                "Sometime in mid December 2005, I do not remember the exact date, Nedjeljko Ajdarić was also transferred to the same room from Remetinec Prison. I immediately noticed that the accused and Nedjeljko Ajdarić greeted each other as if they had known each other for a long time. The bed occupied by Nedjeljko Ajdarić was in the middle, that is to say, between the one that I occupied and the one occupied by the accused. There were six inmates in the room, and they often changed.",
                "Since the bed occupied by the accused was next to the one occupied by Nedjeljko Ajdarić and the distance between the beds was twenty to thirty centimetres, they often talked to each other. They firstly talked about the occupation of Nedjeljko Ajdarić in Banja Luka. I mostly heard these conversations when lying on my bed reading the newspapers and doing crossword puzzles. I remember clearly that the accused and Nedjeljko Ajdarić started to discuss the criminal offence Ajdarić was accused of and I remember that Ajdarić had bought a car somewhere near Karlovac, which had been stolen, and Ajdarić and his wife and another person had been arrested on that account. Ajdarić had stayed in detention while his wife had been released. Ajdarić said that he had been sentenced to one year’s imprisonment and that he had had four more months to serve, after which he would be released and I remember that he had expressed some fear, and that the accused had comforted him. Also, Ajdarić said that he had been dealing in smuggled cars, licence plates and car insurance documents and that he had bought a machine in Germany for identifying the codes of expensive cars.",
                "From their conversations I heard that the accused had family in Banja Luka and that they knew each other from Banja Luka. I also remember that Ajdarić said that the man from whom he had bought the car had died. He said that it was lucky that he had died because otherwise it would have been discovered how he had committed a criminal offence. Another inmate, J.M., reacted to that story since he knew the man who had died.",
                "After that the two of them started to talk about the mobile telephone. Ajdarić said that he had gone to Kutina with S. – I do not know that person – and that they had waited for a long time for a woman to return to the house, a woman who had left the house with one child or more children – I did not understand this very well. I also heard them saying that they had no knowledge about the third person in that house. I remember that they said that they had waited to enter the house, and that the wife of the accused had also been there and that it [sic] concerned a money exchange office where a childhood friend of the accused had worked. From what Ajdarić was saying, I understood that he was worried and I remember the accused telling him that a woman, who was the key prosecution witness in the proceedings, had changed her statement in their favour. They also discussed the money and I remember Ajdarić saying that he would pay for the defence of the accused and they also mentioned that the first lawyer who had defended the accused in these proceedings had later on engaged the services of lawyer B.J.",
                "After I left the [Zagreb Prison] Hospital, I contacted the Bjelovar Police and they asked if I wished to be a witness in the proceedings against the accused and I told them that I firstly wished to consult lawyer B.J, who was both my defence counsel and the defence counsel of the accused. I consulted her and she came to visit me to prison and asked me if I knew anything about the event at issue. I told her that the accused had said that he had been found out as a result of what his wife had been telling [other people] in the town and the lawyer asked me for whom I was working. I told her that I did not work for anyone and that I had decided to testify because of the children who had been left behind. The lawyer told me to be careful what I was saying and that I might be ‘swallowed by the dark’. She said that when I mentioned the name S.",
                "I would also like to add that I heard the accused and Ajdarić saying that later on it had been a problem for them to reach Banja Luka and that Ajdarić and the wife of the accused had crossed the state border at Davor because the wife of the accused had to return the mobile telephone of the accused back to Croatia, while S. crossed the state border in Stara Gradiška. Ajdarić and the wife of the accused had taken the money and two mobile telephones, while the accused had returned to Bjelovar. They took mobile telephones to Bosnia and Herzegovina because they wanted to send signals to Bjelovar. They mentioned that they had [tried to] send a signal from the Motajica mountain, where the signal had been low, so they had gone to the area known as ‘Veseli Brijeg’ near Banja Luka and sent a signal from there.",
                "I also remember that they said that the money had been found in a container, but I do not know if they meant a deep freezer or something else. So, the money had been found in that container, about HRK 450,000.",
                "I would also like to mention a further detail which I noticed while in the prison hospital. It was a Sunday, visiting time and both the accused and Ajdarić had visitors. Ajdarić returned about ten minutes before the accused. The door of the room was open and I saw Ajdarić waving to someone from the open window in the hall. I approached the window to see who he was waving at and I also asked him about it and he said that he was waving at his wife. I saw the car in which his wife had arrived, it was a Golf, and I asked him how come his wife was driving such a car, since he had been bragging that he dealt in expensive cars, and he told me that the car belonged to someone in Croatia who had driven his wife there for the visit and that that man was carrying money to finance the accused’s defence. I asked him if that person was S. and he told me that it was not my business.",

He would only watch the news and then return [to the room] because he had been interested in what the two had been talking about.",

Thus, he said that the applicant and M.G. had had secret conversations and had spoken in lowered voices. If the conversations had been secret, then they would not have been conducted within the hearing of a third person.

As regards the time of the alleged secret conversations between the applicant and M.G., S.Š. firstly claimed that they mostly took place in the afternoon and at the hearing held on 26 June 2006 he said that they took place in the evening, after dinner. It was improbable and unconvincing that two perpetrators of such grave criminal offences would discuss the details of these offences in front of a third person. S.Š. also mentioned that a woman, the key prosecution witness in the proceedings, had altered her previous statement in favour of the accused. However, there had been no such witness in the proceedings. He also repeatedly stated that a person with the surname S. had also been implicated in the murder of the three people in question. However, the person of that name was actually one of the murder victims. S.Š. had no personal direct knowledge of the murders at issue. When giving his evidence at the trial he constantly repeated the phrase ‘I concluded’ which could not be the basis for the applicant’s conviction. The witness enclosed his so called “notes”, allegedly made during the conversations between him and M.G. However, these notes were a list of meaningless words. His statement was in contradiction to those given by inmates from the same room, J.M. and N.P. Furthermore, there was no logic to the whole story and he (the applicant) had not even been to Croatia in 1998, but had been living in Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he had run his own business since 1990. He claimed that he had never met M.G. before. Finally, no material evidence found in the house where the murders had been committed had any connection with him.

However, contrary to their assertions, the first-instance court gave valid reasons for accepting the statement given by that witness and these reasons have not been called into question by the allegations in the appeals.",

Witnesses J.M. and N.P., who gave more details about the circumstances in their room in Zagreb Prison Hospital than witness T.M., said that the accused M.G. and Neđo Ajdarić spent more time together than with other inmates, by which they disputed the defence put forward by the accused, in particular the allegation by Ajdarić that he spoke to M.G. less than to the other inmates. The fact that the other inmates did not hear the conversations described by S.Š. does not cast doubt on that part of his statement, because witness J.M. said that he had regularly watched television, that M.G. had mostly stayed in the room with Ajdarić and that S.Š., who had sometimes watched television, would soon return to the room. Thus, witness S.Š., as it is indirectly shown from the statement of witness J.M., often had the opportunity to be alone in the room with the accused while the other inmates were watching television and was able to hear the confidential conversations which they had obviously then held.",

Such behaviour would be contradictory to the profiles of persons who conspired and planned to commit three murders in a professional manner. He also argued that he had been at large for five years and that in that period he would have had every chance to discuss the crimes at issue with the other perpetrator.",
                "However, [this court finds] that the accidental placement in the same room of persons who committed a criminal offence together cannot be regarded as impossible. The accused Neđo Ajdarić was detained in connection with a criminal offence unrelated to the one examined in these proceedings and was placed in Zagreb Prison Hospital, which only has a couple of rooms in each ward. At that time he was not yet a suspect in respect of the criminal offences which were the subject of the proceedings conducted against M.G. and therefore no formal obstacle existed for placing them in the same room.",

Finally, if the accused saw each other in that period and discussed the criminal offences they had committed, it is certain that after the judgment acquitting [M.G.] had been quashed and he had been detained, in view of these new circumstances and the development of the proceedings, they had something to discuss during their stay in Zagreb Prison Hospital.",
                "The description of the conversations between the accused given by S.Š. is neither unconvincing nor illogical: the accused G. and Ajdarić, as described by S.Š, conducted these conversations when all or at least most of the other inmates were absent, that is to say that they talked in secret as far as it was possible. It is obvious that because the accused talked in lowered voices about the criminal offences in question the witness S.Š did not hear all the details of their conversations. This is precisely why the parts of the statement given by witness S.Š in which he reconstructs the content of these conversations on the basis of the parts of these conversations that he had heard do not fit with the facts established on the basis of the other evidence. Thus, witness S.Š obviously wrongly understood the role of S., whom the accused had mentioned. However, if the evidence given by S.Š had been false, as suggested by the accused M.G. in his appeal, and had relied on facts from the newspapers, he surely would not have mentioned S. in the same context, since this is not shown in the previous proceedings.",

The accused did not specify who had [supposedly] instructed the witness and in whose interest that would be. Lastly, had the statement of that witness been fabricated and had he memorised it according to someone’s instructions, it would be expected that the memorised statement would be entirely in accordance with all the other evidence. It is precisely the contradictions about certain events (allegations of witness S.Š. about the telephone call on a mobile telephone from Bosnia, participation of S. and similar) that show that his statement was not fabricated and [that he was not] following instructions.",

Regarding this question in the present case, there was no modification of the timing of the commission of the offences.

The Court observes that the provisions of paragraph 3 (a) of Article 6 point to the need for special attention to be paid to the notification of the “accusation” to the defendant. Particulars of the offence play a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of their service that the suspect is formally put on notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him (see Kamasinski v. Austria, judgment of 19 December 1989, Series A no. 168, pp. 36-37, § 79). Article 6 § 3 (a) of the Convention affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the cause of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts. In criminal matters the provision of full, detailed information concerning the charges against a defendant, and consequently the legal characterisation that the court might adopt in the matter, is an essential prerequisite for ensuring that the proceedings are fair. Furthermore, the Court has ruled that sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article 6 § 3 are connected and that the right to be informed of the nature and the cause of the accusation must be considered in the light of the accused's right to prepare his defence (see Pélissier and Sassi v.

The Court of Appeal, having found that his position in the company had not been such as would have made it possible for him to commit the offences in issue as a principal offender, convicted him of aiding and abetting those offences. It is not the Court's task to give a ruling as to whether Finnish law, at the time of the proceedings, allowed the Court of Appeal to convict the applicant of aiding and abetting although he had been charged as the principal offender without drawing his attention to that possibility. Given the practice at the relevant time, it is obvious that the impugned interpretation and procedure applied were possible.

Regarding this question in the present case, there was no modification of the timing of the commission of the offences. However, the description of the factual situation set out in the indictment concerning the tax frauds changed during the proceedings in that the applicant had been charged with submitting VAT refund applications, relying on fabricated invoices ( allegedly drawn up by H.A., a co-defendant), whereas he had been convicted also of preparation of the documents needed for the commission of the offences (compare and contrast paragraphs 8 and 14 above ). This new element did not constitute an element intrinsic to the initial accusation (compare and contrast De Salvador Torres v. Spain, judgment of 24 October 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ V, p. 1587, § 33). The Court finds that the applicant's chances to defend himself in respect of the new element of the charges were impaired. As to the Government's argument that the applicant had himself anticipated the possibility that he could be convicted of aiding and abetting (see paragraphs 11 and 27 above), the Court notes that it still remains the case that he was denied the possibility to argue his defence in adversarial proceedings insofar as the element introduced by the Court of Appeal, i.e. the preparation of the documents, was concerned."

Belgium (dec.), no. 48193/99, 24 June 2004). In the present case, the Supreme Court only considered whether or not to grant leave to appeal. In the event, it refused leave to appeal.

France, 26 September 1996, § 43, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV; Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, § 38, Series A no. 275). The provisions of paragraph 3 (a) of Article 6 point to the need for special attention to be paid to the notification of the “accusation” to the defendant. Particulars of the offence play a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of their service that the suspect is formally put on written notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him ( Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, § 79, Series A no. 168). Article 6 § 3 (a) of the Convention affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the “cause” of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts. That information should be detailed ( Pélissier and Sassi v. France, 25 March 1999, § 51, Reports 1999- II ). The scope of the above provision must in particular be assessed in the light of the more general right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In criminal matters the provision of full, detailed information concerning the charges against a defendant, and consequently the legal characterisation that the court might adopt in the matter, is an essential prerequisite for ensuring that the proceedings are fair. In this respect it is to be observed that Article 6 § 3 (a) does not impose any special formal requirement as to the manner in which the accused is to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him."

It is noteworthy in this connection that although before the Court of Appeal the applicant was warned of the possibility of the re-characterisation his offence as fraud, he was then found guilty of forgery of public documents, and that the Supreme Court's confirmation of his conviction on account of attempted fraud and forgery of private documents occurred without prior notice."

The Court further recognises that the existence and utilisation of expeditious proceedings in criminal matters is not in itself contrary to Article 6 of the Convention as long as they provide the necessary safeguards and guarantees contained therein.

In this connection, the Court notes the applicant's claim before the domestic court that she was unaware of the upcoming proceedings against her at the time she was placed in the police car (see paragraphs 10 and 15 above). In any event, the time afforded to the applicant to prepare her defence could not have been more than a couple of hours, during which time she was either in transit to the court or was being held in a cell at the police station."

The Court's task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, p. 711, § 50). In particular, “as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce ... Article 6 § 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses” (see Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1 992, Series A no. 235-B, pp. 32 ‑ 33, § 33). It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 38-39, § 91; Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1 989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, § 89; and Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898 /99, § 29, ECHR 2003 ‑ V)."

It is true that she did not provide the court with the names of the witnesses she wanted to call, but considering the lack of time and facilities to prepare her defence (see paragraph 45 above), the Court finds it reasonable that she should not be expected to have done so immediately. Moreover, the Court notes the applicant's claim before the domestic court that she was not able to call any such witnesses because she was not informed where she was being taken when the police placed her in a vehicle to take her to court (see paragraphs 10 and 15 above)."

The Court has considered treatment to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering. It has deemed treatment to be “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see, for example, Kudła v. Poland, no. 30210/96, § 92, ECHR 2000-XI). In considering whether a particular form of treatment is “degrading” within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3 (see, among other authorities, Raninen v. Finland, judgment of 16 December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 1997-VIII, pp. 2821 – 22, § 55). However, the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see, among other authorities, Peers v. Greece, no; 28524/95, § 74, ECHR 2001-III).

Russia ) the Court is aware that overcrowding in pre-trial detention facilities is a general problem in Russia (ibid. § 93). In these circumstances the Court does not find it of crucial importance to determine the exact number of inmates in the cells during the periods concerned. The material available suggests that at any given time there would be less than 2 m² of space per inmate.

According to the information received, these protests were sometimes dispersed with excessive force, and the work of journalists was hindered. The organisers were denied permission to demonstrate in a central square and other places in the city centre in Baku, and were instead authorised to hold a demonstration in the outskirts of the city.

                "63. Azerbaijan amended its Law on Freedom of Assembly in 2008, following two opinions adopted by the Council of Europe Venice Commission. While the law is thus in line with international standards, undue restrictions of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly are widely reported in practice. The problems mainly stem from the interpretation of Article 5 of the law. This Article provides for a “notification” procedure before convening an assembly. In 2006, the Venice Commission welcomed the confirmation by representatives of the Government that the requirement in the law was for notification and not for a prior permission to hold the assembly, noting that “other provisions of the Law could, as they currently stand, encourage the competent authorities to issue a blanket prohibition as soon as the notification process proves incomplete.” In 2007, the Venice Commission added that a system of notification is in itself admissible so long as it is only meant to help the authorities cope more easily with the practical problems involved with the holding of an assembly; it also stressed that it is indeed important that assemblies can be held with a presumption of legality so as to avoid any chilling effect on organisers and participants.",
                "64. The Commissioner notes that the authorities have also confirmed that the legislation does not require permission for rallies. However, the authorities appear to have interpreted it as requiring such permission, and a system of authorisation has in practice replaced the system of notification. Peaceful protesters have for instance been effectively banned from demonstrating in central Baku since 2006, despite advanced notification of the assemblies. Several requests by the political opposition or civil society to hold demonstrations were allegedly denied or, when allowed, organisers were obliged to have them in areas very remote from the city centre. ...",

The Commissioner welcomes the announced publication by the authorities of a list of locations where demonstrations will be made possible, and calls for these to include adequate locations in the centre of Baku and other cities, as a first step towards a better enjoyment of the right to freedom of assembly by the population of Azerbaijan. Given the need for tolerance in a democratic society, the authorities should nevertheless seek to facilitate and protect public assemblies at the organisers ’ preferred location. ...",

The Commissioner therefore urges the authorities to ensure that no disproportionate sanction, which would undermine the fundamental right to peaceful assembly, is imposed.",

The Court reiterates that interference with the exercise of freedom of peaceful assembly does not need to amount to an outright ban, legal or de facto, but can consist in various other measures taken by the authorities. The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 39, Series A no. 202 ). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see Bączkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, §§ 66-68, 3 May 2007 ). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to interference as well (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, §§ 59 ‑ 62, ECHR 2003 ‑ III). So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 7 and 30, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII, and Hyde Park and Others v.

On the other hand, the Law on Freedom of Assembly provided the relevant local executive authority (in the present case, the BCEA) with broad powers to prohibit or stop a public assembly. Also, the Law vested it with the rights to restrict or change the place, route and/or time of a gathering, and to designate specific areas for public assemblies (see paragraphs 2 8 and 29 above). A number of international reports have stressed that a system of notification set forth by the Constitution has been replaced in practice by a system of authorisation (see paragraphs 4 0 -4 2 above). The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe in his Report of 6 August 2013 stated, in particular, that “peaceful protesters have ... been effectively banned from demonstrating in central Baku since 2006, despite advanced notification of the assemblies” (see paragraph 4 1 above).

In effect, the key circumstance constituting the basis for the administrative proceedings against the applicant was the fact that the demonstration in which he participated was unauthorised (contrast with Malofeyeva v. Russia, no. 36673/04, 30 May 2013 ). In such circumstances the Court has doubts about the credibility of the formal ground invoked by the authorities for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction."

When the Court carries out its scrutiny, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 11 the decisions they delivered in the exercise of their discretion. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among other authorities, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I, and Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § 70, ECHR 2006 ‑ II)."

The Court reiterates that although it is not a priori contrary to the spirit of Article 11 if, for reasons of public order and national security, a High Contracting Party requires that the holding of meetings be subject to authorisation, an unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation, does not justify per se an infringement of freedom of assembly ( see Cisse v. France, no. 51346/99, § 50, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Oya Ataman, cited above, §§ 37- 39). While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, § 34, ECHR 2007 ‑ III; Fáber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 49, 24 July 2012; Malofeyeva v. Russia, cited above, §§ 136-37; and Kasparov and Others v.

However, the authorities have not explained why, instead of taking measures to minimise the disruption to traffic and implementing other safety measures, they decided to refuse “authorisation” of the demonstration and subsequently to disperse it. The domestic courts in their turn did not attempt to examine whether the absence of authorisation justified the dispersal.

This already calls into question the Government ’ s assertion about the necessity of the dispersal. It has not been argued or demonstrated that it would have been difficult for the police to contain or redirect protestors, or control the situation otherwise, protect public safety and prevent any possible disorder or crime. Nor has it been shown, either at the domestic level or before the Court, that the demonstration posed a high level of disruption of public order. It follows that the authorities have not adduced relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstration."

Nor did they specify who had given such an order and when, or indicate its exact wording. In such circumstances, reference by the authorities to Article 310.1 of the CAO as a ground for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction appears to be unsubstantiated. Despite being formally charged with failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, the applicant in fact was arrested and convicted for his participation in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration. The Court notes that at the material time, no penalty in the form of deprivation of liberty was provided for under the CAO for participating in an unauthorised public assembly or generally for violation of rules on holding public assemblies. Nevertheless, the applicant was sentenced to five days ’ “administrative ” detention on charges that he “had failed to stop participating in the unauthorised demonstration”. It follows that the arbitrary reference to Article 310.1 of the CAO as a ground for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction also made it possible to apply a penalty which was otherwise not applicable to the action held against him."

A State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. However, if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or is sufficiently brought to the authorities ’ attention in some other way, the authorities must take steps to ensure that the accused effectively enjoys the right to legal assistance (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, §§ 33-37, Series A no. 37, and Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, § 65, Series A no. 168). Moreover, where it is clear that the lawyer representing the accused before the domestic court has not had the time and facilities to organise a proper defence, the court should take positive measures to ensure that the lawyer is given an opportunity to fulfil his obligations in the best possible conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, § 31, Series A no. 76).

Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 § 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see Bozano v.

While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute “arbitrariness” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis (see Mooren v.

While he was formally charged with failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, the applicant was in fact detained for his participation in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration (see paragraphs 5 6 and 6 2 above). Furthermore, there are sufficient elements to conclude that the domestic courts that imposed the administrative detention also acted arbitrarily in reviewing both the factual and the legal grounds for the applicant ’ s detention. They failed to examine whether the police had invoked the correct legal basis for the applicant ’ s arrest or to examine the legality of the police ’ s interference with the demonstration (see paragraph 8 6 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty as a whole was arbitrary and therefore contrary to the requirements of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention."

Bulgaria [GC], no. 21980/04, § 114, 12 May 2017). The Court has also recognised that the presence of a lawyer during the investigative actions, including police questioning, is an inherent aspect of the safeguard enshrined in Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention (see Karabil v.

France, no. 1466/07, § 54 in fine, 14 October 2010; Aras v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 15065/07, §§ 39-42, 1 8 November 2014; and A.T. v.

The lawyer ’ s presence and active assistance during questioning by police is an important procedural safeguard aimed at, among other things, preventing the collection of evidence through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the suspect and protecting the freedom of a suspected person to choose whether to speak or to remain silent when questioned by the police."

The same considerations also hold true in case the lawyer has to – or is requested to – leave before the end of the questioning of the police and before the reading out and the signing of the statements taken (see Pishchalnikov v. Russia, no. 7025/04, §§ 74 and 79, 24 September 2009, and Kulik v. Ukraine [Committee], no. 34515/04, §§ 186-87, 2 February 2017)."

It was only after the lawyer had left the interview room and the applicant was no longer assisted by a lawyer that the applicant was made to sign the interview record, according to the applicant as a result of coercion from the police. In other words, the statements were signed by the applicant in the absence of the lawyer chosen by him.

In that connection, it notes that the Government did not dispute the applicant ’ s contention that the removal had been unlawful as there was no basis in Turkish law allowing the police to remove and replace an officially appointed lawyer.

As there were no compelling reasons to restrict the applicant ’ s right of access to a lawyer when he was giving statements to the police, the Court must apply a very strict scrutiny to its fairness assessment (see Dimitar Mitev v.

More importantly, the onus is on the Government to demonstrate convincingly why, exceptionally and in the specific circumstances of the case, the overall fairness of the trial was not irretrievably prejudiced by the restriction on access to legal advice (see Simeonovi, cited above, § 132, and Ibrahim and Others, cited above, § 265)."

In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy.

In addition to that, in convicting him, the trial court relied on his statements to the police without examining their admissibility at the trial. Likewise, the Court of Cassation dealt with this issue in a formalistic manner and failed to remedy this shortcoming (see Bayram Koç v. Turkey, no. 38907/09, § 23 in fine, 5 September 2017). Therefore, neither the assistance provided subsequently by a lawyer nor the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings were sufficient to remedy the defects which had occurred earlier.

However, the Court cannot regard this as a valid waiver of the defence’s rights under Article 6 § 3 (c). It reiterates that a waiver of a right must be, amongst other things, voluntary, and must be established in an unequivocal manner (see Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 73, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII, with further references; and, more recently, Vozhigov v. Russia, no. 5953/02, § 57, 26 April 2007; Pishchalnikov v.

At the trial the defence expressed their concerns about the “security plan” implemented by the escort service in the courtroom. From the judge’s reaction it was clear that she did not consider herself competent to deal with that issue (see paragraph 151 above), and that the judge deferred to the prison authorities in a matter clearly related to legal assistance. Be that as it may, having consulted with the prosecution and the escort service the judge proposed an alternative solution, namely that all defence documents would be passed through her. The defence seemingly had no other choice but to accept that new rule. Therefore, Mr Padva’s remark that he would comply with the new rule cannot be interpreted as an unequivocal and voluntary acceptance of it."

The Court reiterates in this respect that, first, the applicants’ case was not such as to give reason to stringent restrictions on confidential exchanges, and that the authorities did not refer to specific facts which would justify the departure from the general rule of confidentiality of the lawyer-client contacts, including written communications. Second, the Court observes that Judge Kolesnikova, who requested the defence lawyers to show her all written communications, was also a judge of fact and law in the trial. While checking drafts and notes prepared by the defence lawyers or the applicants the judge might have come across information or arguments which the defence would not wish to reveal (see, for example, paragraph 155 above). Consequently, her role in checking the defence papers might have affected her opinion about the factual and legal issues involved in the case (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Erdem, cited above, § 67) where the Court examined a similar procedure of checking prisoners’ correspondence). In the Court’s opinion, it would be contrary to the principle of adversarial proceedings if the judge’s decision was influenced by arguments and information which the parties did not present and did not discuss at an open trial."

In particular, the Court notes that the lawyers were not allowed to come closer than 50 cm to their clients when they wished to speak to them, and that escort officers were always standing in close proximity. The Court concludes that their oral exchanges might have been overheard by the convoy officers, at least occasionally."

Thus, for example, in assessing limitations imposed on the defence in the case of Titarenko v. Ukraine (no. 31720/02, 20 September 2012), the Court applied a quantitative approach and held as follows (§ 92):",
                "“The security arrangements [i.e. placement of the accused in a metal cage] undeniably limited communication between the applicant and his lawyer during the hearing. These limitations did not, however, amount to a complete lack of communication between the applicant and his lawyer; the applicant did not demonstrate that it was impossible to request that the lawyer’s seat be brought closer to his “cage”, or that they had been denied an opportunity for private communication when necessary.”",
                "In contrast with Titarenko, in the present case the applicants did not have “an opportunity for private communication” with their lawyers, due to the permanent presence of escort officers near the metal cage and the minimal distance the lawyers had to respect. The fact that the defence was able to request adjournments during the hearings is irrelevant: it appears that even during those adjournments the lawyers were unable to discuss the case with their clients anywhere but in the hearing room, i.e. in the close vicinity of the prison guards. The Court concludes that even though the applicants benefited from legal assistance by several lawyers, the secrecy of their exchanges, both oral and written, was seriously impaired during the hearings."

Following privatisation, new management techniques were introduced and the companies acquired by Yukos were reorganised. In particular, sales of the producing companies were re-directed to new trading companies. As a result, Yukos became one of the most successful businesses in Russia, and the first applicant was mentioned in the press as one of the richest persons in Russia."

Amongst other acquisitions by Yukos in the course of the privatisation were 20 per cent of the shares of a large mining company, Apatit Plc (hereinafter referred to as “Apatit”), a major supplier of the apatite concentrate in the country. The acquisition of Apatit shares gave rise to litigation in which the State Property Fund opposed Yukos. The former claimed that Yukos had failed to meet its obligations under the privatisation agreement. That litigation ended in 2002 with a friendly settlement: the State Property Fund accepted a termination fee while acknowledging the rights of Yukos to 20 per cent of Apatit shares."

Special taxation in Lesnoy was established by the Federal Law “On Closed Administrative-Territorial Entities” of 14 July 1992 (the “ZATO Act”).

Those agreements were renewed every year since 1998. Thus, for example, on 28 January 2000 the town administration concluded a preferential tax agreement with Business Oil Ltd (hereinafter referred to as “Business Oil”), the main trading company of Yukos in Lesnoy, providing it, amongst other tax cuts, a 75 per cent reduction of the “local” part of the corporate income tax (i.e. of the part destined for the local budget). Under that agreement Business Oil was supposed to transfer a certain amount of money to the town budget (5 per cent of the amount of tax cuts obtained). A major part of the profits of Business Oil and other trading companies were later transferred on a gratuitous basis in the form of investments in the “fund for financial support for production development”, which was founded within Yukos on the basis of a resolution of the Board of Directors."

Those notes were accepted by the local authorities as a method of payment of taxes and were later honoured by Yukos. The trading companies also enjoyed VAT exemption in respect of the oil they were selling abroad. VAT was reimbursed in monetary form from the State budget to the bank accounts of those companies. Tax audits carried out in 1999 confirmed the eligibility of Business Oil for tax cuts."

In 2003 the office of the General Prosecutor of the Russian Federation (hereafter “the GPO”) started a criminal investigation into the business activities of Mr Khodorkovskiy and his partners. The charges against the applicants originally concerned fraudulent acquisition of Apatit and another firm during the mass privatisation of 1990s. Later the GPO charged the applicants with large-scale tax evasion. In particular, the GPO suspected that the trading companies registered in the low-tax zones were in fact sham legal entities ( podstavnye, i.e. “frontman companies”; hereinafter referred to as “sham companies”) affiliated with the applicants, as they were neither present nor operated in the place of their registration, had no assets and no employees of their own but were fully controlled from the Yukos head-quarters in Moscow. Therefore, tax cuts had been obtained by them unlawfully. The tax authorities also characterised payment of taxes with promissory notes as tax evasion. Furthermore, the tax authorities suspected that the firms to which the applicants, in their private capacity, had been rendering consulting service were affiliated with them and that no services had been provided to those firms in reality."

Those proceedings concerned the operation of the “tax-minimisation scheme” using trading companies, described above. In the following months more claims concerning the tax situation of Yukos and its affiliates were lodged. The commercial courts granted most of the Tax Service’s claims. As a result Yukos had to declare itself insolvent and bankruptcy proceedings were started, which ended up by a forced sale of its assets and, finally, by the liquidation of the company on 12 November 2007. The company ceased to exist, leaving over RUB 227.1 billion (around 9.2 billion US dollars (USD)) in unsatisfied liabilities.

Yukos sought instead to maximise its oil production and market share. Further, from 2003 Yukos was in the process of merging with Sibneft, another large Russian oil company. The merger was supposed to take place in two steps: firstly, completion of the deal on paper, and then unification of the new company’s management structures. The first aspect of the deal was finalised in October 2003; the second was supposed to be implemented by January 2004. Yukos was also engaged in merger talks with the US-based Exxon Mobil and Chevron Texaco companies.

The combination of the seriousness of the charge and the information about the applicant’s character gives reason to suspect that, if released, the applicant may abscond from trial, interfere with the proceedings and influence witnesses. [In particular], the persons suspected of having committed the offences in concert with [the applicant] have gone into hiding. [The applicant] maintains international connections. [He] is accused of offences committed in his capacity as a manager of commercial companies. The persons with whose assistance, according to the investigating authorities, [the applicant] committed the offences, still work in the companies and depend on [him] financially and otherwise.

The District Court refused to release him, on the basis that the second applicant could receive adequate medical aid in the remand prison. The court also held that the second applicant’s continuous detention was justified in view of the gravity of crimes imputed to him, and “information about [the second applicant’s] character”.

Thus, he constantly missed his daily walks because of the need to read the materials in the case file or participate in the hearings. On weekends and holidays, when there were no court hearings he could not go outside because he was ill. Further, the food in the prison was incompatible with his illnesses, and he only received appropriate food from his relatives or lawyers to a limited extent. It was impossible to have a hot meal at midday when there was a hearing or when he was reading the case file.

It was prohibited to lie or even sit on the bed between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. The bed was very close to the toilet pan.

The cell had a folding bed, a washbasin with cold water, a toilet, a shelf for toiletries, a chair and a table. The cell was ventilated naturally, and was lit by a day-time lamp and a night-time lamp (dezhurnoye osvescheniye). In addition, the cell had a window measuring 60 x 90 cm. The cell was equipped with a cistern for boiled water which was supplied by the warders when necessary. Referring to the certificates issued by the head of the remand prison, Mr Tagiyev, dated 7 August 2008, the Government alleged that illumination, temperature and humidity in the isolation cell had corresponded to the sanitary standards. The distance between the toilet and the bed was one metre, which was explained by the small dimensions of the cell; such a distance, however, respected basic requirements of hygiene. The bed was unfolded during the night, namely between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. During the daytime the second applicant could sit on the chair. The Government also attached a report of inspection of sanitary conditions of certain other premises of the remand prison (not apparently related to the cells where the second applicant was detained), dated January 2006, as well as two reports of the inspection of the ordinary cells where the second applicant was detained dated February 2004 and January 2005, which concluded that sanitary condition of the cells was satisfactory.

However, he always refused to take the dry meal; he preferred the food he received from his relatives.

Those companies were not formally affiliated with the applicants or Yukos, but were controlled by them de facto. Those companies claimed to operate in Lesnoy, and, on that ground, they qualified for tax cuts.

As a result, the profits from the oil trade were concentrated in those companies.

Instead, they obtained promissory notes from Yukos and then transferred them to the Lesnoy town Tax Inspectorate. The value of the promissory notes was later offset from the tax debt of the sham companies.

The inspector at the first control post demanded that Mr Shmidt should hand over to her for inspection a transparent plastic paper-case that he had with him. Mr Shmidt refused, explaining that it was his lawyer’s file. In response, the inspector forcibly seized the papers from him. According to the first applicant, the seized document itself comprised two sheets. The first sheet was written by Mr Simonov, the head of the Glasnost Defence Foundation. It was in Mr Simonov’s own handwriting and was a rough draft of a proposed letter in support of the applicant - that letter was published some time later. The second sheet was in Mr Shmidt’s own handwriting. Both notes were written quite some time before the 11 March visit to the applicant. On 13 March 2004 Mr Karimov, the lead investigator, wrote to Mr Denisov at the Ministry of Justice stating that the note seized “contained an instruction on counteraction to the investigation by way of influencing the investigation through mass media”. Mr Denisov then wrote on 26 March 2004 to the head of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Justice requesting measures to be taken against Mr Shmidt. On 7 May 2004 the Ministry of Justice Main Directorate wrote to the St Petersburg Bar Association requesting that disciplinary proceedings be started against Mr Shmidt for breach of professional ethics.

As to the report by Ernst and Young, the court first referred to a number of informalities in the report itself, in particular to the fact that the report mentioned the names of two persons who contributed to the report, but in fact other specialists of the Ernst and Young had also participated in its preparation. The report did not mention their names and was not signed by them. Mr Gage, a partner with Ernst and Young who testified before the court, named those persons in his oral submissions, but since they had not signed the report, it was impossible to establish their role in the preparation of the report and their qualifications. The only signature on the report was that of the general director. Furthermore, the report had been obtained at the request of ALM-Feldmans law firm, which was not participating in the criminal proceedings. The cover-letter with which that report was forwarded to ALM-Feldmans was irrelevant. Finally, the report contained analysis and therefore did not qualify as a “document” within the meaning of the CCrP. Similarly, it could not have qualified as an opinion of a “specialist” within the meaning of the CCrP."

That report was originally commissioned by Apatit outside the criminal proceedings in the applicants’ case, so it could not be considered as an expert report or a report by a specialist. Furthermore, the conformity of the copy of the report was certified by a manager of Apatit and not by Price Waterhouse Coopers itself, and did not contain signatures of the persons who had conducted the examination.

On the same day the court refused to admit this document in evidence. The court noted that the “other documents” mentioned in Article 74 of the CCrP had to have relevance for the case. Having reviewed the report produced by Mr Pleshkov the court concluded that it “contained opinions of certain persons based on investigations and qualification of the documents on the questions provided by the defence, a part of which were questions of legal character”. Consequently, the court did not accept this “assessment” as evidence. Furthermore, the court noted that the CCrP did not provide with such method of collecting evidence as “commissioning a study”.

According to the first applicant, penal colony FGU IK-10 in Krasnokamensk was not quite the furthest penal colony from Moscow but it was the least accessible, because direct flights were available to the colonies further from Moscow. To reach Krasnokamensk from Moscow involved a minimum of two days. It was a long and strenuous journey, made even more difficult by the infrequency of flights from Moscow to Chita. A flight from Moscow to Chita took approximately six and a half hours (occasionally more, when the aircraft had to refuel in Yekaterinburg). On arrival in Chita, there was a seven-hour wait before boarding a train for Krasnokamensk, which took another fifteen hours to arrive. Alternatively, the visitors had the choice of a train ride from Moscow, 106 hours on an uninterrupted run. This made it very arduous for the first applicant’s lawyers and family to gain access to him, and inevitably some of them were not seeing the first applicant as much as they otherwise would. The first applicant’s lawyers described the journey as “very exhausting and debilitating”. Mr Mkrtychev, a lawyer who undertook the journey from Moscow to Krasnokamensk on eight occasions, testified that he had never seen any “sleeping wagons” or a dining car on the trains on which he had travelled. Internet and mobile phone reception were also impossible, contrary to what the Government had maintained. The first applicant further maintained that Krasnokamensk itself was subject to huge extremes in climate. According to Mr Mkrtychev, during his first journey there in October 2005 the temperature was approximately minus ten degrees Celsius, with a freezing and almost unbearable wind.

I know that there are essential facts which the authorities should have presented in court, but which they didn’t present. The ministries, official bodies and various organizations that had anything to do with this case were forbidden to present any documents or facts that may have led people to form a different opinion from the one that was presented to the court by the prosecution.

Mr Kasyanov described his dialogue with Mr Putin on that day in the following terms:",

At the beginning, Mr Putin, as previously, tried to avoid giving a direct answer, but I was persistent, and after another attempt on my part he answered me that they (meaning [the first applicant] and other owners of Yukos) provided funding not only to Yabloko and the Union of Right Forces (the SPS) which he (Mr Putin) allowed them to provide funding to, but also to communists. And he didn’t allow sponsoring communists. I didn’t say anything in response because I was surprised at what was said. I hadn’t even suspected that statutory-allowed financial support of political parties also needed to be approved confidentially by the President. I didn’t know that Mr Putin had given [the first applicant] permission to fund the SPS and Yabloko. But Mr Putin’s answer left me in no doubt that by funding the communists [the first applicant] had crossed a line so far as Mr Putin was concerned and that the criminal prosecution case of Yukos employees was started exactly because of the funding of political parties not sanctioned by Mr Putin.”"

The former Prime Minister also explained that the tax optimisation schemes, which formed a central component of the criminal case against the applicant, had been in conformity with the law at the relevant time. Mr Kasyanov believed that the initial reason for the criminal prosecution of the applicant was the political concern of President Putin and his immediate circle prior to the State Duma election of December 2003. Mr Kasyanov did not think that the criminal prosecution of the applicant had originally been caused by economic reasons, including intent to take over his assets, but that goal appeared subsequently as a concomitant one to the original political goal of removing a political opponent.

Mr Gref also said that “Mr Khodorkovskiy had placed himself in the firing line by his overt and powerful support for the liberal wing in Russian politics”. Mr Shakhnovskiy also reported on his meeting with the then Minister of Finances, Mr Kudrin, who said, inter alia, that unpaid taxes had been just a pretext used to crush Mr Khodorkovskiy and take away his company.

Mr Dubov, another major shareholder of Yukos, testified that on 24 October 2003 (the day before the first applicant’s arrest) Mr Surkov (one of the closest aids of President Putin) had said that “all government institutions had been forbidden from having any contact with Open Russia and that President Putin had stated that Yukos was going to be eliminated from the political sphere”. Mr Dyatelev, one of the applicants’ lawyers, gave evidence that a former Tax Minister, Mr Pochinok, was told by Mr Surkov not to give evidence at the applicant’s trial in relation to the tax charges. Mr Ivlev, a lawyer with ALM Feldmans (a law firm working for Yukos), testified that in November 2003 he had met Mr Shuvalov, another aid to President Putin, who had said that there had been absolutely nothing he could do to stop the attacks on the first applicant and Yukos, and implied that decision concerning their fate had been taken at the highest level within the Presidential Administration.",

If having collected the evidence the prosecution concludes that a particular person has committed a crime, the prosecution makes an order formally charging the said person.

The time for reading the case file by the accused and his counsel may be limited (for example, when the defence deliberately delays the proceedings).

The prosecutor opens the case for the accusation by setting out succinctly the essence of the accusation with reference to the relevant Articles of the Criminal Code. The judge then asks the accused if he (the accused) understands the accusation and whether or not he considers himself guilty. If the accused understands the charges and does not plead guilty, the examination of evidence produced by the prosecution begins.

In particular, Mr T., one of the plaintiffs, was a director of a firm which had an outstanding tax debt. Instead of paying that debt he spent the money of his firm for other purposes. Such behaviour was considered as tax evasion “by other means” and Mr T. was convicted.

All the above circumstances as such did not exclude that the company was carrying out its activities on the territory of the ZATO and are irrelevant for the case at hand, since they are not taken into account by the tax law in order to define conditions for tax cuts.",

At the same time, the decision of the Tax Inspectorate of 2000 indicates that the company was brought to tax liability following a “desk” tax audit – i.e. solely on the basis of documents submitted by the taxpayer. The documents submitted by the company to the Tax Inspectorate demonstrated that the company satisfied all requirements of section 5 (1) of the Law on ZATOs. The Tax Inspectorate, within a “desk” tax audit, was not empowered to visit premises of the company. Although after the decision bringing the company to tax liability the Tax Inspectorate conducted an “on-the-site” tax audit of the company, its results cannot be used to support the conclusions of the decision of 2000. The court of cassation also held that it was wrong to shift on the company the burden of proof that it had indeed carried out its business activities on the territory of ZATO. Although it was possible to request the taxpayer to submit additional documents, in the case at hand it had been done simultaneously with rendering the decision on bringing the company to tax liability. The court also noted that the eligibility of the company to tax cuts was confirmed by the official letters of the Ministry of Taxes and the Ministry of Finances."

Preferential taxation for small business was introduced by the Federal Law “On Simplified Taxation, Accounting and Reporting for Small Businesses” (No. FZ -222, 29 December 1995, the “Small Business Act”). It introduced inter alia a “patent” system for self-employed businessmen, who, instead of paying a variety of different taxes and submitting complex tax declarations, were only required to buy every year a “patent” (licence) for a particular type of activity, provided that their yearly proceeds do not exceed a particular amount (100,000 times the statutory minimum wage). The price of the licence thus constituted a nominal annual advance tax payment (calculated as a multiple of the State defined minimum wage), and exempted the entrepreneur from further taxation (including state insurance premiums) in respect of the licensed activity income. Under Article 1 of the Act, the businessmen eligible for the “licence system” were free to choose it or to remain within the “traditional” taxation framework. A separate licence was required for each category of services specified in the Small Business Act."

On 2 October 2002 the Federal Commercial Court for Eastern-Siberian District, sitting as a court of cassation, rendered a decision in the case of Tax Service (Angarsk Inspectorate) v. Vliran Ltd (case No. A19-884/02-24-F02-2873/02C1). That case concerned a service agreement concluded between Mr K. and the taxpayer - Vliran Ltd. Under that agreement Mr K. was supposed to work as a general manager of the taxpayer company, in exchange of a fee. Mr K. was registered as an individual entrepreneur; at the same time he was the sole owner of the Vliran Ltd (i.e. the taxpayer company). As a result, the service agreement had his signatures on behalf of both sides: he signed it in the capacity of an individual entrepreneur and in the capacity of the sole owner of the company. The fees paid by the company to Mr K. were included in its declaration as “costs”. The Tax Inspectorate considered that these fees could not be regarded as “costs” on the ground that the service agreement between the company and Mr K. was null, since it was signed by the same person on both sides. The court of cassation, however, ruled in favour of the taxpayer company. It held, in particular, that the charter of the company did not provide for the position of a general director, and that his functions could therefore be transferred to an external person. Furthermore, there was nothing in the law to prevent the company from “outsourcing” the managerial function to somebody else. The court ruled that there was no evidence that the company acted in bad faith, and the service contract was therefore valid.",

The last paragraph of that provision stipulates that where the victim of the tort has asked for the damage to be caused, or has agreed to it, no liability for tort arises.

In the 21 st General Report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) ( CPT/Inf (2011) 28) made certain recommendations on the solitary confinement of prisoners. It noted, in p. 55, that “solitary confinement further restricts the already highly limited rights of people deprived of their liberty. The extra restrictions involved are not inherent in the fact of imprisonment and thus have to be separately justified”. For the CPT, it is appropriate to apply the traditional tests developed by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. In particular, any further restriction of a prisoner’s rights must be linked to the actual harm the prisoner has caused in the prison setting. During solitary confinement there should, for example, be no automatic withdrawal of rights to visits, telephone calls and correspondence or of access to resources normally available to prisoners (such as reading materials). Given the potentially very damaging effects of solitary confinement, the CPT considers that the principle of proportionality requires that it be used as a disciplinary punishment only in exceptional cases and as a last resort, and for the shortest possible period of time, no higher than 14 days for a given offence, and preferably lower. Prisoners undergoing solitary confinement as a disciplinary sanction should be entitled to at least one hour’s outdoor exercise per day, from the very first day of placement in solitary confinement, and should also be permitted access to a reasonable range of reading material (for further details see Razvyazkin v. Russia, no. 13579/09, § 89, 3 July 2012).

Insofar as the second applicant can be understood as complaining about conditions in the ordinary cell where he was detained most of the time, the Court observes that he did not develop this complaint in sufficient detail and did not submit information or documents that would persuade the Court that conditions there were indeed “inhuman and degrading”.

                "469. The Court observes, first of all, that at the relevant time the second applicant’s conviction has not yet been confirmed by the court of appeal. Therefore, in domestic terms he was still detained on remand. In a number of previous cases the Court stressed that “prolonged solitary confinement is undesirable, especially where the person is detained on remand” (see Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, § 120 with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "470. Secondly, the Court notes that the solitary confinement was imposed on the applicant for his alleged refusal to go for a walk. Some of the submitted documents mentioned that the applicant had refused to go to the shower (see paragraph 57 above). Whatever the real reason for imposing a disciplinary sanction, the Court considers that the applicant’s fault, if any, was not particularly serious and did not probably call for such a measure (see in this respect the CPT’s recommendation that such a serious punishment as solitary confinement should be commensurable to the disciplinary offence for which it was imposed, paragraph 455 above). The Court reiterates that although it is not for the Court to specify which security measures may be applied to prisoners, “the absence of any substantive reasons” for placing a detainee in a solitary confinement cell for a considerable period of time can be a relevant factor for characterising this form of disciplinary punishment as “inhuman and degrading treatment” (see Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 24027/07, 11949/08, 36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09, § 211, 10 April 2012; see also Razvyazkin, cited above, § 107)."

                "471. Thirdly, the Court reiterates that solitary confinement is one of the most serious measures which can be imposed within a prison. Bearing in mind the gravity of the measure, the domestic authorities are under an obligation to assess all relevant factors in an inmate’s case before placing him in solitary confinement (see Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v. Georgia, no. 1704/06, § 83, 27 January 2009; Onoufriou v. Cyprus, no. 24407/04, § 71, 7 January 2010; and A.B. v. Russia, no. 1439/06, § 104, 14 October 2010)."

Italy (no. 2) (dec.), no. 25498/94, ECHR 1999-V, quoted with approval by the Grand Chamber in Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, § 12; Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 191, ECHR 2005-IV). The Court must examine whether other limitations and hardships associated with this disciplinary sanction brought the whole situation within the ambit of Article 3."

            [
                "473. Some elements in the applicant’s account of the conditions in the isolation cell are not disputed by the Government. In particular, the Court takes it as accepted that the cell had a window measuring 90 x 60 cm. It is questionable whether such a window would provide enough natural light for a cell measuring 5.5 square metres. The permanent electric light in the cell may have been very disturbing for a detainee, and the one-metre distance between the open toilet pan and the sleeping place was clearly insufficient. Furthermore, the applicant had been deprived of all social contacts, could not read books or magazines or watch TV (see paragraph 452 above), and could not lie down on the bunk-bed, since it was unfolded only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m."

                "474. Other factual assertions by the applicant concerning the conditions in the isolation cell (poor sanitary condition of the cell, no hot food or walks) are disputed by the Government. However, the Court is not required to resolve this factual controversy on those points. Even if the applicant’s description of the other conditions of detention was accurate, and even if such conditions might indeed be very uncomfortable, it is crucial to note that the situation complained of lasted for only seven days (cf. with Popandopulo v. Russia, no. 4512/09, § 95, 10 May 2011, or A.B. v. Russia, cited above, §§ 105 et seq., where the applicants’ solitary confinment lasted much longer). The Court concludes that in the circumstances of the present case the degree of suffering to which the applicant was exposed, given its short duration and in view of the applicant’s age and mental and physical condition, did not reach the minimal threshold of severity to amount to “inhuman or degrading” treatment. Consequently, there was no violation of Article 3 on this account.",

                "476. As regards the unavailability of hot food on court days, the Court notes that the Government produced a document, written by the applicant himself, whereby he refused to receive dry meals because he had his own food (see paragraph 60 above). As follows from the Government’s explanations, the detainees were allowed to use a kettle in the premises of the Meshchanskiy District Court. It was therefore possible for the applicant to prepare tea, coffee or instant food during the day. Such arrangements, in the absence of any particular medical counter-indications, and where a detainee can afford to buy his own food in sufficient quantities, do not raise any issue under Article 3 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "477. The Court will now turn to the alleged lack of physical exercise. The Court has frequently found that a short duration of outdoor exercise, limited to one hour a day, was a factor that further exacerbated the situation of applicants who were confined to their cells for the rest of the time without any kind of freedom of movement (see Skachkov v. Russia, no. 25432/05, § 54, 7 October 2010; Gladkiy v. Russia, no. 3242/03, § 69, 21 December 2010; and Yevgeniy Alekseyenko v. Russia, no. 41833/04, § 88, 27 January 2011). The applicant in the present case claimed that for most of the time he had been deprived even of that short walk. The Government’s responses in this respect indicate that walks had been available to detainees only if they left the remand prison some time after sunrise and returned there before sunset. The Court reiterates its factual findings in the case of Trepashkin v. Russia (no. 2) (no. 14248/05, § 119, 16 December 2010), which analysed the situation in the same remand prison in the following terms:",
                "“... It is doubtful whether the applicant was able to use the walking yards on the days of the court hearings. Between January and April 2004 the applicant was taken to the courts almost every second working day ... As appears from the evidence in the case file, the logistical arrangements in the remand prison were such that groups of prisoners were dispatched to different courts in Moscow in the same prison van. As a result, the applicant was usually woken up early and returned to the remand prison quite late. This fact is confirmed by, amongst other sources, the letter from the Ministry of Justice concerning the delays in dispatching prisoners to and back from the Moscow courts ...",
                "The Government stated that detainees from the same cell were taken for walks together, normally during the daytime. However, the Government did not explain whether any special arrangements had been made for those returning from the courts in the evening, especially in winter, when the “daytime” is short. In sum, the Court concludes that on the days of the hearings the applicant was repeatedly (if not always) deprived of any possibility of physical exercise, however limited.”"

There is no information as to the exact time that the applicant left the prison and when he was returned there on every particular date. In the circumstances the Court is prepared to assume that on most of the days when the applicant was taken to the court he could not take walks in the remand prison. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the second applicant was able to take advantage of that possibility (the first applicant had this opportunity – see the case of Khodorkovskiy (no.1), § 113)."

Russia, no. 62936/00, §§ 124 et seq., 9 October 2008). Furthermore, the applicant was able to take walks on weekends and on those days when there were no hearings.

This security arrangement was a part of the standard design of courtrooms according to State building standards. The cage was 2.2 m high and surrounded the defendants’ bench.

Such security arrangements, which might exceptionally be warranted in the case of dangerous defendants, were wholly unjustified in the applicant’s case. The applicant was charged with economic crimes and there was no reasonable basis for keeping him in a cage during the trial. He had never been convicted of any criminal offence prior to his trial. The second applicant was a very tall man (almost 2 metres in height), with long feet (size 47), and a history of knee surgery. The fact that he was kept in a cramped cage for extended periods of time, sometimes for almost the entire day, caused him physical suffering."

On arrival at the court he was surrounded by armed forces and handcuffed. The average observer could easily have believed that an extremely dangerous criminal was on trial. Such public exposure humiliated him and aroused in him feelings of inferiority.

Armenia (no. 34334/04, §§ 126 et seq., 15 June 2010), decided that the conditions in which the first applicant was detained in the courtroom were degrading. The Court held as follows:",

Heavily armed guards wearing black hood-like masks were always present ... the hearing was broadcast live ... Such a harsh and hostile appearance of judicial proceedings could lead an average observer to believe that ‘extremely dangerous criminals’ were on trial.

The Court also accepts the applicants’ assertion that the special forces in the courthouse aroused in them feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority ...",

Nothing in the case file suggests that there was the slightest risk that the applicants, well-known and apparently quite harmless persons, might abscond or resort to violence during their transfer to the courthouse or at the hearings ....",

Thus, the applicant was accused of non-violent crimes, he had no criminal record, and there was no evidence that he was predisposed to violence. The Government’s reference to certain “security risks” was too vague and was not supported by any specific fact. It appears that “the metal cage in the ... courtroom was a permanent installation which served as a dock and that the applicant’s placement in it was not necessitated by any real risk of his absconding or resorting to violence but by the simple fact that it was the seat where he, as a defendant in a criminal case, was meant to be seated” (see Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia, cited above, § 127). Furthermore, the applicant’s own safety or the safety of the co-accused was not at stake. Finally, the applicant’s trial was covered by almost all major national and international mass media, so the applicant was permanently exposed to the public at large in such a setting. As in Ashot Harutyunyan the Court concludes that “such a harsh appearance of judicial proceedings could lead an average observer to believe that an extremely dangerous criminal was on trial. Furthermore, [the Court] agrees with the applicant that such a form of public exposure humiliated him in his own eyes, if not in those of the public, and aroused in him feelings of inferiority” (§ 128)."

On 25 November 2004 in the case Lebedev (no. 1) the Court held, in a partial decision on admissibility, that the second applicant’s detention in custody from 2 July 2003 until 10 September 2004 had been justified. The Court found that some of the arguments put forward by the Russian courts were questionable, whereas others were “not devoid of merit”. Assessing the reasons invoked by the Russian authorities as a whole and having regard to the overall length of the applicant’s detention accrued by the time of the examination of the first case, the Court accepted “that the Russian authorities had not failed to give sufficient and relevant justification for the applicant’s continued detention.” The question before the Court in the present case is whether the reasons adduced by the domestic courts were sufficient to justify the second applicant’s detention from 10 September 2004 onwards, i.e. until 16 May 2005."

In that judgment the Court outlined the general principles of its case-law governing the application of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see §§ 182-186). It held, in particular, that when choosing a measure of restraint for the first time a court may rely on relatively loose presumptions of fact, and that the existence of a potential risk, for example, the risk of fleeing, cannot be demonstrated with the same degree of certitude as the existence of a fact that has already occurred (see §§ 188 et seq.). Having examined the first detention order in respect of the first applicant, the Court acknowledged that the domestic authorities had little time to evaluate the possibility for applying alternative measures of restraint, and that, although not flawless, the first detention order provided sufficient justification for the applicant’s detention on remand."

                "503. The Court noted further that in the subsequent period the first applicant’s personal situation had evolved, and that some of the risks mentioned in the original detention order ceased to exist. The Court stressed, in particular, that “the Russian courts on two occasions failed to indicate reasons for the continued detention of the [first] applicant, they relied on material obtained by way of a violation of the lawyer-client privilege, and never seriously considered other measures of restraint.” On the last point the Court held as follows:",
                "“194. ... The Court observes that at no point during the whole period of the applicant’s detention did the District Court or City Court take the trouble to explain why it was impossible to apply bail or house arrest to the applicant, or to accept ‘personal sureties’.",
                "195. There is no single standard of reasoning in those matters, and the Court is prepared to tolerate an implicit rejection of the alternative measures at the initial stages of the investigation. However, the time that had elapsed since the applicant’s arrest should have given the authorities sufficient time to assess the existing options, to make practical arrangements for their implementation, if any, or to develop more detailed arguments as to why alternative measures would not work. Instead, the Russian courts simply stated that the applicant could not be released ...",
                "196. Further, the context of the case was not such as to make the applicant obviously “non-bailable”... The applicant was accused of a number of non-violent crimes; he did not have any criminal record and he lived permanently with his family in Moscow, where he had his main business interests.",
                "197. In sum, the domestic courts ought to have considered whether other, less intrusive, preventive measures could have been applied, and whether they were capable of reducing or removing completely the risks of fleeing, re-offending or obstructing justice. Their failure to do so seriously undermines the Government’s contention that the applicant had to be detained throughout the whole period under consideration”.",
                "On the strength of the above the Court concluded that the first applicant’s continuous detention was not justified by compelling reasons outweighing the presumption of liberty.",

                "504. In their submissions the Government described in detail the circumstances of the second applicant’s arrest and claimed that his behaviour at that point, as well as his informal exchanges with his lawyers had been indicative of his inclination to flee (see paragraph 489 above). However, the Court notes that these arguments did not constitute part of the domestic courts’ reasoning. The Government further referred to the testimony of potential witnesses who had fled the country, allegedly at the insistence of the Yukos management (see paragraph 491 above). The Court notes that that testimony was collected only in 2007-2008 and, consequently, had not been relied upon by the domestic courts in 2003 ‑ 2005. The same concerns information about credit cards issued by foreign banks in the applicant’s name, real-estate abroad and private jets which had allegedly been at the applicant’s disposal at Vnukovo airport: those factual elements were not mentioned in the extension orders under examination. The Court reiterates in this respect that “it is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in [the detention orders] and of the established facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3” (see, for example, Wiensztal v. Poland, no. 43748/98, § 50, 30 May 2006). In the present case the Court will take into consideration only those arguments and information which were explicitly relied upon by the domestic courts in their decisions (see paragraphs 47 et seq. above) and which the applicant had an opportunity to discuss in the domestic proceedings."

                "505. During the period under consideration the domestic courts extended the second applicant’s detention with reference to two risks: the risk of tampering with evidence and the risk of absconding. As to the former, the Court notes that by June 2004, when the trial started, all documentary evidence had been already seized by the prosecution, all prosecution witnesses and experts had been questioned and their recorded testimony had been submitted to the court. By the end of 2004 the court had completed its examination of evidence collected by the prosecution. These developments significantly reduced the risk of tampering with evidence. Furthermore, throughout 2004 the main assets of Yukos were attached and sold at auction (see the Yukos case, §§ 92 et seq.). Thus, the second applicant ceased to exercise de facto control over the company; his ability to influence the company’s personnel was accordingly reduced. Despite those changes the domestic courts continued to repeat the reasons set out in their earlier detention orders."

                "506. The other reason justifying the second applicant’s detention was, according to the domestic courts, a risk of absconding. However, the existence of that risk was not convincingly demonstrated in the extension orders. Thus, the mention of the second applicant’s “international connections” was too vague and was not supported by any evidence. The Court stresses that, given the advanced stage of the proceedings, the domestic courts were in a position to take a closer look at the second applicant’s alleged “international connections” and explain it in their decisions (compare Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, § 187, 22 December 2008, and Aleksandr Makarov v. Russia, no. 15217/07, § 126, 12 March 2009). The reference to the second applicant’s character “was not accompanied by any description of the applicant’s character or an explanation as to why it made his detention necessary” (see Polonskiy v. Russia, no. 30033/05, § 152, 19 March 2009). The fact that other Yukos managers and shareholders had left Russia might probably have been relevant at the initial stage of the investigation, but “the fact that a person is charged with acting in criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention; his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account” (see Sizov v. Russia, no. 33123/08, § 53, 15 March 2011). Furthermore, the Court notes that “the behaviour of a co-accused cannot be a decisive factor for the assessment of the risk of the detainee’s absconding. Such assessment should be based on personal circumstances of the detainee” (see Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, § 76, 1 June 2006)."

                "507. The Court also notes that in ordering the extensions the courts used a stereotyped wording. Such an approach may suggest that there was no genuine judicial review of the need for the detention (see Yağcı and Sargın v. Turkey, 8 June 1995, § 50 et seq., Series A no. 319 ‑ A) at each extension."

The Court reiterates that when deciding whether a person should be released or detained the authorities have an obligation under Article 5 § 3 to consider alternative measures of ensuring his or her appearance at trial. This Convention provision proclaims not only the right to “trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial” but also lays down that “release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial” (see Jabłoński v. Poland, no. 33492/96, § 83, 21 December 2000, and Sulaoja v. Estonia, no. 55939/00, § 64, in fine, 15 February 2005). In the present case the authorities did not consider the possibility of ensuring the second applicant’s attendance by the use of a more lenient preventive measure, such as bail, house arrest, or other measures provided by the Russian law, and “the context of the case was not such as to make the applicant obviously “non-bailable” (see Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), § 196, with further references)."

Where domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 § 4; at the same time, the standard of speediness “is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal.... The Court would not be concerned, to the same extent, with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees” (see Shakurov v. Russia, no. 55822/10, § 179, 5 June 2012). In the case of Mamedova, cited above, which, like the present case, concerned appeal proceedings, it found that the “speediness” requirement was not complied with where the appeal proceedings lasted thirty-six, twenty-six, thirty-six, and twenty-nine days respectively, stressing that their entire duration was attributable to the authorities (see Mamedova, § 96; see also, for longer delays, Ignatov v.

Defence motions were often summarily rejected with no substantive reasons given. Judge Kolesnikova refused to grant permission to the Council of Europe Special Rapporteur to see the applicants. Finally, almost two years after the conclusion of the trial Judge Kolesnikova made an order lifting the seizure of Yukos ordinary shares and directing that they be used towards satisfying the civil damages award.

From media the applicants became aware of the rumour that Judge Kolesnikova and/or her family members were under investigation by the GPO during the trial.

There are two tests for assessing whether a tribunal is impartial: the first consists of seeking to determine a particular judge’s personal conviction or interest in a given case and the second in ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see, for example, Gautrin and Others v. France, 20 May 1998, § 58, Reports 1998-III; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 30, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; and Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 118, ECHR 2005-XIII)."

In applying the second test the Court often observed that “even appearances may be of a certain importance”, although the standpoint of the accused is not decisive, and what is determinant is whether the fear of partiality may be held to be objectively justified (see Sutyagin v. Russia, no. 30024/02, § 182, 3 May 2011). The mere disagreement with the procedural decisions taken by a judge does not provide a legitimate reason to doubt his or her impartiality (see Academy Trading Ltd and Others v. Greece, no. 30342/96, § 46, 4 April 2000). Similarly, the mere fact that a professional judge had already tried a co ‑ accused and knows the facts of the case is not, in itself, sufficient to cast doubt on that judge’s impartiality (see Miminoshvili v.

The Court, however, is not convinced by that argument. In Morel v. France (no. 34130/96, §§ 45 et seq., ECHR 2000 ‑ VI, with further references) the Court held that the mere fact that a judge had already taken pre-trial decisions could not by itself be regarded as justifying concerns about his impartiality. What mattered was the scope and nature of the measures taken by the judge before the trial.

To overcome the presumption of impartiality (see paragraph 538 above), which is a starting point for its analysis under the subjective test, the Court must have a stronger evidence of personal bias than a series of procedural decisions infavourable to the defence. The Court reiterates that it may not necessarily agree with all of the decisions taken by Judge Kolesnikova, and will scrutinise them in more detail below; however, there was nothing in them to reveal any particular predisposition against the applicants (see Miminoshvili v.

As a matter of practice, criminal adjudication frequently involves judges presiding over various trials in which a number of co-accused persons stand charged. The Court considers that the work of criminal courts would be rendered impossible if, by that fact alone, a judge’s impartiality could be called into question. An examination is needed, however, to determine whether the earlier judgments contained findings that actually prejudged the question of the applicant’s guilt."

Further, in the judgment against the co-accused, the established facts about the applicant’s involvement in the crimes were essentially based on the co-accused’s submissions, and thus did not constitute the Regional Court’s assessment of the applicant’s guilt. In Poppe, cited above, the Court found it decisive that the applicant’s name had been mentioned only in passing in the judgments against the co ‑ accused and that the trial judges had not determined whether the applicant was guilty of having committed an offence."

In that case the judgment in the applicant’s case contained a reference to a judgment rendered earlier in the case of his brother, who was a member of the same gang, but only in passing. There was no direct evidence that the findings of the previous judgment were relied on by the judge in the proceedings against the applicant. What is more, Article 90 of the CCrP clearly stipulated that those findings could not have the force of res judicata in the applicant’s case. The judge sitting in the applicant’s case was required to conduct a fresh examination of the charges against him, relying only on the evidence examined at his trial."

The court in the case of the applicant’s brother did not determine whether the applicant was guilty, and there was no specific qualification of the acts committed by him. The Court further held as follows:",

That information was reproduced in the judgment; however, it was presented in the judgment as reported speech, and not as the court’s own findings. It can be seen from the judgment that the information about the applicant’s involvement in the gang was not a condition sine qua non for the conviction of [the applicant’s brother]. At least, there is no indication that the Nikulinskiy District Court would not have come to the same conclusions in [the applicant’s brother’s] case if all references to the applicant’s name had been removed.

Although the Shakhnovskiy judgment did not establish the applicants’ guilt, their names were mentioned in a somewhat incriminating context. Thus, the central proposition of the Shakhnovskiy judgment was the fictitious character of his relations with Status Services. This was based on a number of other interim factual findings, including the fact that Mr Aleksanyan had given a legal opinion to the first applicant, describing the individual entrepreneur’s scheme, the fact that the second applicant had been a chief executive of Status Services, and the fact that an identical service contract had existed between the second applicant and Status Services (see paragraph 142 above)."

It appears that at least the first two items of evidence were discovered by the prosecution during the searches in the Yukos premises in Zhukovka in October 2003 (see paragraphs 69 et seq. above). The Court notes that the defence in the case at hand tried to obtain the exclusion of materials obtained during those searches (see paragraph 173 above).

The first applicant obtained access on 25 November 2003 (see paragraph 120 above). The case files were withdrawn from the defence on 13 May 2004 (see paragraph 132 above). It follows that the second applicant had eight months and twenty days to study over 41,000 pages, whereas the first applicant had five months and eighteen days to study over 55,000 pages (see paragraphs 120 and 127 above). In order to go through the case file at least once the second applicant would have to read at a rate of over 200 pages per working day. The first applicant would have needed to read more than 320 pages per working day in order to study the prosecution case.

In the Court’s opinion those conditions were uncomfortable at best (see paragraphs 121 et seq. above). Thus, only one copy of each case file was made available to the defence. If one of the lawyers was studying a particular volume of the case-file in the premises of the GPO, the applicants were unable to study that volume at the remand prison. Although the applicants were allowed to take handwritten notes, it was impossible for them to make photocopies. The lawyers, by contrast, were allowed to make photocopies, but mostly for their own use. If they needed to give a copy of a document to the applicants, this was possible only through the remand prison administration and, in any event, the applicants could keep only a limited amount of printed materials in their cells. The second applicant was not allowed to use a magnifying glass and a calculator for some time, which must have slowed down his work. The case file was made available to the defence only in special rooms. The applicants and their lawyers were unable to discuss the case confidentially and, simultaneously, to work with the case file: if they needed to have the case file before them, the presence of an investigator was obligatory. In 2004 the case files were transferred to the remand prison, and, as follows from the applicants’ lawyers’ complaints to the investigative authorities, this made photocopying of documents impossible. All this made the work of the defence team very difficult."

Estonia, no. 59577/08, § 80, 6 March 2012). First and foremost, the Court observes that in the present case each applicant was assisted by a team of highly professional lawyers, many of them of great renown. All of them were privately retained and all had spent a considerable amount of time working with the applicants’ cases. The Court reiterates that in Kamasinski v. Austria (19 December 1989, § 87, Series A no. 168), which concerned the rights of the accused under Article 6 § 3 (e), the Court held that the system provided for under section 45 § 2 of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure which stipulated that the right to inspect and make copies of the court file is restricted to the defendant’s lawyer, the defendant himself only having such access if he is legally unrepresented, was not in itself incompatible with the right of the defence safeguarded under Article 6 § 3 (b); see also Kremzow v.

The Court reiterates that in Öcalan, cited above, §§ 141 et seq.,) it found a violation of Article 6 § 3 (b) because before the start of the trial the applicant had not been permitted to inspect the prosecution case file personally, even though the applicant’s lawyers had had access to it. However, the present case must be distinguished from Öcalan. In the latter the applicant had no access to the case file whatsoever prior to the start of the trial, whereas in the present case both applicants had the case files at their disposal for several months. When in Öcalan the applicant was finally given direct access to the materials of the prosecution case, he had only twenty days to read 17,000 pages. The time given to the applicants in the present case was much longer. Finally, in Öcalan v. Turkey (no. 46221/99, § 162, 12 March 2003) “the applicant’s lawyers may have been prevented from giving the applicant an assessment of the importance of all these items of evidence by the sheer number and volume of documents and the restriction imposed on the number and length of their visits”. No such drastic restrictions were imposed on the applicants in the present case (compare with the description of the conditions in which the applicant had to meet his lawyers in Öcalan, cited above, § 26 et seq.)."

Importantly, the applicants were not limited in the number and duration of their meetings with the lawyers. The defence lawyers had at their disposal portable copying and scanning devices and were thus able to make and keep copies of the most important documents in the case file. The Court is aware that certain restrictions applied to the meetings between the applicants and their respective defence teams, in particular as regards the exchange of notes and documents. Those restrictions will be analysed separately under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention. However, they were not such as to make it impossible for the applicants to obtain the assistance of their lawyers in examining the case file and ascertaining the position of the prosecution before the start of the trial."

Furthermore, at least until the end of 2003 – beginning of 2004 there was a possibility for the defence lawyers to make copies of the materials. The Court previously held that unrestricted use of any notes and the possibility of obtaining copies of relevant documents were important guarantees of a fair trial. The failure to afford such access weighed, in the Court’s assessment, in favour of the finding that the principle of equality of arms had been breached (see Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, §§ 59 and 63, 24 April 2007; Luboch v. Poland, no. 37469/05, §§ 64 and 68, 15 January 2008; and Moiseyev, cited above, § 217). However, the applicants in the present case, unlike in Matyjek or Moiseyev, were not bound by any rules on State secrets; they could make notes and keep their notebooks with them, and their lawyers were allowed to make copies of pages from the case file, at least until the end of 2003 – beginning of 2004."

Their ability to absorb and analyse information was necessarily above average; they knew the business processes at the heart of the case and were, arguably, more competent in those matters than any other participants in the proceedings. Their professional status is also an additional factor in favour of the Court’s finding that the applicants’ inability to study every document personally was somehow compensated by their lawyers’ participation in examination of the case file: it must have been natural for the applicants, as senior managers, to delegate certain tasks to their lawyers."

For example, contracts between Yukos and its affiliates were important only in so far as they contained information about the price of oil and about the parties involved. It follows that the applicants did not need to read every page of such contracts in order to counter the prosecution’s arguments. As transpires from the judgment in the applicants’ case, a large part of the materials in both cases must have been identical. This means that in reality the number of pages which the applicants needed to scrutinise after the joinder of the two cases was less than the overall number of pages in each co-defendant’s case."

However, the timing changed and the hearings became more intensive as soon as the court began examining evidence by the defence.

The defence obtained a copy of the first-instance court judgment on 7 June 2005; the fifteen volumes containing the hearing record (which ran to over five thousand pages) were made available to the defence on 28 July 2005. The appeal hearing took place on 22 September 2005 (see paragraphs 278, 279 and 306 above). After lodging a preliminary brief of appeal the defence had the opportunity to supplement it (see paragraph 293 above). Thus, the defence team had three months and sixteen days to prepare written pleadings and to prepare for an oral argument, which appears to be a sufficient time, at least on the face of it. The Court’s analysis, however, cannot stop here: it must ascertain whether that time was sufficient in view of the specific conditions in which the defence had to prepare their appeal and whether the defence had all necessary facilities for that purpose."

In Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) the Court found that the conditions of detention in that cell amounted to “inhuman and degrading treatment” within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention (§§ 117 et seq.). On 18 August 2005 the second applicant was placed for one week in an isolation cell where it was impossible to work with the case (see paragraph 473 above). On 15 September 2005 both cells in which the applicants were detained were placed under the quarantine regime (see paragraph 301 above); as a result, the applicants were unable to meet with their lawyers for some time.

The Court accepts that studying a trial record and other trial materials may be a necessary phase in the preparation of a brief of appeal, especially where, as in the case at hand, the defence questions the lower courts’ findings of fact and challenges procedural decisions made during the trial, and where the court of appeal does not conduct a full rehearing of the case but bases its conclusions on written materials contained in the case file (see, mutatis mutandis, Klimentyev v.

The remaining volumes were not available to the defence, apparently because GPO was using them. Those volumes contained a number of the court’s procedural rulings and some documentary evidence added during the trial. The remaining volumes were given to the defence some time later, but the applicants were silent on that point and the Government did not comment either.

The Court is not in a position to say whether this was really so. It is, however, worrying that the defence’s written submissions on the trial record were dismissed by the domestic judge in a summary manner. The judge refused to consider the audiotapes made by the defence throughout the trial (see paragraph 287 above) and held in essence that she trusted her secretaries and her own memory better than the audiotapes (see paragraph 291 above). The Court accepts that audio-recording is not the only possible method of keeping track of proceedings. However, the case at hand was extremely complex, the trial lasted for nearly a year, seven secretaries were employed to keep the summary record, and hearings were held almost every day. In such circumstances it is difficult to believe that in all 126 pages of the defence’s written submissions, based on the audiotapes they had made, there was not a single accurate remark worthy of attention and that the secretaries’ diligence and the judge’s memory were infallible. In addition, the date of the appellate hearing was set by the Chairman of the Meshchanskiy District Court before Judge Kolesnikova had ruled on the defence’s objections to the trial record (see paragraph 290 above).

In the circumstances the Court considers that possible inaccuracies in the trial record and the defence’s temporary inability to obtain access to part of the trial materials did not make it impossible for the defence to formulate their arguments and did not, therefore, influence the outcome of the appeal proceedings. The applicants’ conviction was based on various items of evidence, including a large amount of documentary evidence and statements from dozens of witnesses. Even acknowledging that the trial record may have contained some inaccuracies, the Court is not persuaded that they were such as to render the conviction unsafe.

According to an inquiry conducted by competent authorities in 2010, on 4 December 2003 the second applicant met with one of his lawyers, Mr Baru. Prison officers who supervised the meeting noted that the second applicant, in breach of section 18 (4) of the Detention on Remand Act, gave Mr Baru a handwritten note which was not a part of any procedural document. Mr Baru tore the note to pieces and hid the shreds in the pocket of his trousers. At the end of the meeting prison officer N. informed Mr Baru that all written complaints and requests addressed to the lawyer must first be inspected by the administration of the remand prison and then forwarded to [him] within three days. Mr Baru was invited to hand over prohibited objects but he refused. In such circumstances, and pursuant to section 34 (6) of the Act, the prison officers had grounds to believe that Mr Baru was carrying prohibited objects; they searched his clothes and discovered shreds of the note written by the applicant. Those shreds were seized. As follows from that note, the second applicant was instructing Mr Baru how to impede the investigation."

The notes on the sheet had not been made in Mr Shmidt’s hand, so this had given the prison officials sufficient reason to believe that Mr Shmidt had tried to pass a prohibited object – a “private letter”. Mr Shmidt had not been subjected to a personal search. The seizure of that document had been lawful by virtue of sections 16, 18 and 34 of the Detention on Remand Act, and of Decree no. 148 – it was a “prohibited object”. The seizure was also lawful by virtue of Artcles 19.12, 27.1, and 27.10 of the Code of Administrative Punishments. Seizure of the document was found to be lawful by a decision of the Preobrazhenskiy District Court of Moscow of 19 May 2005."

Conditions in those rooms complied with the requirements of section 18 of the Detention on Remand Act. Since the case file was very voluminous, the prison administration allocated the applicants several meeting rooms, equipped with safe-boxes for storing the materials of the case, in order to make the defence’s task easier. Prison officials were able to see what was happening in the meeting room but not to hear conversations. The Government referred to the record of an interview with the second applicant: according to the record, when the applicant was asked whether he had had an opportunity to consult his lawyers in private, he had replied: “Not always, but, in general, yes”. Given that the second applicant otherwise had a very critical attitude towards the investigative authorities, this reply suggested that he had been generally satisfied with the degree of confidentiality of his communication with his lawyers."

The court even sent a letter to the administration of the remand prison inquiring about the meetings between the second applicant and his lawyers. This showed that the court did not ignore the defence lawyers’ motions concerning meetings with their client. The defence lawyers were capable of communicating with their clients orally during the breaks in the court hearings. Originally the court allocated one day per week for meetings between the applicants and their lawyers. Later that arrangement was changed; however, when needed, the court allowed short breaks and even adjourned proceedings until the following day. The applicants’ defence lawyers did not object to such arrangements."

The applicants were not separated from the lawyers by a screen during the meetings in the remand prison. As to the exchange of documents in the courtroom, the head escort officer informed the defence that the applicants were entitled to use their notes, show them to the defence and transmit documents. Pursuant to the law the exchange of objects and documents between the defence lawyers and the defendant had to remain under the supervision of the investigators and the court, in order to exclude collusion. Under Article 275 § 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code the applicants were entitled to use notes, which had to be shown to the presiding judge if he or she so requested. The presiding judge had explained to the defence that all transmitted documents should first be shown to her for inspection, to which Mr Padva, one of the first applicant’s lawyers, replied “Sure, by all means”. The judge needed to inspect notes transmitted from the applicants to their lawyers in order to decide whether they were related to the criminal proceedings, and in order to prevent the applicants giving their lawyers personal letters and similar documents that were not relevant to the case. The judge did not object to the contacts between the applicants and the lawyers during the breaks and even in the course of the hearing (to the extent that these did not pose a problem for the normal course of the hearing), but insisted on inspecting written documents passed between them. That measure was accepted by Mr Padva, who had said: “I will print out [those documents and notes] and show them to you”. The second applicant said to the judge that he did not always need to pass documents to his lawyers but at least needed to read them or let them be read. In sum, the procedure for inspection of materials had been decided with the participation of the defence lawyers. The Government concluded that the existing arrangement was accepted by the defendants and did not raise any objections."

That rule did not cover oral communications, which were limited only to the extent required in order to comply with the detention rules. As to the distance between the applicant and his lawyers, which allegedly had not permitted them to communicate in private, the court had refused to examine that issue since it was outside the court’s competence."

Under Articles 62 and 72 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the official in charge of the criminal case (an investigator or a judge) must confirm the participation of a lawyer in the case. However, on 15 August 2005 Ms Khrunova did not have the status of the applicant’s legal representative in the proceedings and had not therefore been allowed to visit him. On 23 August 2005, when he obtained confirmation of her status from the Meshchanskiy District Court, she had been allowed to visit the applicant. On 15 and 21 September 2005 the applicant’s lawyers Mr Mkrtychev, Mr Drel and Mr Padva were unable to meet the applicant because on those dates the applicant’s cell had been closed for quarantine because one of his cellmates had fallen ill.

That search was instigated on the basis of an order from the GPO, and not by a judge, as required by the Advocacy Act. In the course of the search, the investigators seized, and later added to the criminal case file as evidence, documents constituting lawyer’s case files for a number of different clients. Those documents were subsequently widely used by the investigators. The files were labelled as containing lawyers’ notes relating to the defence of the second applicant, and Mr Drel’s role in the case was very well known to the GPO and the investigators. It was indisputably established before the Meshchanskiy District Court that a number of documents were seized directly from Mr Drel, a defence lawyer in the criminal case, shortly before the second applicant’s arrest on 25 October 2003; these concerned the first applicant’s tax affairs and advice given to the applicant in connection with the case being conducted at that time against the second applicant, who by that time had already been in detention for more than three months. Since the first applicant’s name was mentioned in the charges against the second applicant – and the charges subsequently brought against them were virtually identical – Mr Drel, at the first applicant’s request, had formulated the applicant’s defence position in the event of identical charges being brought against him. Thus, by dint of the search the prosecution knew about the first applicant’s likely legal defence strategy in advance of the charges being brought against him."

The search of Ms Artyukhova had been unlawful and a blatant violation of lawyer/client privilege. The record of the search of Ms Artyukhova indicates that the search was conducted under section 34 (6) of the Detention on Remand Act. According to this section, a search can only be conducted if there are sufficient grounds for suspecting individuals of attempting to smuggle in prohibited items, substances or food. It was claimed in the report following Ms Artyukhova’s search that the duty officer saw that “the lawyer and the defendant were repeatedly passing to each other notepads with some notes, making notes therein from time to time”. There were thus no legal grounds for conducting a search of Ms Artyukhova, because there was no indication in the report that the officer witnessed any attempt to pass any prohibited items, substances or food."

However, the search of and subsequent seizure from Mr Shmidt occurred when he was leaving the remand prison, and it could not therefore be alleged that the measures were designed to prevent prohibited items being brought into it. The applicants noted that that as a consequence of the search the Ministry of Justice demanded that disbarment proceedings be instigated against Mr Shmidt. The St Petersburg Bar Association subsequently exonerated Mr Shmidt at the disciplinary proceedings and determined that Mr Shmidt was entitled to take the document in and out of the remand prison and that the document was legally privileged."

Armed guards regularly stepped between the applicants and their lawyers when they attempted to communicate directly through the bars of the cage. The court declined to intervene, notwithstanding its overriding duty under the CCrP to ensure the fairness of its proceedings. However, the applicants were not violent. They had never attempted to escape. It was difficult to see what possible reason that there could have been for such a restriction, save to ensure that their discussions could be overheard. At a key phase in the trial (when the applicants’ defence was being presented) the court eliminated the Wednesday recess, which had been the primary opportunity for the applicants and their lawyers to communicate. The defence complained to the Meshchanskiy District Court about the inability to discuss matters confidentially in the court room on a significant number of occasions. The trial court refused to alter the arrangements in any way, simply stating that the defence were able to discuss matters confidentially during the adjournments. The District Court took the view that the requirement that the defence lawyers stood at least one metre from the applicants in the cage “does not really have anything to do with the case”. The defence raised those issues in the brief of appeal, but the Moscow City Court did not even address this aspect of the appeal in its decision."

As to Ms Khrunova and Ms Mikhailova, they were both authorised by the first applicant to act for him, in relation to the criminal proceedings as well as the applicant’s case before the Court. The Government’s reliance on Articles 62 and 72 of the CCrP was misconceived. Those provisions related to a lawyer’s participation in the trial, and did not govern the right of a lawyer to see his client. Section 18 of the Detention on Remand Act contained the applicable law in relation to access to a lawyer and provided that an accused was permitted to receive visits from his lawyer “with no limitation of their number or duration”. Moreover, Section 18 expressly stated that “visits shall be granted to a defence lawyer upon presentation of a lawyer’s ID and an authorisation. Demanding other documents from a lawyer is prohibited”. There was no requirement under domestic law for the trial court to “validate” a lawyer before he or she was permitted access to a client who had already authorised that lawyer to represent him or her in the proceedings. The remand prison officials’ insistence that the applicant’s lawyers had to be authorised by the trial court before they were permitted to see the first applicant was particular to his case and was unlawful."

The Court observes that the first applicant’s complaint under Article 6 § 3 (c) about the alleged breach of lawyer-client confidentiality concerned criminal proceedings against him. In order to decide whether Article 6 § 3 (c) was complied with the Court does not need to know what happened after those proceedings were over, i.e. after the judgment of the Moscow City Court of 22 September 2005.

Russia [GC], no. 21272/03, § 97, 2 November 2010). An accused’s right to communicate with his advocate out of hearing of a third person is part of the basic requirements of a fair trial.

Switzerland, 28 November 1991, § 48, Series A no. 220).

From the search record itself it is clear that the investigators knew that they were entering a law firm’s office and were seizing the working files of a lawyer who represented the applicants (see, in particular, paragraph 71 above). Thus, by searching in Mr Drel’s office and seizing his working files the authorities deliberately interfered with the secrecy of the lawyer-client contacts protected under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention (see André and Other v.

Most significantly, the search in Mr Drel’s office was not accompanied by appropriate procedural safeguards, for example a court warrant, as required by the Advocacy Act and confirmed by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 398 and 399 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, Aleksanyan, cited above, § 214; Golovan v.

Such limitations, however, had no firm basis in domestic law. Thus, the legislation referred to by the Government regulated the correspondence of detainees with the outside world (“telegrams [and] letters” or “proposals, declarations and complaints” - see section 20 of the Detention on Remand Act, sections 84, 86, 91 and 99 of the Internal Regulations).

The Court has doubts as to whether the drafts or notes made by a lawyer during a meeting with his or her client could be qualified as “correspondence” or “prohibited objects” within the meaning of the Detention on Remand Act or the Internal Regulations. The Government did not specify what set of rules applied to the notes and to other written materials which the applicants might have exchanged with their lawyers during the meetings, and the Court cannot accept that the law was applied by extension in such a sensitive area as intereference with privileged materials of the defence. The Court reiterates in this respect that any limitations imposed on a detainee concerning his contacts with lawyers should have a lawful basis and that the law should be sufficiently precise (see, mutatis mutandis, Nolan and K. v.

Furthermore, even assuming that the Russian law at the time prevented the defence from keeping and exchanging notes during the meetings, the Court is not persuaded that such a measure was necessary in the applicants’ case. Secrecy of written communications is no less important than the secrecy of oral exchanges, especially where the case is factually and legally complex. As follows from the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 29 November 2010 (see paragraph 396 above), notes, drafts, outlines, action plans, etc. prepared by the lawyer for or during a meeting with his detained client are to all intents and purposes privileged material. In addition, as noted by the Constitutional Court, certain exceptions from the general principle of confidentiality are permissible, but only if the authorities have a reasonable cause to believe that the professional privilege is being abused. The Court fully subscribes to this position. The Court reiterates that in Campbell, cited above, it stressed that the prisoner’s correspondence with a lawyer should not be “susceptible to routine scrutiny”. Such correspondence can be opened only when the prison authorities have “reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure”. The letter should, however, only be opened and should not be read. The reading of a prisoner’s mail to and from a lawyer should only be permitted “in exceptional circumstances when the authorities have reasonable cause to believe that the privilege is being abused in that the contents of the letter endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature” (§ 48)."

                "639. In the present case the authorities took as their starting point the opposite presumption, namely that all written communications between any detained person and his lawyer were suspect. This went so far as to assimilate “correspondence” with written notes made by the lawyers in preparation for the meetings with the client or during them. The only way for the defence to overcome that presumption was to submit their working papers to the prison authorities for inspection, i.e. to reveal their arguments to a body which could hardly be regarded as independent, and which was required by law to communicate all suspicious correspondence to the investigative authorities (see paragraph 392 above)."
            ],
            [
                "640. Again, the principle of confidentiality of lawyer-client contacts is not absolute. However, the fact that a criminal defendant is detained is not sufficient to subject all of his written communications with his lawyers to perusal, and that for an indefinite period of time and without any justification specific for that particular case. The Court has repeatedly condemned the practice of “indiscriminate, routine checking of all of the applicant’s correspondence” with his lawyer (see Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, § 22, 24 February 2005; see also Kepeneklioğlu v. Turkey, no. 73520/01, § 31, 23 January 2007). This is a fortiori true in respect of papers brought by the lawyer to a meeting with his client or prepared during the meeting. To have a reasonable cause for interfering with the confidentiality of lawyer-client written communications the authorities must have something more than a sweeping presumption that lawyers always conspire with their clients in disregard of the rules of professional ethics and despite the serious sanctions which such behaviour entails."

                "641. The Government did not claim that the authorities were aware of what had been discussed in the meeting rooms. There was nothing in the behaviour of the applicants and their lawyers during those meetings to give rise to any reasonable suspicion of abuse of confidentiality; they were not “extraordinarily dangerous [criminals] whose methods had features in common with those of terrorists” (see S. v. Switzerland, cited above, § 47, see also Kröcher and Möller v. Switzerland, no. 8463/78, Commission decision of 10 July 1981, DR 26, p. 40). The applicants were accused of non-violent economic crimes and had no criminal record (compare with Castravet v. Moldova, no. 23393/05, § 58, 13 March 2007). There were no ascertainable facts showing that the applicants’ lawyers might abuse their professional privilege. The Court stresses that the measures complained of were not limited to the first days or weeks after the applicants’ arrest, when the risk of tampering with evidence, collision or re-offending was arguably higher, but lasted for over two years. In the circumstances the Court concludes that the rule whereby working documents of the defence, drafts, notes etc. were subject to perusal and could have been confiscated if not checked by the prison authorities beforehand was unjustified. Accordingly, the searches of the applicants’ lawyers were also unjustified.",

                "644. The Court takes note of the Government’s argument that the defence agreed to such security arrangements (see paragraph 152 above). However, the Court cannot regard this as a valid waiver of the defence’s rights under Article 6 § 3 (c). It reiterates that a waiver of a right must be, amongst other things, voluntary, and must be established in an unequivocal manner (see Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 73, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII, with further references; and, more recently, Vozhigov v. Russia, no. 5953/02, § 57, 26 April 2007; Pishchalnikov v. Russia, no. 7025/04, § 77, 24 September 2009; and Damir Sibgatullin v. Russia, no. 1413/05, § 48, 24 April 2012). The “waiver” in the present case satisfied neither of these two criteria. At the trial the defence expressed their concerns about the “security plan” implemented by the escort service in the courtroom. From the judge’s reaction it was clear that she did not consider herself competent to deal with that issue (see paragraph 151 above), and that the judge deferred to the prison authorities in a matter clearly related to legal assistance. Be that as it may, having consulted with the prosecution and the escort service the judge proposed an alternative solution, namely that all defence documents would be passed through her. The defence seemingly had no other choice but to accept that new rule. Therefore, Mr Padva’s remark that he would comply with the new rule cannot be interpreted as an unequivocal and voluntary acceptance of it."

            [
                "645. The Court accepts that a judge offers better guarantees of independence and impartiality than an escort officer. Nevertheless, in the circumstances the new rule still fell short of the requirements of Article 6 § 3 (c). The Court reiterates in this respect that, first, the applicants’ case was not such as to give reason to stringent restrictions on confidential exchanges, and that the authorities did not refer to specific facts which would justify the departure from the general rule of confidentiality of the lawyer-client contacts, including written communications. Second, the Court observes that Judge Kolesnikova, who requested the defence lawyers to show her all written communications, was also a judge of fact and law in the trial. While checking drafts and notes prepared by the defence lawyers or the applicants the judge might have come across information or arguments which the defence would not wish to reveal (see, for example, paragraph 155 above). Consequently, her role in checking the defence papers might have affected her opinion about the factual and legal issues involved in the case (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Erdem, cited above, § 67) where the Court examined a similar procedure of checking prisoners’ correspondence). In the Court’s opinion, it would be contrary to the principle of adversarial proceedings if the judge’s decision was influenced by arguments and information which the parties did not present and did not discuss at an open trial."

The Government did not challenge the applicants’ description of the conditions in which they had had to speak to their lawyers in the courtroom. In the light of the materials of the case, the Court has no reason to doubt the accuracy of the applicants’ account in this respect (see, in particular, paragraphs 151 and 154 above). In particular, the Court notes that the lawyers were not allowed to come closer than 50 cm to their clients when they wished to speak to them, and that escort officers were always standing in close proximity. The Court concludes that their oral exchanges might have been overheard by the convoy officers, at least occasionally."

                "647. The Court reiterates that not every measure hindering communication between the defendant and his lawyer must necessarily lead to a violation to Article 6 § 3 (c). Thus, for example, in assessing limitations imposed on the defence in the case of Titarenko v. Ukraine (no. 31720/02, 20 September 2012), the Court applied a quantitative approach and held as follows (§ 92):",
                "“The security arrangements [i.e. placement of the accused in a metal cage] undeniably limited communication between the applicant and his lawyer during the hearing. These limitations did not, however, amount to a complete lack of communication between the applicant and his lawyer; the applicant did not demonstrate that it was impossible to request that the lawyer’s seat be brought closer to his “cage”, or that they had been denied an opportunity for private communication when necessary.”",
                "In contrast with Titarenko, in the present case the applicants did not have “an opportunity for private communication” with their lawyers, due to the permanent presence of escort officers near the metal cage and the minimal distance the lawyers had to respect. The fact that the defence was able to request adjournments during the hearings is irrelevant: it appears that even during those adjournments the lawyers were unable to discuss the case with their clients anywhere but in the hearing room, i.e. in the close vicinity of the prison guards. The Court concludes that even though the applicants benefited from legal assistance by several lawyers, the secrecy of their exchanges, both oral and written, was seriously impaired during the hearings."

An expert could not be questioned if he had not earlier produced a written expert opinion. At the same time, the law allowed a written expert opinion (report) to be admitted to the materials of the case file without subsequent questioning of the expert who had prepared it. The judge in this case decided that there had been no grounds for calling the experts for questioning. It was the court’s task to establish the amount of damage, and the court had all the necessary information for that purpose. The District Court noted that the final assessment of the conclusions of the report by Mr Yeloyan and Mr Kupriyanov could be made only at the conclusive stage of the proceedings, when the court had deliberated and developed its position.

Those reports contained analysis of tax and banking legislation and accounting procedures and practices, criticism of the conclusions of the prosecution authorities, analysis of the lawfulness of audit reports issued by the tax authorities in the case in respect of the companies allegedly affiliated with the applicants, etc. The reports of those “expert witnesses” contained conclusions of a legal nature about the applicants’ guilt, analysis of the arguments of the prosecution, of evidence, interpretation of the applicable law etc., which was not an expert’s task under Russian law.

The Court agrees that the role of an expert witness in the proceedings can be distinguished from that of an eye-witness who must give to the court his personal recollection of a particular event. That does not mean, however, that testing of expert evidence is not covered by Article 6 § 3 (d) taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 1.

Consequently, their position was closer to that of a “prosecution witness”. Contrary to the situation with defence witnesses, the accused is not required to demonstrate the importance of a prosecution witness. If the prosecution decides that a particular person is a relevant source of information and relies on his or her testimony at the trial (see paragraph 165 above), and if the testimony of that witness is used by the court to support a guilty verdict (which was the case – see paragraph 271 above), it must be presumed that his or her personal appearance and questioning are necessary, unless the testimony of that witness is manifestly irrelevant or redundant."

In the present case, the District Court held that opinions by several “experts” for the defence touched upon legal matters, namely on the interpretation of the Russian legislation and were therefore useless for the court. In the Court’s opinion, and in the light of the nature of the submissions by those “experts”, the irrelevance/uselessness for the court was the central argument for rejecting them. This concerned oral and written submissions by Mr Shchekin, Mr Semenov, Mr Grechishkin, Mr Lubenchenko, Mr Gulyaev, and, to a certain extent, by Ms Petrova, Mr Bochko and Mr Pleshkov (see paragraphs 199 et seq., 214, 222 and 225 et seq.)."

For example, in exceptional circumstances the need to obtain a second expert opinion on an important aspect of the case may be self-evident and the failure of the court to obtain expert evidence sought by the defence may make the trial unfair (see, for example, G.B. v.

There was, however, no doubt that the reports emanated from the audit firms in question. Those firms were well known; they had their offices in Moscow and followed established practices and procedures. The District Court heard Mr Gage, a partner with Ernst and Young, who testified amongst other things about the preparation of the report by his firm. If the court needed any further information about the names or qualifications of experts involved in the preparation of the reports, it was easy to obtain it. The Court considers that defects as to the form were not a decisive argument for their rejection. The Court has therefore to examine the last argument, namely the inadmissibility of the reports from the standpoint of Russian law."

For the purposes of the present case the Court is prepared to accept the reading of the CCrP proposed by the Meshchanskiy District Court as reasonable (see Perić v. Croatia, no. 34499/06, § 17, 27 March 2008). That being said, the Court stresses that the rules on admissibility of evidence may sometimes run counter to the principles of equality of arms and adversarial proceedings, or affect the fairness of the proceedings otherwise (see, for example, Tamminen v. Finland, no. 40847/98, §§ 40-41, 15 June 2004). Although “Article 6 does not go as far as requiring that the defence be given the same rights as the prosecution in taking evidence” (see Mirilashvili, cited above, § 225), the accused should be entitled to seek and produce evidence “under the same conditions” as the prosecution (see, mutatis mutandis, Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, § 33, Series A no. 274; see also Perić, cited above, § 19). Clearly, those “conditions” cannot be exactly the same in all respects; thus, for example, the defence cannot have the same search and seizure powers as the prosecution. However, as follows from the text of Article 6 § 3 (d) the defence must have an opportunity to conduct an active defence – for example, by calling witnesses on its behalf or adducing other evidence."

The reports were obtained within the preliminary investigation, i.e. not in adversarial proceedings, and, in this case, without any participation of the defence. Thus, the defence was unable to formulate questions to the experts, challenge the experts or propose their own experts for inclusion in the team, etc. The trial court admitted those reports in evidence because under the CCrP the prosecution had a right to collect them."

Indeed, in theory the defence could challenge an expert report produced by the prosecution and ask the court to commission a fresh expert examination. However, to obtain such a fresh examination it was incumbent on the defence to persuade the court that the report produced by the prosecution was incomplete or deficient. The Court notes that the defence was unable to call some of the experts who had prepared the reports at the request of the prosecution, and to cast doubt on their credibility. That fact gave rise to a separate finding of a violation under Article 6 § 3 (d) (see paragraph 716 above) and it undoubtedly made the defence’s task of proving the usefulness of the counter-reports more difficult."

In any event, the defence would only be able to rely on oral questioning of the “specialists” at the trial, whereas the prosecution was able to produce written reports prepared beforehand by “experts”. Finally, as transpires from the Meshchanskiy District Court’s reasoning, “specialists” invited by the defence, unlike “experts” for the prosecution, did not have direct access to the original copy of the case file, and the court was not prepared to admit their conclusions based on the copies of materials of the case provided to them by the defence (see paragraph 252 above)."

It was hard to believe that the applicants had never assessed the risks related to their business activities in Russia, including the risks in the sphere of criminal law.

There could be different methods of tax evasion. For example, it could occur in the form of a deliberate and knowing indication of false information in the tax declaration or in other documents which the taxpayer must submit to the tax authority in accordance with the law. “Other documents” in this context meant any documents necessary for the calculation of the taxes due. “Deliberate” meant the existence of a direct intent to give false information. “False information” was understood as any incorrect data about the object of the tax (i.e. property, revenue or other operations and status), about the right to tax deductions, credits etc., which could affect the correctness of the calculation of the amount due by the taxpayer. “Indication of the false information” could take the form of the taxpayer’s failure to indicate the true amount of his revenues; artificial minimisation of revenues or increase of deductible costs; falsification of data on the time period when certain revenues were received or losses suffered; distortion of physical characteristics of a particular type of business activity, etc."

Their report on money laundering in 1999-98 mentioned the use of offshore companies as a common tax-evasion technique. The Financial Action Task Force continued to discover new forms of tax evasion every year; however, this could not preclude the States from bringing the persons responsible for tax evasion to criminal liability.

The central question was therefore whether such schemes had been discovered and penalised in any other case before the applicants were brought to trial. The Government asserted that the tax-evasion schemes used by the applicants were “relatively new” and were discovered only in the course of the investigation into the applicants’ case. Thus, the sham companies were registered and functioned on the territories enjoying a special taxation regime. However, the ZATO Act clearly established criteria which permitted companies incorporated and registered in those locations to use that special regime. In order to benefit from tax cuts the companies had to have up to 90 per cent of their fixed assets and 70 per cent of their human resources concentrated in those territories. Seventy per cent of the wage-fund was supposed to be paid to locally-hired employees. The companies which were buying oil from Yukos did not correspond to those requirements; consequently, they obtained tax cuts unlawfully and caused damage to the State.

The actual word used in relation to Business Oil and other trading companies in the criminal judgment was “ podstavnye ” (“sham [legal entities]”).

This requirement is satisfied when the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it or by way of appropriate legal advice, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see Liivik v.

Foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the law concerned, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed.

The Court also reiterates that “the wording of statutes is not always precise. One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. That means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent are vague, and their interpretation and application depend on practice” (see Scoppola (no. 2) [GC], cited above, § 100). Furthermore, in most of the member States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition.

The company’s “tax optimisation techniques” applied with slight variations throughout 2000-2003 consisted of switching the tax burden from the applicant company and its production and service units to letter-box companies in domestic tax havens in Russia. These companies, with no assets, employees or operations of their own, were nominally owned and managed by third parties, although in reality they were set up and run by the applicant company itself. In essence, the applicant company’s oil-producing subsidiaries sold the extracted oil to the letter-box companies at a fraction of the market price. The letter-box companies, acting in cascade, then sold the oil either abroad, this time at market price or to the applicant company’s refineries and subsequently re-bought it at a reduced price and re-sold it at the market price. Thus, the letter-box companies accumulated most of the applicant company’s profits. Since they were registered in domestic low-tax areas, they enabled the applicant company to pay substantially lower taxes in respect of these profits. Subsequently, the letter-box companies transferred the accumulated profits unilaterally to the applicant company as gifts ...",

This was made clear not only by Article 10 (3) of the Civil Code relied on by the domestic courts in the Tax Assessment proceedings, but also by other relevant and applicable statutory provisions which were available to the applicant company and other taxpayers at the time .... The case-law referred to by the Government indicated that the power to re-characterise or to cancel bad faith activities of companies existed and had been used by the domestic courts in diverse contexts and with varying consequences for the parties concerned since as early as 1997 ....

The Court observes in this respect that the Meshchanskiy District Court convicted the applicants for two distinct counts of tax evasion under Article 199. The first count related to the allegedly unlawful tax cuts obtained by the trading companies. The second related to the payment of taxes with promissory notes (see paragraphs 111 et seq. above). The court of appeal (the Moscow City Court) quashed the District Court’s judgment in so far as it concerned payment of taxes with promissory notes (see paragraph 318 above). It found that after the 2003 amendments to Article 199, such behaviour ceased to be a crime, since the law no longer referred to “other methods” of tax evasion. That second count was therefore removed from the list of accusations against the applicants, as upheld at final instance. In such circumstances the Court concludes that the applicants could not claim to be victims of the alleged violation of Article 7 in this respect, since they had not been “held guilty” of a crime within the meaning of that Convention provision.",

                "788. The applicants claimed that, as the law stood in 1999-2000, there were certain procedural obstacles to bringing them to criminal liability for tax evasion. In particular, the applicants referred to the Ruling of the Constitutional Court of 27 May 2003 (see paragraph 43 above) which may be interpreted as requiring that bringing a person to criminal liability for tax evasion must be preceded by establishing his tax liability in separate proceedings. The case of Chelpiks decided by the commercial courts of the Urals District implied that it was impossible to sue a taxpayer for the use of tax advantages granted by a preferential tax agreement without previously invalidating that agreement (see paragraph 436 above). However, the applicants in the present case had been brought to criminal liability without the preferential tax agreements being invalidated and before the courts pronounced on the tax liability of the company in separate proceedings."

                "789. The Court is not persuaded that the applicants’ understanding of the Constitutional Court’s ruling is correct. Similarly, the Urals District commercial court’s decision in the Chelpiks case may reasonably have a different interpretation. Be that as it may, the Court reiterates that Article 7 guarantees that criminal offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by substantive criminal law. It does not, however, set any requirements as to the procedure in which those offences must be investigated and brought to trial. The Court reiterates that in the case of Coëme and Others v. Belgium (nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 149, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII) it faced a somewhat similar claim by the applicants, who argued that Article 7 guaranteed not only the foreseeability of the punishment, but also the foreseeability of the prosecution. In that case the new law had extended the limitation period and thus prolonged the period of time during which prosecutions could be brought in respect of the offences imputed to the applicants. The Court admitted that the application of the new law “detrimentally affected the applicants’ situation, in particular by frustrating their expectations”, but that it did not “entail an infringement of the rights guaranteed by Article 7, since that provision cannot be interpreted as prohibiting an extension of limitation periods through the immediate application of a procedural law where the relevant offences have never become subject to limitation”."

The applicants may have expected that the authorities would be unable to prosecute them in a criminal court without going first through separate court proceedings, tax or civil. The Court reiterates that it is not persuaded that this was the only possible scenario for their prosecution. In any event, the alleged “procedural obstacles” did not mean that the acts imputed to the applicants were not defined as “criminal offences” at the moment when they were committed. It follows that there was no violation of Article 7 on this account.",

The Court will now turn to the applicants’ conviction under Article 198 and 199 for the use of various tax-minimisation techniques in respect of both company taxes and personal income taxes. The Court observes that “tax evasion” is defined in Articles 198 and 199 of the Criminal Code in very general terms (see paragraph 429 above). The Code describes tax evasion as “knowing” inclusion of “false data” in the fiscal declarations. By itself such a broad definition does not raise any issue under Article 7 of the Convention. Forms of economic activity are in constant development, and so are the methods of tax evasion. In order to define whether a particular behaviour amounts to “tax evasion” in the criminal-law sense the domestic courts may invoke legal concepts from other areas of law, in particular the tax law. The law in this area may be sufficiently flexible to adapt to new situations, without, however, becoming unpredictable."

The applicants had every reason to believe that those declarations faithfully reflected all the transactions of the trading companies and were thus accurate for the purposes of the ZATO Act. Similarly, the applicants duly reported on the amounts they had been receiving from the Isle of Man companies, in accordance with the Small Business Act. Both acts were formulated very precisely and did not use such concepts as “business purpose”, “sham” or “bad faith”. The Government argued that the then existing case-law developed the concept of “tax evasion” in sufficient detail to make the applicants’ conviction foreseeable."

It observes that the Supreme Court’s Ruling no. 8 of 4 July 1997, referred to by the Government (see paragraph 753 above), explained some of the concepts related to the concept of “tax evasion” and of the constituent elements thereof. However, it did not describe such phenomena as “transfer pricing”, “sham” companies or transactions, which were at the heart of the applicants’ criminal case. The use of “frontman” companies as a method of tax evasion was first mentioned explicitly in the Supreme Court’s Ruling no. 64 of 28 December 2006 (see paragraph 434 above). That Ruling cannot support the Government’s case, because the acts imputed to the applicants related to 1998-2000."

                "794. Other case-law referred to by the Government is, for the most part, irrelevant, since it concerned other forms of tax evasion, such as, for example, the straightforward failure to declare revenues. There were few cases which concerned the use of “front” or “sham” companies, but they were decided in 2002 or even later (see, in particular, the cases of Mironov and Selivanov summarised in paragraph 754 above). The Court is not aware of any other case-law on the matter contemporary to the relevant period of time. Writings of legal scholars referred to by the Government were scarce and inconclusive. The Court concludes that in the criminal law sphere there was no case-law directly applicable to the transfer pricing arrangements and allegedly sham transactions as those in the heart of the applicants’ case."

                "795. The Government’s next argument was that the illegal character of such arrangements might have been established with reference to general principles derived from other areas of law, in particular the tax and civil law. This argument is not devoid of merit. The Court observes that the position of the authorities in the tax proceedings against Yukos was centred on the concept of “sham transaction”. The prosecution in the applicants’ case alleged that the applicants were submitting “false” information to the authorities. For many purposes “sham” is a synonym of “false”, so the logic of the State authorities in the two cases was broadly similar. A person cannot enter into a “sham” transaction by inadvertence; it is always a deliberate act. In other words, submitting tax declarations based on sham operations can be construed as “knowingly” submitting “false information” to the tax authorities, a situation falling within the ambit of Articles 198 and 199 of the Criminal Code."

                "796. The concept of “sham transaction” was known in Russian law (see paragraphs 417 et seq. above). The courts had always the power to apply the “substance-over-form” rule and invalidate a transaction as “sham” under Articles 167 and 170 of the Civil Code (see the case-law in paragraphs 422 et seq.). A similar (albeit not identical) legal construction existed in the Tax Code: for example, in certain situations the Code allowed tax authorities to disregard a contract and calculate taxes due by the parties to it on the basis of imputed “market prices” (see paragraph 414 above). Thus, the “substance-over-form” approach also existed in the field of the tax law. The Court emphasises that such an approach exists in many European countries and that the Court does not see anything unreasonable or unusual in it."

Some of the case-law referred to by the parties speak in favour of the Government’s position. In particular, in the cases of Mechel or Grin Haus (paragraphs 422 and 425 above) the courts re-characterised the transactions of taxpayers as “sham” at the request of the Tax Service."

OOO Pribrezhnoe (see paragraph 439 above), analysed in §§ 593-594 of the Yukos judgment. In that case a commercial court refused to recalculate taxes due by a company registered in the low-tax zone despite several factual elements indicative of the “sham” character of the operations of that company. Factual elements relied on by the Tax Service in the Pribrezhnoye case were very close to those relied on by the prosecution in the criminal case against the applicants. The domestic court accepted the documents submitted by the defendant (contracts, lists of personnel, payrolls, bills, etc.) at face value and rejected the prosecution’s arguments about the fictitious character of the impugned operations as unconvincing."

Energosintez (see paragraph 437 above), where the commercial court held in favour of the defendant company registered in a ZATO, despite the fact that industrial facilities for processing and transporting oil (which was the main business of that company) did not belong to the company and were located outside the territory of the ZATO. The court found those arguments irrelevant."

The Court notes that the cases of Pribrezhnoye and Energosintez may create an impression that the courts at the time were reluctant to apply the “substance-over-form” approach to transfer pricing arrangements. However, in the Court’s opinion, those cases were mostly decided on the facts. They cannot be construed as negating the power of the courts to invalidate a particular transaction as “sham”. Rather, the courts in those cases found that evidence produced by the Tax Service was insufficient to reach such a conclusion. The fact that in one or two cases the Tax Service failed to produce sufficient evidence and prove the fictitious character of a taxpayer’s operations does not mean that it would fail in all subsequent cases in respect of other taxpayers."

The existence of such an agreement with the ZATO administration is a powerful argument strengthening the presumption that the taxpayer acted bona fide, but it does not give absolute immunity from possible re-characterisation of operations based on that agreement as “sham”."

                "805. The Court acknowledges that there are legitimate methods of tax minimisation: a company may organise its business processes in such a way as to benefit from special tax regimes. However, the tax-minimisation scheme deployed by Yukos was not fully transparent; some of the elements of the scheme were concealed from the authorities. Such behaviour by the taxpayer might have reasonably been construed as amounting to the submission of “false data” to the tax authorities within the meaning of the Criminal Code, which constitutes the actus reus of tax evasion."

It was not claimed by the applicants, neither in the domestic proceedings nor before this Court, that the trading companies were registered in Lesnoy in order to facilitate logistics, save on production costs, hire qualified staff, etc. As the Court put it in the Yukos case (§ 593), “the arrangement [i.e. the tax minimisation scheme] was obviously aimed at evading the general requirements of the Tax Code, which expected taxpayers to trade at market prices”."

Second, the Court observes that despite the formal domiciliation of the trading companies in Lesnoy, all business activities which generated profit were in fact carried out in Moscow. The trading companies presented themselves as real companies having assets and personnel in the low-tax zone; however, as was established in the domestic proceedings and later confirmed by the Court in the Yukos case (see § 591), all of the trading companies had virtually no assets or personnel in the ZATO, and had enjoyed no operational independence whatsoever from the Moscow headquarters. Thus, the trading companies claimed tax cuts as if they were really operating in the low-tax zone, but in reality they were merely registered there for form’s sake, and all the operations were conducted in Moscow."

Quite the contrary: the system of oil sales set by Yukos was deliberately opaque. The trading companies were registered in the names of third persons not formally connected to Yukos or its managers, and had been managed by fictional directors. Benefits of the trading companies were returned to Yukos indirectly, through a special fund which received “gifts” from the trading companies. The fact that the Lesnoy town trading companies were wound up in 2001 following audits by the Tax Service, and that immediately afterwards similar entities were registered in other low-tax zones demonstrates that Yukos was not prepared to defend the lawfulness of the tax optimisation technique in courts. Such a coordinated reorganisation implies that it was done in order to render it more difficult for the authorities to scrutinize the business operations of those companies, to trace their assets and their affiliation with other companies and persons. In sum, by organising its sales in this way the applicants evaded application of the provisions of the Tax Code which permitted recalculation of taxes on the basis of “market prices” in the relations between affiliated companies."

The Court concludes that the applicants’ behaviour cannot be compared to that of a bona fide taxpayer who fails to declare his revenues or submit other relevant information due to some unintended omission or a genuine misinterpretation of the tax law. In the present case, whereas a part of the tax-minimisation scheme was visible to the authorities, the applicants misrepresented or concealed some important aspects of that scheme which arguably might have been crucial for defining eligibility of the trading companies to tax cuts."

The applicants also challenged the finding of the domestic courts to the effect that they (the applicants) had played a leading role in mounting and managing the impugned tax-optimisation scheme. In the opinion of the Court it is difficult to imagine that the applicants, as senior executives and co-owners of Yukos, were not aware of the entire transfer pricing arrangement and did not know that the information included in the fiscal reporting of the trading companies did not reflect the true nature of their operations (see, mutatis mutandis, Soros, cited above, § 59).

Similarly, it is impossible to set an exhaustive list of criteria for defining a particular operation or a company as “sham”. However, the cumulative effect of the elements discussed was sufficient to demonstrate that the operations of the trading companies were likely to be “sham”, that the reporting based thereon did not reflect the realities of the business operations, and that the applicants therefore “knowingly” submitted “false data” in order to reduce the overall tax burden of the company.

If the “consultancy agreements” between the applicants and the Isle of Man companies were indeed “sham” or “fictitious” – and that was the finding of the domestic courts – one can reasonably consider that the applicants had knowingly submitted false data in their declarations, thus committing an offence under Article 198 of the Criminal Code."

The applicants’ own explanations concerning their relations with the unnamed “end-users” were quite vague. Even though the applicants were allowed to remain silent, the overall picture of their relations with the two Isle of Man companies and/or “end-users” required some explanation, especially in the light of their parallel work as senior executives of Yukos, work for which they received only a symbolic compensation, and in view of other evidence discovered by the prosecution which showed the links between the applicants and the two Isle of Man companies. The provenance of the money paid by the Isle of Man companies under the “service agreements” – an element which the applicant considered as important – in the eyes of the domestic courts was not important for establishing the true purpose of those transfers, and the Court does not see any reason to disagree with this.

The right to choose a particular mode of operation with a view to minimising taxes does not relieve the taxpayer from the obligation to submit true information to the tax authorities. In the domestic proceedings (as well as before this Court) the applicants claimed that they had provided consulting services to various clients, including those not related to Yukos. Apparently, their tax declarations were formulated in similar terms. However, the Russian courts did not accept that assertion, holding that the sums received by the applicants had nothing to do with any consulting services but solely related to their work as senior executives in Yukos. In other words, the applicants did not inform the tax authorities of the true nature of their activities.

Thus, the Government insisted that the measure complained of was lawful. Under Article 73 of the CES a convict was entitled to serve his prison sentence in the same federal constituency where he was convicted (in the applicants’ case, Moscow). However, where this is impossible, the convict was sent to serve his sentence in a penal colony situated in the next closest federal constituency. Several regions of Russia (Moscow, St Petersburg and some republics of the Northern Caucasus) have no general-regime penal colonies. In order to avoid prison overcrowding and comply with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention, as interpreted in the Court’s case-law in respect to prison conditions in Russia, convicts from those regions were sent to colonies situated in other regions. For example, convicts from Moscow often served their sentences even further from Moscow than the town of Krasnokamensk, where the first applicant had been sent. According to the Government, Article 73 of the CES “was complied with in the majority of the federal constituencies of the Russian Federation”. In many regions new penal colonies were being built. The applicants were treated in this respect in the same manner as any other convict in a similar situation. There were no grounds for giving the applicants preferential treatment because of their family or financial situation. They were sent to serve their sentences in such distant locations because there was no place for them in other regions of Russia."

Furthermore, the Government noted that the applicants’ cellmates could have learned that they had money in foreign banks. That could have put the applicants in danger. In the Government’s words, the detainees in the Yamalo-Nenetskiy Autonomous region and in the Chita region were less informed about the details of the applicants’ case than those in Central Russia.

As a direct consequence of his transfer to Krasnokamensk, his family had only been able to make use of the “short” visits on one occasion since 2005. Of course, had the applicant been serving his sentence closer to his family, he would have been able to make far greater use of the facility for short visits. On account of the exhausting and demanding nature of the journey, his young twin sons were unable to visit him in Krasnokamensk at all. The children were able to visit the first applicant whilst he was detained in Moscow. The first applicant’s elderly father had been able to visit him only once. The fact that the first applicant’s family did not use up his full allowance of visits – he had five long visits and only one short visit over 14 months at IK-10 penal colony – clearly suggested that the enormous distance prevented visits taking place."

Under the law, it was incumbent upon the Russian authorities to send the applicants to serve their sentences in a colony in Moscow or in the Moscow Region. The Government provided no evidence in support of their assertion that overcrowding in Moscow prisons was such that the applicants could not be sent to a penal colony in the Moscow region. Further, the Government did not challenge the first applicant’s assertion that in September 2005 there had been 149,674 available places in penal colonies in the Russian Federation out of a total capacity of 786,753 places.

Second, the Government did not explain why the risk allegedly posed by the other inmates would be lower in Krasnokamensk or Kharp than in Moscow. In fact, for more than two years the applicants had been held in remand prisons in the city of Moscow, and there had not been a single incident involving them during that time concerning relations with their cellmates.

First, the domestic courts wrongly accepted the arguments of the representatives of the FSIN that that there was no requirement upon them to consider the individual circumstances of the convict. Such a contention was clearly incompatible with Article 8. Second, the domestic courts were similarly wrong in failing to require an explanation as to why it was that the applicants was sent to Krasnokamensk and Kharp, thousands of kilometres from Moscow, despite the fact that there were 149,674 available places in penal colonies in the Russian Federation as at September 2005.

The domestic courts failed to enquire why it was that both applicants had also been sent to a very remote region of the Russian Federation in apparent disregard of the provisions of the law. The fact that both men had been sent thousands of miles from Moscow was strongly suggestive of improper motives on the part of the State authorities.",

The Court reiterates in this respect that any detention which is lawful for the purposes of Article 5 of the Convention (and there is no doubt that the applicants’ detention following their conviction complied with Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention) entails by its nature various limitations on private and family life (see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, § 98, Series A, no. 161). It would be fundamentally wrong to analyse each and every case of detention following conviction from the standpoint of Article 8, and to consider the “lawfulness” and “proportionality” of the prison sentence as such."

However, the Convention cannot stop at the prison gate (see Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, § 70, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX), and there is no question that a prisoner forfeits all of his Article 8 rights merely because of his status as a person detained following conviction (see Ploski v. Poland, no. 26761/95, 12 November 2002). The Court will not turn a blind eye to such limitations which go beyond what would normally be accepted in the case of an ordinary detainee. Thus, for example, it is an essential part of a prisoner’s right to respect for family life that the prison authorities assist him in maintaining contact with his close family (see Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, § 61, ECHR 2000-X). Limitations on contacts with other prisoners and with family members, imposed by prison rules, have been regarded by the Court as an “interference” with the rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention (see Van der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, § 69, ECHR 2003-II)."

Thus, placing a convict in a particular prison may potentially raise an issue under Article 8 if its effects for the applicant’s private and family life go beyond “normal” hardships and restrictions inherent to the very concept of imprisonment. As the Commission already observed in Wakefield v. the United Kingdom (no. 15817/89, decision of 1 October 1990, DR 66, p. 251): “Article 8 requires the State to assist prisoners as far as possible to create and sustain ties with people outside prison in order to promote prisoners’ social rehabilitation. In this context the location of the place where a prisoner is detained is relevant”. Furthermore, the right to respect for family life imposes upon states a positive obligation to assist prisoners in maintaining effective contact with their close family members (see X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 9054/80, Commission decision of 8 October 1982, DR 30, p. 115). In the context of imprisonment the Commission recognised that the possibility for close family members to visit a detainee constitutes an essential factor in the maintenance of family life (see Hacisuleymanoglou v. Italy no. 23241/94, decision of 20 October 1994, DR no. 79-B, p. 121)."

The Court reiterates that in the Wakefield case the Commission considered that the refusal to allow the applicant a permanent transfer from Yorkshire to Scotland to be near his fiancée had constituted an interference with the applicant’s right to respect for private life. In the present case the distances involved were much longer than those in Wakefield. Given the geographical situation of the colonies concerned, and the realities of the Russian transport system the Court has no difficulty in accepting that a trip from Moscow to the Krasnokamensk colony or the Kharp colony was a long and exhaustive endeavour, especially for the applicants’ young children. Indeed, it was not the applicants themselves but the members of their respective families who suffered from the remoteness of the colonies. Still, the applicants were affected by this measure, albeit indirectly, because they probably received fewer visits than they would have received had they been located closer to Moscow.

The Court is aware that the FSIN was the main regulatory body in the penitentiary system and, as such, was competent to decide matters related to transferrals of detainees. In such circumstances, the Court does not consider it necessary to review the findings of the Russian courts as to the lawfulness of the measure complained of.

Furthermore, it is evident that the exception to the “geographical rule” applied to the applicants was aimed at combating prison overcrowding in certain regions. Those aims (guaranteeing safety of the convict and avoiding general overcrowding) are, in the opinion of the Court, “legitimate” under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention since they contribute to preventing “disorder and crime” and securing the “rights and freedoms” of others.

Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the general assumption that inmates in the Kharp or Krasnokamensk colonies were less dangerous for the applicants since these other inmates did not know who the applicants were: the applicants’ trial was the most mediatised trial of the recent decade and the first applicant’s wealth was well-known from many sources open to the general public. Finally, the Government’s assertion that unnamed “victims” of the applicants’ crimes would try to take vengeance on them did not have any factual basis - the principal victim of the crimes imputed to the applicants was the State itself.

It appears that in order to address that problem the FSIN came up with a general plan establishing quotas for the distribution of convicts amongst penitentiary colonies in different Russian regions (“federal constituencies”). The Government submitted to the Court a copy of that plan. However, the Government did not explain how that plan was prepared, and did not describe a method or algorithm of distribution of convicts used by the FSIN to draw that plan.

Data referred to by the applicants and not contested by the Government suggested that at the time when the applicants were sent to Siberia and the Far North there were free places in the Russian penitentiary system, including in colonies situated in Central Russia (see paragraphs 328 and 347 above). Over thirty-five regions in Russia are closer to Moscow than the Yamalo-Nenetskiy region, and over fifty-five regions are closer than the Chita region. Therefore, it was likely that the FSIN plan did not adhere strictly to the “geographical rule” fixed in Article 73.

There are other arguments speaking in favour of giving the authorities a large margin of appreciation in this sphere. However, that margin of appreciation is not unlimited. The distribution of the prison population must not remain entirely at the discretion of the administrative bodies, such as FSIN. The interests of the convicts in maintaining at least some family and social ties must somehow be taken into account. The Russian law is based on a similar assumption, as the spirit and the goal of Article 73 of the CES was to preserve the applicants’ social and family ties to the place where they used to live before the conviction. However, practical implementation of that law in Russia could lead to a disproportionate result, as the applicants’ case demonstrates. In absence of a clear and foreseeable method of distribution of convicts amongst penal colonies, the system failed to “provide a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities” (see Telegraaf Nederland Landelijke Media B.V. and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 39315/06, § 90, 22 November 2012).

In such circumstances the amounts recovered from him must be regarded as compensation due to society and the State for the wrongs committed by him.

As a general rule, tax claims concerning unpaid corporate taxes are brought against the corporate taxpayer. However, there are a few exceptions from this rule. Thus, if at the moment when the claim is introduced, the corporate entity still exists but it does not have sufficient assets to satisfy the claim, this triggers the subsidiary liability of the person who was responsible for the tax debt.

In the first applicant’s opinion, the Court’s admissibility decision left open two key questions: (a) whether it was “lawful”, as a matter of domestic and/or Convention law for the Meshchanskiy District Court to make a damages award for company tax evasion against an individual; and (b) if so, whether it was correct to do so in the instant case given the rulings of the Commercial Courts in the Yukos tax proceedings."

            [
                "861. As to the first of those questions, the first applicant alleged that claims for damages in relation to company tax evasion should be brought against the companies that are alleged to have evaded the taxes and thus the Meshchanskiy District Court was not entitled to make any award of damages against him under this charge. Thus in the I. and K. case the Russian Supreme Court stated that there was no legal justification for upholding a civil claim filed by the tax authorities for the evasion of taxes that were not paid by a joint-stock company implicated in a criminal case to the private individuals convicted in the relevant case. The principles set out in I. and K. were applied by the Moscow Regional Court on 9 October 2002 in its report “On the results of an examination of criminal cases in the economic sphere by the Moscow region courts during 2000 and the first half of 2002”:",
                "“Under Article 55 of the [old] Criminal Procedural Code, civil respondents may include, in particular, enterprises, establishments and companies, which, according to law, carry material liability for losses caused by the criminal actions of the accused individual. In a criminal case an individual may be recognised as a civil respondent only on the basis of the tax, which he failed to pay into the budget as a taxpayer paying income tax. But as a company’s head or chief accountant, an individual cannot incur tax liability for the company, because the latter, being a separate object of taxation, has its own collection of rights and responsibilities as a taxpayer, particularly as the payer of tax on legal entities or companies, including tax on profit (income), VAT, transactions with securities, tax on profit from stock exchange and insurance operations. Therefore, in this example the company/taxpayer itself must be regarded as the civil respondent in respect of the unpaid taxes and duties. In granting the civil claim submitted by the prosecutor, the court actually shifted the obligation to pay tax arrears to the wrong taxpayer. Granting a civil claim for the collection of tax in a criminal case instigated on the indications specified under Article 199 of the Criminal Code (company tax evasion), from the personal funds of a private individual convicted under this article, has no basis in law”."

They asserted that the Supreme Court decision in I. and K. was now “irrelevant” as on 18 December 2002 a new Criminal Procedure Code came into force. However, the Government’s assertions were not supported by reference to any subsequent case-law demonstrating that the case had been challenged, let alone overruled. The Government’s references to the changes in the Criminal Procedure Code introduced in 2002 were equally unsubstantiated: there was no analysis of how the new Code undermined the judgment of the Supreme Court in I. and K. in any way. The provisions of the new Code had not altered the basis for the Supreme Court’s findings. In any event, it was impossible to understand how, even if the new Criminal Procedure Code were relevant, it could, consistent with the principle of fair balance, have retrospective effect."

As to the second of the issues, namely the possibility for “double recovery” of the same amounts of unpaid taxes from a company and its top-executive, the first applicant claimed that the Government had not addressed this question. In the applicant’s view, the civil damages award was manifestly arbitrary as: (a) the alleged tax arrears had already been collected from Yukos; (b) the promissory notes had all been redeemed in full and there was therefore no loss to the state. Subsequent domestic decisions in related cases had concluded that the promissory notes were redeemed in full: see the judgments of the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in the Ivannikov case and the judgment of the Miass City Court of Chelyabinsk Oblast in the Lubenets case."

The amounts recovered from him by virtue of the judgment of 16 May 2005 were the same as the amounts recovered from the companies affiliated with the first applicant - in particular, Yukos. The Meshchanskiy District Court ordered the first applicant to pay the Federal Tax Service RUB 17,395,449,282 in relation to the latter’s claim for damages arising from the alleged non-payment of taxes by the ZATO trading companies. The total award for damages related to the crime committed under Article 199 of the Criminal Code comprised: (a) damages related to the tax evasion for 1999 in the amount of RUB 5,447,501,388; and (b) damages relating to the alleged tax evasion for 2000 in the amount of RUB 11,947,947,894. On appeal, the Moscow City Court excluded from the total amount of unpaid taxes for 1999 and 2000 the amount of taxes which were paid by the four trading companies in promissory notes. The basis of the Moscow City Court’s decision on this point was that even if one assumed that payment of tax by the Lesnoy companies by using promissory notes had been unlawful in 1999 and 2000, by the time that the first applicant’s case came to trial the wording of Article 199 of the Criminal Code had been amended so as to exclude the possibility of his being convicted under that (or any other) provision of the Criminal Code in respect of such conduct, and the applicant was therefore entitled to invoke the benefit of that change. As a result, the total amount of unpaid taxes was reduced by the Moscow City Court to RUB 1,217,622,799 for 1999 and to RUB 1,566,046,683 for 2000. Despite this change, the court of appeal refused to reduce the amount of the civil claim."

Given that the damages award was itself unlawful and that the alleged loss to the State for the year 2000 had already been recovered in the Yukos tax proceedings, the issue as to “fair balance” did not fall to be considered.

Further, according to the Court’s well-established case-law, an instance of interference, including one resulting from a measure to secure payment of taxes, must strike a “fair balance” between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. The States, when framing and implementing policies in the area of taxation, enjoys a wide margin of appreciation, since decisions in this area will commonly involve the appreciation of political, economic and social questions which the Convention leaves within the competence of the States parties. The second paragraph of Article 1 explicitly reserves the right of Contracting States to enact such laws as they may deem necessary to secure the payment of taxes. In the case of Gasus Dosier- und Fördertechnik GmbH v. the Netherlands (23 February 1995, § 59, Series A no. 306 ‑ B), the Court stated that “the importance which the drafters of the Convention attached to this aspect of the second paragraph of Article 1 may be gauged from the fact that at a stage when the proposed text did not contain such explicit reference to taxes, it was already understood to reserve the States’ power to pass whatever fiscal laws they considered desirable, provided always that measures in this field did not amount to arbitrary confiscation (see Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, Rapporteur of the Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, Second Session of the Consultative Assembly, Sixteenth Sitting (25 August 1950), Collected Edition of the Travaux préparatoires, vol. VI, p. 140, commenting on the text of the proposed Article 10A, ibid., p. 68)”. The power of appreciation of the States parties in such matters is therefore a wide one (see Gasus Dosier- und Fördertechnik GmbH, cited above, § 60; see also Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, § 69, Series A no. 52; National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society, 23 October 1997, § 80, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VII; and M.A. and 34 Others v.

                "871. The Government claimed, referring to Ferrazzini, cited above, that the recovery of unpaid company taxes from the first applicant cannot be analysed in terms of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 since it was not an “interference” with the applicant’s rights guaranteed by this provision. The Court considers, however, that the Government’s reading of Ferrazzini is misconceived. The question for the Court in the present case is not to define whether the “tax proceedings” are “civil proceedings” for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, but to define whether Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is applicable to the court order recovering a certain amount of unpaid taxes from a taxpayer. Even if tax proceedings are not civil (cf. Yukos judgment, §§ 527 and 528), a pecuniary award made against a taxpayer within such proceedings may still constitute an “interference” with his possessions. As the Court held in Burden, cited above, “taxation is in principle an interference with the right guaranteed by the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, since it deprives the person concerned of a possession, namely the amount of money which must be paid” (§ 59). The fact that the State enjoys a large margin of appreciation in this sphere does not affect that conclusion."

The Government further argued that the amount of unpaid taxes did not constitute the applicant’s “possessions” in the Convention meaning since the applicant withheld it unlawfully. The Court cannot agree with that argument either. The parties disagreed on the meaning of the applicable legal provisions, eligibility of the first applicant and trading companies to tax cuts, and, consequently, on the exact amount of taxes due. Eventually, the courts ruled in favour of the authorities and concluded that Yukos and the first applicant had an outstanding tax debt, but that fact alone cannot remove from the amounts recovered from Yukos and/or from the first applicant the protection guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, “Bulves” AD v.

Thus, he claimed that, as a matter of principle, Russian law did not provide for the recovery of unpaid company taxes from the managers of that company who had been found guilty of tax evasion under Article 199. In his submissions, only a company which had failed to pay taxes might be a defendant in such circumstances. The interference at issue, therefore, did not have a lawful basis.

The phrase “subject to the conditions provided for by law” requires in the first place the existence of and compliance with adequately accessible and sufficiently precise domestic legal provisions (see the Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 July 1986, § 110, Series A no. 102). The Court’s power to review compliance with domestic law is limited (see, inter alia, the Fredin v.

However, the Court is required to verify whether the way in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the principles of the Convention, as interpreted in the light of the Court’s case-law (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, §§ 190 and 191, ECHR 2006 ‑ V)."

First, it is questionnable whether the Meshchanskiy District Court had the power to grant the claims of the Tax Service against the applicant while the corporate taxpayer still existed (see paragraph 350 above; see also paragraph 18 above). Second, Article 56 of the Civil Code provides for subsidiary liability of managers of the insolvent company, whereas the judgment of the Meshchanskiy District Court seemed to order the recovery of the outstanding amount of company taxes from both applicants on the solidarity basis with the company.

The Court notes that the underlying rules of civil, tax and criminal liability, applied in the case of I. and K., were the same as in the applicants’ case.

After 2006 the Russian courts repeatedly stated that company taxes cannot be recovered from its managers convicted under Article 199 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 451 above).

There was now a clear global consensus, including judgments from the highest courts in Switzerland and Cyprus, that the applicants’ prosecution was politically motivated. Finally, the Court’s approach to Article 18 in Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) was inconsistent with the Convention case-law. The travaux préparatoires for Article 18 indicated that the drafters of this provision were concerned to ensure thereby that an individual was protected from the imposition of restrictions arising from a desire of the State to protect itself according “to the political tendency which it represents” and the desire of the State to act “against an opposition which it considers dangerous”."

Such recognition is apparent from the Court’s approach to Article 14, which like Article 18, has no autonomous place in the Convention but has a particular character in the case-law (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 57325/00, § 186, 13 November 2007).

In Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) the complaint under Article 18 was examined in conjunction with Article 5 of the Convention and related to the first applicant’s detention on remand during the first months of the investigation. In Yukos the Article 18 complaint was examined in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and related to the tax proceedings against the company and the ensuing enforcement proceedings. In the present case the applicants invoke Article 18 on account of a different set of facts; these facts are connected with the previous examined cases but are, nevertheless, distinguishable from them. Therefore, this complaint is not the same as that previously examined and the Court may continue examination of it. Nevertheless, the Court cannot ignore its own findings in Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) and Yukos and will take them into account when assessing the parties’ arguments in the present case."

That assumption is rebuttable in theory, but it is difficult to overcome in practice: the applicant alleging that his rights and freedoms were limited for an improper reason must convincingly show that the real aim of the authorities was not the same as that proclaimed (or as can be reasonably inferred from the context). Thus, the Court has to apply a very exacting standard of proof to such allegations. The Court was satisfied that such standard was met only in few cases, such as Gusinskiy v. Russia (no. 70276/01, § 73–78, ECHR 2004); Cebotari v. Moldova (no. 35615/06, §§ 46 et seq., 13 November 2007); or Lutsenko v.

It confirms its position in Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) that the applicant alleging bad faith of the authorities must “convincingly show” that their actions were driven by improper motives. Thus, the standard of proof in such cases is high. Otherwise the Court would have to find violations in every high-profile case where the applicant’s status, wealth, reputation, etc. gives rise to a suspicion that the driving force behind his or her prosecution was improper. Such prosecutions as those, for example, at the heart of the case of Streletz, Kessler and Krenz, cited above, would then become impossible. This is definitely not the result which the drafters of that provision sought to achieve.

Indeed, in some cases applicants have been successful in convincing the Court that a particular action of the authorities (such as arrest or detention, for instance) was driven by improper motives. Examples of such situations can be found in Khodorskovkiy (no.1), § 142, and in Gusinskiy, cited above, §§ 76-77 (see also the Court’s findings under Article 34 of the Convention below). In Lutsenko, also cited above, § 108, the Court held as follows:",
                "“The circumstances of the present case suggest ... that the applicant’s arrest and detention, which were ordered after the investigation against the applicant had been completed, had their own distinguishable features which allow the Court to look into the matter separately from the more general context of politically motivated prosecution of the opposition leader. In the present case, the Court has already established that the grounds advanced by the authorities for the deprivation of the applicant’s liberty were not only incompatible with the requirements of Article 5 § 1 but were also against the spirit of the Convention ...”"

[had been] ab initio misused, that from the beginning to the end the authorities [had been] acting with bad faith and in blatant disregard of the Convention” ( Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), § 260). In essence, the applicants tried to persuade the Court that everything in their case was contrary to the Convention, and that their conviction was therefore invalid. That allegation is a very serious one; it assails the general presumption of good faith on the part of the public authorities and consequently requires particularly weighty evidence in support."

On the other hand, the Court cannot agree with the applicants’ sweeping claim that their whole case was a travesty of justice. In the final reckoning, none of the accusations against them concerned their political activities stricto sensu, even remotely. The applicants were not opposition leaders or public officials. The acts imputed to them were not related to their participation in the political life, real or imaginary – they were prosecuted for common criminal offences, such as tax evasion, fraud, etc."

However, it is insufficient to conclude that the applicants would not have been convicted otherwise. Elements of “improper motivation” which may exist in the present case do not make the applicants’ prosecution illegitimate “from the beginning to the end”: the fact remains that the accusations against the applicants were serious, that the case against them had a “healthy core”, and that even if there was a mixed intent behind their prosecution, this did not grant them immunity from answering the accusations.

Article 53 of the CCrP provided that an advocate must be formally admitted to act in the proceedings by the official in charge of the case. Although Ms Mikhaylova had the status of an advocate, she was not on the list of lawyers admitted to participate in that particular criminal case.

The Court notes that the second applicant’s claim in respect of pecuniary damage is based on the understanding that his conviction was entirely baseless and that it was the sole cause of his loss of earnings. The Court is not persuaded by this argument. Although the Court found several violations of the second applicant’s rights under Articles 3, 6 and 8 in the present case, the loss of his earnings can be attributed to many other factors, primarily to the tax proceedings involving Yukos, which eventually led to its bankruptcy and liquidation. The second applicant’s detention throughout 2004 and 2005 undoubtedly played some part in those proceedings. However, the Court does not need to speculate in this respect. It observes that the link between the violations found in the present case and the loss of the second applicant’s earnings, if any, is too remote and uncertain. The Court concludes that the second applicant’s claims for pecuniary damages are unjustified and must be rejected."

On the contrary, those statements had just confirmed a series of unequivocal elements which had been listed in the indictment and which would have been sufficient on their own to consider the commission of the fraud plausible on a logical level. The phone calls between the first applicant and G. on the days prior to the car accident of 28 September 2011 had not only confirmed, beyond reasonable doubt, G. ’ s statement incriminating the first applicant, but had also shown that the car accident that had occurred two years earlier (on 18 October 2009) between the first and second applicants had not been a matter of pure chance. This was so, a fortiori in light of the fact that an alternative explanation (which not even the first applicant had attempted to provide) would have been completely implausible. It was not credible that the first applicant had been involved in two car accidents with people with whom he was already acquainted, involving his relatives and causing the same injuries, and in the same street in San Marino. Moreover, the numerous phone calls between the first and second applicants had confirmed the existence of a well-established relationship, albeit also a professional one, between the two accused.

However, that competence went beyond that provided in Article 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning revision proceedings (see paragraph 59 above), and thus such competence had no basis in law (contrary, for example, to the new constitutional remedy in Turkey examined in Hasan Uzun v. Turkey (dec.), no. 10755/13, §§ 68 ‑ 71, 30 April 2013). Moreover, the 2016 judgment was not accessible since San Marino did not have a system of published judgments (except for constitutional cases), thus making it difficult for individuals to learn about a new remedy created by case-law as opposed to codified law. Similarly, the decision of the Judge of Extraordinary Remedies, in the first applicant ’ s case, to apply a six months ’ time-limit also had no legal basis. Indeed that judge had only chosen to apply the same time-limit used by the Court, but he could also have applied that relevant to revision proceedings namely a year (see paragraph 60 above) or that of any other human rights organ. Thus, even the rules regulating the remedy were uncertain. In this connection the first applicant referred to Williams v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 32567/06, 17 February 2009). The first applicant pointed out that pursuing an uncertain remedy could lead to having a case rejected by the Court for failure to abide by the six-month limit. He relied on Rezgui v.

Indeed, according to the second applicant, no further evidence had corroborated the charges against him, given that the above-mentioned phone records did not refer to the car accident of 18 October 2009 in respect of which he had been charged, but exclusively to the one of 28 September 2011. Moreover, L. ’ s statements had not even been verified.

In their opinion, there had been a good reason for the first ‑ instance judge ’ s decision not to cross-examine G. and L. at the trial and, consequently, for the fact that the domestic courts had relied on the statements that they had made during the investigation (not in adversarial proceedings), namely, the necessity to safeguard G. and L. ’ s own right of defence.

Therefore, they had a personal interest in the outcome of the proceedings and, in accordance with the privilege against self ‑ incrimination they were not obliged to make statements that might be detrimental to their personal position, nor were they obliged to participate in the trial.

Expounding on the interplay of the second and third steps, the Grand Chamber highlighted the importance of sufficient counterbalancing factors not only in cases in which the absent witness ’ s testimony was the sole or the decisive basis for the conviction, but also in those cases where, in the domestic courts ’ assessment, that evidence, without clearly reaching the threshold of “sole or decisive”, carried significant weight and its admission may have handicapped the defence (ibid., § 116, and Seton v. the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, § 59, 31 March 2016 )."

In the Court ’ s view once a co-accused or other accomplice makes statements incriminating another person (i.e. the accused), the former inevitably becomes “a witness against him” and should expect to be confronted by the accused as well as to be compelled to appear at trial for such purpose. Indeed, the absence under national legislation of any means to ensure the attendance of the accusers (charged with the same crime), for the purposes of examination, can be considered inadequate and can contribute to a finding of a violation of the rights of the accused (see, for example, Mild and Virtanen, cited above, §§ 46-48). However, the Court emphasises that the status of “witness” given to a co-accused or an alleged accomplice (tried separately) does not detract from their own rights as accused persons or criminal suspects, including that of the privilege against self ‑ incrimination (see, by implication, Cabral, cited above § 34).

No further steps were taken by the domestic authorities to have G. and L. cross ‑ examined as witnesses. The applicants ’ request to reopen the investigation in order to cross-examine them was refused (see paragraph 39 above). Thus, the Court is of the view that the domestic courts did not make any significant efforts to hear G. and L. in adversarial proceedings. While it is true that there is no suggestion that L. and G. were absent witnesses in the sense that they were dead, sick, or unreachable (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 119), they were absent witnesses in so far as they did not attend the trial in person while their untested evidence was admitted for use by the trial courts."

The Judge of Criminal Appeals confirmed that the investigating judge had legitimately questioned L. and G. without the presence of the applicants ’ defence and that their statements had been correctly admitted as evidence and used in the first ‑ instance judgment, given that the Code of Criminal Procedure did not contain any rules on the admissibility of evidence (see paragraph 49 above)."

This is even more so where the co ‑ accused, whose statements were being used, had admitted to the charges and not retracted their testimony via counsel present at the hearing, and thus had no apparent reason to remain silent at trial. Indeed, in the present case, precisely on the basis of their confession, the two witnesses had asked the court to take account of mitigating circumstances in sentencing them (see paragraph 36 above). It follows, that in the circumstances of the present case there was no good reason for not securing the attendance of the witnesses at the trial.

As to the strength of the additional incriminating evidence available in the present case, the Court will first take into account the evidence in relation to the first accident.

Nor did the courts, anywhere in their judgment as regards G. ’ s testimony or in the appropriate context as regards L. ’ s testimony, (i) take any account of the fact that G. and L. ’ s statements had not been consistent, namely that they had first denied all the charges against them and then later admitted to them (see Dimović, cited above, § 46); (ii) make any observation as to whether the witnesses had given detailed and coherent descriptions of the circumstances of the offence; (iii) take into consideration the fact that the witnesses had, without good reason, not made themselves available for cross-examination (see, a contrario and mutatis mutandis, Schatschaschwili, cited above, §§ 148-49); or (iv) assess the reliability of L. ’ s testimony in the light of the fact that it had been given to obtain the advantages offered to her in exchange. Thus, the Court considers that the manner in which the domestic courts examined L. and G. ’ s credibility, and the reliability of their statements, was insufficient."

It is vital for the determination of the fairness of the trial as a whole to ascertain whether the authorities, at the time of the witness hearing at the investigation stage, proceeded on the assumption that the witness would not be heard at the trial. Where the investigating authorities took the reasonable view that the witness concerned would not be examined at the hearing of the trial court, it is essential for the defence to have been given an opportunity to put questions to the witness at the investigation stage (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, §§ 156-57)."

She thus refused the applicants ’ request to cross ‑ examine G. and L. at the investigation stage and did not include G. and L. in the list of witnesses to be heard at the trial (see paragraph 26 above).

As to the claim for EUR 25,000, the Government noted that it appeared to be a duplication of the claim for damages, since the first applicant had already requested EUR 100,000 on that same account.

In a leading judgment of 25 July 2000 (published in the official reports, BGHSt, volume 46, p. 96 et seq. ) the Federal Court of Justice held that section 141 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure required, in view of Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention, the appointment of counsel for an unrepresented accused if the key witness for the prosecution was to testify before an investigating judge and the accused was excluded from this hearing. The failure to appoint counsel prior to the hearing before the investigating judge did not exclude the latter ’ s testimony about the witnesses ’ statements as long as the proceedings, seen as a whole, remained fair. To this end the investigating judge ’ s testimony had to be carefully assessed. A conviction could only be based on the investigating judge ’ s testimony if this testimony was corroborated by other important considerations."

In line with the related principles developed in the Federal Court of Justice ’ s case-law referring to Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention, the Regional Court had pointed out that the evidentiary value of the investigating judge ’ s testimony was reduced because of the applicant ’ s inability to question the main witnesses. Consequently, it had not based its findings of fact solely on the witnesses ’ testimonies as introduced by the investigating judge but had taken other significant evidence into account. For instance, the court had made reference to the applicant ’ s account of the events following the assault on the morning of 3 September 2003 and the witnesses ’ spontaneous statements made vis-à-vis the police officer who had recorded the criminal charges brought against the applicant on 26 November 2003 as well as the applicant ’ s mother ’ s enquiry of 3 December 2003 regarding the further steps taken by the police as a result of the criminal complaint.

Article 6 § 3 (d) enshrines the principle that, before an accused can be convicted, all evidence against him must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. The underlying principle is that the defendant in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of proceedings (see Lucà v. Italy, no. 33354/96, § 39, ECHR 2001 ‑ II and Solakov v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, no. 47023/99, § 57, ECHR 2001 ‑ X)."

In any event, paragraph 1 of Article 6 taken together with paragraph 3 requires the Contracting States to take positive steps, in particular to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him. Such measures form part of the diligence which the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see D. v. Finland, no. 30542/04, § 41, 7 July 2009 and Sadak and Others v. Turkey, nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, § 67, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII )."

In the instant case the only available eye witnesses of the events in issue were the applicant ’ s mother, brother and sister (the applicant ’ s father having refrained from participating in the proceedings, see above §§ 7 and 12) who all refused to give evidence at the trial, as they were entitled to in their capacity as family members of the accused pursuant to section 52 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure. They could thus neither be heard by the trial court nor were the prosecution or the defence able to examine them during trial. The Court recalls in this context that provisions granting family members of the accused the right not to testify as witnesses in court with a view to avoiding their being put in a moral dilemma can be found in the domestic law of several member States of the Council of Europe and are, as such, not incompatible with Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention (see Unterpertinger v.

Furthermore, as concerns the fact that the Regional Court heard the investigating judge who gave an account of the witnesses ’ pre-trial statements of 8 December 2003, the Court reiterates that the use in evidence of statements obtained at the investigative stage is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 3 (d) and 1 of Article 6, provided the defendant has been given an adequate opportunity to challenge the statements, either when made or at a later stage ( see, among other authorities, Isgrò v. Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, § 34, Series A no. 194 ‑ A; Lucà, cited above, § 40 and Gossa v. Poland, no. 47986/99, § 54, 9 January 2007 ). This implies that the use made of evidence admitted by the trial court must comply with the rights of the defence, in particular, where the accused has not had an opportunity at any stage in the earlier proceedings to question the persons whose statements are introduced into the trial (see, mutatis mutandis, Unterpertinger, cited above, § 31) and where they form the sole or decisive evidence for a conviction or related decision by the trial court ( see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 119). The Court has held in this context that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence may be restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (the so -called “sole or decisive rule”; ibid .)."

It is further not contested by the Government that the Public Prosecutor had failed to request the appointment of counsel prior to the witnesses ’ hearing before the investigating judge in accordance with domestic law as construed by the Federal Court of Justice and that it thus had been imputable to the national authorities that defence counsel did not have an opportunity to examine the witnesses at the pre-trial stage."

As regards the significance of the untested evidence for the trial, the Court accepts the Government ’ s submissions that the witnesses ’ pre-trial statements of 8 December 2003, as introduced to the proceedings by the investigating judge ’ s testimony, were not the only evidence before the Regional Court. The court also referred, inter alia, to the witnesses ’ statements made prior to their formal testimonies vis-à-vis the police officer who had recorded the criminal charges brought against the applicant on 26 November 2003 as well as the applicant ’ s mother ’ s enquiry of 3 December 2003 regarding the further steps taken by the police as a result of the criminal complaint. It further had regard to the injuries sustained by the applicant ’ s brother, the submissions of the doctor who had treated the applicant ’ s brother ’ s wounds and the corpus delicti handed over to the police by the latter. The Court notes, however, that such corroborating evidence was either hearsay itself or circumstantial and appears to have even increased the Regional Court ’ s reliance on the statements of the witnesses whom the applicant could not examine. As regards the applicant ’ s recollection of the events following the assault, the Court notes that this could at best provide indirect support for the claim that the applicant had attacked his sister and brother.",
                "It follows that the only evidence conclusively demonstrating that the applicant had committed the assault was the witnesses ’ pre-trial statements. In its judgment of 28 February 2005, the Regional Court in fact emphasised that its establishment of facts was not only based on the testimony by the investigating judge but also on three consistent witness statements that gave a coherent account of the events in issue and were credible. It thus appears that the Regional Court ’ s finding relied, at least to a significant extent, on the hearsay testimony of the only direct witnesses of the events in issue and whom neither the defence nor the trial court had an opportunity to examine. It was obviously evidence of great weight and the Court therefore concludes that the witness statements made by the applicant ’ s mother, brother and sister at the pre-trial stage were decisive for the trial court ’ s decision-making (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 131)."

The Court has emphasised in its recent case-law that, where a hearsay statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission at trial will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 § 1. At the same time the Court found that where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, it must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance in the case (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 147). The Court observes that similar considerations are reflected in the Regional Court ’ s judgment of 28 February 2005 stating, with reference to the Federal Court of Justice ’ s related case-law, that since neither the accused nor counsel had been able to examine the witnesses against the accused, the trial court was requested to assess the investigating judge ’ s testimony particularly critically and could only base its decision on such testimony if the latter was corroborated by other significant factors."

The Government further pointed out that the applicant as well as counsel had been in a position to observe the demeanour of the investigative judge as well as the aforementioned police officers and doctor when they had testified in court and had the opportunity to question these witnesses. In the Government ’ s view they had thus had the possibility to form their own impression of the latter ’ s credibility.

It notes, for instance, that the applicant ’ s brother, mother and sister pressed criminal charges against the applicant on 26 November 2003, almost three months after the incident had occurred. It is therefore questionable whether any statements made on that date or thereafter vis-à-vis the police officer can still be considered as being made spontaneously as assumed by the trial court. It is further not surprising that after such a considerable period of time the witnesses, having had ample opportunity to compare their recollection of the events, gave similar and coherent accounts of the alleged assault during their examination by the investigating judge. As regards the injuries sustained by the applicant ’ s brother, the Court notes that the latter himself had adduced vis-à-vis the doctor who had treated him in hospital on 2 September 2003 and who had subsequently testified at the applicant ’ s trial, that he had fallen through a glass pane. While this doctor, when examined at trial, expressed doubts as to the explanation given for the injuries, there is nothing in his testimony to establish that the injuries could in principle not have been caused by such an accident or that they had actually been caused by the axe that constituted the alleged corpus delicti. The Court further cannot but take note of the fact that even though the sister had undisputedly accompanied her brother to the hospital, she had not been examined by a doctor and no circumstantial evidence exists for any injuries, such as strangulation marks, sustained by her."

While the Court accepts the Government ’ s submissions that the applicant as well as counsel had been in a position to observe the demeanour of the investigative judge as well as the aforementioned police officers and doctor when testifying in court, it nevertheless is of the opinion that such possibility does not compensate for the lack of opportunity to test the truthfulness and reliability of the decisive evidence in the case at hand, namely the witnesses ’ statements at the pre-trial stage.",

                "109. The Court also reiterates that the term “witnesses” under Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention has an autonomous meaning which also includes expert witnesses. However, the role of an expert witness can be distinguished from that of an eyewitness, who must give to the court his personal recollection of a particular event. In analysing whether the appearance in person of an expert at the trial was necessary, the Court will therefore be primarily guided by the principles enshrined in the concept of a “fair trial” under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, and in particular by the guarantees of “adversarial proceedings” and “equality of arms”. That being said, some of the Court ’ s approaches to the examination in person of “witnesses” under Article 6 § 3 (d) are no doubt relevant in the context of the examination of expert evidence, and may be applied, mutatis mutandis, with due regard to the difference in their status and role (see Avagyan v. Armenia, no. 1837/10, § 40, 22 November 2018, and Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia (no. 2), cited above § 476 )."

Furthermore, as is also apparent from Russian law (ibid.) and is evidenced by the applicant ’ s case, the FSB continues to monitor people with security clearance and their compliance with the obligation not to disclose State secrets. The Court considers that having security clearance does not automatically imply the lack of impartiality. However, taking into account that the applicant had been indicted by the FSB for treason for having disclosed a State secret, his fear that jurors with security clearance might, at least to some extent, be influenced by partial considerations, appears sufficiently serious to have warranted a concrete examination by the presiding judge."

As possession of security clearance is not one of the grounds which generally disqualify somebody from jury service under Russian law (see paragraphs 64 - 65 above), the judge considered that the fact that some jurors had security clearance could not affect their impartiality (see paragraphs 35, 56 and 89 above). Consequently, the Court finds that the applicant ’ s objections to jurors with security clearance participating in his particular case, a case which concerned the alleged disclosure of a State secret, were dismissed in general terms without considering the nature and the subject matter of the trial and on purely formal grounds; those grounds were that the applicable legislation did not provide for security clearance being a reason to generally disqualify somebody from jury service. Thus, the national courts failed to take sufficient steps to check that the trial court had been established as an impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention and did not offer sufficient guarantees to dispel any doubts in this regard (see, by contrast, Gregory v. the United Kingdom, 25 February 1997, §§ 48-49, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I)."

However, the role of an expert witness can be distinguished from that of an eyewitness, who must give to the court his personal recollection of a particular event. In analysing whether the appearance in person of an expert at the trial was necessary, the Court will therefore be primarily guided by the principles enshrined in the concept of a “fair trial” under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, and in particular by the guarantees of “adversarial proceedings” and “equality of arms”. That being said, some of the Court ’ s approaches to the examination in person of “witnesses” under Article 6 § 3 (d) are no doubt relevant in the context of the examination of expert evidence, and may be applied, mutatis mutandis, with due regard to the difference in their status and role (see Avagyan v.

Belgium, 22 April 1992, § 33, Series A no. 235 ‑ B; Avagyan, cited above, § 41; Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev (no. 2), cited above, § 478)."

His application was not particularly detailed, and only referred to his rights under Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention (see paragraph 37 above). The trial court held that it was not necessary to question the experts at the hearing, because their reports were clear and the court did not require any clarification or additional information from them (see paragraph 39 above). In his appeal, the applicant asserted that it had been necessary to cross-examine the expert witnesses before the court, in order to demonstrate that they had little or no expertise in the relevant fields of physics (see paragraphs 45 - 49 above) and then challenge their conclusions, especially those regarding the issue of whether the information had constituted a State secret. The appeal court dismissed that argument, generally asserting that the experts had the proper expertise and referring to the need for an expert assessment to determine whether the information had constituted a State secret (see paragraph 56 above). The Court thus finds that the applicant clearly indicated to the national courts that he wished to have the expert witnesses examined before the court in order to challenge their credibility and conclusions (see, mutatis mutandis, Hanu v.

The appeal court noted that the nature of the information ( its constituting a State secret) formed one of the two essential elements of the offence of treason by disclosure of a State secret, the offence of which the applicant was accused. Furthermore, it held that that matter was a legal one, and thus not one for the jury to determine. Lastly, under Russian law, the justification for categorising information as a State secret could be determined only by experts (see paragraphs 56 and 61 above).

There is also nothing to show that the applicant had other opportunities to confront those expert witnesses and challenge their credibility and conclusions during the investigation stage (see, by contrast, Kashlev v.

Furthermore, according to the applicant ’ s submissions, which were not denied by the Government, the experts had no relevant or sufficient expertise in the relevant area of physics (see paragraphs 45 - 49 above). Lastly, on several occasions the applicant attempted to bring to the national courts ’ attention the alternative opinions of leading scientists who supported his position that the information divulged did not contain any State secrets (see paragraphs 15 and 44 above).

The applicant made an application for an inquiry into PK ’ s sources arguing that his trial would be unfair if he did not know these sources and the evidence against him ( Rowe and Davis v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28901/95, ECHR 2000 - II). The prosecution, which had no access to the confidential source material, opposed the applicant ’ s request on the basis of the principle of informer privilege. Reviewing this Court ’ s case-law ( inter alia, Edwards and Lewis v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39647/98 and 40461/98, ECHR 2004 - X), the SCC found that, while it was unthinkable that information that would threaten lives or State security would be disclosed, the admission of PK ’ s evidence without any inquiry into its basis would unfairly balance the trial in favour of the prosecution. The accused, it held, was entitled to some enquiry into the basis of PK ’ s belief in order to reconcile an order for privilege with defence rights. The SCC, therefore, directed the Chief Superintendent to produce all relevant documentation which, he asserted, informed him that the accused were members of the IRA. In compliance with the direction, files relating to both the applicant and his co-accused and covering a lengthy period prior to 10 October 2002 were produced to the trial court, but not disclosed to the prosecution or to the defence. The Court conducted a review of those files considering this to be the most appropriate solution in the interests of justice. Its competence to do so had been considered and confirmed previously by the Supreme Court and, as such, it was authorised by domestic law ( DPP v Ward [1999] 1 I.R. 60)."

Following the review of PK ’ s files, the SCC was satisfied that PK had “adequate and reliable information” on which he could legitimately form the opinion that each accused was a member of the IRA. It found that there was nothing in the files that would assist the defence in proving the innocence of their clients. Later, in weighing PK ’ s evidence, the SCC confirmed that it had excluded any information to which it had become privy during its review of the files he had produced to the court. The SCC also noted that the demeanour of PK was such that the court was persuaded that he was an “honest and reliable” witness. He had 25 years ’ service as a police officer most of which was devoted to combating subversion and, as the head of the Special Detective Unit (concerned with the State security and monitoring subversive organisations), PK was the person best placed to learn of the activities of the accused. It was difficult to imagine anyone better informed on the subject in the country. The SCC was persuaded beyond any doubt by the belief evidence of PK that the accused were members of the IRA as charged. Moreover, the trial court was satisfied that PK had formed that belief ever before the ‘ Corke Abbey ’ events of 10 October 2002 or any matters discovered following the arrest of five persons on that occasion. The SCC totally rejected a suggestion put to the Chief Superintendent PK, in cross-examination that his evidence was a fiction."

Police officers gave detailed evidence about the events and the suspicious activities in Corke Abbey on the night of 10 October 2002 and about the items that had been found following a search of the vehicles involved (see paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 above)."

The SCC was satisfied beyond any doubt that this packaging and receipt matched the torch found in the Transit van. It was further satisfied that the dark green Nissan Micra observed by the police at Corke Abbey was the property of Ms K, the partner of the applicant, and that he, the applicant, had had control of the motor vehicle on the evening in question. His partner had testified that she had given the keys of her Nissan Micra to the applicant around 8pm on 10 October 2002; that neither he nor the car was back when she returned home later that night; and that when she awoke the next morning both he and the car were back at the house they shared. The trial court had no doubt that the applicant was either one of the male drivers of the Nissan Micra at Corke Abbey or that he was aware of and acquiesced in the use to which it was being put. It was also satisfied, having heard abundant evidence which included sightings of the applicant and his co-accused together in the middle of the night when the applicant ’ s home was being searched, that they were ‘ well known ’ to each other."

On the one hand, there was a piece of paper containing the drawing of a key and a telephone number which the court accepted was that of MB, the owner of the Nissan Almera with the false number plates. They also found a piece of paper with the telephone number of PB whom the Court had no doubt was the person found to be driving the Ford Transit van on the night of the 10 October 2002. During an earlier search of the co-accused ’ s home, police had found documents which contained notes of the actions and movements of a number of elected politicians from different political parties plus documents recording the names and addresses of persons involved in serious crime and documents noting the names of persons linked to the Irish National Liberation Army (“INLA”), another unlawful organisation ( paragraph 3 9 below). A thumb print on black tape found in the Almera was accepted as being that of the co-accused. The trial court accepted that the documentation established that the applicant was, at the very least, acquainted with the driver of the Transit van (PB) and the owner of the Nissan Almera (MB).

It was accepted by the defence that each accused was afforded all the rights and privileges to which they were legally entitled during their detention and, in particular, that each of them had full access to legal advice. The court noted that each availed of the opportunity to consult a solicitor before and in the course of several police interviews. The video-recordings of the interviews were shown to the trial court. It noted that, not only did each remain totally silent during the course of interview, but each appeared to take no ostensible interest whatsoever in what was going on. They sat bolt upright showing remarkable self-control throughout, in that their only movement was an occasional blink of the eyes but they made no effort to engage with the interviewers. It was clear to the court that each was deliberately and offensively ignoring all that was being asked of them. The court was satisfied that not only were the relevant statutory provisions invoked and adequately explained to each accused but each was given an opportunity to protest in the event that he had not understood that explanation, an opportunity which was ignored. Each question material to the charge was met with a stony silence. For example, each accused was asked to affirm or deny that he was a member of the IRA. Each was asked whether he knew the men arrested at Corke Abbey on the night of 10 October 2002, it being clear that each knew one or more of them. Each was asked to explain why they kept the documentation found when their houses were searched and each was asked whether they had any involvement with the aforesaid events. The applicant, in particular, was specifically asked about his use of his partner ’ s car on the night of 10 October 2002 and to explain how it had been seen at Corke Abbey on that night, it being the evidence of his partner that he had been in possession of the car."

In those circumstances, the court had ‘ no doubt ’ that, as provided for by section 2 of the 1998 Act, it was entitled to and did, in fact, draw the inference from the failure of each accused to answer those questions that each had a guilty conscience insofar as the allegation of membership of an unlawful organisation was concerned. The court was satisfied that their silence amounted to corroboration of the belief evidence given by Chief Superintendent PK. As the court did not doubt the evidence of PK that he believed each was a member of the IRA and as the court was satisfied that the failure of each to answer material questions during police interviews was corroborative of that evidence, it was persuaded beyond all reasonable doubt that each of the accused was guilty of charged."

It was satisfied that a restriction on the ability to cross-examine the Chief Superintendent, arising from his claim of privilege in respect of the underlying sources of information upon which his belief was based because of a threat to life or to the on-going security of the State, did not ipso facto constitute a breach of Article 38 of the Constitution or of Article 6 of the Convention. The Supreme Court in DPP v. Kelly ([2006] IESC 20) had found this limitation necessary and properly counterbalanced by matters not dissimilar to those arising in the present case. The belief of Chief Superintendent PK was simply admitted as being evidence, no more and no less, and this was already well established in the prior jurisprudence. Such a witness could be cross-examined but he was entitled to claim privilege in respect of underlying facts or sources which led to his belief that disclosure of same could cause a credible threat to life or to state security. By ruling that it would not convict without evidence that supported or corroborated that belief, the trial court had clearly recognised the disadvantage to the defence which flowed from the claim of privilege and it had correctly sought evidence corroborative of PK ’ s belief. The exercise of the trial court ’ s discretion to review the files furnished by the Chief Superintendent PK did not infringe the right to a fair trial. It found no evidence that would have assisted the accused and the material examined constituted a good basis for the belief of the Chief Superintendent. The trial court had confirmed that, if it had found otherwise, this would have led to a different outcome."

It was not at all clear from the Convention case-law that any of the judgments relied upon by counsel in this case dealt with the issue of a claim to privilege based on a threat to life or to the on-going security of the State. In the applicant ’ s case, the CCA held that there was no reason to conclude that anything found in the material examined by the trial court was influential on that court in making its judgment, let alone inspiring anything determinative of the guilt of either accused. A statement to the contrary was explicitly made by the trial court and was to be found in the judgment itself. Nor could any of this material, had it been disclosed to the defence, have been considered to be in any way of assistance in establishing the innocence of the accused.

The facts upon which the trial court relied were all proven beyond reasonable doubt and, indeed, the trial court had noted that there had been no serious challenge to the prosecution evidence of the facts, connections and associations so found. The trial court was fully entitled to have found that the applicant was associated with the events at Corke Abbey and its conclusion, in the circumstances, was a safe and valid one. Insofar as the appellants had complained about the trial court ’ s comment on the demeanour of each accused during police interviews, the CCA considered that their objection, against a background of a total failure to answer any question at all, was rather surreal. The evidence established a complete and utter failure to answer any question at all and the trial court made a finding on that failure. That court ’ s entitlement to draw inferences arose, precisely, from that failure. In the circumstances, the inferences were correctly and validly drawn.

When considered with his evidence, all the matters taken together were sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that both appellants were members of the IRA on the date in question. The trial court was entitled to look at the established facts, when taken together, and also when taken in conjunction with the inferences which it had properly drawn to see whether these supported or corroborated the belief evidence of the Chief Superintendent.

Instead this Court ’ s role is to ascertain whether the decision-making procedure or process which was applied did comply, as far as possible, with the requirements of adversarial proceedings; (c) in the Rowe cases there was a failure by the prosecution to lay the evidence in question before the trial judge to permit him to rule on the question of disclosure and this deprived the applicant of a fair trial; and (d) the particular facts in that case differentiated it from the case of Edwards v. the United Kingdom (16 December 1992, Series A no. 247 B). Referring to Jasper v. the United Kingdom ( [GC], no. 27052/95, 16 February 2000 ), in which these principles were repeated, the CCA noted that this Court had recognised that the trial judge held a supervisory role in determining the balance between the competing rights of the defence and of public interest immunity.

The CCA rejected the submission that the trial court ’ s approach involved a review of material which was determinative of guilt. Rather, the judges were considering whether PK ’ s evidence should be admitted without cross-examination as to its source in circumstances where privilege, based on the safety of the life of others, had been invoked. In weighing up the value of that belief evidence, the trial judges had had no regard at all to the documentary source material. There was no requirement to disclose documents which did not damage the prosecution or assist the defence and it was clear from the SCC ’ s review that there were no such documents: if the SCC had found documents of assistance to the applicant, its answer would have been different. Moreover, the undisclosed documents were demonstrably not determinative as the applicant had suggested and the trial court had explicitly stated this to be so in its judgment. Finally, the CCA noted that the applicant had not sought to have the appeal court examine or consider the Chief Superintendent ’ s documentation in order to ascertain whether the trial judges had misdirected themselves in respect of the documents or the material contained therein.",

The SCC was itself established to avoid the mischief of juror coercion and intimidation. In relation to all anti-terrorist offences, as a matter of common sense, there would be equal apprehension about the intimidation of witnesses. It held that it was a reasonable inference to draw that section 3(2) of the 1972 Act was enacted out of bitter experience. A limitation on cross-examination was permitted by the statutory provision.

Such organisations threatened, intimidated and endangered the lives of informers. It followed that it would be extremely difficult to produce direct evidence capable of sustaining a prosecution. Intimidation of possible witnesses, and worse, was to be presumed. Where the police had secret intelligence, they would have been unable to produce informants without compromising them. Hence the need for the type of evidence permitted under section 3(2) of the 1972 Act. Parliament had chosen to designate a person holding the rank of Chief Superintendent as a witness whose belief might be accepted as evidence. Whether or not an accused person was a member of an unlawful organisation was a question of fact and the Chief Superintendent gave evidence, not of fact, but of belief.

It reviewed case-law of the Irish, American and British courts as well as of this Court and found that the essential question was whether the undisputed restriction on the right of the accused to cross-examine his accusers and to have access to the materials relied upon by the prosecution, had been unduly restricted to the extent that it rendered his trial unfair."

The privilege granted was a clear infringement of the normal right of the accused to have access to the material which underlay the belief expressed and, to that extent, constituted a restriction on the effectiveness of his right to cross-examine his true accusers. However, there were a number of compelling justifications for this course of action. In the first place, resort to belief evidence applied only in the case of organisations which, by their nature, represented a threat, not only to the institutions of the State, but to individuals who were prepared to cooperate with the State in securing the conviction of members of such organisations. Secondly, the legislature allowed such evidence to be given by police officers of particularly high rank who could be presumed to have been chosen for having high standards of integrity. Thirdly, the procedure applied only while there was in force a declaration that “the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice....” The offence was a scheduled one: thus the cases would be heard by the SCC, a court composed of judges who had to be presumed to apply only the highest standards of fairness. Any restriction on the right to cross-examine had been limited to the extent that was strictly necessary to achieve its objective."

The IRA assiduously sought out police informers: any identification usually resulted in serious ill-treatment or death. The evidence was that, while there were about 69 police officers of the rank of Chief Superintendent or higher who could give belief evidence under section 3(2), only 17 or so were experienced to give such evidence in practice. The Supreme Court also stated that a common feature of investigations into the activities of the IRA was “the presence of fear, intimidation and the threat of reprisals” so that, if section 3(2) had not existed, the police would not have succeeded in counter-acting the threat posed by the IRA.",

Unlawful organisations were cell based, secretive, and violent organisations which invested considerable resources in the enforcement of secrecy about the membership and did so through torture, death and the inevitable fear that those methods engender. “Membership” was normally a continuing state of affairs and more susceptible to belief evidence of a senior police officer, based on a variety of sources over a period of time.",

                "“The section makes the belief of a chief superintendent evidence that an accused was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation. As the cases show, it does not make that evidence conclusive or preclude it from being challenged, tested or contradicted. For present purposes, it is important however, that it is the belief of the Chief Superintendent which is evidence, and not the material upon which that belief is based. Thus, the section does not involve the giving of hearsay evidence where the relevant evidence is that of a person who is not available in court for cross- examination. Nor is it akin to the giving of evidence by an anonymous witness. Here, the relevant evidence is the belief of a Chief Superintendent, who is identified and gives his or her evidence in open court. It is to be anticipated that the belief of such a senior officer in the gardaí will be based on a variety of sources: technological, electronic, and human, including information supplied by informants. But even in cases where the evidence of the Chief Superintendent is based upon the direct statements provided to him or her by an informant or informants, the court is not asked to act upon the hearsay statements of such informants: rather it is the belief of the Chief Superintendent based upon such informants which is the evidence. The formation of that belief would normally involve the application of the Chief Superintendent of his or her experience in dealing with informants and in dealing with illegal organisations and where relevant, in assessing the significance and value of diverse pieces of information and intelligence. Accordingly, where evidence is given pursuant to s.3(2) it is not the case that the court is asked to act upon either the evidence of anonymous witnesses or witnesses who are out of court and not available for cross-examination. Accordingly, any analysis based upon Doorson and Al-Khawaja should take account of this structural distinction.”",

The Supreme Court recognised that the difficulty for the defence was not so much created by the fact that the belief of a Chief Superintendent is made admissible as evidence, but rather by the inevitable claim of privilege when asked questions in relation to the basis of his or her belief. However, it noted that informer privilege cannot be claimed as a right by any Garda witness; it must be established that circumstances give rise to a valid claim in this regard. In addition, the privilege itself is not absolute since it has always been subject to the ‘ innocence at stake ’ exception. Furthermore, the Supreme Court noted:",
                "“Even where such privilege is upheld, it does not follow that the evidence of a chief superintendent cannot be tested. The credibility of any witness is not dependent solely on the material which that witness seeks to adduce in evidence in chief. On the contrary, credibility can be challenged on any issue collateral to the particular testimony. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court expressly held in Kelly in rejecting a submission made on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the evidence of a Chief Superintendent under s.3(2) can be explored and tested in a number of ways, such as whether the belief is based upon one or more sources of information, whether in the case of a human informant the Chief Superintendent is personally aware of the identity of the informant and has dealt personally with him or her, and whether as in this case, the witness has experience in dealing with such informants and rating and analysing their evidence.”",

While the IRA observed a ceasefire, dissident groups continued to recruit, train and arm members. In recent years, members of the IRA had conducted numerous operations, including, murder, attempted murder, the use of explosives and firearms, extortion, intimidation and the execution of its own members who were believed to have cooperated with the authorities. Unlawful organisations continued to pose a threat to the security of the State and to the institutions of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Belief evidence regularly comprised one of the pillars of evidence in the prosecution of the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation. It remained an essential tool for the prosecution of such offences given that a basic tenet of dissident Republican organisations was non-cooperation with the Gardai and non-recognition of State institutions and given that these organisations carried out attacks on those suspected of having cooperated with An Garda Siochána. Given the nature, secretiveness and violent propensity of these unlawful organisations which continued to pose a threat to the State and to other sovereign nations, investigations into their activities were difficult. A repeal of section 3(2) would seriously diminish the ability of An Garda Siochána to investigate the IRA and would threaten national security."

The SCC was alive to the potential prejudice to the defence and, therefore, the judges had reviewed the documentary sources of the belief evidence. Further, when weighing the Chief Superintendent ’ s evidence in light of the evidence as a whole, the court had expressly excluded consideration of any information to which it had become privy as a result of this review. As to the applicant ’ s suggestion that the trial judges, who decided on guilt or innocence, should not have reviewed this material, the Government underlined that the process and objective of the review and of the trial itself were different. The trial court was experienced in discarding information of which it had become aware but which it should not factor into its deliberations (see the CCA at paragraph 31 above). The case of Edwards and Lewis v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 39647/98 and 40461/98, ECHR 2004 ‑ X) was distinguishable in a number of respects. The undisclosed evidence was of determinative importance to the defence in that case because, had the defence been able to prove police misconduct and entrapment, the prosecution would have had to have been discontinued. In the present case, the SCC found that there was nothing which would assist the defence and the CCA later noted that the applicant could have sought, but did not seek, to have the CCA re-examine that material in order to ascertain whether the SCC judges had misdirected themselves. Secondly, in Edwards and Lewis, the Court could not rule out the possibility that the undisclosed material had been relevant to the judge ’ s conclusion on the entrapment defence raised whereas, in the present case, the SCC expressly stated that, while weighing and considering the belief evidence, it had specifically excluded consideration of any information to which it had become privy as a result of its review of PK ’ s documentary sources. Thirdly, the trial court had added a safeguard: it had expressly stated that it would not convict on the basis of the belief evidence alone. Fourthly, the applicant was able to make submissions in advance of these procedural steps. The thorough and careful judgment of the SCC was accompanied by a rigorous appellate process and by two thoroughly and carefully reasoned judgments of the CCA.

In the present case, the Court was concerned with the overall fairness of the actual criminal proceedings in issue in the applicant ’ s trial. Likewise, its general comments regarding the operation of section 3(2) of the 1972 Act did not assist with the determination of the question before the Court. The fact that the SCC was a non-jury court was not pertinent to the question identified for determination by the Court since many Contracting Parties do not adopt a jury system. The IHRC discussion of cases of conviction on the basis of uncorroborated belief evidence was also irrelevant because, as the IHRC itself accepted, the SCC exercises a self-imposed restraint and does not convict solely on the basis of belief evidence (as in the present case)."

The intervener also provided a review of the domestic jurisprudence on section 3(2).

While the CCA had in 1975 (People ( DPP) v Ferguson, unreported CCA 27 October 1975) affirmed the conviction of an accused based on belief evidence (with the court emphasising that the failure of the accused to deny the belief significantly increased the weight to be attached to it), the practice since then showed that the SCC adopted a self-imposed restraint of not convicting solely on the basis of belief evidence and that this accorded with the judgment of the CCA in the present case."

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 § 1 ... Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities ...",

Accordingly, the questions to be addressed by the Court are threefold: (i) whether it was necessary to uphold the claim of privilege asserted by Chief Superintendent PK as regards the source of his belief; (ii) if so, whether Chief Superintendent PK ’ s evidence was the sole or decisive basis for the applicant ’ s conviction; and, (iii) if it was, whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, in place to ensure that the proceedings, when judged in their entirety, were fair within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention."

                "80. As to the necessity for upholding the claim of privilege asserted by PK, the Court recalls that the public and victims have a strong interest in ensuring that organised and subversive crime is prosecuted. However, the interests of informers courageous enough to provide information must also be taken into account and allowing police informers to provide information anonymously is a vital tool in prosecuting, in particular, organised and subversive crime ( Saïdi v. France, 20 September 1993, § 44, Series A no. 261-C; Doorson v. the Netherlands, cited above, § 70; Dzelili v. Germany (dec.), no. 15065/05, 29 September 2009; and Ellis and Simms v. the United Kingdom, cited above)."

                "81. The applicant did not challenge, either before the domestic courts or this Court, PK ’ s view that disclosure of his sources would endanger persons and State security. The Court notes the domestic courts ’ description of the unlawful organisation in question, the IRA: it was a secretive and violent organisation, one which assiduously sought out and punished police informers through torture and death and one which relied on the inevitable fear of testifying which those methods engendered (paragraphs 4 6, 4 7, 4 9, 50 and 53 above). The admission of belief evidence, combined with the inevitable grant of privilege for the sources of that belief (paragraphs 4 8 and 5 4 ), also provides a crucial tool to overcome the evidential difficulties in prosecuting this particular kind of charge. A charge of “membership” of such an organisation requires evidence drawn from intelligence necessarily gathered from numerous and varied sources (human and documentary) and over some time. The Court considers these justifications for the grant of privilege - effective protection of persons and State security as well as effective prosecution of serious and complex crime - to be compelling and substantiated."

As to whether the evidence of Chief Superintendent PK was the sole or decisive basis for the applicant ’ s conviction, the Court notes that the SCC expressly stated that it would not convict the applicant on the basis of his evidence alone. In addition to his evidence, the trial court heard over 50 other prosecution witnesses. It also examined what it regarded as ‘ significant ’ other material evidence and it identified therefrom three further strands of corroborative evidence against the applicant."

            [
                "83. The second and third strands of evidence concerned the applicant ’ s connection to the main factual event namely, the suspicious activities in Corke Abbey on 10 October 2002. The trial court found that there was clear evidence associating each accused with the other and with the activities in Corke Abbey. In particular, it had had “no doubt” that the applicant, if not an actual participant, was well aware of and acquiesced in those activities. He was linked to those events in three ways: his partner ’ s Nissan Micra present in Corke Abbey had been entrusted by her to him just before the Corke Abbey events; that car had been observed by the police at Corke Abbey with five male occupants and, if the applicant was not amongst the five, then the movements of the car were at least within his knowledge or acquiescence; a Rayovac torch was found in the van and the wrapping (matching that usually found on such a torch) as well as a receipt for the purchase of such a torch was found in the Nissan Micra. A piece of paper also found after a search of the applicant ’ s home, the third strand of evidence, contained the phone number of the owner of the Nissan Almera and of the man in the driver ’ s seat of the van. The applicant did not challenge in any significant way the evidence of the police officers involved in the arrest of the five men in Corke Abbey. However, the SCC was careful to conclude that these two strands of evidence were insufficient, in isolation, to prove the charge of IRA membership but were evidence of suspicious activities of an organised crime nature which were corroborative of PK ’ s evidence."

            [
                "84. The fourth strand of evidence, which corroborated the Chief Superintendent ’ s evidence and which the trial court took into account in convicting the applicant, was the negative inference which it was entitled by law to draw and which it did draw from the applicant ’ s refusal to answer police questions. It is recalled that silence maintained in response to questions “clearly calling for an explanation” can be taken into account although that negative inference cannot be the “sole or main” basis for a conviction ( John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ I; and Condron v. the United Kingdom, no. 35718/97, § 56, ECHR 2000 ‑ V). The Court again notes that section 2 of the 1998 Act, which allowed the negative inference to be drawn, was also limited to the charge of membership of an unlawful organisation. The SCC did not doubt the materiality to the charge of the police questions, noting that each question had a clear evidential basis which called for a response. The applicant, who was at all times legally represented, had also been warned of the possibility of a negative inference being drawn if he did not answer questions material to the charge and he maintained his silence. The negative inference which the trial court was entitled under statute to draw was so drawn and the court considered it to be corroborative of the Chief Superintendent ’ s evidence."

                "85. In conclusion, the SCC was careful to point out that none of the four strands of evidence, if taken in isolation, was sufficient to ground the applicant ’ s conviction. However, its assessment was that, when viewed in conjunction with Chief Superintendent PK ’ s belief, the applicant ’ s association with the Corke Abbey activities, the material found during the search of his home and the negative inference to be drawn from his failure to respond to material questions, were supportive of the charge of membership of the IRA."

                "86. The CCA, on appeal, reviewed the evidential analysis of the SCC in detail. It endorsed its conclusions and, notably, found it clear that the events at, and evidence from, Corke Abbey as well as the applicant ’ s association with those events constituted conduct within the meaning of section 3(1)(b)(i) of the 1972 Act, as amended, and thus evidence of his membership of the IRA. The negative inferences from silence were correctly and validly drawn. The belief evidence was accorded appropriate weight. The appeal court held that the SCC ’ s review of the underlying documentation was clearly within the ambit of the case-law of the Court which requires that the withholding of any such documentation must at all times remain within the supervisory control of judges themselves. The CCA rejected the applicant ’ s claim that the trial court ’ s review had entailed a review of material that was or could have been ‘ determinative ’ of guilt. It found that in view of the SCC ’ s express statement that it had not convicted on the basis only of Chief Superintendent PK ’ s evidence, still less on the basis of anything appearing in the documents examined by the trial judges as part of their monitoring of procedures, the information in the documentation could not be regarded as having been ‘ determinative ’. The CCA approved the SCC ’ s conclusion that, when taken cumulatively, the four strands of evidence established, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant was guilty, as charged."

In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that Chief Superintendent PK ’ s evidence cannot be considered to have been the sole or decisive evidence grounding the applicant ’ s conviction. However, the Court observes that his evidence clearly carried some weight in the establishment of the applicant ’ s guilt. Accordingly, it considers it necessary to examine, carefully, whether there were adequate counterbalancing factors and safeguards in place (see Pesukic v Switzerland, cited above, § 50) in order to ensure that the disadvantage caused to the applicant by upholding PK ’ s claim of privilege did not restrict his defence rights to an extent incompatible with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention."

The Court observes, at the outset, that the trial court was alert to the need to approach the Chief Superintendent ’ s evidence with caution having regard to his claim of privilege and was aware of the necessity to counterbalance the restriction imposed on the defence as a result of its decision upholding that claim. It proceeded to adopt a number of measures having regard to the rights of the defence.",
                "Firstly, the court reviewed the documentary material upon which PK ’ s sources were based in order to assess the adequacy and reliability of his belief. While the Court does not regard such a review, in itself, to be sufficient to safeguard the rights of the defence ( Edwards and Lewis v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 46 ), it nevertheless considers that the exercise of judicial control over the question of disclosure in this case provided an important safeguard in that it enabled the trial judges to monitor throughout the trial the fairness or otherwise of upholding the claim of privilege in respect of the non-disclosed material (see McKeown v. the United Kingdom, no. 6684/05, § 45, 11 January 2011 ).",
                "Secondly, the trial court in considering the claim of privilege was alert to the importance of the ‘ innocence at stake ’ exception to any grant of privilege. It confirmed, expressly, that there was nothing in what it had reviewed that could or might assist the applicant in his defence and that, if there had been, then its response would have been different. The trial court was thus vigilant in exploring whether the non-disclosed material was relevant or likely to be relevant to the defence and was attentive to the requirements of fairness when weighing the public interest in concealment against the interest of the accused in disclosure (see, mutatis mutandi, Jasper v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 57). The Court considers that if the applicant had any reason to doubt the trial judges ’ assessment in this regard he could have requested the appeal court to review the material and to check the trial court ’ s conclusions. However, he chose not to do so.",
                "Thirdly, in coming to its judgment the trial court stated, specifically, that it had expressly excluded from its consideration any information it had reviewed when it was weighing the Chief Superintendent ’ s evidence in the light of the proceedings as a whole. It further confirmed that it would not convict the applicant on the basis of PK ’ s evidence alone and that it required his evidence to be corroborated and supported by other evidence.",
                "The Court further notes that, in advance of taking its intended procedural steps, the trial court informed the applicant and his co-accused of its intentions as regards its procedures and it afforded them an opportunity to make detailed submissions inter partes which they did (see, a contrario, Edwards and Lewis v. the United Kingdom )."

            ],
            [
                "90. In the first place, as noted above, providing belief evidence involves a complex intelligence gathering and analytical exercise. Section 3(2) therefore requires that those doing so must be high-ranking police officers and, moreover, they are generally officers with significant experience of such organisations and in gathering and analysing relevant intelligence (paragraphs 51 and 5 3 above). 90. In the present case, PK was the Head of the Special Detective Unit concerned with State security and monitoring subversive organisations and had such pertinent professional experience as to lead the SCC to state that it was difficult to envisage any other person in the State more relevantly informed (paragraph 19 above)."
            ],
            [
                "91. In addition, the Chief Superintendent ’ s evidence is not admitted as an assertion of fact but as the belief or opinion of an expert. It is not, therefore, conclusive and, indeed, it has no special status it being one piece of admissible evidence to be considered by the trial court having regard to all the other admissible evidence (paragraphs 4 3, 4 7 and 5 3 above)."
            ],
            [
                "92. The Court further notes that while the scope of cross-examination was restricted by the trial court ’ s ruling, the possibility to cross-examine the witness on his evidence was not entirely eliminated. The possibility to test the Chief Superintendent ’ s evidence in a range of ways still remained. Consistently, such evidence could be tested by the defence even if privilege had been granted as regards the sources upon which that opinion was based. As pointed out by the Supreme Court in DPP v. Kelly (paragraph 4 9 above), the principle is that any restriction on the right to cross-examine is limited to the extent ‘ strictly necessary ’ to achieve its (protective) objective. As noted by O ’ Donnell J in DPP v. Donnelly and Others (paragraph 54 above), the Chief Superintendent ’ s evidence can, therefore, be challenged on all matters collateral and accessory to the content of the privileged information. He could be cross-examined on the nature of his sources (documentary, civilian, police and amount); on his analytical approach and process; on whether he knew or personally dealt with any of the informants; and on his experience in gathering related intelligence, in dealing with informants as well as in rating and analysing informants and information obtained. His responses would allow the trial court to assess his demeanour and credibility and, in turn, the reliability of his evidence. This possibility of testing the witness distinguishes this case from those where the evidence of absent/anonymous witnesses is admitted (paragraphs 77 and 7 8 above), and where the cross-examination of these witnesses is hindered or not possible at all. There is, however, no evidence that the present applicant attempted to test the Chief Superintendent ’ s belief evidence in any way other than by asking him to disclose his sources. In this respect, it remains relevant also to note the comment of O ’ Donnell J in DPP v. Donnelly and Others to the effect that an accused may decide not to cross-examine a Chief Superintendent, not because of the constraints imposed by a grant of source privilege, but for other reasons including to avoid the risk of unwittingly strengthening the prosecution ’ s case against him."

In such circumstances, and recalling that this Court ’ s task is to ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety were fair, the Court considers that the weight of the evidence other than the belief evidence, combined with the counterbalancing safeguards and factors, must be considered sufficient to conclude that the grant of privilege as regards the sources of the Chief Superintendent ’ s belief did not render the applicant ’ s trial unfair."

As shown by the above examples from the Court ’ s case-law, it is incumbent on the authorities involved in the proceedings, in particular the domestic courts, to ascertain whether the fairness of the trial requires, or has required, the appointment of an interpreter to assist the defendant. In the Court ’ s opinion, this duty is not confined to situations where the foreign defendant makes an explicit request for interpreting. In view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial ( see Hermi, cited above, § 76, and Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37 ), it arises whenever there are reasons to suspect that the defendant is not proficient enough in the language of the proceedings, for example if he or she is neither a national nor a resident of the country in which the proceedings are being conducted. A similar duty arises when a third language is envisaged to be used for the interpreting. In such circumstances, the defendant ’ s proficiency in the third language should be ascertained before the decision is taken to use it for the purposes of interpreting."

It observed that the applicant ’ s situation was an exceptional one, in that he was not required to properly exhaust remedies in respect of the Kranj District Court ’ s decision. In its view, the applicant, who was detained at the time, could not have been expected to challenge the impugned decision by means of a standard appeal as he had stated that he could not understand the language in which the decision had been written. The Constitutional Court went on to examine the complaint on the merits, finding in favour of the applicant. It noted that the law afforded special protection to a defendant ’ s right to use his or her own language and script after detention. The person ’ s own language would in principle be his or her mother tongue but, if the person had a command of another language, the use of the latter could suffice for oral communication in the proceedings. However, the Constitutional Court rejected the District Court ’ s view that a defendant who was in custody and who had used a certain language in oral proceedings should also submit written submissions in that language, finding that written communication required a higher level of language proficiency. The Constitutional Court noted that the applicant had been assisted by a Russian interpreter in the first-instance proceedings, which had mainly involved oral communication. After an appeal, proceedings were typically in writing and the accused no longer benefited from the assistance of court-appointed counsel. The Constitutional Court therefore found that the applicant, who had explained in his submissions to the Supreme Court that he could not write in Russian, should be allowed to submit them in his own language. It therefore concluded that the court below had violated the applicant ’ s right to use his own language in the proceedings, as explicitly provided for by section 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act and as guaranteed by Article 62 of the Constitution. It annulled the Kranj District Court ’ s decision of 29 April 2003 (see paragraph 38 above) and remitted the applicant ’ s application for the protection of legality for fresh consideration."

It also found no indication that the applicant had given any statement concerning that right.

The applicant had participated in the proceedings, examined witnesses, answered questions and had not complained of not being able to understand Russian, the language in which he had communicated in the proceedings.

Fair Trials International, intervening as a third party, argued that the Court should adopt a demanding approach when assessing whether national courts have discharged their duty to check the adequacy of interpretation when put on notice as to an issue in that regard. It referred to the Resolution of the Council of 30 November 2009 on a Roadmap for strengthening procedural rights of suspected and accused persons in criminal proceedings and Directive 2010/64/EU (see paragraphs 52 to 57 above). In particular, the third party argued that the failure to make a complaint at national level should by no means be regarded as determinative. In determining whether the domestic authorities had been “put on notice” such as to trigger their responsibility for any oversight, the Court should take into account any factual situation arising in the context of the national proceedings, which should be such as to alert the courts as to a possible issue with the adequacy of interpretation. It pointed out that when interpretation was provided in a language other than that of the accused, this should automatically put the authorities on notice and trigger their obligation to verify the adequacy of the interpretation. The authorities would then have to establish that the accused person had a sufficient command of the interpreting language. In this connection, it was necessary to have regard to the elements taken into account by the Court in assessing the impact of not providing interpreting for people who did not have a perfect command of the language of the proceedings, such as their linguistic knowledge, literacy and personal situation, and the complexity of the case. The national authorities were required to determine whether the accused person had a sufficient command of the third language by conducting similar checks."

If the domestic authorities failed to conduct a proper examination of the adequacy of interpretation, the Court should not speculate about the effect that inadequate interpretation might have had on the defence strategies. It should instead be prepared to conclude that the defence might have been conducted differently if proper interpreting had been provided and therefore find a violation of Article 6.",

Whilst this provision does not specify that the relevant information should be given in writing or translated in written form for a foreign defendant, it does point to the need for special attention to be paid to the notification of the “accusation” to the defendant. An indictment plays a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of its service that the defendant is formally put on notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him. A defendant not familiar with the language used by the court may be at a practical disadvantage if the indictment is not translated into a language which he understands (see Hermi v.

                "80. As regards its case-law to date, the Court observes that already in Brozicek v. Italy (19 December 1989, § 41, Series A no. 167) it indicated the need for verification of the defendant ’ s needs in terms of language assistance. In particular, it considered that the Italian authorities, which had been informed in an unequivocal manner of the applicant ’ s lack of knowledge of Italian, “ should have taken steps to comply with [his request for translation] ... unless they were in a position to establish that the applicant in fact had sufficient knowledge of Italian to understand from the notification the purport of the letter notifying him of the charges brought against him ”. Noting that there was no evidence in the file to indicate that the applicant had had sufficient knowledge of Italian, the Court found a violation of Article 6. Similarly, in Cuscani v. the United Kingdom (no. 32771/96, § 38, 24 September 2002 ), the Court took the view that after the authorities had been put on notice of the applicant ’ s inability to understand the proceedings, the verification of his need for interpretation had become a matter for the judge to determine. The Court held that the onus had been on the judge to ascertain whether the absence of an interpreter at the hearing would have prejudiced the applicant ’ s full involvement in a trial in which he had pleaded guilty. Furthermore, in Amer v. Turkey (no. 25720/02, § 83, 13 January 2009), the Court found no indication in the file as to the presence of an interpreter during the police ’ s questioning of the applicant, who claimed to have only limited knowledge of Turkish, which was the language of the proceedings. Noting that crucial evidence had been gathered during that questioning, and referring to the subsequent proceedings before the domestic court, the Court found that “ the verification of the applicant ’ s need for interpretation facilities at the time of his questioning by the police should have been a matter for the domestic courts to adequately examine with a view to reassuring themselves that the absence of an interpreter [when the applicant was] in police custody would not have prejudiced the applicant ’ s right to a fair trial ”."

                "81. As shown by the above examples from the Court ’ s case-law, it is incumbent on the authorities involved in the proceedings, in particular the domestic courts, to ascertain whether the fairness of the trial requires, or has required, the appointment of an interpreter to assist the defendant. In the Court ’ s opinion, this duty is not confined to situations where the foreign defendant makes an explicit request for interpreting. In view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial ( see Hermi, cited above, § 76, and Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37 ), it arises whenever there are reasons to suspect that the defendant is not proficient enough in the language of the proceedings, for example if he or she is neither a national nor a resident of the country in which the proceedings are being conducted. A similar duty arises when a third language is envisaged to be used for the interpreting. In such circumstances, the defendant ’ s proficiency in the third language should be ascertained before the decision is taken to use it for the purposes of interpreting."

The Court further observes that the importance of verifying the defendant ’ s interpreting needs in order to ensure the right to a fair trial has been recognised also by the adoption of the European Union ’ s Directive 2010/64/EU. That Directive requires member States to ensure that a procedure or mechanism is in place to ascertain whether suspected or accused persons speak and understand the language of the criminal proceedings and whether they need the assistance of an interpreter (see paragraphs 52 to 54 above )."

The Court has held on several occasions that in determining the defendant ’ s interpreting needs, the issue of his or her linguistic knowledge is vital (see, among many authorities, Hermi, cited above, § 71). It would add in this connection that the fact that the defendant has a basic command of the language of the proceedings or, as may be the case, a third language into which interpreting is readily available, should not by itself bar that individual from benefiting from interpreting into a language he or she understands well enough to fully exercise his or her defence rights. This follows from the requirement that the defendant be informed of the accusation in a language “ which he understands ” and from the requirement that the interpretation assistance provided should be such as to enable the defendant to have knowledge of the case against him and to defend himself (see paragraph 79 above). Recital 22 of the Preamble to Directive 2010/64/EU more specifically provides that the interpretation and translation should be provided either in the native language of defendants or in any other language that they speak or understand in order to allow them fully to exercise their right of defence, and in order to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings (see paragraph 53 above)."

It is therefore not for the Court to set out in any detail the precise measures that should be taken by domestic authorities with a view to verifying the linguistic knowledge of a defendant who is not sufficiently proficient in the language of the proceedings. Depending on different factors, such as the nature of the offence and the communications addressed to the defendant by the domestic authorities ( see Hermi, cited above, § 71), a number of open-ended questions might be sufficient to establish the defendant ’ s language needs. In this connection, the Court observes that recital 21 of Directive 2010/64/EU likewise leaves it to the authorities to choose the most appropriate manner of verification, which may include consulting the suspected or accused persons concerned (see paragraph 53 above)."

The Court has already had occasion to point out, in the context of the right of access to a lawyer, the right to remain silent and the privilege against self-incrimination, that for these rights to be practical and effective it is crucial that the suspects be aware of them ( see Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, § 272, ECHR 2016 ). The Court finds that for the very same reason it is important for the suspect to be aware of the right to interpretation, which means that he must be notified of such a right when “charged with a criminal offence” (see, mutatis mutandis, ibid.; see also Article 3 of Directive 2012/13/EU cited in paragraph 60 above )."

The Court observes at the outset that the Kranj District Court seemed to have made some enquiries about the availability of interpreters for the applicant ’ s native language, Lithuanian, finding that no such interpreters were registered in Slovenia at the material time and that translation from and into that language would have required the assistance of the nearest Lithuanian Embassy (see paragraph 38 above). However, those enquiries were made only in the proceedings following the second-instance court ’ s judgment, without any further steps being taken. There is no indication in the file that any possibilities of securing a Lithuanian interpreter had been entertained by the authorities during the trial or the investigation. However, it appears that later in the proceedings, for instance before the Supreme Court ( see paragraphs 42 and 43 above ), a translation from Lithuanian into Slovenian and vice versa was obtained."

In any event, the Government did not argue that there had been compelling reasons (see paragraph 76 above) preventing the authorities from appointing a Lithuanian interpreter to assist the applicant. In fact, they argued that a Russian interpreter had been appointed to assist him because, in their view, he understood Russian (see paragraph 71 above). Indeed, the domestic courts ’ decisions concerning the present complaint (see paragraphs 41, 43 and 46 above) were based on the assumption that the applicant understood Russian and was able to follow the proceedings in that language."

In view of the foregoing, the Court cannot speculate as to whether or at what point a Lithuanian interpreter would have been available to the applicant, had the authorities actively sought one. Bearing in mind that Article 6 does not require that the defendant should necessarily be able to follow the proceedings in his or her native language, it will proceed to examine the main question, that is whether the applicant was provided with interpreting into a language of which he had a sufficient command for the purposes of his defence, and if not, whether this undermined the fairness of the proceedings as a whole.",

In the present case, the authorities were clearly aware that the applicant, who was a Lithuanian national and had arrived in Slovenia only a short time before his arrest, did not understand the language of the criminal proceedings against him, which was Slovenian. After taking the applicant into custody, the police informed him, with the assistance of the Russian interpreter, of the reasons for his arrest and his right of access to a lawyer. When questioned by the investigating judge, the applicant was again assisted by the Russian interpreter. He continued to be assisted by that interpreter throughout the proceedings and during consultations with his court-appointed lawyer and was given Russian translations of the relevant court documents. However, although the records of the investigation and hearing are quite detailed, the Court cannot find any indication that the applicant was ever consulted as to whether he understood the interpreting and written translation into Russian well enough to conduct his defence effectively in that language."

In that connection, the Court cannot accept the Government ’ s suggestion that any general assumption about the applicant ’ s knowledge of Russian could be made on the basis of his Lithuanian nationality and rejects the Government ’ s arguments about the use of Russian in Lithuania (see paragraph 71 above), finding that the accuracy of those submissions has not been proven in any way. It further notes that no other explanation was provided by the Government as to what led the authorities, when appointing a Russian interpreter to assist the applicant, to believe that he had sufficient command of that language (see paragraph 71 above; and contrast Hermi, cited above, §§ 90 and 91, and Katritsch v.

The lack of such verification is an important element in the Court ’ s consideration of the case, as the effective protection of the rights enshrined in Article 6 § 3 (a) and (e) requires that a defendant be provided with interpreting into a language of which he has a sufficient command (see paragraphs 81 to 83 above).",

As to whether there are any indications, in the trial records or elsewhere, of his understanding of the interpreting language ( see paragraph 71 above ), the Court notes, firstly, that in the absence of any verification, his lack of cooperation during the police procedure and during his questioning by the investigating judge might be understood as being, at least in part, attributed to his difficulties in expressing himself and in following the proceedings in Russian (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above)."

The Government gave no justification for that failure. The Court emphasises in this connection that the notification of the right to interpretation was an integral part of the authorities ’ duty to provide adequate language assistance to the applicant in order to secure the right to a fair trial – a duty which was at the centre of the applicant ’ s appeal on points of law and his constitutional complaint (see paragraphs 37, 44, 86 and 87 above). Moreover, under domestic law the applicant was entitled to interpreting into his native language and the authorities were obliged, under domestic procedural law, to inform him of that right and to make a record of such notification and of the applicant ’ s response to it (see paragraphs 46, 48 and 49 above)."

In the Court ’ s view, the lack of such notification of the right to interpretation, coupled with the applicant ’ s vulnerability as a foreigner who had arrived in Slovenia only a short time before the arrest and had been detained during the proceedings, and his limited command of Russian, could well explain the lack of any request for a different interpreter or complaint in this regard until later in the proceedings, at which point he was able to use his native language (see paragraphs 37 to 46 above). The Court further observes that the Constitutional Court considered the applicant ’ s situation to be one of an exceptional nature, with the consequence that he had not been required to exhaust regular remedies (see paragraphs 41 and 46 above)."

As regards the lack of complaints by the applicant ’ s counsel, the Court reiterates that although the conduct of the defence is essentially a matter between the defendant and his or her counsel, whether counsel has been appointed under a legal - aid scheme or privately financed, the ultimate guardians of the fairness of the proceedings – encompassing, among other aspects, the possible absence of translation or interpretation for a non-national defendant – are the domestic courts (see Hermi, cited above, § 72, and Cuscani, cited above, § 39).
