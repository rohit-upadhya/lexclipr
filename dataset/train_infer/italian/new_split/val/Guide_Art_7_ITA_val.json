                "72. The applicant contested the accessibility and foreseeability of the law of contempt of court in her case. There is no dispute between the parties as to the correct test for common law contempt of court. The test required, in particular, that two elements be present: first, there had to be an act which created a “real risk” of prejudice to the administration of justice; and second, there had to be an intention to create that risk (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above). It is true that, in its summary of the test, the Divisional Court omitted the word “real” from its description of the risk (see paragraph 32 above). However, it subsequently held that the applicant had caused “actual prejudice” to the due administration of justice, and not merely a risk of such prejudice (see paragraph 37 above). It is not, therefore, arguable that the Divisional Court in her case applied a lower threshold than the test required. Further, the summary of the test in the subsequent case of Davey and Beard shows that the court in the applicant ’ s case did not alter the nature of the risk which had to be demonstrated (see paragraph 54 above)."
            ],
            [
                "73.  As to the question of intent, the Divisional Court decided that, in the circumstances of the applicant’s case, if it was proved that she had deliberately disobeyed the judge’s direction prohibiting the obtaining of extraneous information relating to the trial, an intent to impede or prejudice the due administration of justice would also have been proved (see paragraph 37 above)."
            ],
            [
                "74.  The Court considers that it must be quite evident to any juror that deliberately introducing extraneous evidence into the jury room contrary to an order of the trial judge amounts to intending to commit an act that at the very least carries a real risk of being prejudicial to the administration of justice. In deciding that specific intent could be derived from the foreseeability of the consequences of certain actions, the Divisional Court was not replacing the specific intent test with a test of “breach of an order” or with a more basic intent test. Rather, it was finding the specific intent test to be met in the circumstances of the applicant’s case. This approach to proof of specific intent had clear precedent (see paragraph 47 above). While it was open to the applicant’s counsel to argue, as it appears that he to some extent did, that it was not appropriate to proceed in this way in her case (see paragraph 30 above), it cannot reasonably be suggested that the approach of the Divisional Court was not foreseeable, having regard to existing case-law on this question. Thus, by stating that intent could be demonstrated by the foreseeability of consequences, the court did not overstep the limits of what can be regarded as an acceptable clarification of the law."
            ],
            [
                "75.  The applicant also criticised the clarity of the judge’s direction. The Court cannot accept that the direction given by the judge, especially when taken in the context of the other information provided to the applicant by the jury officer, the notices posted around the court building and her oath or affirmation at the start of the trial (see paragraphs 8-10 above), was ambiguous. The jury members were clearly told, twice, that they were not to “go on the internet”. They were told not to “try and do any research of [their] own” and that, once they left the courtroom, they were not to deal with the case in any way (see paragraph 11 above). While the judge’s direction was in broad terms, it is not argued that the applicant understood the direction as prohibiting any use of the Internet whatsoever. Had she done so, she could have sought clarification from the trial judge. The judge further alluded to the Fraill case (see paragraphs 50-52 above) and warned the jurors of the severe problems which arose for a juror who went on the Internet (see paragraph 11 above). The fact that no explicit penal warning was included in the direction does not affect the clarity of the instruction given by the judge. Such a warning is not required under domestic law and had the applicant wished to know further details of the sanctions applicable to a breach of the direction, she could again have sought clarification from the judge. The consequences of contempt of court by Internet research were also made clear in the notices in the jury waiting room (see paragraph 9 above). The applicant went on the Internet to conduct research into the previous conviction of the defendant in the case in which she was sitting as a juror. On any interpretation of the judge’s direction, such action was clearly prohibited."
            ],
            [
                "76.  Finally, as to the applicant’s argument concerning the difference between a direction and an order, the Court considers such arguments to be untenable for the reasons given by the Divisional Court (see paragraph 37 above) and the Supreme Court (see paragraph 42 above)."
            ],
            [
                "77.  The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that the test for contempt of court applied in the applicant’s case was both accessible and foreseeable. The law-making function of the courts remained within reasonable limits: the judgment rendered in her case can be considered, at most, a step in the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability for contempt of court through judicial interpretation. Any development of the law was consistent with the essence of the offence and could be reasonably foreseen."

Referring to the obligation of jurors to swear an oath to “give true verdicts according to the evidence”, the court described as “elementary” the conclusion that a verdict not given by each juror conscientiously in accordance with her assessment of the evidence at trial constituted a breach of that promise. The court emphasised that the jury ’ s deliberations, and ultimately their verdict, had to be exclusively based on the evidence given in court, a principle which applied as much to communication with the Internet as it did to discussions by members of the jury with individuals not on the jury. Information provided by the Internet was not evidence and its use by a juror exposed her to the risk of being influenced. This, the court explained, offended “our long held belief that justice requires that both sides in a criminal trial should know and be able to address or answer any material (particularly material which appears adverse to them) which may influence the verdict”."

In its report no. 340 on Contempt of Court (1) Juror Misconduct and Internet Publications, published on 9 December 2013, the Law Commission identified problems with the law and procedure for dealing with jurors who sought extraneous information about the case that they were trying. It noted that the relevant conduct was treated as contempt because it was a breach of the order made by the judge at the start of the trial instructing jurors not to undertake research into the case, but that there was no specific form of words that judges had to use. As a consequence, the scope of the criminal contempt depended on the exact wording that each judge adopted in warning the jurors at the start of the trial. Further, while the prohibition on searching for extraneous material was explained to jurors as forbidden because it was “a contempt of court”, the Law Commission doubted whether, from the point of view of a layperson, it was obvious what “a contempt ” was or what the implications of this were. It considered that the message would be clearer for jurors if they were told that such conduct was a crime. Finally, the Law Commission pointed to doubt whether extraneous research by jurors was a contempt by its own nature or only because it was a breach of the directions given by the judge. This, the Law Commission said, was a further source of confusion. It continued:",

It allows the legislature to set down with clarity the elements of the offence, and to debate publicly the mischief which the offence seeks to address. The Parliamentary process and the fact that the offence has been enshrined in statute adds to the legitimacy of any offence created and the sanction which committing the offence attracts. ”"

Although that Article did not prevent the clarification or adaptation of existing law, it required that the interpretation of the law conform to the principle of reasonable certainty. The test for contempt of court at common law was clear: it required specific intent to impede, or create a risk of prejudicing, the due administration of justice. The application, in her case, of a test which required only “deliberate disobedience of a direction by the judge” and creating a risk to the due administration of justice was a separate and distinct test which, she argued, equated with a “breach - of - an - order” test. She argued that Order 52 expressly excluded the jurisdiction of the Divisional Court in cases where contempt was committed in connection with criminal proceedings and the alleged contempt was in breach of an order. She considered that the Government ’ s submissions did not adequately address the distinction between specific intent and basic intent, but rather elided “specific intent” with the deliberate disobedience of a court order and did not explain how such a change in the law was compliant with Article 7."

In her submission, the whole exchange between her counsel and the court had to be taken into account: on a proper reading of this exchange there was not agreement to a different test (see paragraphs 30 - 34 and 39 - 40 above).

In particular, the nature of the contempt had to be defined with precision. Oral directions to the jury formulated on a case-by-case basis lacked consistency. Since Internet use varied widely, there was a need for a clear definition of what was permitted. In her case, there were several possible interpretations of the direction or order. The words “go on the internet”, used in the judge ’ s direction (see paragraph 11 above), were not adequately defined. She further argued that a penal warning was necessary because it was not clear which directions, if breached, could attract a criminal penalty and which would not. The reference to the “severe problems” of a juror who had done so was equally insufficient to meet the requirements of an order with a penal notice. An oral direction to persons unfamiliar with court procedure required simplicity and considerable clarity to be properly understood."

For the Divisional Court to move to a “breach - of - an - order” test in these circumstances was not foreseeable, even with legal advice, since it was unprecedented, it removed constituent elements of the offence which essentially changed its legal character, the test had not been applied since her case and it had led to an extensive construction of the law to her detriment.

                "66. In finding the applicant guilty of contempt of court at common law, the Divisional Court had applied well-established law. The applicant, in complaining that it had formulated a new test of liability, had mischaracterised and misunderstood the domestic judgment and domestic law. In particular, the court had applied the well-established mental element required, namely an intent to impede or prejudice the due administration of justice. It had merely reformulated the law to the specific facts of the applicant ’ s case. The nature of the order in her case was a prohibition on doing an act which was inherently and inevitably prejudicial to the fairness of the proceedings, prejudicial to the administration of justice and contrary to the jury oath or affirmation. In these circumstances, the question whether the applicant had intended to prejudice the administration of justice was indistinguishable from the question whether she had deliberately disobeyed the order of the court. Her counsel had agreed that there was no distinction between these two questions (see paragraphs 32 - 34 above). The approach of the court was uncontroversial : it was the approach that the Divisional Court had previously taken in Fraill (see paragraphs 50 - 52 above ); it was supported by the Supreme Court in the applicant ’ s case when refusing permission to appeal (see paragraph 42 above); and it was clear from the subsequent case of Davey and Beard (see paragraphs 53 - 54 above) that, in the applicant ’ s case, the court had done nothing more than find that the requisite intent had been proved by reference to the particular issues in her case. Even if it were possible to formulate an academic argument that there was a distinction between proof of deliberate disobedience of the judicial order and proof of an intent to impede or prejudice the due administration of justice, the application of the former test would not violate Article 7. Liability based on disobedience of such an order was obviously foreseeable, having regard to the fact that it had a foundation in domestic case-law, including in the Fraill judgment (see paragraph 50 - 52 above)."

It had also held that the judge ’ s direction was an order and that the applicant ’ s disobedience of it was deliberate. The prohibition imposed by the judge was consistent with the information given by the jury officer, the written notices in the jury room and the applicant ’ s oath or affirmation. The Divisional Court did not believe the applicant ’ s claim that there was a lack in clarity in her mind as to the order and concluded that she had understood its scope “perfectly well” (see paragraph 37 above).

Finally, it was also irrelevant for the purposes of domestic law and for the purposes of any analysis under Article 7 whether the prohibition imposed by the judge was characterised as a direction, an order or both. First, as matter of domestic law, there was no doubt that Internet research by a juror in disobedience of a direction given by a judge constituted contempt of court. Second, as a matter of domestic law, the meaning of “direction” and “order” depended on the context and both could mean the same.

There is no dispute between the parties as to the correct test for common law contempt of court. The test required, in particular, that two elements be present: first, there had to be an act which created a “real risk” of prejudice to the administration of justice; and second, there had to be an intention to create that risk (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above). It is true that, in its summary of the test, the Divisional Court omitted the word “real” from its description of the risk (see paragraph 32 above). However, it subsequently held that the applicant had caused “actual prejudice” to the due administration of justice, and not merely a risk of such prejudice (see paragraph 37 above). It is not, therefore, arguable that the Divisional Court in her case applied a lower threshold than the test required. Further, the summary of the test in the subsequent case of Davey and Beard shows that the court in the applicant ’ s case did not alter the nature of the risk which had to be demonstrated (see paragraph 54 above)."

The Court considers that it must be quite evident to any juror that deliberately introducing extraneous evidence into the jury room contrary to an order of the trial judge amounts to intending to commit an act that at the very least carries a real risk of being prejudicial to the administration of justice. In deciding that specific intent could be derived from the foreseeability of the consequences of certain actions, the Divisional Court was not replacing the specific intent test with a test of “breach of an order” or with a more basic intent test. Rather, it was finding the specific intent test to be met in the circumstances of the applicant’s case. This approach to proof of specific intent had clear precedent (see paragraph 47 above). While it was open to the applicant’s counsel to argue, as it appears that he to some extent did, that it was not appropriate to proceed in this way in her case (see paragraph 30 above), it cannot reasonably be suggested that the approach of the Divisional Court was not foreseeable, having regard to existing case-law on this question.

The jury members were clearly told, twice, that they were not to “go on the internet”. They were told not to “try and do any research of [their] own” and that, once they left the courtroom, they were not to deal with the case in any way (see paragraph 11 above). While the judge’s direction was in broad terms, it is not argued that the applicant understood the direction as prohibiting any use of the Internet whatsoever. Had she done so, she could have sought clarification from the trial judge. The judge further alluded to the Fraill case (see paragraphs 50-52 above) and warned the jurors of the severe problems which arose for a juror who went on the Internet (see paragraph 11 above). The fact that no explicit penal warning was included in the direction does not affect the clarity of the instruction given by the judge. Such a warning is not required under domestic law and had the applicant wished to know further details of the sanctions applicable to a breach of the direction, she could again have sought clarification from the judge. The consequences of contempt of court by Internet research were also made clear in the notices in the jury waiting room (see paragraph 9 above).

The first phase of the development extended from 1992 to 1994 during which time the economic and commercial activity of the company was concentrated in the sphere of fast-income businesses, relying on cash, such as bakeries, retail shops, cake shops, restaurants and travel agencies. The second phase extended from the end of 1994 until the placement of the company in administration. During this period, the goal of the company was to modernise its lines of production and extend its activities within the country and abroad. In the court ’ s view, this was the decisive period which gave rise to great economic and financial problems. The District Court acknowledged that the principal reason for the taking of loans from members of the public were the rapid pace of the company ’ s expansion and development as well as the actual impossibility for the Albanian banks to give loans."

The total number of persons who concluded a loan contract with the company was 68,857 creditors. The total amount of loans taken, on the basis of calculations made by specialised bodies and experts, was equivalent to USD 325,300,000.

                "“On the basis of the wealth of material, documents and experts ’ reports which have been adduced before the trial and appeal courts, it is clear that the accused collected considerable amounts of money and foreign currency from members of the public by means of false promises to repay the amounts and pay high interest rates, knowing that he was incapable of keeping his promises. In contrast to the accused ’ s claims, the [lower] courts established that the taking of money from members of the public, in the form of so-called loans, was carried out for the sole purpose of acquiring property for the accused himself and other persons. The accused was not capable of securing the amounts in question relying solely on the money taken from members of the public and he knew that he could not obtain profits in a lawful manner in order to repay the loans.",
                "The undertaking to pay back the money collected from members of the public was not based on the company ’ s realisable profits, but on the prospect of attracting money in the same way from other members of the public. The [lower] courts established that no lawful and normal commercial company could secure the interest rates needed to cover the high rate of interest that the accused offered to persons from whom he had collected extraordinarily large sums of money.",
                "In augmenting untruthfully the value of investments he had made using the money taken from members of the public, the accused ’ s purpose was to attract a large number of persons in response to the competition from the so-called foundations and other pyramid schemes which were operating at the time, and to instil in the public the false idea that he possessed property and other assets which would underwrite the obligations he had entered into. The increase in interest rates for creditors and the shortening of deadlines for the repayment of loans fell into this same category.",
                "Regard being had to the whole body of evidence which was analysed in detail by the District Court and by the Court of Appeal, it emerges that, using money taken from members of the public, the accused created a pyramid scheme the base of which consisted of loans collected from members of the public who had been deceived, while its apex consisted of repayments which, as established by the courts, were not sufficient to fulfil the accused ’ s [contractual] obligations.",

With the passage of time this intent evolved as the applicant expanded his activities, which took on staggering proportions as the scheme was rolled out across the country until 23 January 1997, the date that marked the end of his pyramid scheme.",

In its decision, the Court of Appeal, relying on Article 3 § 3 of the CC, reasoned that the offence should be classified under Article 143 § 2 of the CC, on the grounds that, as a newly introduced criminal-law provision, the latter was more favourable than the previous provisions.",
                "The argument employed by the District Court that the criminal offence constitutes a continuous crime ... is not borne out by the deception that has been carried out. In order for a crime to be continuous, the following elements must be present: each offence must not stand on its own, the acts or the failure to act must have constituted the same criminal offence, and the criminal intent which joins separate acts in a single integral offence must exist.",

The criminal activity took place over a long time and, as argued above, was not the consequence of the same criminal intent. The latter was subject to continuous modification owing to competition from other unlawful loan-taking companies. This took the form of changing interest rates, varying deception techniques to adapt to different people and different circumstances, developing diverse strategies to make the deception credible, either through propaganda in the broadcast media or through efforts to make the criminal activity appear as normal banking activity.",
                "The court adopts the same position with the unifying decision (no. 284) of 15 September 2000 of the Supreme Court Joint Benches to the effect that persons who have committed the offence of deception shall be criminally liable under Article 143 of the CC on as many counts as the number of people deceived.",
                "The Supreme Court considers that the Court of Appeal ’ s reasoning that Article 143 § 2 should be applied as it is more favourable does not have any legal basis. Article 82 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that “the most serious criminal offence shall be considered to be that which attracts the most severe maximum penalty or, where the most severe maximum penalties are equal, the most severe minimum penalty.” On that basis, taking the most severe maximum penalty as the criterion for the most serious offence, it is clear that Article 143 of the Criminal Code, which was in force when the criminal offence was committed and which provides for a penalty of five years ’ imprisonment, is more favourable than the second paragraph, which was added to the provision and provides for a maximum penalty of twenty years ’ imprisonment. The fact that the cumulative sentence imposed may be higher than the penalty provided for in Article 143 § 2 of the Criminal Code cannot provide a basis for finding that Article 143 is less favourable.",
                "For these reasons the Court of Appeal, having aggravated the accused ’ s position, should not have classified the offence under Article 143 § 2 of the CC. The accused ... should be found guilty and sentenced on the basis of Article 143 for the criminal offence of deception on 57,923 counts, equal to the number of injured persons.",

The court, by giving the facts a different determination, may re-characterise the offence, which may be less serious or more so. In the latter case, this does not mean that the accused ’ s position has been aggravated. In accordance with Article 375 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court may give the facts a different determination from that given by the prosecutor, since the court is independent and makes its own assessment of the facts.",
                "In this context, Article 375 does not oblige the court to give the accused time in the defence of his interest, whereas pursuant to Article 372, 373 and 374 the accused is granted additional time to secure his defence against new charges lodged by the prosecutor. The latter provisions make reference to the prosecutor who, prior to the completion of the judicial examination has the right to modify the charges, to lodge a different charge or to charge the accused with a new offence. On these occasions, because the defence rights should be secured, the law provides that the court makes time available to the accused to secure his defence against the new charges. In the case of the application of Article 375 of the CCP, when the court proceeds with a different requalification of the offence, the same binding procedure does not apply as in the case of the filing of new charges by the prosecutor. The court, after an examination of facts, may give the facts a new and different legal determination. The criminal procedural law does not envisage adjournment of hearings or granting of [additional] time to the defence when the re-characterisation of the criminal offence is made by the court by virtue of its final decision. Contrary to the defendant ’ s complaint, it cannot be said that there has been a breach of the accused ’ s right to defence.",

The prosecutor and the courts questioned as many creditors as was deemed necessary. Questioning of creditors does not constitute a legal necessity, since deception is not a criminal offence which can be prosecuted solely on the strength of a complaint.

The conditions for imposing a cumulative sentence are as follows.",

None of the offences may be time-barred or have been the subject of an amnesty or of proceedings which were discontinued.

More specifically, the court imposes fifteen years ’ imprisonment for the offence of intentional homicide and five years ’ imprisonment for the offence of illegal possession of firearms. By applying a cumulative sentence, the court imposes a penalty of eighteen years ’ imprisonment, which corresponds to the most severe cumulative sentence. This means that three years were added to the most severe sentence of fifteen years ’ imprisonment, resulting in the most severe cumulative sentence of eighteen years ’ imprisonment.",
                "A cumulative sentence cannot be imposed where the same actions, committed repeatedly, form part of a single offence under the [Criminal] Code. For example, serious injury caused to several people, irrespective of the fact that it was inflicted recurrently and by way of the same actions against two, three or more people, forms part of a single offence specifically provided for under Article ... and cannot be subject to a cumulative penalty.",

It finally imposed on him a cumulative sentence of seven years. In this case, the most severe cumulative sentence was correctly applied, in that the sentence did not exceed the total sum of the separate sentences imposed (eight years), or the maximum sentence within the type of penalty imposed, i.e. imprisonment.",

For the first offence, he shall be sentenced to fifteen years ’ imprisonment and for the second to ten years ’ imprisonment.

In this connection, the Court notes that the Government did not provide any prior, relevant domestic case-law to the effect that a person convicted of deception under Article 143 § 1 of the Criminal Code could be sentenced on as many counts as the number of injured parties, thereby multiplying the maximum penalty to a term of imprisonment superior to five years."

The first clarification by the domestic courts was given by the Supreme Court ’ s unifying decision of 15 September 2000, namely subsequent to the events on which the applicant ’ s prosecution and conviction were based. In its unifying decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a person who had committed the criminal offence of deception was to be sentenced on as many counts as the number of injured parties. The Court therefore considers that, at the time he committed the offence, the applicant could not reasonably foresee that he would be found guilty of 57,923 counts of deception, even if he were to seek legal advice."

In the first place, two or more offences, as provided for by two or more distinct provisions of the CC, must have been committed. Secondly, no court decision should have been taken in respect of any of the offences (see § 100 above). In its extensive case-law, the Supreme Court has consistently applied Article 55 in imposing cumulative sentences, when two or more offences, as designated by two or more separate provisions of the CC, were committed (see §§ 101 – 112 above)."

The applicant was neither charged with nor convicted of another criminal offence. Having regard to the doctrinal interpretation and the effective application of Article 55 by the Supreme Court at the material time, the Court considers that the applicant could not reasonably foresee that Article 55 would apply in the imposition of a cumulative sentence for the commission of deception as a repeat offence, in the absence of another accusation and conviction of another charge, even if he were to obtain legal advice."

In view of the above, the Court considers that the criminal law was extensively and unforeseeably construed to the applicant ’ s detriment in sentencing him to 20 years ’ imprisonment."

In their view, the domestic courts had questioned as many witnesses as they deemed necessary. There was no obligation for them to question every witness requested by the applicant. The domestic courts had convicted the applicant on the strength of a number of experts ’ reports, which were complex and involved the assessment of a huge volume of information. The Government maintained that the assessment of evidence and the interpretation of domestic law was a matter for the domestic courts. In finding the applicant guilty, the domestic courts, having regard to the adversarial proceedings, had held that the applicant had deceived the general public by entering into loan contracts when he was unable to pay off the loans. The discrepancies between the findings of the experts ’ reports had been explained by the Court of Appeal in its judgment."

This was also in line with section 3 of Act no. 2 and with Article 290 of the CCP. The law had been amended to allow his prosecution. The applicant also took issue with the way in which the experts ’ reports had been prepared. In his view, the reports had been drawn up on the basis of documents processed by the Board of Supervisors. They had not been based on the accounting and loan-taking documents of the company. This explained the inconsistent findings of the reports before the first-instance court and the Court of Appeal respectively. Furthermore, the experts ’ reports had been compiled two years after the company had been placed in compulsory administration, no prior experts ’ reports having been prepared. The District Court ’ s decision of 27 June 1997 had been disregarded even though it had become final and reflected the company ’ s annual reports to the tax authorities."

They had not reasonably examined the fact that the borrowed money had been properly invested in business activities, as attested by the number of business and property assets which the applicant and his company owned. None of the 40 creditors who had been questioned had stated that they had been deceived by the applicant.
