In the instant case, the Court notes that the applicant's purpose is not to call into question her relationship with her adoptive parents but to discover the circumstances in which she was born and abandoned, including the identity of her natural parents and brothers. For that reason, it considers it necessary to examine the case from the perspective of private life, not family life, since the applicant's claim to be entitled, in the name of biological truth, to know her personal history is based on her inability to gain access to information about her origins and related identifying data."

                "15. The mater semper certa est rule has not found acceptance in French law. There is an ancient tradition in France that enables newborn babies to be abandoned in accordance with a set procedure. The practice can be traced back to the time of Saint Vincent de Paul, who introduced the use of the tour, a sort of revolving crib housed in the wall a charitable institution. The mother would place the child in the crib and ring a bell. On that signal someone on the other side of the wall would cause the tour to pivot and collect the infant. The aim of Saint Vincent de Paul in setting up the Foundlings Home ( Œuvre des Enfants trouvés ) in 1638 was to prevent infanticide, abortion and babies being exposed.",
                "The Revolution introduced a reform making medical care available to expectant mothers who wished to abandon their children anonymously. In 1793 the Convention passed the following provision:",

                "The system of abandonment in the tour was abolished by a law of 27 June 1904 which introduced the “open office” ( bureau ouvert ) system (the office was open day and night so that the mother could leave her child there secretly, without disclosing her identity; at the same time she could be given information about the consequences of abandoning the child and offered assistance). The tradition of assisting anonymous births led the Vichy government to adopt the Legislative Decree of 2 September 1941 on the protection of births. The legislative decree allowed the mother to give birth anonymously and to receive free medical care during the month preceding and the month following the birth in any public hospital able to provide her with the care her condition required. That provision was repealed and subsequently reintroduced by decrees of 29 November 1953 and 7 January 1959, before being amended in 1986 and becoming first Article 47 of the Family and Welfare Code and then the current Article L. 222-6 of the Social Action and Families Code:",

For the first time, choosing to give birth in secret had an effect on the determination of filiation, as Articles 341 and 341-1 of the Civil Code created an estoppel defence to proceedings to establish maternity: there was no mother in the legal sense of the word:",

Provided the child is less than a year old, its parents may entrust it to the Child Welfare Service and request that their identity be kept secret (former Article 62-4 of the Family and Welfare Code, which later became Article L. 224-5 (4) of the Social Action and Families Code).

                "As far back as 1990 a report by the Conseil d'Etat, entitled “Status and protection of the child”, proposed the setting up of a mediatory body, “the Council for Tracing Family Origins”, to allow information to be communicated and contact to be established between the persons concerned, provided the interested parties consented. The Conseil d'Etat thus emphasised the need for a prior consensual basis before secret information about a child's origins could be disclosed. In that connection, it noted the difficulties inherent in searching for a parent (“this task is rendered all the more difficult by the fact that the administrative authorities currently follow a wide variety of practices with regard to the secrecy of origins. No method for tracing relatives can be established in these conditions. Nonetheless, one consistently finds in practice that a certain amount of information is collected and preserved and, in theory, it could be used. However, it will only become usable if a uniform, clear and simple procedure for collecting and preserving the confidential information relied on is established beforehand”); it also observed that professional secrecy obligations constituted a serious impediment to tracing. For that reason it proposed a compromise that would enable professionals to disregard their confidentiality obligations if they considered it appropriate for the purposes of enabling family origins to be established. In short, the Conseil d'Etat proposed that children should be given a limited right of access to information regarding the identity of their progenitors through the intermediary of a specially created structure that would be responsible for ascertaining the wishes of the parents and facilitating a psychological rapprochement of the parties.",
                "In 1995 a report by Mr Mattéi entitled “Children from here, children from elsewhere – Adoption without borders” proposed preserving the system of secret births, but suggested that it might be possible for non-identifying information to be gathered.",
                "The report of the parliamentary inquiry committee presided over by Laurent Fabius entitled “Rights of the child, uncharted territory”, which was made public on 12 May 1998, proposed reforming the system of anonymous births in these terms:",
                "“It is possible to envisage information on the child's biological filiation being kept with a public institution. Confidential information could be disclosed during the child's minority on a joint application by the mother and child. The right to make such an application could be made subject to conditions concerning the child's capacity or as to minimum age. The right would only be exercisable by the child in person, not its legal representative. Once the child has reached the age of 18, the information would automatically cease to be confidential at the child's request, subject to the mother being informed. In any event, disclosure of the confidential information would be incapable of having any effect on the parental ties the child already enjoyed. ...",
                "A system of this type could initially be established for cases of anonymous births and secret abandonment and subsequently extended, once the legislature considered it appropriate, to births following medically assisted procreation.”",

                "“In view of the extremely serious consequences of anonymous births, which deprive the child of both its paternal and maternal filiation, we propose repealing Article 341-1 of the Civil Code. Putting the child up for adoption voluntarily and responsibly appears to be a more balanced and less painful course for the child.”",

It proposes retaining the system of anonymous births, repealing Article 62-4 of the Family and Welfare Code and encouraging a reversible implementation of a right for mothers to give birth “discreetly” by, for instance, the creation of a body or the appointment of referents who would be responsible for keeping confidential the mother's identity if she has so requested and would also act as mediators.",

It is relatively rare for mothers to be entitled to give birth anonymously under European domestic legislation, as Italy and Luxembourg stand alone in not imposing a statutory obligation on the natural parents to register a newborn child or to state their identity when registering it. Conversely, many countries make it obligatory to provide the names, not only of the mother, to whom the child is automatically linked, but also of the father. The countries concerned are Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Spain (where section 47 of the Law on civil status, which allowed mothers to have the words “mother unknown” entered in the register of births, deaths and marriages, was held to be unconstitutional in a decision of the Supreme Court in 1999), Denmark, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Slovenia and Switzerland.",
                "The current trend in certain countries is towards the acceptance, if not of a right to give birth anonymously, then at least of a right to give birth “discreetly”. An example of this is provided by Belgium, where a debate has begun, largely as a result of the large number of women crossing the border to give birth anonymously in France. In an opinion delivered on 12 January 1998 the Consultative Committee on Bioethics set out the two lines of argument that were defensible from an ethical standpoint: the first considered it unacceptable for children to be brought into the world without parents; for that reason its proponents proposed that facilities for “giving birth discreetly” should be provided, without completely closing the door on all attempts to trace the parents. Proponents of the second line of argument considered that the ethical dilemma posed by the right to give birth anonymously did not result from the need to resolve the conflict arising out of the clash between the respective rights of “the child to filiation” and “the mother in distress”, but from the more fundamental confrontation of two values: the life of the child on the one hand and the right of everyone to know his or her natural mother on the other. They contended that in the face of that dilemma, the primary concern had to be the protection of the life and of the development of the child. For that reason, they considered that giving birth anonymously was perfectly legitimate and acceptable from an ethical standpoint. Likewise, in Germany, in view of the rising number of abandoned newborn infants, the first “baby box” ( Babyklappe ) – a system that allows the mother to leave her child, ring a bell and leave without giving her identity – was installed in Hamburg approximately two years ago. Since then, other “baby boxes” have been installed in other towns. In May 2002 a bill on anonymous births was rejected by the Bundestag. On 21 June 2002 the Land of Baden-Württemberg introduced a further bill in the Bundesrat which was submitted to the relevant committees for presentation to the Bundestag. Yet another example is provided by Hungary, where mothers may decide to remain anonymous by abandoning their newborn child in a special, unsupervised room in the hospital.",

They contended that in the event of a refusal by the Commission for Access to Administrative Documents (CADA) to provide the applicant with identifying information on her natural mother she should seek judicial review by the administrative courts (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” in the Court's admissibility decision of 16 October 2001 in the present case). Accordingly, although the provisions of domestic law that established and protected the right of mothers to keep their identity secret when giving birth meant that that remedy had little prospect of success, the applicant could have pleaded an alleged incompatibility of domestic law with the provisions of the Convention, which was directly applicable in the French legal system."

                "“... the Court notes that Law no. 78/753 of 17 July 1978 on the right of access to administrative documents entitles anyone who has had a request for information turned down by the authorities under sections 6 and 6 bis of the Law to apply to the CADA. However, it is clear from the opinions that have been issued by that body that disclosure of documents held by the authorities will be refused if the mother has expressly stated that she wishes her identity to remain secret. Any subsequent application to the administrative court will also be to no avail, again as a result of the statutory right to confidentiality protected by section 6 of the aforementioned Law. Thus, in the absence of any convincing explanation from the Government showing that the remedy to which they have referred is 'effective' and 'adequate' and in view of the unequivocal nature of the natural mother's request for secrecy, the Court holds that the remedy at the applicant's disposal was not, in the instant case, an ordinary remedy and sufficient to enable her to obtain details of her identity as a human being.”"

                "26. The Government excluded the latter possibility, contending that the guarantee of the right to respect for family life under Article 8 presupposed the existence of a family (see Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31). Although the case-law did not require cohabitation between the various members of the “family”, there had to be at the very least close personal ties. The existence of ties demonstrating an emotional relationship between two beings and a desire to pursue that relationship was essential so far as the Convention institutions were concerned. The Convention institutions had even held that in the absence of close personal ties between those concerned a mere biological link was insufficient to constitute family life within the meaning of Article 8. Thus, the Commission had expressed the opinion that the situation in which a person donated sperm only to enable a woman to become pregnant through artificial insemination did not of itself give the donor a right to respect for family life with the child (see M. v. the Netherlands, no. 16944/90, Commission decision of 8 February 1993, Decision and Reports 74, p. 120). In the instant case, the Government maintained that no family life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention existed between the applicant and her natural mother, as the applicant had never met her mother, while the latter had at no point expressed any interest in the applicant or regarded her as her child. The applicant's natural mother had expressly manifested an intention to abandon the applicant and had agreed to her adoption by others. Only the applicant's family life with her adoptive parents could come within the scope of Article 8."

The Government did not deny that the notion of private life, which is also referred to in Article 8 of the Convention, could sometimes encompass information enabling a person's physical or social identity to be established. They observed that in Gaskin v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 160), the applicant, who had been taken into care at a very early age, wished to consult the confidential case records that had been compiled by the local authorities containing reports by everyone connected with the care proceedings. He was not able to gain access to all the information in his file as some of the contributors refused to provide him with information they had given in confidence. In the present case, the French State had not refused to furnish the applicant with information but had taken into account her mother's refusal from the beginning to allow her identity to be disclosed. As in Gaskin, the application in the present case concerned two competing interests: the applicant's interest in finding out her origins and the interest of a woman who from the outset did not wish to be regarded as the applicant's mother in preserving her private life. However, the applicant's request did not concern information on “highly personal aspects of [her] childhood, development and history”, as her aim was to make contact with her siblings, whose existence she had only discovered on becoming an adult and whom she had never met. The Government said in conclusion that, as it stood, the applicant's request did not come within the scope of “private life” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention, as it concerned information relating to a natural family from which she had been separated since birth following her mother's decision to abandon her."

In the instant case, the Court notes that the applicant's purpose is not to call into question her relationship with her adoptive parents but to discover the circumstances in which she was born and abandoned, including the identity of her natural parents and brothers. For that reason, it considers it necessary to examine the case from the perspective of private life, not family life, since the applicant's claim to be entitled, in the name of biological truth, to know her personal history is based on her inability to gain access to information about her origins and related identifying data."

The preservation of mental stability is in that context an indispensable precondition to effective enjoyment of the right to respect for private life” (see Bensaid v. the United Kingdom, no. 44599/98, § 47, ECHR 2001-I). Matters of relevance to personal development include details of a person's identity as a human being and the vital interest protected by the Convention in obtaining information necessary to discover the truth concerning important aspects of one's personal identity, such as the identity of one's parents (see Mikulić v. Croatia, no. 53176/99, §§ 54 and 64, ECHR 2002-I). Birth, and in particular the circumstances in which a child is born, forms part of a child's, and subsequently the adult's, private life guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention.

In France it was possible to act as if the mother did not exist, whereas in most countries in the world birth automatically created parental ties between the mother and the child she had brought into the world. By a legal fiction and because she had expressly sought confidentiality, the applicant's mother was deemed never to have given birth. The applicant described how difficult it was for her to live without knowing her original identity and complained not only of the arbitrary interference in her life as an ordinary citizen caused by the system used to preserve confidentiality, but also of culpable failure on the part of the domestic authorities through their refusal to disclose the requested information even though it was available in the file."

She said that women who asked for the birth and their identity to be kept secret found themselves in that position mainly through a lack of autonomy, problems related to youth, difficulties in gaining access to the job market, the isolation and financial predicament of single-parent families and domestic violence. In her submission, an anonymous birth therefore constituted an act of violence that was easily avoidable: concerns for the health of mother and child could be addressed without any need to rely on a right to confidentiality that would prevent the child from finding out its origins. In most cases the distress of a mother who was unable to care for her child could be alleviated by providing her with the necessary help or enabling her to make her child available for adoption, not by promising her anonymity. The days when women did not express their feelings after abandoning a child were over. Many women had now formed associations. Society had been given an insight into the trauma that followed from their accounts of their experiences. Despite appearances to the contrary, the child often represented an “emotional investment”, the page was rarely turned and life did not simply go on as if nothing had happened. The argument that it was necessary to reassure the mother in order to prevent infanticide was a thing of the past and unconvincing when the situation in countries which did not allow mothers to give birth anonymously was examined. The health of mother and child was protected in many countries without resorting to a right to confidentiality which prevented the child from ever being able to find out its origins."

In the applicant's submission, the fact that the child was taken into care and could be adopted speedily had absolutely no bearing on the issue of confidentiality, since those consequences followed directly from the child's abandonment, whether or not the mother requested anonymity. It was the irrational fear of certain adoptive parents and adoption agencies that had encouraged the belief that children without a past were easier to adopt. However, adoptive parents could easily be reassured if they were reminded that legal filiation by a full adoption order was irrevocable. As to the emotional tie, an understanding by the adoptive parents of their child's desire to know his or her natural parents and support for him or her in that quest could only serve to strengthen it."

                "33. The search for common ground between irreconcilable points of view had led to the current proposal to replace the right to give birth anonymously with a right to confidentiality that could be waived ex post facto. However, surely a woman's freedom ended where the child's freedom began? The applicant referred to the Gaskin principle that a system that made access to case records conditional on obtaining the contributors' consent would only comply with the principle of proportionality if it made an independent body responsible for taking the final decision regarding access to the records in the event of the contributor failing to answer or withholding consent. In the applicant's submission, in a society which emphasised responsibility for procreation, a natural mother, who even if she was not willing to assume the maternal role could not refute maternity, was not necessarily deserving of the same protection as the third-party contributors referred to in Gaskin. In the instant case, no arrangements had thus far been made to trace the mother and establish whether she still refused to see her daughter. While the setting up of such a procedure was proposed in the law of 22 January 2002, it would in no way lessen the harm that had already been done. However, worse still, in the applicant's submission, was the fact that the new law reaffirmed the notion of secret births, as the mother's right to confidentiality was solemnly restated. The legislature had endeavoured to forestall the claims of children born of anonymous parents and had opted for the course that was the least consistent with the expressed aim. With that piece of legislation, France had made do with warding off the offensive in a way that did nothing to temper the rigours of secrecy, as the new legislation now added but one right, namely the right to seek the mother. Searches had to be made through the National Council for Access to Information on Personal Origins, which had to ensure that the mother whose identity it was required to keep confidential consented to its disclosure to her child. The system set up by the law of 2002 thus continued to mark a blind preference for the mother's alleged interests, in manifest contempt of the rights of the child: the Council was not empowered to analyse the reasons for the mother's refusal, to assess whether they were legitimate or, above all, to ignore a refusal which it considered to have been unreasonable. No final decision could be taken to disclose confidential information after weighing up the relevant interests if the mother continued to withhold her consent. The innovations in the new legislation thus continued to fall foul of the provisions of the Convention, since the mother's statutory right to confidentiality remained intact and was incompatible with the principle of proportionality."

However, the problem posed by secret births was very different: a State could not be afforded a margin of appreciation if, despite the fact that the child's best interest was at stake, it chose to differ from the shared views of the member States of the Council of Europe on the subject. Such was the position with France's legislation on the right to give birth anonymously, even after the enactment of the law of 22 January 2002."

The Government maintained that a woman's right to request that the birth and her identity be kept secret was laid down by Article 341-1 of the Civil Code and amounted to an interference prescribed by law. The interference pursued a legitimate aim, namely alleviating the distress of mothers who did not have the means of bringing up their children. By affording them the option of confidentiality, the French State sought to encourage women in that position to give birth in favourable conditions, rather than alone with the attendant risk that they may not tend to the child's needs. Such situations of distress were by no means rare in France (the number of births to mothers of unknown identity was approximately 600 a year). The Government observed that until the 1960s, when the applicant's natural mother had taken the decision to request that her identity remain secret, neither contraception nor abortion were legal in France. Nowadays, there were three main categories of women who chose to give birth anonymously: young women who were not yet independent, young women still living with their parents in Muslim families originating from North African or sub-Saharan African societies in which pregnancy outside marriage was a great dishonour, and isolated women with financial difficulties (the youngest, many of whom were under 25, were single mothers; many of the older women were over 35 and for the most part separated or divorced or had been abandoned, some being victims of domestic violence, with several children to look after). As to what drove women to seek confidentiality, the Government said that the stated reasons sometimes concealed more serious problems, such as rape or incest, which were not always revealed by those concerned.",
                "Thus, according to the Government, the system took both the mother's and the child's health into account and pursued a public-health objective, which, by protecting the mother's private life, enabled the rights and freedoms of others to be preserved. It enabled the mother to benefit from proper medical facilities and the child to receive all necessary care. Furthermore, the fact that the child was taken into care as a result meant that it could be adopted without delay."

With regard to the proportionality of the interference, the Government said that a request by the child to be given access to information about its identity could come into conflict with the freedom which all women enjoyed to decline their role as mother or to assume responsibility for the child. Under French law, maternity was considered an aspect of private life and received statutory protection on that account (Article 9 of the Civil Code). On the basis of that provision, the Court of Cassation had held that it was a breach of the right to respect for private life to publish, without her consent, information that a woman was pregnant, even though her condition was visible in public. In its judgment in Gaskin, the Court had reiterated the importance of keeping official files confidential if reliable information was to be obtained and third parties protected. The Court had also held that, in view of the State's margin of appreciation, a system that made access to records conditional on the consent of the contributors being obtained could in principle be compatible with Article 8. It had thus ruled that the State enjoyed a margin of appreciation in the event of a conflict between two private interests. That margin of appreciation was enlarged in the instant case by the fact that no European consensus on the issue of a child's access to information about its origins existed. The Government asserted that traditionally only Italy and Luxembourg had joined France in allowing mothers to withhold their identities at the time of the birth. Elsewhere, a debate had begun in recent years in various countries in which the legislation did not permit mothers to give birth anonymously, with a view to possible changes being made to the system. In Belgium a bill that would enable expectant mothers to request that the birth remain secret had been put before the Senate on 30 September 1999 and reintroduced with amendments on 28 May 2002. In Germany a bill proposing measures regulating anonymous births had been lodged in June 2002.

The applicant was free to make use of the provisions of the new legislation and to apply to the National Council for Access to Information about Personal Origins. The machinery established under the legislation satisfied the proportionality requirements contained in the Court's case-law, as the French State took into account the child's interest by regulating access to information about the child's origins while making it easier for the mother to waive confidentiality. Firstly, the mother was invited, as soon as she had given birth, to leave particulars of her identity in a sealed envelope together with non-identifying information, to which the child would have access if it wished. Secondly, considerable efforts were made to trace the mother and to seek her consent to disclosure of her identity to the child.

The Court reiterates that although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91, p. 11, § 23). The boundaries between the State's positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In particular, in both instances regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the competing interests; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Mikulić, cited above, § 58)."

In the Court's opinion, people “have a vital interest, protected by the Convention, in receiving the information necessary to know and to understand their childhood and early development”. With regard to an application by Mr Gaskin for access to the case records held on him by the social services – he was suffering from psychological trauma as a result of ill-treatment to which he said he had been subjected when in State care – the Court stated:",
                "“... confidentiality of public records is of importance for receiving objective and reliable information, and ... such confidentiality can also be necessary for the protection of third persons. Under the latter aspect, a system like the British one, which makes access to records dependent on the consent of the contributor, can in principle be considered to be compatible with the obligations under Article 8, taking into account the State's margin of appreciation. The Court considers, however, that under such a system the interests of the individual seeking access to records relating to his private and family life must be secured when a contributor to the records either is not available or improperly refuses consent. Such a system is only in conformity with the principle of proportionality if it provides that an independent authority finally decides whether access has to be granted in cases where a contributor fails to answer or withholds consent.” ( Gaskin, cited above, p. 20, § 49; see also M.G. v. the United Kingdom, no. 39393/98, § 27, 24 September 2002)",

The Court weighed the vital interest of a person in receiving the information necessary to uncover the truth about an important aspect of his or her personal identity against the interest of third parties in refusing to be compelled to make themselves available for medical testing. It found that the State had a duty to establish alternative means to enable an independent authority to determine the paternity claim speedily. It held that there had been a breach of the proportionality principle as regards the interests of the applicant, who had been left in a state of prolonged uncertainty as to her personal identity (§§ 64-66)."

The issue of access to information about one's origins and the identity of one's natural parents is not of the same nature as that of access to a case record concerning a child in care or to evidence of alleged paternity. The applicant in the present case is an adopted child who is trying to trace another person, her natural mother, by whom she was abandoned at birth and who has expressly requested that information about the birth remain confidential."

                "44. The expression “everyone” in Article 8 of the Convention applies to both the child and the mother. On the one hand, people have a right to know their origins, that right being derived from a wide interpretation of the scope of the notion of private life. The child's vital interest in its personal development is also widely recognised in the general scheme of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Johansen v. Norway, judgment of 7 August 1996, Reports 1996-III, p. 1008, § 78; Mikulić, cited above, § 64; and Kutzner v. Germany, no. 46544/99, § 66, ECHR 2002-I). On the other hand, a woman's interest in remaining anonymous in order to protect her health by giving birth in appropriate medical conditions cannot be denied. In the present case, the applicant's mother never went to see the baby at the clinic and appears to have greeted their separation with total indifference (see paragraph 12 above). Nor is it alleged that she subsequently expressed the least desire to meet her daughter. The Court's task is not to judge that conduct, but merely to take note of it. The two private interests with which the Court is confronted in the present case are not easily reconciled; moreover, they do not concern an adult and a child, but two adults, each endowed with her own free will.",
                "In addition to that conflict of interest, the problem of anonymous births cannot be dealt with in isolation from the issue of the protection of third parties, essentially the adoptive parents, the father and the other members of the natural family. The Court notes in that connection that the applicant is now 38 years old, having been adopted at the age of four, and that non-consensual disclosure could entail substantial risks, not only for the mother herself, but also for the adoptive family which brought up the applicant, and her natural father and siblings, each of whom also has a right to respect for his or her private and family life."

The Court observes that most of the Contracting States do not have legislation that is comparable to that applicable in France, at least as regards the child's permanent inability to establish parental ties with the natural mother if she continues to keep her identity secret from the child she has brought into the world. However, it notes that some countries do not impose a duty on natural parents to declare their identities on the birth of their children and that there have been cases of child abandonment in various other countries that have given rise to renewed debate about the right to give birth anonymously. In the light not only of the diversity of practice to be found among the legal systems and traditions but also of the fact that various means are being resorted to for abandoning children, the Court concludes that States must be afforded a margin of appreciation to decide which measures are apt to ensure that the rights guaranteed by the Convention are secured to everyone within their jurisdiction."

In addition, while preserving the principle that mothers may give birth anonymously, the system recently set up in France improves the prospect of their agreeing to waive confidentiality, something which, it will be noted in passing, they have always been able to do even before the enactment of the law of 22 January 2002. The new legislation will facilitate searches for information about a person's biological origins, as a National Council for Access to Information about Personal Origins has been set up. That council is an independent body composed of members of the national legal service, representatives of associations having an interest in the subject matter of the law and professional people with good practical knowledge of the issues. The legislation is already in force and the applicant may use it to request disclosure of her mother's identity, subject to the latter's consent being obtained to ensure that her need for protection and the applicant's legitimate request are fairly reconciled. Indeed, though unlikely, the possibility that the applicant will be able to obtain the information she is seeking through the new Council that has been set up by the legislature cannot be excluded.",

The Court observes in that connection that the States must be allowed to determine the means which they consider to be best suited to achieve the aim of reconciling those interests. Overall, the Court considers that France has not overstepped the margin of appreciation which it must be afforded in view of the complex and sensitive nature of the issue of access to information about one's origins, an issue that concerns the right to know one's personal history, the choices of the natural parents, the existing family ties and the adoptive parents.",

After evaluating the surveillance file it found that the medical reports contradicted the images and videos showing the applicant walking her dog, driving a car long distances, going shopping, carrying groceries and opening the boot of the car by moving her arms above her head without noticeable restrictions or unusual behaviour. Moreover, it found that there were discrepancies, not only between the results of the surveillance and the medical reports but also between the medical reports which had been drafted before the surveillance. Finally, the examination of the applicant by a neurologist was necessary and admissible because she had previously refused to undergo an assessment of her functional capacities and a neurological examination, which were required in the circumstances. Accordingly, the Federal Court denied the probative value not only of the medical reports attesting to the applicant ’ s complete incapacity to work but also of the reports attesting to her incapacity to work of a lesser degree. Therefore, the insurance company had acted correctly in ordering a reassessment of her ability to work through a critical review of all previous medical reports. Following an analysis of this expert opinion report based on evidence, the Federal Court held that its findings were convincing.

                "“ 4.2 The respondent is an insurance company, which is registered as an authorised insurer in the Register for the implementation of compulsory accident insurance within the meaning of Article 68 UVG. As such, it is considered a public authority within the meaning of Article 1 § 2 ( e ) VwVG ... To the extent that it can deliver binding decisions to insured persons, and thus exercises sovereign powers, it has to respect not only the procedural guarantees of administrative law, but also general constitutional principles, in particular fundamental rights. ...",
                "4.3 The aim of surveillance of an insured person by private detectives is to collect and confirm facts which materialise in the public domain and may be observed by anyone (for example, walking, climbing stairs, driving, carrying loads or performing sports activities). Even when the surveillance is ordered by an authority, it does not give the person undertaking the surveillance the right to interfere with the privacy of the insured person. Unlike a judicially ordered surveillance – for instance, in the context of the Federal Act of 6 October 2000 on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications (BÜPF; SR 780.1) – the protection of the insured person from crime remains intact, since private detectives acting on the strength of an administrative order are not allowed to commit criminal acts. In particular, the person in charge of the surveillance has to keep to the framework set up by Article 179 quater of the Criminal Code. In contrast to a covert investigation pursuant to the Federal Law of 20 June 2003 on the undercover investigation ... it is not the purpose of such surveillance for the investigating person to create links with the person subject to the surveillance so as to penetrate into their environment ...",
                "5.4 Given that, pursuant to Article 43 [of the Social Security Act] it is incumbent on the insurer to make the necessary clarifications, the said provision – at least in conjunction with Article 28 ( 2 ) [of the Social Security Act], which sets out a general obligation on the insured person to provide information – represents a basis for ordering surveillance. It must, however, be examined whether these provisions are sufficiently clear to serve as a legal basis within the meaning of Article 36 § 1 [of the Constitution].",
                "5.4.2 Regular surveillance of insured persons by private detectives represents in any case a relatively minor interference with the fundamental rights of the individual concerned, in particular if it is limited to the area defined at point 4.3 [above] and thus restricted to the public space ... Part of the literature represents the view that surveillance which is limited to such an extent does not even affect the scope of the fundamental right of privacy ( Ueli Kieser, supra). The core content of Article 13 [of the Constitution] is not affected by the institution of such surveillance. In principle, information obtained from insured persons, their employers and healthcare professionals is sufficient for a reliable assessment of claims for benefits; further investigation by a private detective is indicated only in a vanishingly small percentage of persons registered with accident insurance cases ... Ordering of secret surveillance is thus of an exceptional nature, as it will only take place if the other clarification measures fail to produce a conclusive result. The overall legal basis for the restriction of the fundamental rights of insured persons is thus sufficiently precise ...",
                "5.7 To sum up, it should be concluded that ordering surveillance of insured persons by accident insurers in the context outlined in point 4.3 [above] is permitted; the results of such surveillance can thus in principle be used for assessment of the issues in question ... The probative value of the records and reports of private investigators can, however, only be granted in so far as they indicate activities and actions which the insured person has exercised without being influenced by those engaging in the surveillance ... ”",

Under normal circumstances the information provided by the insured persons, their employer and doctors was sufficient to conduct a reliable assessment of an insurance benefit claim. Surveillance by a private investigator was requested only in a small proportion of cases when other measures of examination had proved inconclusive and the insured person had not fulfilled her or his obligation to provide the requested information. In these circumstances, surveillance aimed at systematically collecting and retaining data on facts that happened in the public arena and that anyone could note, for example the observed person ’ s way of walking, climbing the stairs, driving, carrying loads or exercising."

As to the first condition, surveillance would be permissible virtually any time that a victim of a traffic accident claimed a large amount in damages, which was usually the case. As to the second condition, the applicant pointed out that the findings of the medical reports did not depend on the victim of the accident, but on the medical experts in charge, who had often been commissioned by the insurance company itself."

In particular, the Federal Court repeatedly recognised that Article 43, read in conjunction with Article 28 (2) of the Social Security Act and Article 96 (b) of the Accident Insurance Act formed a sufficient legal basis for the surveillance of an insured person. The said provisions prescribed surveillance as a measure of last resort used when the insured person did not comply with her or his obligation to provide information requested and the insurance company had to process certain data necessary for it to perform the tasks assigned to it in domestic law. The law allowed the collection of data only in public spaces for a limited period of time and made it available only to a restricted number of persons."

According to the case-law of the Federal Court, the domestic law did not allow intrusion into the intimate sphere of the person being watched, or the commission of any punishable acts against him or her. Insured persons were protected against the abuse of surveillance measures by a number of domestic law provisions, namely Article 28 of the Civil Code and Article 179 quater of the Criminal Code. In particular, it was forbidden to contact the insured person in order to interfere with her or his life, surveillance could be performed only for a limited period of time, and collected data could be seen only by a small number of people for the fulfilment of the insurer ’ s legal tasks."

Pursuant to the Court ’ s case-law, the expression “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 requires, firstly, that the measure should have some basis in domestic law. It also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring it to be accessible to the person concerned, who must, moreover, be able to foresee its consequences for him. It must also be compatible with the rule of law (see, among many other authorities, Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 52, ECHR 2000 ‑ V; Uzun, cited above, § 60; and Kennedy, cited above, § 151)."

The Court has held on several occasions that the reference to “foreseeability” in the context of secret surveillance measures by State authorities could not be the same as in many other fields (see, as a most recent authority, Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, § 229, 4 December 2015). Foreseeability in that specific context cannot mean that individuals should be able to foresee when the authorities are likely to resort to secret surveillance so that they can adapt their conduct accordingly. However, especially where a power vested in the executive is exercised in secret, the risks of arbitrariness are evident. The domestic law must be sufficiently clear to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances and conditions under which public authorities are empowered to resort to any such measures (see Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 51, Series A no. 116; Uzun, cited above, §§ 61-63; Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev v. Bulgaria, no. 62540/00, §§ 75, 28 June 2007; and Shimovolos v. Russia, no. 30194/09, § 68, 21 June 2011 ). In view of the risk of abuse intrinsic to any system of secret surveillance, such measures must be based on a law that is particularly precise, especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated (see Uzun, cited above, § 61)."

In addition, in the context of secret measures of surveillance by public authorities, because of the lack of public scrutiny and the risk of abuse of power, compatibility with the rule of law requires domestic law to provide adequate protection against arbitrary interference with Article 8 rights. The Court ’ s assessment in this respect depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to permit, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law (see Uzun, cited above, § 63 ).",

Turning to the present case, it is not in dispute that the surveillance measure applied to the applicant was based on Article 43 read in conjunction with Article 28 (2) of the Social Security Act and Article 96 (b) of the Accident Insurance Act (see § § 3 8 and 40 above). These articles, read together, provide that when an insured person does not comply with the obligation to submit the requested information, insurance companies are allowed to take of their own motion the necessary investigative measures and collect necessary information. In particular, they are allowed to process and require to have processed personal data, including sensitive data and personality profiles necessary in order to establish rights to benefits and to calculate, allocate and coordinate them with those from other social insurance funds."

In determining whether the provisions of domestic law on which the applicant ’ s surveillance was based complied with the requirement of “foreseeability”, the Court notes that the said provisions were limited to obliging the insured persons to “provide all information necessary to establish their rights” ( Article 28 (2) of the Social Security Act), allowing insurance companies to “take investigative measures and collect the necessary information ” ( Article 43 of the Social Security Act) as well as to “process and require [the processing of] personal data” ( Article 96 of the Accident Insurance Act) in order to carry out their duties when an insured person refused to cooperate by providing the necessary information herself or himself. In the Court ’ s view, the said expressions did not seem to either expressly include or even imply the recording of images or videos among the investigative measures that could be deployed by insurance companies. However, it observes that the domestic courts, which are primarily called upon to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among many other authorities, Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, § 59, Reports 1998 ‑ II), concluded that the said provisions covered surveillance in such circumstances (see §§ 35 and 43 above)."

In examining whether domestic law contained adequate and effective guarantees against abuse, the Court takes note of the Government ’ s argument that Article 28 of the Civil Code and Article 179 quater of the Criminal Code, coupled with the case-law of the Federal Court (see § 43 above), constituted sufficient safeguards against abuse of secret surveillance measures as they restricted the measure to the actions taken in public and forbid the making of contact with the insured person with the aim of interfering in his or her life."

In particular, the Court observes that neither the above provisions nor the cited jurisprudence indicated any procedures to follow for the authorisation or supervision of the implementation of secret surveillance measures in the specific context of insurance disputes. Furthermore, in the absence of any details as regards the maximum duration of the surveillance measures or the possibility of their judicial challenge, insurance companies (acting as public authorities) were granted a wide discretion in deciding which circumstances justified such surveillance and for how long. It can thus not be said that the domestic law had set a strict standard for authorising the surveillance measure at issue (see, a contrario, Uzun, cited above, § 70)."

Moreover, the said legal provisions equally remained silent on the procedures to be followed for storing, accessing, examining, using, communicating or destroying the data collected through secret measures of surveillance. It thus remained unclear where and how long the report containing the impugned footage and photographs of the applicant would remain stored, which persons would have access to it and whether she had any legal means of contesting the handling of the said report. The foregoing necessarily increased the risk of unauthorised access to, or disclosure of, the surveillance materials."

The Government further argued that the interference with the applicant ’ s right to privacy by way of secret surveillance was relatively small in the light of the public interests at stake, namely the prevention of insurance fraud and, ultimately, ensuring the proper management of public funds. In the Government ’ s view, this placed in context the need for clarity and precision of the legal basis of the surveillance in question. While the Court can agree that surveillance in the present case must be considered to interfere less with a person ’ s private life than, for instance, telephone tapping, it nonetheless has to adhere to general principles on adequate protection against arbitrary interference with Article 8 rights as summarised above (see § 68 above; see also Uzun, cited above, §§ 66 and 72 )."

In particular, it did not, as required by the Court ’ s case-law, set out sufficient safeguards against abuse. The interference with the applicant ’ s rights under Article 8 was not, therefore, “in accordance with the law” and there has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention."

Only an assessment of the surveillance report by a doctor could have led to certainty about the facts. If a private insurance company appointed a private investigator to lawfully monitor a person, Article 96 (b) of the Accident Insurance Act and 43 (1) read in conjunction with Article 61 (c) of the Social Security Act formed the legal basis for the use of the evidence collected ( namely the surveillance report and the video recording) by the Swiss National Accident Insurance Fund."

In a similar vein, the Court is ready to accept that it should be open to the authorities to refuse a claim to be officially recorded as belonging to a particular ethnicity where such a claim is based on purely subjective and unsubstantiated grounds. In the instant case, however, the applicant appears to have been confronted with a legal requirement which made it impossible for him to adduce any evidence in support of his claim. This is precisely because section 68 of the Law on Documents pertaining to Civil Status and the current practice of recording ethnic identity create insurmountable barriers for someone wishing to have recorded an ethnic identity different from that recorded in respect of his or her parents by the Soviet authorities. According to this section the applicant could change his ethnic identity only if he could show that one of his parents had been recorded as being of Romanian ethnicity in the official records, which represented a disproportionate burden in view of the historical realities of the Republic of Moldova (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above)."

Having regard to the circumstances of the case as a whole, it cannot be said that the procedure in place to enable the applicant to have his recorded ethnicity changed complied with Moldova's positive obligations to safeguard his right to respect for his private life. For the Court, the State's failure consists in the inability for the applicant to have examined his claim to belong to a certain ethnic group in the light of the objectively verifiable evidence adduced in support of that claim. The Court therefore concludes that the authorities failed to comply with their positive obligation to secure to the applicant the effective respect for his private life. There has, accordingly, been a breach of Article 8 of the Convention.",

In the applicant's opinion, the State's policy of imposing by force the Moldovan ethnic identity on him and on others amounted to xenophobia as it was not in accordance with any democratic values and did not promote the value of pluralism, inherent in a democratic society. The applicant denied the Government's argument that he needed to be indicated as an ethnic Romanian in the records in order to obtain Romanian citizenship. He argued that according to the law of Romania, Romanian citizenship was issued to former Romanian citizens and their descendants irrespective of ethnic origin. The applicant contended that the State had placed on him an excessive and insurmountable burden by requesting documentary evidence of his Romanian origin in circumstances in which it was common ground that almost all the representatives of the majority ethnic group had been deliberately recorded as ethnic Moldovans during the Soviet era. Moreover, the applicant had been placed in a position of substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis the Government, which did not have to produce any evidence of his Moldovan ethnic identity."

There was a need for evidence but not for arguments based on an alleged scientific and historical truth. The Government submitted that the applicant was the only person who had ever instituted proceedings with a view to changing his ethnic identity from Moldovan to Romanian. They had to rely therefore on a similar case concerning other ethnic identities, namely on the domestic judgment in the case of Caragheorghi, where a person had been able to have his ethnic identity changed from Gagauz to Greek on the basis of evidence proving the Greek ethnic identity of one of his ancestors ( see paragraph 22 above ). At the same time they drew attention to section 68 of the Law on Documents pertaining to Civil Status, which clearly stated that it was impossible to rectify the ethnic identity of one's parents in their children's birth certificates, on the basis of identity papers of grandparents or other ascendants, if the parents'civil status documents did not contain information concerning the requested ethnic identity."

The Government asked a rhetorical question as to what might happen if a significant number of Moldovan nationals declared themselves to be ethnic French, German or English and were recorded as such solely on the basis of their declarations. In the Government's view such a situation could constitute an abuse in respect of other countries. The Government suggested that the applicant's desire to be recorded as an ethnic Romanian might be motivated by his intention to obtain Romanian citizenship and argued that it was within the Government's margin of appreciation to determine the extent to which requests concerning changes in records concerning ethnic origin could be accepted. In any event, the Convention was to be interpreted in the light of present circumstances and not in the light of the history of a period during which the Convention was not yet in existence."

                "49. The Court reiterates that the concept of “private life” is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 61, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Y.F. v. Turkey, no. 24209/94, § 33, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX ). The notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the guarantees provided for by Article 8. Under this principle protection is given to the personal sphere of each individual, including the right to establish details of their identity as individual human beings (see Burghartz v. Switzerland, 22 February 1994, § 24, Series A no. 280 ‑ B; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 90, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI ). The Court has held that gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life were details pertaining to an individual's identity falling within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 (see, among other authorities, Bensaid v. the United Kingdom, no. 44599/98, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ I with further references, and Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ I ). In a more recent judgment, in the case of S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom ( [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 66, 4 December 2008 ), the Court further held that ethnic identity was also a detail pertaining to the individual's identity falling within the ambit of Article 8."

Although the object of Article 8 is essentially to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference. There may, in addition to this primary negative undertaking, be positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, § 23, Series A no. 91). The boundaries between the State's positive and negative obligations under this provision do not always lend themselves to precise definition; nonetheless, the applicable principles are similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole, and in both contexts the State is recognised as enjoying a certain margin of appreciation (see Paulík v. Slovakia, no. 10699/05, § 43, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI (extracts) )."

The Court reiterates that in the assessment of the present case it should be borne in mind that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 24, Series A no. 32 ). Whilst Article 8 contains no explicit procedural requirements, it is important for the effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by this provision that the relevant decision ‑ making process is fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded by it. Such a process may require the existence of an effective procedural framework whereby an applicant can assert his or her rights under Article 8 under conditions of fairness, including as regards matters of proof and evidence. The Court recalls in this latter connection that in the case of I. v. Finland ( no. 20511/03, § 44, 17 July 2008 ) in finding a violation of Article 8 of the Convention the Court gave weight to the fact that the State had placed too heavy a burden of proof on the applicant in civil proceedings in which she sought compensation for the dissemination of information about her medical condition."

It therefore stresses from the outset that, for the purposes of the present judgment, it will distance itself from the debate within Moldovan society concerning the ethnic identity of the main ethnic group and will take as a working basis the legislation of the Republic of Moldova and the official position of the respondent State (see paragraphs 15 and 23 above) when referring to Moldovans and Romanians."

                "53. As noted above, along with such aspects as name, gender, religion and sexual orientation, an individual's ethnic identity constitutes an essential aspect of his or her private life and identity. This must be particularly true in the current social setting of the Republic of Moldova, where the problem of ethnic identity has been the subject matter of social tension and heated debate for a long time and, more importantly, where an individual's recorded ethnic identity, unlike other recorded aspects of identity, is decisive for the determination of the ethnic identity of his or her children and of the next generations. Accordingly, the facts of the present case fall within the ambit of “private life” under Article 8 of the Convention and since the authorities refused to record the applicant's declared ethnic identity, he may claim to be a victim of a breach of the provisions of this Article. The Court therefore dismisses the Government's preliminary objection (see paragraph 32 above)."

In a similar vein, the Court is ready to accept that it should be open to the authorities to refuse a claim to be officially recorded as belonging to a particular ethnicity where such a claim is based on purely subjective and unsubstantiated grounds. In the instant case, however, the applicant appears to have been confronted with a legal requirement which made it impossible for him to adduce any evidence in support of his claim. This is precisely because section 68 of the Law on Documents pertaining to Civil Status and the current practice of recording ethnic identity create insurmountable barriers for someone wishing to have recorded an ethnic identity different from that recorded in respect of his or her parents by the Soviet authorities. According to this section the applicant could change his ethnic identity only if he could show that one of his parents had been recorded as being of Romanian ethnicity in the official records, which represented a disproportionate burden in view of the historical realities of the Republic of Moldova (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above)."

Having regard to the circumstances of the case as a whole, it cannot be said that the procedure in place to enable the applicant to have his recorded ethnicity changed complied with Moldova's positive obligations to safeguard his right to respect for his private life. For the Court, the State's failure consists in the inability for the applicant to have examined his claim to belong to a certain ethnic group in the light of the objectively verifiable evidence adduced in support of that claim. The Court therefore concludes that the authorities failed to comply with their positive obligation to secure to the applicant the effective respect for his private life.

The Court recalls that, in certain circumstances, it has struck out of its list cases where it has taken the view that the nature of the complaint did not allow it to be transferred to a relative because it was so closely linked to the person of the deceased that the heirs could not claim to have a sufficient interest to justify the continuation of the examination of the application ( see X v. France, judgment of 31 March 1992, Series A no. 234 ‑ C, p. 11, § 26). However, in the present case the Court considers that the close relatives of Laimutis Armonas, in particular his spouse and their minor child, have an interest of their own to ensure that his right to privacy is respected even if he died before the final domestic decision, as any statement violating this right not only affected the deceased ’ s reputation but also that of his family (see, mutatis mutandis, Nölkenbockhoff v.

Moreover, the family had had to leave their village because of the adverse effects of the newspaper article on their relations with their neighbours (paragraph 2 6 above). Consequently, the Court is of the opinion that the link between the publication and the deceased is not exclusive and it cannot be claimed that the article had no bearing at all on the person of the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Funke v.

However, the Court emphasises that a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him or her of the status of a “victim” unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ III, § 36). The Court recognises that the domestic courts determined the violation of the husband ’ s right to private and family life. However, the Court finds that the question of victim status as regards the redress for this violation is inextricably linked to the merits of the complaint. Therefore, it considers that both questions should be joined and examined together.

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure the right even in the sphere of the relations between individuals (see Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, § 75, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... )."

In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole ( see Von Hannover v. Germany, no. 59320/00, § 57, ECHR 2004 ‑ VI ).

The Court takes particular note of the fact that the family lived not in a city but in a village, which increased the impact of the publication on the possibility that the husband ’ s illness would be known by his neighbours and his immediate family, thereby causing public humiliation and exclusion from village social life.

In the Court ’ s view, the publication of the article in question, the sole purpose of which was apparently to satisfy the prurient curiosity of a particular readership, cannot be deemed to contribute to any debate of general interest to society (see, among many authorities, Prisma Presse v.

The Court also notes that the domestic courts indeed awarded the husband compensation for non-pecuniary damage. However the principal issue is whether the award of LTL 10,000 was proportionate to the damage he sustained and whether the State, in adopting Article 54 § 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public, which limited the amount of such compensation payable by the mass media, fulfilled its positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention."

The Court likewise takes note of the fact that the Member States of the Council of Europe may regulate questions of compensation for non-pecuniary damage differently, as well as the fact that the imposition of financial limits is not in itself incompatible with a State ’ s positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention.

The Court observes, however, that the present case differs from the one referred to above in that in the present case the applicant did not dispute the fact of his service in the KGB. It would appear that the question of whether the publication amounted to a disproportionate interference with the private life of the person falling under the Disclosure Act could be raised either through challenging the Estonian Internal Security Service ’ s initial notice or the actual publication of the announcement in Riigi Teataja Lisa. The Court notes that in the present case, although the applicant did not use the possibility to contest the notice, the administrative courts nevertheless examined on the merits his complaint against the publication of the announcement.

Estonia lost its independence as a result of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (also known as “Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact”), concluded on 23 August 1939, and the secret additional protocols to it. Following an ultimatum to set up Soviet military bases in Estonia in 1939, a large-scale entry of the Soviet army into Estonia took place in June 1940. The lawful government of the country was overthrown and Soviet rule was imposed by force. Interrupted by the German occupation in 1941-1944, Estonia remained occupied by the Soviet Union until its restoration of independence in 1991 (see Kolk and Kislyiy v. Estonia (dec.), nos. 23052/04 and 24018/04, ECHR 2006 ‑ I, and Penart v. Estonia (dec.), no. 14685/04, 24 January 2006 ).

The court has no ground to take a different position in this question relating to the security risks. The Estonian State cannot establish decades later with absolute certainty whether a specific driver performed merely technical or also substantial tasks. Thus, one has to proceed from the possibility that a KGB driver may also pose a potential security risk and the disclosure of the information about him may be in the public interests. Therefore, it is proportionate to apply the [Disclosure Act] in respect of the persons who worked as drivers in the security or intelligence organisations. Thereby account must be taken of the fact that the publication of the announcement and the indirect interferences caused by that were not inevitably foreseen by law; the [applicant] could have prevented these consequences by making a confession pursuant to ... the [Disclosure Act].”"

                "41. On 27 June 1996 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe ( PACE ) adopted Resolution 1096 (1996) on measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems. It reads, in so far as relevant:",
                "“ 1. The heritage of former communist totalitarian systems is not an easy one to handle. On an institutional level this heritage includes (over)centralisation, the militarisation of civilian institutions, bureaucratisation, monopolisation, and over-regulation; on the level of society, it reaches from collectivism and conformism to blind obedience and other totalitarian thought patterns. To re-establish a civilised, liberal state under the rule of law on this basis is difficult - this is why the old structures and thought patterns have to be dismantled and overcome.",
                "3. The dangers of a failed transition process are manifold. At best, oligarchy will reign instead of democracy, corruption instead of the rule of law, and organised crime instead of human rights. At worst, the result could be the \"velvet restoration\" of a totalitarian regime, if not a violent overthrow of the fledgling democracy. In that worst case, the new undemocratic regime of a bigger country can present also an international danger for its weaker neighbours. The key to peaceful coexistence and a successful transition process lies in striking the delicate balance of providing justice without seeking revenge.",
                "4. Thus a democratic state based on the rule of law must, in dismantling the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems, apply the procedural means of such a state. It cannot apply any other means, since it would then be no better than the totalitarian regime which is to be dismantled. A democratic state based on the rule of law has sufficient means at its disposal to ensure that the cause of justice is served and the guilty are punished - it cannot, and should not, however, cater to the desire for revenge instead of justice. It must instead respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as the right to due process and the right to be heard, and it must apply them even to those people who, when they were in power, did not apply them themselves. A state based on the rule of law can also defend itself against a resurgence of the communist totalitarian threat, since it has ample means at its disposal which do not conflict with human rights and the rule of law, and are based upon the use of both criminal justice and administrative measures.",
                "5. The Assembly recommends that member states dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian regimes by restructuring the old legal and institutional systems, a process which should be based on the principle(s) of:",
                "i. demilitarisation, to ensure that the militarisation of essentially civilian institutions, such as the existence of military prison administration or troops of the Ministry of the Interior, which is typical of communist totalitarian systems, comes to an end;",
                "ii. decentralisation, especially at local and regional levels and within state institutions;",
                "iii. demonopolisation and privatisation, which are central to the construction of some kind of a market economy and of a pluralist society;",
                "iv. debureaucratisation, which should reduce communist totalitarian over-regulation and transfer the power from the bureaucrats back to the citizens.",
                "6. This process must include a transformation of mentalities (a transformation of hearts and minds) whose main goal should be to eliminate the fear of responsibility, and to eliminate as well the disrespect for diversity, extreme nationalism, intolerance, racism and xenophobia, which are part of the heritage of the old regimes. All of these should be replaced by democratic values such as tolerance, respect for diversity, subsidiarity and accountability for one ’ s actions.",
                "7. The Assembly also recommends that criminal acts committed by individuals during the communist totalitarian regime be prosecuted and punished under the standard criminal code. If the criminal code provides for a statute of limitations for some crimes, this can be extended, since it is only a procedural, not a substantive matter. Passing and applying retroactive criminal laws is, however, not permitted. On the other hand, the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which at the time when it was committed did not constitute a criminal offence according to national law, but which was considered criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations, is permitted. Moreover, where a person clearly acted in violation of human rights, the claim of having acted under orders excludes neither illegality nor individual guilt.",
                "8. The Assembly recommends that the prosecution of individual crimes go hand-in-hand with the rehabilitation of people convicted of \"crimes\" which in a civilised society do not constitute criminal acts, and of those who were unjustly sentenced. Material compensation should also be awarded to these victims of totalitarian justice, and should not be (much) lower than the compensation accorded to those unjustly sentenced for crimes under the standard penal code in force.",
                "9. The Assembly welcomes the opening of secret service files for public examination in some former communist totalitarian countries. It advises all countries concerned to enable the persons affected to examine, upon their request, the files kept on them by the former secret services.",
                "11. Concerning the treatment of persons who did not commit any crimes that can be prosecuted in accordance with paragraph 7, but who nevertheless held high positions in the former totalitarian communist regimes and supported them, the Assembly notes that some states have found it necessary to introduce administrative measures, such as lustration or decommunisation laws. The aim of these measures is to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they cannot be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles, as they have shown no commitment to or belief in them in the past and have no interest or motivation to make the transition to them now.",
                "12. The Assembly stresses that, in general, these measures can be compatible with a democratic state under the rule of law if several criteria are met. Firstly, guilt, being individual, rather than collective, must be proven in each individual case - this emphasises the need for an individual, and not collective, application of lustration laws. Secondly, the right of defence, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed. Revenge may never be a goal of such measures, nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed. The aim of lustration is not to punish people presumed guilty - this is the task of prosecutors using criminal law - but to protect the newly emerged democracy.",
                "13. The Assembly thus suggests that it be ensured that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law, and focus on threats to fundamental human rights and the democratisation process ... ”"

                "“ 2. The totalitarian communist regimes which ruled in central and eastern Europe in the last century, and which are still in power in several countries in the world, have been, without exception, characterised by massive violations of human rights. The violations have differed depending on the culture, country and the historical period and have included individual and collective assassinations and executions, death in concentration camps, starvation, deportations, torture, slave labour and other forms of mass physical terror, persecution on ethnic or religious grounds, violation of freedom of conscience, thought and expression, of freedom of the press, and also lack of political pluralism.",
                "3. The crimes were justified in the name of the class struggle theory and the principle of dictatorship of the proletariat. The interpretation of both principles legitimised the “elimination” of people who were considered harmful to the construction of a new society and, as such, enemies of the totalitarian communist regimes. A vast number of victims in every country concerned were its own nationals. It was the case particularly of the peoples of the former USSR who by far outnumbered other peoples in terms of the number of victims.",
                "5. The fall of totalitarian communist regimes in central and eastern Europe has not been followed in all cases by an international investigation of the crimes committed by them. Moreover, the authors of these crimes have not been brought to trial by the international community, as was the case with the horrible crimes committed by National Socialism (Nazism).",
                "6. Consequently, public awareness of crimes committed by totalitarian communist regimes is very poor. Communist parties are legal and active in some countries, even if in some cases they have not distanced themselves from the crimes committed by totalitarian communist regimes in the past.",
                "7. The Assembly is convinced that the awareness of history is one of the preconditions for avoiding similar crimes in the future. Furthermore, moral assessment and condemnation of crimes committed play an important role in the education of young generations. The clear position of the international community on the past may be a reference for their future actions.",
                "8. Moreover, the Assembly believes that those victims of crimes committed by totalitarian communist regimes who are still alive or their families, deserve sympathy, understanding and recognition for their sufferings.",

Furthermore, it calls on all communist or post-communist parties in its member states which have not yet done so to reassess the history of communism and their own past, clearly distance themselves from the crimes committed by totalitarian communist regimes and condemn them without any ambiguity.",

The Court observes, however, that the present case differs from the one referred to above in that in the present case the applicant did not dispute the fact of his service in the KGB. It would appear that the question of whether the publication amounted to a disproportionate interference with the private life of the person falling under the Disclosure Act could be raised either through challenging the Estonian Internal Security Service ’ s initial notice or the actual publication of the announcement in Riigi Teataja Lisa.

Secondly, as concerns the fact that the opinion of the Chancellor of Justice – according to which the Disclosure Act was not unconstitutional (see paragraph 23 above) – was known to the domestic courts, it is not for the Court to speculate whether the domestic courts would have decided the applicant ’ s case differently if they would have dealt with it before the Chancellor of Justice gave his opinion.

He argued that it was unclear on the basis of which evidence he was deemed as an occupier and why he was considered to be dangerous.

The Government pointed out that for the transfer from a totalitarian regime to a democratic system, Estonia took various measures which, in aggregate, had to ensure the development and security of the democratic system. Criminal liability for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed under the totalitarian regime was established and an obligation to take an oath of conscience was introduced for those seeking the highest offices in the country. The Disclosure Act dealt with the persons who had not committed any crimes but had been employed by or collaborated with the intelligence or counterintelligence authorities of the States which had occupied Estonia. It was found that such persons had to come to terms with their past and not to try to forget, conceal or be silent about it. There was also a significant public interest in the publicity of information relating to the past; this had to guarantee transparency and clarity as well as overall internal peace in the society. Obtaining complete information about the members and agents of the security and intelligence authorities which had operated on the territory of Estonia was also important for the protection of independence and security of the Republic of Estonia. Estonia was lacking the relevant information; such information, including the lists of persons who had worked in the KGB, was in the hands of foreign States. There could be attempts to recruit former staff of the security authorities and make them perform security or intelligence tasks, or they could be subject to blackmailing.

As regards the question whether it was necessary to also disclose information about persons who, as the applicant, had worked as drivers, the Government argued that the formal job title was not decisive as the drivers could also perform other tasks, especially in rural regions where the applicant had worked. There had even been separate positions formally combining the tasks of the driver with other functions, such as “driver-intelligence officer” dealing with secret surveillance, and for some of the drivers the driver ’ s position had been a step for advancement to the next, “more important” position, like that of an operative agent or intelligence officer.

The Court concludes that the interference in question pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8, namely the protection of national security and public safety, the prevention of disorder as well as well as the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (compare, mutatis mutandis, Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, §§ 54-55 )."

                "59. Accordingly, the Court proceeds to the examination of whether the measure was “necessary in a democratic society”. The Court observes in this connection that there is no uniform approach among High Contracting Parties as to the measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems (see Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, § 36, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII ). Different measures have been applied and their application has given rise to a number of cases before the Court concerning a variety of issues such as restrictions on the persons ’ eligibility to stand for elections (see Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV, and Ādamsons v. Latvia, no. 3669/03, 24 June 2008) or to their employment (see Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323; Volkmer v. Germany (dec.), no. 39799/98, 22 November 2001; Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above; Rainys and Gasparavičius v. Lithuania, nos. 70665/01 and 74345/01, 7 April 2005; and Žičkus v. Lithuania, no. 26652/02, 7 April 2009) as well as lack of access to the information on the basis of which the persons ’ collaboration with former secret services was established (see Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, 24 April 2007) or reduction of pensions of the persons concerned (see Cichopek and Others v. Poland (dec.) no. 15189/10 and other applications, 14 May 2013). Against this background, the Court turns to the proportionality analysis of the impugned measures in the present case."

            [
                "60. The Court reiterates that in a number of previous cases it has criticised the lack of individualisation of the impugned measures. Thus, in Ādamsons it considered that the group of persons – former KGB agents – to which the restrictions to stand for elections applied, had been designed in a too broad manner without having regard to the period of service of the persons concerned, specific tasks assigned to them or their individual behaviour (see Ādamsons, cited above, § 125). Similarly, in Žičkus the lack of differentiation in domestic law between different levels of former involvement with the KGB was pointed out by the Court (see Žičkus, cited above, § 33). In addition to the lack of differentiation in domestic law as regards the premises for the application of the restrictions, the Court has also addressed the issue of broadly fashioned restrictions applied to the individuals concerned. Thus, in Sidabras and Džiautas, it noted that with the exception of references to “lawyers” and “notaries”, domestic law contained no definition of the specific private sector jobs, functions or tasks which the applicants were barred from holding (see Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, § 59)."

                "61. The Court is of the view that the above considerations also apply to the present case. It notes that the Disclosure Act made no distinction between different levels of former involvement with the KGB. It is true that under the applicable procedure the applicant was informed beforehand of the text of the announcement to be published, and given a possibility to contest the factual information contained in it. However, there was no procedure put in place to assess the specific tasks performed by individual employees of the former security services in order to differentiate the danger they could possibly pose several years after the termination of their career in these institutions. The Court is not convinced that there existed a reasonable link between the legitimate aims sought by the enactment of the Disclosure Act and the publication of information about all former employees of the former security services including drivers, as in the applicant ’ s case, regardless of the specific function they performed in these services."

The Court also notes that although the Disclosure Act came into force three and a half years after Estonia had declared its independence on 20 August 1991, the publication of the information about the former employees of the security services was stretched over several years. Thus, in the applicant ’ s case the information in question was only published in 2004 – almost thirteen years after the restoration of the Estonian independence. The Court is of the opinion that any threat the former servicemen of the KGB could initially pose to the newly created democracy must have considerably decreased with the passage of time. It notes that it does not appear from the file that any assessment of the possible threat posed by the applicant at the time of the publication of the information was carried out (compare Žičkus, loc. cit. )."

The free development of personality presupposes the protection of the individual against unrestricted collection, storage, use and transmission of the individual’s personal data. This protection is therefore covered by the fundamental right of Article 2(1) in conjunction with Article 1(1) of the Basic Law. In this respect, the fundamental right guarantees the authority of the individual in principle himself or herself to decide on the disclosure and use of his or her personal data. The guarantee of the fundamental right takes effect in particular when the development of personality is endangered by government authorities using and combining personal information in a manner which persons affected can neither fully appreciate nor control. The extent of protection of the right to informational self-determination is not restricted to information which by its very nature is sensitive and for this reason alone is constitutionally protected. In view of the possibilities of processing and combining, there is no item of personal data which is in itself, that is, regardless of the context of its use, insignificant. In particular, the protection of informational self-determination also includes personal information on the procedure by which telecommunications services are provided.",

In this respect, a distinction must in particular be made between the collection, storage and use of data. In legislating for data exchange for the purpose of the performance of government duties, however, a distinction must also be made between data transfer by the party supplying the information and data retrieval by the agency seeking the information. A data exchange takes place through the encroachments of retrieval and transfer, which correspond to each other and each of which requires an independent legal basis. Figuratively speaking, the legislature must open not only the door for the transmission of data, but also the door for their retrieval. It is only both legal bases together, which must operate together like a double door, which give authority to exchange personal data. This does not exclude – subject to the system of competencies and the requirements of clear drafting – the possibility of both legal bases being contained in one provision.",

Firstly, there are encroachments upon the duty of collection and storage of [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act]. There are independent further encroachments upon fundamental rights by the duty of service providers laid down in [section 112(1) of the Telecommunications Act] to make the data available as customer databases which can be accessed in an automated procedure and by the authority of the Federal Network Agency to retrieve these data and to transmit them to particular authorities (see [section 112(4) of the Telecommunications Act]). Accordingly, [section 113(1), sentences 1 and 2, of the Telecommunications Act] create independent encroachments upon fundamental rights by imposing on the telecommunications service providers a duty to provide information on demand with regard to the data stored by themselves.",

Finally, [sections 112 and 113 of the Telecommunications Act] are subject to prior retrieval of the data by the authorities entitled to retrieve, in the form of a request ([sections 112(1), 112(2) and 112(4) of the Telecommunications Act]) or a demand ([section 113(1) of the Telecommunications Act]); this constitutes an independent encroachment which must be distinguished from the foregoing. But under the legislature’s legislative concept, this also requires a further legal basis, which must be contained in federal or Land legislation, depending on the area involved. The provisions of [sections 112 and 113 of the Telecommunications Act] – corresponding to the distinction between collection and transmission in the legislative typology of the data protection Acts – are to be understood solely as the legal basis for the transmission. They presuppose that the authorities entitled to receive information have independent powers of collection ...”"

In connection with section 111 of the Telecommunications Act the Federal Constitutional Court held that the obligation to maintain a database for subscriber information pursued the legitimate aim of, in particular, criminal prosecution. Even though the database constituted a precautionary collection and storage of a great range of data and criminal offenders would still be able to circumvent the provision by using telecommunications services anonymously, under false names or with mobile-telephone cards acquired from third parties, the interference with the right to informational self-determination was ultimately justified owing to the relatively restricted nature of the information stored."

                "“136. [Section 111 of the Telecommunications Act] does not violate the requirements of proportionality in the narrow sense. Even if the provision orders a precautionary collection and storage, without occasion, of a great range of telecommunications data, in view of the relatively restricted information content of the collected data this is an encroachment of limited weight.",
                "137. However, the encroachment is non-trivial. It has weight in so far as [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act] makes it possible to attribute telecommunications numbers and subscribers almost completely for all telecommunications services and for this purpose individualising data such as address, date of birth and date when the contract commences are recorded and kept available by the government. The data form a general basis for information and fulfil the function of a telecommunications number register. As a rule, they make it possible to obtain all the telecommunication numbers of any person; conversely, virtually every telecommunications event for which a telecommunications number is determined may also be attributed to a connection and thus to a subscriber. As data which relate to the fundamental elements of telecommunications events they are therefore associated with particularly protected information relationships whose confidentiality is essential for a free order. In addition, the corresponding data are collected and stored without cause by way of precaution in order to make them available for the performance of government duties.",
                "138. Nevertheless, the encroachment constituted by this is not of very great weight. In particular, the fact that the data are collected by way of precaution does not give the procedure a very great weight. For even if [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act] has a great range, the encroachment is restricted in substance to narrowly restricted data which in themselves give no evidence as to the specific activities of individuals and whose use the legislature has restricted to purposes defined in more detail. In such cases, even a precautionary storage is not automatically a particularly serious encroachment for the mere reason that it is carried out without occasion. Admittedly, the precautionary storage of data must always remain an exception to the rule and needs to be justified. But it is not excluded from the outset that precautionary data collections may be justified as the basis of the performance of a variety of government duties, such as are currently familiar in the form of the register of residents or, in the field of motor vehicles, in the form of the Central Vehicle Register ... and the Central Register of Driving Licences ...",
                "139. The data covered by [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act] have limited probative value. They merely make it possible for telecommunications numbers to be individually attributed to the respective subscribers and thus to those numbers’ potential (and typical) users. These data contain no more detailed private information. In a fundamentally different way than in the case of precautionary storage of all telecommunications traffic data, neither do these data as such contain highly personal information, nor is it possible to use them to create personality profiles or track users’ movements. ...",
                "140. Nor does a particular weight of the encroachment result from the fact that the data of [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act], taken in context, permit individual telecommunications events known to the authorities to be attributed and thus in certain circumstances make it possible to obtain individualised knowledge of their circumstances or their content. For in this way all that is made possible from the outset is the investigation of individual events where required by a specific case. In these cases, the authority already knows the circumstances or the content of the telecommunications event which is to be individualised with the data of [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act], whether because the authority has found them by investigation within its own competence – for example on the basis of § 100g of the Code of Criminal Procedure ... – involving encroachment upon the secrecy of telecommunications, whether because it has learnt of them through its own observations or from third-party information without such an encroachment. In the same way, conversely, no particular weight of the encroachment results from the fact that a retrieval of telecommunications numbers may be followed by further measures which in certain circumstances may entail serious encroachments, including encroachments upon the secrecy of telecommunications. For such further encroachments are only permissible under independent legal bases, which must take account of the weight of the encroachment in question.",
                "141. The possibility of attribution of the data collected in [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act] serves the effective performance of the duties of the authorities defined in more detail in the provisions on use. It is constitutionally justified by the fact that the State may have a legitimate interest in successfully investigating particular telecommunications events if occasion arises, and this interest in the performance of particular tasks may have considerable weight, in individual cases even pre-eminent weight. It may not be cited in opposition to this that direct communication without means of telecommunications has no comparable encroachments. For the situation in that case is different. Because direct communication does not resort to technical means of communication which make it possible, without public observation, to interact over any distance in real time, it has no comparable basis, nor is there a comparable necessity for such a register. The traditional powers of investigation, for example the examination of witnesses or the seizure of documents, are more useful for clarification here than they are with regard to communication by means of electronic services. However, it is correct that even the possibilities of the modern means of telecommunications provide no justification for registering, if possible, all activities of citizens by way of precaution and making them basically reconstructible in this way. But there is no question of this when a register of telecommunications numbers is established, even when account is taken of the interaction with other available data.”"

The provision is the legal basis only for the duty to make the data available as customer databases, for access to and transmission of these data, but not also for the retrieval in the form of a request from the authorities entitled to receive information.”",

                "“156. However, the provision acquires a considerable weight of encroachment from the fact that [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act] very much simplifies data retrievals. The procedure, which is centrally organised and automated, permits an access which largely removes practical difficulties of data collection and makes the data of the persons affected available without delay or attrition in the form of requirements of review. In addition, the information is given without telecommunications enterprises or other third parties becoming aware of this. Admittedly, the fact that the issuing of information is not noticed by the telecommunications enterprise ensures discretion for the persons whose data are involved; but at the same time, this means that the encroachments lack the effects of restraint and control which are entailed by observation by third parties. In addition, a legal review by the Federal Network Agency, which transmits the data, is only made if there is a particular occasion for this (see [section 112(4), sentence 2, of the Telecommunications Act ]). Since the retrieving authority does not have to give reasons for its request, however, such an occasion will scarcely ever arise.",
                "157. Weight also attaches to the fact that the legislature has drafted the purposes of the data very broadly. The data may generally be transmitted to the authorities named in [section 112(2) of the Telecommunications Act] for the performance of their statutory duties. This is restricted only for the law enforcement authorities under [section 112(2), no. 2, of the Telecommunications Act], and under [section 112(2), nos. 3 and 7, of that Act] for the customs authorities named there. But it is important in this connection that data may be issued to the former, under [section 112 of the Telecommunications Act], only for purposes of warding off danger, which excludes mere risk precaution. In connection with the respective duties of the authorities entitled to retrieve, the information duties of the Federal Network Agency are also not very restricted. In particular, there are no strict encroachment thresholds in the statute; instead, the duty of information is opened in full to the respective competence of the authorities. However, the fact that information may only be given in so far as it is necessary for the performance of the duty does create an objectively limiting factor. This ensures that retrievals are not casually permitted for mere guidance in advance but only when information actually needed for the performance of duties cannot be obtained more easily but equally effectively in another way.",
                "163. However, [section 112 of the Telecommunications Act] does not in fact restrict information to retrievals which are legitimised by specific legal bases relating to the automated information procedure, but also accepts requests which are based on simple powers of data collection. As a result, there is no requirement on the non ‑ constitutional level for the entitled authorities to be expressly specified over and above [section 112(2) of the Telecommunications Act] and for further conditions for data retrieval which are to be observed. ...”"

It is also proportionate in the narrow sense.",

The purposes for which they are given information under [section 112(2) of the Telecommunications Act] are central duties relating to the guarantee of security. In view of the increasing importance of electronic means of communication and the concomitant changes of human communication behaviour in all areas of life, the authorities here depend to a great extent on a possibility which is as uncomplicated as possible of being able to attribute telecommunications numbers individually. In this respect, it is a decision of the legislature which is constitutionally unobjectionable if it permits the transmission of these data in order to investigate criminal offences and dangers, to observe developments which endanger the Constitution in order for the government and the public to be informed or to give assistance in emergencies. Because such investigations must often be carried out rapidly and without the knowledge of those affected, an automated information procedure is of particular importance for them. Increasing the effectiveness of the work of the courts is also a concern whose weight is supported by such a provision.",

Since the subject here is the transmission of data by an authority and the substantive conditions for this, including those with regard to the persons whose data are involved, are laid down definitively and with sufficient clarity [in section 112 of the Telecommunications Act], then, taking account of the limited weight of encroachment of the provision, this is compatible with the principle of proportionality and corresponds to the structure of the provisions on the automated retrieval of vehicle and vehicle owner data from the vehicle register ... and the provision on data transmission in the law relating to the registration of residents .... Admittedly, this does not change the responsibility of the legislature – and in this connection, where applicable, of the Länder – for the constitutional formulation of the data collection provisions, which are not themselves the subject of the present proceedings. ...”",

It permits information for the purpose of warding off dangers, prosecuting criminal offences or regulatory offences and performing intelligence duties. In this connection, the provision is also given no specific thresholds of encroachment which define its scope in more detail. Instead, it always permits information in the individual case if this is necessary to perform the above duties.",

However, in view of the information content of the data in question, which in itself is limited, and their great importance for an effective performance of duties, the reach of this provision is constitutionally unobjectionable. In this connection, account must be taken of the fact that it by no means permits information to be given indiscriminately. On the contrary, there is a restrictive effect in the fact that information under [section 113(1), sentence 1, of the Telecommunications Act is] called for in the individual case and must be necessary. In relation to warding off danger, which the legislature has expressly not defined as including risk precaution, a prudent interpretation reveals that a ‘concrete danger’ within the meaning of the ‘general clauses’ [ Generalklauseln ] of police law is a requirement for such information. Admittedly, this threshold is low and also admits the suspicion of dangers. Equally, it does not in advance restrict information to persons endangering public security within the meaning of general police and regulatory law. However, this does not relieve it from restriction to such an extent as to be disproportionate in view of its limited weight of encroachment. In particular it does not enable information as a general means for lawful administrative enforcement, but in the individual case it requires the duty in question to have a security-law character. It is true that in regard to the intelligence services, which in general act in advance, irrespective of concrete dangers, there is no comparable threshold of encroachment. But this is justified by the restricted duties of the intelligence services, which are not directly aimed at police measures, but only at a duty to provide reports to the politically responsible State bodies or to the public. Apart from this, it follows here too from the requirement of necessity in the individual case that information under [section 113(1), sentence 1, of the Telecommunications Act] must be required in order to successfully investigate a particular action or group which requires observation by the security authorities. In so far as information relates to the prosecution of criminal offences and regulatory offences, the requirement of necessity in an individual case means that there must at least be an initial suspicion.",
                "178. Taken together, these thresholds are not high, but they are constitutionally acceptable. In this connection, it must be taken into account in comparison to [section 112 of the Telecommunications Act] that a manual information procedure entails certain procedural efforts on the part of the retrieving authority, which is likely to encourage the authority to obtain the information only where it is sufficiently needed.”"

In that regard, it must be observed, first, that the effect of such legislation, in the light of its characteristic features as described in paragraph 97 of the present judgment, is that the retention of traffic and location data is the rule, whereas the system put in place by Directive 2002/58 requires the retention of data to be the exception.",

Second, national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which covers, in a generalised manner, all subscribers and registered users and all means of electronic communication as well as all traffic data, provides for no differentiation, limitation or exception according to the objective pursued. It is comprehensive in that it affects all persons using electronic communication services, even though those persons are not, even indirectly, in a situation that is liable to give rise to criminal proceedings. It therefore applies even to persons for whom there is no evidence capable of suggesting that their conduct might have a link, even an indirect or remote one, with serious criminal offences. Further, it does not provide for any exception, and consequently it applies even to persons whose communications are subject, according to rules of national law, to the obligation of professional secrecy.",

Second, as regards the substantive conditions which must be satisfied by national legislation that authorises, in the context of fighting crime, the retention, as a preventive measure, of traffic and location data, if it is to be ensured that data retention is limited to what is strictly necessary, it must be observed that, while those conditions may vary according to the nature of the measures taken for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, the retention of data must continue nonetheless to meet objective criteria, that establish a connection between the data to be retained and the objective pursued. In particular, such conditions must be shown to be such as actually to circumscribe, in practice, the extent of that measure and, thus, the public affected.",

Moreover, there is variation as regards the length of time such data may be stored, the purposes for which they may be used, and the procedural requirements that must be met in order to access them. In particular, a majority of the States prescribe in law a list of specific authorities who are permitted to access subscriber information and limit the acceptable purposes to the investigation of crimes or for the prevention of threats to public order. Furthermore, in most States, procedural requirements for accessing stored subscriber information include an order by a court or a public prosecutor, typically if the subscriber data are to be used mainly for criminal investigative purposes.

However, it also observes that before the Court the applicants merely challenged the compatibility of section 111 of the Telecommunications Act with the Convention. They did not explicitly complain about sections 112 or 113 of that Act, which had also been the subject of their complaint before the Federal Constitutional Court, or about any further measures concerning surveillance or interception of telephone communications. This does not mean, however, that those other provisions of the Telecommunications Act will not prove relevant when assessing the proportionality of the interference complained of and how it operates in practice (see paragraphs 97 ‑ 101 below).",

This provision does not extend to traffic data, location data or data which reveal the content of communications. Moreover, the applicants have not alleged that their communications have been intercepted or that their telecommunications have been subjected to any other surveillance measure. The interference complained of relates to the storage of the data set described above and the potential for national authorities to access that data set in certain defined circumstances. Therefore, while the Court is mindful of the circumstances of the data storage at issue and its proximity to telephone communications and the right to correspondence, it considers that the key aspect of the applicants’ complaint is the storage of their personal data and not any particular interference with their correspondence or with their freedom of expression."

The applicants argued that the obligation to store their personal data under section 111 of the Telecommunications Act interfered with their right to privacy, as it had forced them to disclose their personal data, which had subsequently been stored. This interference was not justified, in particular since it was disproportionate and not necessary in a democratic society. Firstly, the provision was not a suitable instrument, as the identification process could easily be circumvented by submitting false names or using stolen, second-hand or foreign SIM cards. It was also not necessary as the identification of mobile-telephone users suspected of a criminal offence could easily be accomplished by other investigatory measures. Consequently, the amendment of section 111 of the Telecommunications Act had not led to a reduction in crime."

The provision did not include any prerequisites for storage, but was generally applicable to all mobile-telephone users. The vast majority of affected people were innocent and did not present any danger or risk for public safety or national security. In that regard the applicants submitted that, according to the Federal Network Agency, the number of queried data sets under the automated procedure of section 112 of the Telecommunications Act had risen from 26.62 million in 2008 to 34.83 million in 2015. Moreover, the provision also did not differentiate between “normal” communication and communication that was particularly protected by the Convention, such as between a lawyer and his or her client or a doctor and his or her patient.

Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 48, Series A no. 116).

According to the Court’s established case ‑ law, the requirement that an interference be “in accordance with the law” does not only mean that the measure in question should have some basis in domestic law, but also that the law should be accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to its effects. In the context of, inter alia, storage of personal information it is essential to have clear, detailed rules governing minimum safeguards concerning among other things duration, storage, usage, access of third parties, procedures for preserving the integrity and confidentiality of data and procedures for its destruction (see S. and Marper, cited above, § 99, with further references)"

The Court considers, however, that the question of foreseeability and whether sufficient detail is contained in these provisions are in the present case closely related to the broader issues of whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society and proportionate. It will therefore assess them further when it comes to those issues (see paragraphs 88-110 below)."

These purposes are further emphasised in the Telecommunications Act, which states that information requests are permissible in so far as they are necessary to prosecute criminal and regulatory offences, to avert danger and to perform intelligence tasks (see paragraph 31 above).",

The Court finds that the fight against crime, and in particular against organised crime and terrorism, which is one of the challenges faced by today’s European societies, upholding public safety and the protection of citizens constitute “pressing social needs” (compare, mutatis mutandis, Szabó and Vissy, cited above, § 68, and Ramda v. France, no. 78477/11, § 96, 19 December 2017).

The Court observes that the Government argued that the possibility of correlating mobile-telephone numbers of prepaid SIM cards to specific individuals was necessary for effective law enforcement and to avert danger. The applicants, however, contested the effectiveness of section 111 of the Telecommunications Act, since there was no empirical evidence that mandatory registration had led to a reduction in crime. Moreover, they argued that the identification process could easily be circumvented by submitting false names or using stolen, second-hand or foreign SIM cards."

The Court acknowledges that pre-registration of mobile-telephone subscribers strongly simplifies and accelerates investigation by law ‑ enforcement agencies and can thereby contribute to effective law enforcement and prevention of disorder or crime. Moreover, it considers that the existence of possibilities of circumventing legal obligations cannot be a reason to call into question the overall utility and effectiveness of a legal provision. Lastly, the Court reiterates that in a national security context, national authorities enjoy a certain margin of appreciation when choosing the means for achieving a legitimate aim and notes that according to the comparative-law report, there is no consensus between the member States as regards the retention of subscriber information of prepaid SIM card customers (see paragraph 58 above). Having regard to that margin of appreciation, the Court accepts that the obligation to store subscriber information under section 111 of the Telecommunications Act was, in general, a suitable response to changes in communication behaviour and in the means of telecommunications."

                "92. At the outset the Court has to establish the level of interference with the applicants’ right to private life. In that regard the Court agrees with the Federal Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 138-39 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment cited in paragraph 15 above) that only a limited data set was stored. These data did not include any highly personal information or allow the creation of personality profiles or the tracking of the movements of mobile-telephone subscribers. Moreover, no data concerning individual communication events were stored. The level of interference therefore has to be clearly distinguished from the Court’s previous cases that concerned, for example, “metering” (see Malone and Copland, both cited above), geolocation (see Uzun and Ben Faiza, both cited above), or the storage of health or other sensitive data (see, for example, S. and Marper, cited above, and M.M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 24029/07, 13 November 2012). Moreover, the case has to be distinguished from cases in which the registration in a particular database led to frequent checks or further collection of private information (see Dimitrov-Kazakov v. Bulgaria, no. 11379/03, 10 February 2011, and Shimovolos v. Russia, no. 30194/09, 21 June 2011)."
            ],
            [
                "93. Lastly, in so far as the applicants argued that the interference was severe, because section 111 of the Telecommunications Act created a register of all users of mobile SIM cards, and in that sense was comparable to the data retention at issue in Digital Rights Ireland and Seitlinger and Others, as well as Tele2 Sverige and Tom Watson and Others (see paragraphs 51-52 above), the Court notes that the Directive at issue in those cases applied to traffic and location data on both legal entities and natural persons and to the related data necessary to identify the subscriber or registered user."

As the CJEU stated in that case, the data in question “do not make it possible to ascertain the date, time, duration and recipients of the communications made with the SIM card or cards in question, nor the locations where those communications took place or the frequency of those communications with specific people during a given period. Those data do not therefore allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data is concerned”. The CJEU therefore concluded that the access to the data at issue could not be defined as a serious interference with the fundamental rights of the persons whose data were concerned (see paragraph 55 above)."

                "96. As regards safeguards, the Court observes that the applicants have not alleged that the data storage at issue was subject to any technical insecurities. Moreover, the duration of the storage is limited to the expiry of the calendar year following the year in which the contractual relationship ended (section 111(4) of the Telecommunications Act – see paragraph 27 above). This duration of storage does not appear inappropriate, given that investigations into criminal offences may take some time and extend beyond the end of the contractual relationship. Moreover, the stored data appear to be limited to the information necessary to clearly identify the relevant subscriber."

                "97. The Court further observes that even though the applicants have only complained about the storage of their personal information under section 111 of the Telecommunications Act, both parties accepted that the data storage had to be assessed in conjunction with sections 112 and 113 of that Act. The Government argued that these sections, in conjunction with other specific provisions for data retrieval, limited access to and use of the data and constituted effective safeguards against abuse. The applicants, however, submitted that each further investigative measure into a person’s conduct – connected to mobile communication – had been based on the information stored under section 111 of the Telecommunications Act and that therefore the possibilities of subsequent use of their personal data had to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the provision in relation to data storage. The Court agrees with the parties that, in the present case, it cannot consider the proportionality of the interference without closely assessing the future possible access to and use of the data stored. Therefore, it finds it of relevance to consider the legal basis for information requests and the safeguards available (see, mutatis mutandis, S. and Marper, cited above, §§ 67 and 103, with further references)."

            [
                "98. Regarding section 112 of the Telecommunications Act, the Court agrees with the Federal Constitutional Court (see paragraph 156 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment cited in paragraph 18 above) that this provision has very much simplified data retrieval for the authorities. The centralised and automated procedure permits a form of access which largely removes practical difficulties of data collection and makes the data available to the authorities at all times without delay. However, the fact that the authorities which can request access are specifically listed in section 112 of the Telecommunications Act constitutes a limiting factor. Even though the list appears broad, all authorities mentioned therein are concerned with law enforcement or the protection of national security."

                "99. As regards section 113 of the Telecommunications Act, the Court first notes that the information retrieval is not simplified to the same extent as under section 112, since the authorities have to submit a written request for the information sought. A further difference between sections 112 and 113 of the Telecommunications Act is that the authorities entitled to request access pursuant to the latter provision are identified with reference to the tasks they perform but are not explicitly enumerated. While the Court considers this description by task less specific and more open to interpretation, the wording of the provision is nonetheless detailed enough to clearly foresee which authorities are empowered to request information. In that regard the Court also notes that the Federal Constitutional Court concluded that the limited tasks of the intelligence services justified their wide-ranging legal powers to request information on a pre-emptive basis (see paragraph 177 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment cited in paragraph 21 above)."

            [
                "100. Concerning both provisions, the Court observes that the stored data are further protected against excessive or improper information requests by the fact that the requesting authority requires an additional legal basis to retrieve the data. As explained by the Federal Constitutional Court through its “double door” analogy (see paragraph 123 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment cited in paragraph 14 above), sections 112 and 113 of the Telecommunications Act only allow the Federal Network Agency or the respective service provider to release the data. However, a further legal provision is required to allow the specified authorities to request the information. Moreover, the retrieval is limited to necessary data and this necessity requirement is safeguarded by a general obligation for the respective authorities retrieving the information to erase, without undue delay, any data they do not need. The Federal Constitutional Court pointed out that the requirement of “necessity” meant in the context of the prosecution of offences that there had to be at least an initial suspicion (see paragraph 177 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment cited in paragraph 21 above). The Court accepts that there are sufficient limitations on the power to request information and that the requirement of “necessity” is not only inherent in the specific legal provisions that are the subject of this complaint but also to German and European data protection law."

                "101. In view of these elements, the Court can accept the Federal Constitutional Court’s conclusion that the thresholds provided in section 113 of the Telecommunications Act were still acceptable in the light of constitutional law, taking into account also that the obligation to submit a written request for information was likely to encourage the authority to obtain the information only where it was sufficiently needed (see paragraph 178 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment cited in paragraph 21 above). In this connection the Court also notes that, in practice, manual retrievals did indeed seem to have been made in a limited number of cases compared to the automated requests under section 112 of the Telecommunications Act (see paragraph 13 above)."

                "102. Lastly, the Court will consider the available possibilities of review and supervision of information requests under sections 112 and 113 of the Telecommunications Act. In Klass and Others v. Germany (6 September 1978, § 55, Series A no. 28) the Court held that a review of interferences with the right to respect for private life under Article 8 of the Convention – in that case interferences which took the form of secret surveillance measures – might come into play at three different stages: when the interference was first ordered, while it was being carried out, or after it had been terminated. In cases where the review was effected without the individual’s knowledge during the first two stages, it was essential that the procedures established should themselves provide adequate and equivalent guarantees safeguarding the individual’s rights. On a more general note the Court stated (ibid.):",
                "“... the values of a democratic society must be followed as faithfully as possible in the supervisory procedures if the bounds of necessity, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2, are not to be exceeded. One of the fundamental principles of a democratic society is the rule of law, which is expressly referred to in the Preamble to the Convention ... The rule of law implies, inter alia, that an interference by the executive authorities with an individual’s rights should be subject to an effective control which should normally be assured by the judiciary, at least in the last resort, judicial control offering the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and a proper procedure.”"

                "103. It subsequently relied on these principles, in particular the possibility of effective control and review, concerning different interferences with the right to respect for private life under Article 8 of the Convention (see, for example: storing of sensitive personal data in security files, Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 59, ECHR 2000 ‑ V; seizure of bank documents, M.N. and Others, cited above, §§ 73 and 78; decision to override lawyer’s privilege against disclosure of her bank statements in criminal proceedings, Brito Ferrinho Bexiga Villa-Nova v.

Germany (dec.), no. 54934/00, § 117, ECHR 2006-XI). The Court observes, however, that all these cases concerned individualised and more serious and intrusive interferences with the right to respect for private life that cannot be compared to the question of access to data in the present case. In sum, it considers that the level of review and supervision has to be considered an important, but not decisive, element in the proportionality assessment of the collection and storage of such a limited data set."

They noted that it was not technically possible using Yahoo Messenger to mark messages as private; nevertheless, the applicant had had an adequate opportunity, during the initial stage of the disciplinary proceedings, to indicate that his communications had been private, and yet had chosen to maintain that they had been work-related.

                "70. At this stage of its examination it considers it useful to emphasise that “private life” is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition (see Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, § 43, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII). Article 8 of the Convention protects the right to personal development (see K.A. and A.D. v. Belgium, nos. 42758/98 and 45558/99, § 83, 17 February 2005), whether in terms of personality (see Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 90, ECHR 2002-VI) or of personal autonomy, which is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the Article 8 guarantees (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 61, ECHR 2002-III). The Court acknowledges that everyone has the right to live privately, away from unwanted attention (see Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, § 95, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX (extracts)). It also considers that it would be too restrictive to limit the notion of “private life” to an “inner circle” in which the individual may live his or her own personal life as he or she chooses, thus excluding entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle (see Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, § 29, Series A no. 251 ‑ B). Article 8 thus guarantees a right to “private life” in the broad sense, including the right to lead a “private social life”, that is, the possibility for the individual to develop his or her social identity. In that respect, the right in question enshrines the possibility of approaching others in order to establish and develop relationships with them (see Bigaeva v. Greece, no. 26713/05, § 22, 28 May 2009, and Özpınar v. Turkey, no. 20999/04, § 45 in fine, 19 October 2010)."

                "71. The Court considers that the notion of “private life” may include professional activities (see Fernández Martínez v. Spain [GC], no. 56030/07, § 110, ECHR 2014 (extracts), and Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine, no. 21722/11, §§ 165-66, ECHR 2013), or activities taking place in a public context (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 95, ECHR 2012). Restrictions on an individual’s professional life may fall within Article 8 where they have repercussions on the manner in which he or she constructs his or her social identity by developing relationships with others. It should be noted in this connection that it is in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant, if not the greatest, opportunity to develop relationships with the outside world (see Niemietz, cited above, § 29)."

                "72. Furthermore, as regards the notion of “correspondence”, it should be noted that in the wording of Article 8 this word is not qualified by any adjective, unlike the term “life”. And indeed, the Court has already held that, in the context of correspondence by means of telephone calls, no such qualification is to be made. In a number of cases relating to correspondence with a lawyer, it has not even envisaged the possibility that Article 8 might be inapplicable on the ground that the correspondence was of a professional nature (see Niemietz, cited above, § 32, with further references). Furthermore, it has held that telephone conversations are covered by the notions of “private life” and “correspondence” within the meaning of Article 8 (see Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, § 173, ECHR 2015). In principle, this is also true where telephone calls are made from or received on business premises (see Halford, cited above, § 44, and Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ II). The same applies to emails sent from the workplace, which enjoy similar protection under Article 8, as does information derived from the monitoring of a person’s internet use (see Copland, cited above, § 41 in fine )."

In order to ascertain whether the notions of “private life” and “correspondence” are applicable, the Court has on several occasions examined whether individuals had a reasonable expectation that their privacy would be respected and protected (ibid.; and as regards “private life”, see also Köpke v. Germany (dec.), no. 420/07, 5 October 2010).

Applying these principles in the present case, the Court first observes that the kind of internet instant messaging service at issue is just one of the forms of communication enabling individuals to lead a private social life. At the same time, the sending and receiving of communications is covered by the notion of “correspondence”, even if they are sent from an employer’s computer. The Court notes, however, that the applicant’s employer instructed him and the other employees to refrain from any personal activities in the workplace.

Thus, the Government submitted that the applicant had acquainted himself with the employer’s information notice on an unspecified date between 3 and 13 July 2007 (see paragraph 16 above).

In that connection, he contended that his employer had first placed him under surveillance and had only afterwards given him the opportunity to specify whether his communications were private or work-related.

The protection of personal data is of fundamental importance to a person ’ s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention.

Finland, cited above, § 95). The need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned, not least when such data are used for police purposes. The domestic law should notably ensure that such data are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored; and preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored (see Article 5 of the Data Protection Convention and the Preamble thereto and Principle 7 of Recommendation No. R (87) 15 of the Committee of Ministers regulating the use of personal data in the police sector). The domestic law must also afford adequate guarantees that retained personal data were efficiently protected from misuse and abuse (see notably Article 7 of the Data Protection Convention).

                "“... [F] ingerprints and DNA profiles reveal only limited personal information. The physical samples potentially contain very much greater and more personal and detailed information. The anxiety is that science may one day enable analysis of samples to go so far as to obtain information in relation to an individual ’ s propensity to commit certain crime and be used for that purpose within the language of the present section [ section 82 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001]. It might also be said that the law might be changed in order to allow the samples to be used for purposes other than those identified by the section. It might also be said that while samples are retained there is even now a risk that they will be used in a way that the law does not allow. So, it is said, the aims could be achieved in a less restrictive manner ... Why cannot the aim be achieved by retention of the profiles without retention of the samples?",
                "The answer to [these] points is as I see it as follows. First the retention of samples permits ( a) the checking of the integrity and future utility of the DNA database system; (b) a reanalysis for the upgrading of DNA profiles where new technology can improve the discriminating power of the DNA matching process; (c) reanalysis and thus an ability to extract other DNA markers and thus offer benefits in terms of speed, sensitivity and cost of searches of the database; (d) further analysis in investigations of alleged miscarriages of justice; and (e) further analysis so as to be able to identify any analytical or process errors. It is these benefits which must be balanced against the risks identified by Liberty. In relation to those risks, the position in any event is first that any change in the law will have to be itself Convention compliant; second any change in practice would have to be Convention compliant; and third unlawfulness must not be assumed. In my view thus the risks identified are not great, and such as they are they are outweighed by the benefits in achieving the aim of prosecuting and preventing crime. ”"

In two cases, compelling DNA evidence linking one suspect to a rape and another to a murder had not been able to be used, as at the time the matches were made both defendants had either been acquitted or a decision made not to proceed for the offences for which the profiles had been obtained : as a result it had not been possible to convict either suspect."

The sample from “ I ” should have been destroyed, but had not been. “ I ” had pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced.

The offences involved included 53 murders, 33 attempted murders, 94 rapes, 38 sexual offences, 63 aggravated burglaries and 56 cases involving the supply of controlled drugs. On the basis of the existing records, the Home Office statistics estimated that there was a 40% chance that a crime- scene sample would be matched immediately with an individual ’ s profile on the national database. This showed that the fingerprints and samples which could now be retained had in the previous three years played a major role in the detection and prosecution of serious crime."

As to the Convention analysis, Lord Steyn inclined to the view that the mere retention of fingerprints and DNA samples did not constitute an interference with the right to respect for private life but stated that, if he were wrong in that view, he regarded any interference as very modest indeed. Questions of whether, in the future, retained samples could be misused were not relevant in respect of contemporary use of retained samples in connection with the detection and prosecution of crime. If future scientific developments required it, judicial decisions could be made, when the need occurred, to ensure compatibility with the Convention. The provision limiting the permissible use of retained material to “ purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime ...” did not broaden the permitted use unduly, because it was limited by its context."

If the need to justify the modest interference with private life arose, Lord Steyn agreed with Lord Justice Sedley in the Court of Appeal that the purposes of retention – the prevention of crime and the protection of the right of others to be free from crime – were “provided for by law”, as required by Article 8 of the Convention."

Counsel for the Home Secretary had contended that the aim of the retention had nothing to do with the past, that is, with the offence of which a person had been acquitted, but was to assist in the investigation of offences in the future. The applicants would only be affected by the retention of the DNA samples if their profiles matched those found at the scene of a future crime. Lord Steyn saw five factors which led to the conclusion that the interference was proportionate to the aim: (i) the fingerprints and samples were kept only for the limited purpose of the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime; (ii) the fingerprints and samples were not of any use without a comparator fingerprint or sample from the crime scene; (iii) the fingerprints would not be made public; (iv) a person was not identifiable from the retained material to the untutored eye; (v) the resultant expansion of the national database by the retention conferred enormous advantages in the fight against serious crime."

In reply to the contention that the same legislative aim could be obtained by less intrusive means, namely by a case-by-case consideration of whether or not to retain fingerprints and samples, Lord Steyn referred to Lord Justice Waller ’ s comments in the Court of Appeal, which read as follows:",
                "“ If justification for retention is in any degree to be by reference to the view of the police on the degree of innocence, then persons who have been acquitted and have their samples retained can justifiably say this stigmatises or discriminates against me – I am part of a pool of acquitted persons presumed to be innocent, but I am treated as though I was not. It is not in fact in any way stigmatising someone who has been acquitted to say simply that samples lawfully obtained are retained as the norm, and it is in the public interest in its fight against crime for the police to have as large a database as possible. ”"

The House of Lords further rejected the applicants ’ complaint that the retention of their fingerprints and samples subjected them to discriminatory treatment in breach of Article 14 of the Convention when compared to the general body of persons who had not had their fingerprints and samples taken by the police in the course of a criminal investigation. Lord Steyn held that, even assuming that the retention of fingerprints and samples fell within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention so as to trigger the application of Article 14, the difference of treatment relied on by the applicants was not one based on “status” for the purposes of Article 14: the difference simply reflected the historical fact, unrelated to any personal characteristic, that the authorities already held the fingerprints and samples of the individuals concerned which had been lawfully taken. The applicants and their suggested comparators could not in any event be said to be in an analogous situation. Even if, contrary to his view, it was necessary to consider the justification for any difference in treatment, Lord Steyn held that such objective justification had been established: firstly, the element of legitimate aim was plainly present, as the increase in the database of fingerprints and samples promoted the public interest by the detection and prosecution of serious crime and by exculpating the innocent; secondly, the requirement of proportionality was satisfied, section 64(1A) of PACE objectively representing a measured and proportionate response to the legislative aim of dealing with serious crime."

Baroness Hale of Richmond disagreed with the majority, considering that the retention of both fingerprint and DNA data constituted an interference by the State in a person ’ s right to respect for his private life and thus required justification under the Convention. In her opinion, this was an aspect of what had been called informational privacy and there could be little, if anything, more private to the individual than the knowledge of his genetic make-up. She further considered that the difference between fingerprint and DNA data became more important when it came to justify their retention as the justifications for each of these might be very different.

The report referred, in particular, to the lack of satisfactory empirical evidence to justify the present practice of retaining indefinitely fingerprints, samples and DNA profiles from all those arrested for a recordable offence, irrespective of whether they were subsequently charged or convicted. The report voiced particular concerns at the policy of permanently retaining the bioinformation of minors, having regard to the requirements of the 198 9 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child."

Familial searching is the process of comparing a DNA profile from a crime scene with profiles stored on the national database, and prioritising them in terms of “ closeness ” to a match. This allows possible genetic relatives of an offender to be identified. Familial searching might thus lead to revealing previously unknown or concealed genetic relationships.

Ethnic inferring through DNA profiles is possible as the individual “ethnic appearance” is systematically recorded on the database : when taking biological samples, police officers routinely classify suspects into one of seven “ethnic appearance” categories. Ethnicity tests on the database might thus provide inferences for use during a police investigation in order, for example, to help reduce a “ suspect pool ” and to inform police priorities. The report noted that social factors and policing practices lead to a disproportionate number of people from black and ethnic minority groups being stopped, searched and arrested by the police, and hence having their DNA profiles recorded; it therefore voiced concerns that inferring ethnic identity from biological samples might reinforce racist views of propensity to criminality.",

The DNA database was a collection of such profiles which could be searched using material from a crime scene and a person would be identified only if and to the extent that a match was obtained against the sample. Familial searching through partial matches only occurred in very rare cases and was subject to very strict controls. Fingerprints, DNA profiles and samples were neither susceptible to any subjective commentary nor provided any information about a person ’ s activities and thus presented no risk to affect the perception of an individual or affect his or her reputation. Even if such retention were capable of falling within the ambit of Article 8 § 1, the extremely limited nature of any adverse effects rendered the retention not sufficiently serious to constitute an interference."

It can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the person ’ s physical and social identity (see Mikulić v. Croatia, no. 53176/99, § 53, ECHR 2002-I). Elements such as, for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 (see, among other authorities, Bensaid v. the United Kingdom, no. 44599/98, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ I with further references, and Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ I ). Beyond a person ’ s name, his or her private and family life may include other means of personal identification and of linking to a family (see, mutatis mutandis, Burghartz v. Switzerland, 22 February 1994, § 24, Series A no. 280 ‑ B, and Ünal Tekeli v. Turkey, no. 29865/96, § 42, ECHR 2004 ‑ X ). Information about the person ’ s health is an important element of private life (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, § 71, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I ). The Court furthermore considers that an individual ’ s ethnic identity must be regarded as another such element (see, in particular, Article 6 of the Data Protection Convention quoted in paragraph 41 above, which lists personal data revealing racial origin as a special category of data along with other sensitive information about an individual). Article 8 protects, in addition, a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, for example, Burghartz, cited above, opinion of the Commission, p. 37, § 47, and Friedl v. Austria, 31 January 1995, Series A no. 305-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 20, § 45).

However, in determining whether the personal information retained by the authorities involves any of the private-life aspects mentioned above, the Court will have due regard to the specific context in which the information at issue has been recorded and retained, the nature of the records, the way in which these records are used and processed and the results that may be obtained (see, mutatis mutandis, Friedl, cited above, § § 49-51, and Peck, cited above, § 59 ).",

The Court notes in this regard that the Government accepted that DNA profiles could be, and indeed had in some cases been, used for familial searching with a view to identifying a possible genetic relationship between individuals. They also accepted the highly sensitive nature of such searching and the need for very strict controls in this respect. In the Court ’ s view, the DNA profiles ’ capacity to provide a means of identifying genetic relationships between individuals (see paragraph 39 above) is in itself sufficient to conclude that their retention interferes with the right to the private life of the individuals concerned. The frequency of familial searches, the safeguards attached thereto and the likelihood of detriment in a particular case are immaterial in this respect (see Amann, cited above, § 69 ). This conclusion is similarly not affected by the fact that, since the information is in coded form, it is intelligible only with the use of computer technology and capable of being interpreted only by a limited number of persons."

The possibility the DNA profiles create for inferences to be drawn as to ethnic origin makes their retention all the more sensitive and susceptible of affecting the right to private life. This conclusion is consistent with the principle laid down in the Data Protection Convention and reflected in the Data Protection Act that both list personal data revealing ethnic origin among the special categories of sensitive data attracting a heightened level of protection (see paragraphs 3 0-31 and 41 above)."

While true, this consideration cannot alter the fact that fingerprints objectively contain unique information about the individual concerned, allowing his or her identification with precision in a wide range of circumstances.

The Government were given a very wide remit to use samples and DNA profiles notably for “purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime”, “ the investigation of an offence” or “ the conduct of a prosecution”. These purposes were vague and open to abuse as they might, in particular, lead to the collation of detailed personal information outside the immediate context of the investigation of a particular offence. The applicants further submitted that there were insufficient procedural safeguards against misuse or abuse of the information. Records on the Police National Computer ( PNC ) were not only accessible to the police, but also to fifty-six non-police bodies, including government agencies and departments, private groups such as British Telecom and the Association of British Insurers, and even certain employers. Furthermore, the PNC was linked to the Europe-wide “Schengen Information System”. Consequently, their case involved a very substantial and controversial interference with the right to private life, as notably illustrated by ongoing public debate and disagreement about the subject in the United Kingdom. Contrary to the assertion of the Government, the applicants concluded that the issue of the retention of this material was of great individual concern and the State had a narrow margin of appreciation in this field."

In two other cases the retention of DNA profiles of the persons found guilty of certain minor offences (disorder and theft) led to establishing their involvement in other crimes committed later. In one case the retention of a suspect ’ s DNA profile following an alleged immigration offence helped his extradition to the United Kingdom a year later when he was identified by one of his victims as having committed rape and murder.

Their retention was neither warranted by any degree of suspicion of the applicants ’ involvement in a crime or propensity to crime nor directed at retaining records in respect of investigated alleged offences in the past. The records were retained because the police had already been lawfully in possession of them, and their retention would assist in the future prevention and detection of crime in general by increasing the size of the database.

It reiterates that it is as essential, in this context, as in telephone tapping, secret surveillance and covert intelligence-gathering, to have clear, detailed rules governing the scope and application of measures, as well as minimum safeguards concerning, inter alia, duration, storage, usage, access of third parties, procedures for preserving the integrity and confidentiality of data and procedures for its destruction, thus providing sufficient guarantees against the risk of abuse and arbitrariness (see, mutatis mutandis, Kruslin v.

The protection of personal data is of fundamental importance to a person ’ s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. The domestic law must afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such use of personal data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees of this Article (see, mutatis mutandis, Z v. Finland, cited above, § 95). The need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned, not least when such data are used for police purposes. The domestic law should notably ensure that such data are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored; and preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored (see Article 5 of the Data Protection Convention and the Preamble thereto and Principle 7 of Recommendation No. R (87) 15 of the Committee of Ministers regulating the use of personal data in the police sector). The domestic law must also afford adequate guarantees that retained personal data were efficiently protected from misuse and abuse (see notably Article 7 of the Data Protection Convention). The above considerations are especially valid as regards the protection of special categories of more sensitive data (see Article 6 of the Data Protection Convention) and more particularly of DNA information, which contains the person ’ s genetic make-up of great importance to both the person concerned and his or her family (see Recommendation No. R (92) 1 of the Committee of Ministers on the use of analysis of DNA within the framework of the criminal justice system)."

Austria, no. 28389/95, § 31, 21 March 2000, with further references ). It is true that the retention of the applicants ’ private data cannot be equated with the voicing of suspicions.

In fact, the Court notes that all the relevant domestic and international law cited above expressly prohibits disclosure of such information to the point that it even constitutes a criminal offence. There are exceptions to the rule of nondisclosure; however, none of them seems to be applicable to the applicant ’ s situation. Indeed, the Government did not show that any such exception was applicable. It follows that the interference complained of was not “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8. Accordingly, there is no need to examine whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim or was “necessary in a democratic society”."

On 3 August 2003 she was seen by a doctor from the No. 7 Centre for Family Doctors (“ the CFD)”, an institution belonging to the Ministry of Health, who ordered her hospitalisation on account of an increased risk of miscarriage. The applicant was hospitalised between 4 and 20 August 2003 and was later closely supervised by a doctor from the CFD. It would appear that the applicant ’ s absence from work during her hospitalisation was certified by a sick note referring to her pregnancy and an increased risk of miscarriage as the reasons for her absence."

In a letter dated 7 November 2003 the CFD informed the applicant ’ s employer that the applicant had been hospitalised between 4 and 20 August 2003 on account of an increased risk of miscarriage. The letter also stated that this was the applicant ’ s first pregnancy and that she was carrying twins; that the pregnancy had resulted from artificial insemination and that the applicant had hepatitis B. The letter further mentioned that the applicant had obstetrical complications and that she had a negative blood type.

She argued, inter alia, that her employer had had sufficient information as to the reasons for her medical leave and had not been entitled to seek further details of such a private nature. Moreover, after the information had been obtained it had not been kept confidential but had been disclosed to everybody at the Police Academy. According to the applicant, the disclosure had caused her serious stress and anxiety. Everyone at her workplace, including her students, had learned details about her private life, and different rumours had begun to circulate. Only two days after the disclosure, she had suffered a miscarriage due to the stress to which she had been subjected. Her husband, who had also been an employee of the Police Academy, had had to resign from his post and accept a less well- paid job."

The Supreme Court held that the CFD had acted in accordance with the law when providing the applicant ’ s employer with medical information about her. The CFD had been under an obligation to provide the Police Academy with such information in the context of the latter ’ s legal relationship with its employee. According to the Supreme Court, at the time of the events there were relations of an employment- law and of a criminal - law nature between the Police Academy and the applicant.

Among the facts, the letters stated that the first three applicants, who worked at the tills, had allowed customers and colleagues to go to the cash till and leave the shop with goods they had not paid for. They added that those applicants had scanned items presented at the checkout by customers or colleagues and had then cancelled the purchases, with the result that the goods had not been paid for. They explained that a comparison between the goods actually taken away by customers and the sales receipts had made it possible to prove this. As to the fourth and fifth applicants, the cameras had reportedly caught them stealing goods with the help of their colleagues at the tills.

It referred in this connection to the case-law of the Constitutional Court, in particular judgment no. 186/2000 of 10 July 2000, which concerned a similar case of video-surveillance, using hidden cameras, of employees suspected of serious misconduct. In that judgment, the Constitutional Court had found that an employer’s right to adopt monitoring measures in the exercise of its management power and for the purpose of ensuring the smooth running of the company was limited by the respect due to the employees’ right to their privacy and to the protection of their image. It had explained that the lower court was supposed to strike a balance between the various interests of constitutional value by applying a proportionality test to the employer’s measures. In the case at issue, it had found that the covert video-surveillance measure had been proportionate and had not breached the employee’s fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Article 18 of the Constitution given that, first, it was justified by reasonable suspicions of serious misconduct; that, secondly, it was appropriate to the aim pursued, namely to verify whether the employee was actually committing misconduct and to adopt sanctions if necessary; that, thirdly, it was necessary, because the recordings would provide evidence of the misconduct in question; and that, fourthly, it was proportionate, because the monitoring was limited in space and in time to what was sufficient to fulfil its aim. The court had, moreover, considered it not to be constitutionally pertinent to examine the question whether the employees or the staff committee had been informed beforehand of the installation of the video-surveillance. It had further taken the view that the right to effective judicial protection under Article 24 of the Constitution had not been breached by the admission in evidence of the recordings thus obtained, especially as the decision had also been based on other evidence."

It concluded from the union representative’s testimony that the applicants had confessed to the facts during a meeting with her, thus rendering it plausible that they had signed the agreements in order to avoid criminal proceedings. It added that the failure of some employees in the same situation as the applicants (for example, the first and second applicants) to sign such an agreement confirmed the absence of any threat or duress.

Relying on its own case-law, on that of other courts and on that of the Constitutional Court already cited by the Employment Tribunal, the High Court took the view that the video-surveillance measures taken by the employer on the basis of Article 20 § 3 of the Labour Regulations did not require, in the light of section 6(2) of the Personal Data Protection Act, the prior consent of the employees concerned but had to be subjected to a proportionality test according to the criteria laid down by the Constitutional Court. It took the view that the measure at issue in the present case satisfied those criteria because it was justified by the existence of suspicions of misconduct, appropriate to the aim pursued, necessary for the fulfilment of that aim because a more moderate measure would not have been capable of fulfilling it, and proportionate because the recordings were limited, in time and space, to what was necessary for the purpose of verifying the suspicions. Referring to previous judgments, the High Court found as follows in its judgment of 28 January 2011 in the proceedings concerning the first applicant:",
                "“... the monitoring carried out by the employer by means of CCTV cameras (installed on the site where the [first applicant] was working and directed towards the cashiers’ work-stations after the detection of missing goods ...) ‘may be generally regarded as an appropriate and even a necessary means of monitoring the activity and it must therefore be considered that, despite the fact that it may give rise to sanctions ... because of the failure to inform staff representatives about the installation of the camera ..., the monitoring was not carried out in an excessive manner contrary to the test of appropriateness, necessity or proportionality, which would have resulted in an unjustified breach of the right to the protection of the person’s image or in undermining the person’s dignity, since it was an appropriate means and one that would have been difficult to replace for the purpose of proving possible thefts ...’”",
                "The High Court further held that the failure to notify employees and staff representatives could probably be explained by the fact that “the company rightly feared that knowledge of the monitoring system would defeat its purpose”."

                "“... The alleged failure to inform the employees could, if appropriate, entail an administrative sanction but will not fall foul of the conditions regarding the lawfulness of evidence laid down by the Constitutional Court, for it is indeed a justified measure (there were reasonable suspicions that the appellant had committed serious misconduct in the workplace), which was appropriate to the aim pursued by the company (to verify whether the employee had actually committed the acts and if so to take relevant disciplinary measures), and was necessary (since the recordings would be used as evidence of the wrongdoing) and proportionate (the cameras were only zoomed in on the checkout counters and solely for a limited period of time, sufficient to verify that it was not a one-off act or a misunderstanding but indeed repeated unlawful conduct).”",

It took the view that it nevertheless appeared from these agreements that they had expressly acknowledged the facts of which they were accused, that they had accepted the employer’s decision to discontinue their employment and that they had thus given their consent to the termination of their contracts. It therefore reached the conclusion, with reference to case-law of the Supreme Court relating to similar agreements entered into by the same employer with other employees, that the employment contracts had been terminated by mutual agreement. In its view, this was sufficient to consider the facts to be established and the termination of the employment contracts to be lawful, regardless of whether the video recordings were lawful and could be admitted in evidence, a question to which the court had in fact responded in the affirmative."

As regards more specifically the first applicant, whose face did not appear in the video footage, the court found that an analysis of the recordings of the cameras directed towards the till at which she worked and the sales receipts sufficiently demonstrated her involvement in the acts of which she was accused."

On 10 July 2000 the Constitutional Court delivered a leading judgment on the lawfulness of video-surveillance in the workplace in the light of the protection provided by Article 18 § 1 of the Spanish Constitution (judgment no. 186/2000). In that case the employer had set up a system of hidden CCTV cameras in the ceiling of the clothing and footwear department of a shop, directed towards three tills and the reception desk. The Constitutional Court held that the measure at stake had to pass a threefold test to be considered acceptable: there had to be a legitimate aim (“appropriateness test”), and the measure had to be necessary (“necessity test”) and proportionate (“strict proportionality test”). In other words, the courts had to ascertain whether a fair balance had been struck between the interference with a fundamental right and the importance of the legitimate aim pursued. On the subject of the video-surveillance at issue in that case, it found as follows:",
                "“In the present case, the covert video-surveillance ... was a justified measure (since there was a reasonable suspicion that the person investigated had committed some wrongdoing at work); it was suited to the purpose pursued by the company (to verify that the worker was in fact committing the suspected wrongdoing, in which case he would be subjected to an appropriate disciplinary sanction); it was necessary (the recordings were to be used as evidence of the wrongdoing); and it was proportionate (since the cameras were only zoomed in on the checkout counters and solely for a limited period of time) ...; it follows that there has been no interference with the right to [respect for] privacy as enshrined in Article 18.1 of the Spanish Constitution.”"

As to the alleged failure to inform the employees and the staff committee, the Constitutional Court found that it was a question of ordinary legality that was not pertinent in terms of the constitutional protection of fundamental rights. The facts of the case nevertheless predated the entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act in January 2000 and, at that time, the applicable law did not lay down any obligation to provide information that was comparable to the obligation subsequently enshrined in section 5(1) of that Act."

The court noted that the employer had failed to show how the sound recording, which was particularly intrusive for the right to privacy of those concerned, had been necessary for the protection of its legitimate rights and interests."

                "57. Subsequently, in judgment no. 29/2013 of 11 February 2013, which concerned events after the Personal Data Protection Act had entered into force, the Constitutional Court held that the permanent installation of a video-surveillance system, initially as a security measure for the purpose of monitoring employees’ activity, required that the workers’ representatives and employees be given prior notification and that a failure to do so would be in breach of Article 18 § 4 of the Constitution. In that case, an employee of Seville University had been suspended from his duties without pay for unjustified late arrivals and absences that had been established by means of video-surveillance installed with the approval of the administration. The Constitutional Court found as follows:",
                "“7. ... In conclusion, it must not be overlooked that the [Constitutional Court has] established, in an invariable and continuing manner, that an employer’s power is limited by fundamental rights (among many other [authorities], STC no. 98/2000, of 10 April, legal ground no. 7, or STC no. 308/2000, of 18 December, legal ground no. 4). Consequently, in the same way that the ‘public interest’ behind the punishment linked to an administrative offence is not enough to allow the State to deprive the citizen concerned of his or her rights derived from [sections 5(1) and (2) of the Personal Data Protection Act] (STC 292/2000, of 30 November, legal ground no. 18), the ‘private interest’ of an employer cannot justify using the worker’s personal data to his or her detriment without previously informing him or her of the monitoring measures that have been implemented. There is no reason in the employment sphere ... to restrict the right to be informed, a fundamental right that is protected by Article 18.4 of the Constitution. Accordingly, it is not enough that the data processing itself is lawful, being prescribed by law (section 6(2) of the Personal Data Protection Act), or proves, in a given case, to be proportionate to the aim pursued; monitoring by the employer, while certainly possible, must also guarantee the requisite prior information.",

In the instant case, the CCTV cameras installed on the campus recorded the appellant’s image and allowed [the employer] to verify the appellant’s compliance with the working time [regulations] ... The owner of the cameras was Seville University and it was this entity that used the recordings, thus becoming the entity responsible for processing the appellant’s data without previously informing him of the use of cameras to monitor his work. This infringed Article 18.4 of the Constitution.",
                "The fact that signs were put up indicating the existence of a video-surveillance system on the campus, or that the Data Protection Agency had been informed of the installation of the system, does not detract from this conclusion. The employees, moreover, should have been informed, beforehand and in an express, precise and unambiguous manner, that the system could be used to monitor their work. The information should specify the characteristics and scope of the data processing, indicating the situations in which the images could be examined, together with the time-frame and purpose, specifically stating that the images could be used to impose disciplinary sanctions on the workers for non-compliance with the contract of employment.”"

In this case the manager of a clothing shop had detected some thefts from the till and suspected one of its employees. He had temporarily installed hidden cameras zoomed in on the area where the till was located. The employer had placed a sign indicating in a general manner the presence of CCTV cameras, including the information provided for by section 5 of the Personal Data Protection Act, as required by Article 3 of Instruction no. 1/2006 issued by the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The Constitutional Court explained in the following terms the relevance of the fulfilment of the obligation to provide information under section 5 of that Act:",

Without prejudice to any legal sanctions which may be entailed by an employer’s failure to comply with the obligation, for it to constitute a violation of Article 18.4 of the Constitution it is necessary to ascertain whether the proportionality principle has been upheld. The right to data protection should be weighed in the balance against any limitations that may be justified by the employee’s work obligations and the corresponding power of monitoring and supervision granted to the employer by Article 20.3 of the Labour Regulations, in relation to Articles 33 and 38 of the Constitution. The assessment of the constitutional relevance of a total or partial lack of information in cases of video-surveillance in the workplace requires the balancing in each case of the competing constitutional rights and values: on the one hand the employees’ right to the protection of personal data and, on the other, the employer’s management power, which, essential as it is to the proper running of a productive organisation, reflects the constitutional rights recognised in Articles 33 and 38 of the Constitution and ... is enshrined in Article 20.3 of the Labour Regulations, which expressly empower the employer to adopt monitoring and supervision measures in order to verify that the workers comply with their employment duties ... This general monitoring power provided for by law legitimises the supervision carried out by the employer of the employees’ performance of their professional tasks (see ... the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights Bărbulescu v. Romania of 6 [ sic ] January 2016), without prejudging the particular circumstances of each case, which will determine whether or not the monitoring implemented by the employer has entailed a violation of the fundamental right at stake.",

In that case the Constitutional Court found that there had been no violation of Article 18 § 4 of the Constitution, in particular on the ground that the employer had placed a board indicating that video-surveillance was in place, in accordance with the regulations. It considered that the board contained sufficient information as to the existence of monitoring and the purpose of the data processing. After examining the proportionality of the interference with the employee’s private life, using the criteria laid down in the case-law (see paragraph 54 above), it further found that there had not been any breach of the right to personal privacy protected by Article 18 § 1 of the Constitution.",

It can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the person’s physical and social identity (see, as a recent example, Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, § 95, 25 September 2018). It extends in particular to aspects relating to personal identity, such as a person’s name or picture (see Schüssel v. Austria (dec.), no. 42409/98, 21 February 2002, and Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 95, ECHR 2012)."
            ],
            [
                "88. The concept of private life is not limited to an “inner circle” in which the individual may live his or her own personal life without outside interference, but also encompasses the right to lead a “private social life”, that is, the possibility of establishing and developing relationships with others and the outside world (see Bărbulescu v. Romania [GC], no. 61496/08, § 70, 5 September 2017). It does not exclude professional activities in that connection (see Fernández Martínez v. Spain [GC], no. 56030/07, § 110, ECHR 2014 (extracts); Köpke v. Germany (dec.), no. 420/07, 5 October 2010; Bărbulescu, cited above, § 71; Antović and Mirković v.

There is thus a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of “private life” (see P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 56, ECHR 2001-IX; Perry v. the United Kingdom, no. 63737/00, § 36, ECHR 2003-IX (extracts); and Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 95)."

Since there are occasions when people knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which are or may be recorded or reported in a public manner, a person’s reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although not necessarily conclusive, factor in this assessment (see P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 57; Bărbulescu, cited above, § 73; and Antović and Mirković, cited above, § 43). As to the monitoring of an individual’s actions using photographic or video devices, the Convention institutions have taken the view that the monitoring of the actions and movements of an individual in a public place using a camera which did not record the visual data does not constitute in itself a form of interference with private life (see Herbecq and the Association “Ligue des Droits de l’Homme ” v. Belgium, nos. 32200/96 and 32201/96, Commission decision of 14 January 1998, Decisions and Reports 92-B, p. 92, and Perry, cited above, § 41). Private-life considerations may arise, however, once any systematic or permanent record of such personal data comes into existence, particularly pictures of an identified person (see Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, §§ 58-59, ECHR 2003 ‑ I; Perry, cited above, §§ 38 and 41; and Vukota-Bojić v. Switzerland, no. 61838/10, §§ 55 and 59, 18 October 2016). As the Court has stated in this connection, a person’s image constitutes one of the chief attributes of his or her personality, as it reveals the person’s unique characteristics and distinguishes the person from his or her peers. The right of each person to the protection of his or her image is thus one of the essential components of personal development and presupposes the right to control the use of that image. Whilst in most cases the right to control such use involves the possibility for an individual to refuse publication of his or her image, it also covers the individual’s right to object to the recording, conservation and reproduction of the image by another person (see Reklos and Davourlis v. Greece, no. 1234/05, § 40, 15 January 2009, and De La Flor Cabrera v. Spain, no. 10764/09, § 31, 27 May 2014)."

Their expectation as to the protection of their private life was thus necessarily limited. However, even in public places, the creation of a systematic or permanent recording of images of identified persons and the subsequent processing of the images thus recorded could raise questions affecting the private life of the individuals concerned (see paragraph 89 above and the case-law cited therein). The Court notes that in the present case domestic law provided a formal and explicit statutory framework which obliged a person responsible for a video-surveillance system, even in a public place, to give prior information to the persons being monitored by such a system (see paragraphs 47 and 50 above). The applicants had, moreover, been informed about the installation by their employer of other CCTV cameras in the supermarket, those cameras being visible and positioned such as to film the shop’s entrances and exits.

They explained that, in the present case, they and all the supermarket staff had been filmed for weeks, throughout the working day, without having been informed beforehand. The monitoring had been implemented in breach of Spanish law, which provided for an obligation for the employer, if not to obtain the consent of the employees, at least to inform them beforehand of the installation of the cameras and of their rights under the data-protection legislation. If such indications had been given, both their right to respect for their private life and the employer’s interests would have been preserved.

As to the possibility of seeking redress in the ordinary civil courts, they explained that those courts had no jurisdiction in respect of relations under an employment contract and that the case-law cited by the Government by way of example, concerning a situation in which the employment relationship had been severed two years earlier, could not be transposed to the present case (see paragraph 49 above).

They explained in this connection that the monitoring had lasted for only ten days, from 15 to 25 June, on which date the employees under suspicion had been called for individual interview, and that it had been directed not at the whole staff but only at those working in the checkout area, who were in direct contact with the customers. The present case should, by contrast, be distinguished from Bărbulescu as in that case the impugned interference had concerned compliance with the employer’s instructions, which the Court found to have “reduce[d] private social life in the workplace to zero”, whereas the video-surveillance measure at issue had pursued a legitimate aim, namely to shed light on an offence of which the company had been the victim.

These obligations may necessitate the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Söderman v. Sweden [GC], no. 5786/08, § 78, ECHR 2013, and Von Hannover (No. 2), cited above, § 98). The responsibility of the State may thus be engaged if the facts complained of stemmed from a failure on its part to secure to those concerned the enjoyment of a right enshrined in Article 8 of the Convention (see Bărbulescu, cited above, § 110, and Schüth v.

While the boundaries between the State’s positive and negative obligations under the Convention do not lend themselves to precise definition, the applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In both contexts regard must be had in particular to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing private and public interests, subject in any event to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State (see Palomo Sánchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06 and 3 others, § 62, ECHR 2011, and Bărbulescu, cited above, § 112). The margin of appreciation goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. In exercising its supervisory function, the Court does not have to take the place of the national courts but to review, in the light of the case as a whole, whether their decisions were compatible with the provisions of the Convention relied upon (see Peck, cited above, § 77, and Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 105)."

Concerning the gravest acts, such as rape, this obligation may go as far as requiring the adoption of criminal-law provisions (see M.C. v. Bulgaria, cited above, § 150). In respect of less serious acts between individuals which may affect the rights protected under Article 8, the Court takes the view that Article 8 leaves it to the discretion of States to decide whether or not to pass specific legislation and it verifies that the existing remedies were capable of providing sufficient protection of the rights at issue (see, concerning the protection of a minor’s personal integrity, Söderman, cited above, §§ 86-91; and on the right to the protection of one’s image, Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, §§ 95-126, and Reklos and Davourlis, cited above, §§ 34-43)."

These criteria must be applied taking into account the specificity of the employment relations and the development of new technologies, which may enable measures to be taken that are increasingly intrusive in the private life of employees.

Failure to provide these safeguards could give rise to administrative sanctions and could engage the civil liability of the person responsible for the data processing (see paragraphs 46 and 48 above). In addition, Article 20 § 3 of the Employment Regulations limited the employer’s use of monitoring, as regards the fulfilment by employees of their employment duties, by requiring that the measures taken in that regard were compatible with their human dignity. Moreover, the applicable rules of procedure required the domestic courts to exclude any evidence obtained in breach of a fundamental right. Lastly, there was case-law of the ordinary courts and the Constitutional Court requiring that any measures interfering with the privacy of employees had to pursue a legitimate aim (“appropriateness test”), and had to be necessary for the fulfilment of the aim pursued (“necessity test”) and proportionate to the circumstances of each case (“strict proportionality test”) (see paragraphs 54 et seq. above)."

In the Court’s opinion this assessment could not be regarded as unreasonable. It notes that the monitoring did not cover the whole shop but targeted the areas around the tills, where thefts were likely to have been committed. The three applicants who worked as cashiers were indeed monitored by CCTV cameras throughout their working day. As a result of their jobs within the company, they could not evade these recordings, which were aimed at all the staff working in the checkout area, and were operated permanently and without any limitation (contrast Köpke, cited above, concerning an applicant who was both a shop assistant and cashier of the store in question, the video-surveillance measure thus not covering the entirety of her place of work). To some extent, they thus found themselves in limited areas (see, mutatis mutandis, Allan v. the United Kingdom, no. 48539/99, § 35, ECHR 2002 ‑ IX, and Perry, cited above, §§ 39-43).

That expectation is very high in places which are private by nature, such as toilets or cloakrooms, where heightened protection, or even a complete ban on video-surveillance, is justified (see, to this effect, the relevant international instruments cited in paragraphs 61 and 65 above).

In the present case, the Court observes that the employment courts which examined the applicants’ claims carried out a detailed balancing exercise between, on the one hand, their right to respect for their private life, and on the other the employer’s interest in ensuring the protection of its property and the smooth operation of the company. It notes that the proportionality criteria established by the Constitutional Court’s case-law and followed in the present case are close to those which it has developed in its own case-law. The domestic courts thus verified whether the video-surveillance was justified by a legitimate aim and whether the measures adopted for that purpose were appropriate and proportionate, having observed in particular that the legitimate aim pursued by the employer could not be attained by measures that were less intrusive for the applicants’ rights."

Admittedly, the employment courts did not take account of the employer’s failure, as alleged by the applicants, to provide them with the prior information required by section 5 of the Personal Data Protection Act, having considered the matter irrelevant and not capable of calling into question the proportionality, in the constitutional sense, of the measure, provided that the other criteria laid down by the Constitutional Court were satisfied. Given the importance of the right to information in such cases, the Court finds that only an overriding requirement relating to the protection of significant public or private interests could justify the lack of prior information."

However, in the specific circumstances of the present case, having regard particularly to the degree of intrusion into the applicants’ privacy (see paragraphs 125-26 above) and to the legitimate reasons justifying the installation of the video-surveillance, the Court finds that the employment courts were able, without overstepping the margin of appreciation afforded to national authorities, to take the view that the interference with the applicants’ privacy was proportionate (see, for a similar situation, Köpke, cited above). Thus, while it cannot accept the proposition that, generally speaking, the slightest suspicion of misappropriation or any other wrongdoing on the part of employees might justify the installation of covert video-surveillance by the employer, the existence of reasonable suspicion that serious misconduct has been committed and the extent of the losses identified in the present case may appear to constitute weighty justification. This is all the more so in a situation where the smooth functioning of a company is endangered not merely by the suspected misbehaviour of one single employee, but rather by the suspicion of concerted action by several employees, as this creates a general atmosphere of mistrust in the workplace."

Moreover, as the Government argued, the applicants had other remedies available to them, as provided for by the Personal Data Protection Act, for the specific purpose of obtaining sanctions for breaches of that legislation. The applicants could thus have complained to the Data Protection Agency of a failure by the employer to fulfil its obligation to provide prior information, as required by section 5 of that Act. The Agency had the power to investigate the alleged breach of the law and impose financial penalties on the person responsible. They could also have referred the matter to the ordinary courts in order to obtain redress for the alleged breach of their rights under the Personal Data Protection Act. The Court notes in this connection that while the case-law cited by the Government (see paragraph 49 above) does indeed concern a situation which is not identical to that of the present case, the right to obtain redress for damage caused by a breach of the Personal Data Protection Act was expressly provided for in section 19 thereof and there is no reason to question the effectiveness of that remedy now."

In particular, it is not competent to deal with an application alleging that errors of law or fact have been committed by domestic courts, except where it considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation of any of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention. While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1988, § 45, Series A no. 140, and García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, ECHR 1999 ‑ I). Normally, issues such as the weight attached by the national courts to given items of evidence or to findings or assessments in issue before them for consideration are not for the Court to review. The Court should not act as a court of fourth instance and will not therefore question under Article 6 § 1 the judgment of the national courts, unless their findings can be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see Bochan v.

This involves an examination of the unlawfulness in question and, where the violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 76, and Gäfgen v.

In particular, it must be examined whether the applicant was given an opportunity to challenge the authenticity of the evidence and to oppose its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, as must the question whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy (see Schenk, cited above, §§ 46-48; P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 77-79; and Gäfgen, cited above, § 164).

Experience has shown that those who have committed offences may go on to commit other offences. A state decision to draw the line at those convicted of a substantial category of offences is entirely rational and furthers the legitimate aim of countering crime so as to protect the lives and rights of others.",
                "(ii) The rights and expectations of convicted persons differ significantly from those of unconvicted persons. The striking of a balance between the public interest and the rights of a convicted or an unconvicted individual will inevitably be appreciably different. Strasbourg recognises that even in the case of some unconvicted persons retention for a period may be justifiable in the public interest.",
                "(iii) A person can only be identified by fingerprints and DNA sample either by an expert or with the use of sophisticated equipment. The material stored says nothing about the physical make up, characteristics or life of the person concerned and it represents objective identifying material which can only be relevant or of use when compared with comparative material taken from a person lawfully subjected to a requirement to provide such material for comparison.",
                "(iv) The use to which the material can be lawfully put is severely restricted by the legislation.",
                "(v) As well as being potentially inculpatory the material may be exculpatory and thus in ease of a person such as the applicant. If it is inculpatory its use assists in the detection of someone likely to have been involved in crime which is a matter of deep interest to the public.",
                "(vi) There is in place an exceptional case procedure which permits of a possibility of an application to have data removed.",
                "(vii) Any differentiation within the system between categories of convicted persons calls for administrative action and has the potential for administrative complexity. Lord Steyn described how there was the potential for interminable and invidious disputes where differentiation is operated. While he was making that point in the context of differentiation between convicted and unconvicted persons (and thus was in error according to the Strasbourg court) the point retains its force in the context of differentiation between convicted persons. Carswell LCJ pointed out in Re McBride [1997] NI 269 at 274 that the legislature wished to have as wide a cover for the database as possible in order to give the police the best chance of detecting criminal offenders. Marper requires protections for unconvicted persons and the current legislation and policy have limited the retention of data to those convicted of recordable offences. To allow further exceptions would in the view of the authorities undermine the effectiveness of the process which is designed to build up a database of those who have been involved in criminality to assist in the war against crime. Such a conclusion by the state authorities is legitimate and rational.",
                "(viii) The current policy in fact does distinguish between (a) unconvicted persons and those convicted of offences which are not recordable and (b) those convicted of offences which are recordable. This represents a policy and legislative intent which is not blanket or indiscriminate as such but one which distinguishes between cases. The choice of that differentiation is one involving the exercise of judgment by the state authorities which seeks to balance, on the one hand, the very limited impact of retention and use of such material on a person ’ s real private life and its minimal impact on the intimate side of his life and, on the other hand, the benefit to society flowing from the creation of as effective a database as legitimately possible to help in combatting crime. The choice to retain the data of those convicted of recordable offences represents the exercise of a balanced and rational judgment by the authorities.",
                "(ix) In this case the offence committed by the applicant cannot, as the applicant asserts, be described as minor or trivial. It was an offence of a potentially dangerous anti-social nature. The criminal law has as one of its aims the protection of the lives of others and the consumption of alcohol by a driver endangers human life. Indeed the state under its operative duties under Article 2 must have in place laws which protect the lives of others. The offence was a recordable offence being one in respect of which a period of imprisonment could be ordered.",
                "(x) Time limitations on the retention of data for particular categories of offences can be imposed as has occurred in some legal systems such as in the Netherlands ( See W. and Van der Velden ). Different countries operate different policies in this field and some other countries follow practices similar to those followed in the United Kingdom. Any time restriction is inevitably somewhat arbitrary and it is difficult to point to any particular reason why one particular period as opposed to another should be chosen. To introduce time limitations for some offences simply to avoid a possible charge of disproportionality smacks of defensive policy making in a field which requires a proper balancing of the interests of the public against the consequences of criminal activity. The introduction of different time periods for different offences or for different sentences would clearly add to the administrative burden and would require changes and deletion of recorded data. This complexity would be aggravated in the case of those found guilty periodically of repeat offending in respect of minor offences. The removal of such data would give the offender no benefit other than the knowledge that his data is no longer recorded. As already noted the retention of the data represents a very minor intrusion into his private life.",
                "(xi) The retention of the data serves the added purpose of discouraging a convicted offender from reoffending for the offender has the knowledge that the police have available data which could lead to his detection. The permanent retention of that data thus serves a useful long term purpose in that regard.",

That did not mean that system in Northern Ireland (and the United Kingdom) for convicted persons was necessarily proportionate. However, the level of interference in the applicant ’ s Article 8 rights was low, and a fair balance must be struck between competing public and private interests when considering whether that interference is justified. The United Kingdom struck that balance by choosing recordable offences as the touchstone for retention, and this appeared proportionate and justified. He took into account the fact that the applicant was only fined and not imprisoned but highlighted that driving with excess alcohol is a serious offence. He also noted Principle 7 of the Committee of Ministers ’ Recommendation No. R(87)15 as giving some support for the proposition that the fact that a conviction may become spent is potentially relevant, but did not find this was decisive. He also noted that the scheme under scrutiny applied only to adults, whereas in S. and Marper, cited above, the Court was examining a scheme which also applied to minors."

                "“In S. and Marper the ECtHR, when considering the margin of appreciation in the case of those who were acquitted, placed some reliance upon the fact that the United Kingdom was alone or almost alone in retaining biometric data in such cases. There is a much broader range of approaches in the case of those who have been convicted. The Secretary of State produced an annex setting out a summary of inclusions and removal criteria in other jurisdictions. It is attached to this judgment as Annex B. It shows that in such cases many countries retain biometric data for very long periods. In addition to England and Wales and Northern Ireland, Ireland and Scotland are I think the only jurisdictions which provide for indefinite retention. However, there are several states which provide for retention until death. They are Austria: five years after death or 80 years of age; Denmark: two years after death or at 80 years of age; Estonia: ten years after death; Finland: ten years after death; Lithuania: 100 years after inclusion or ten years after death; Luxembourg: ten years after death; The Netherlands: as stated above and 80 years after a conviction against minors; Romania five years after death or 60 years of age; and Slovakia: 100 years after date of birth. It seems to me that in the context of a person ’ s rights under article 8 there is little, if any, difference between retention for an indefinite period and retention until death or effectively until death.",
                "Annex B shows that there are other formulae. They include Belgium: 30 years after inclusion; France: 40 years after the end of the sentence or after the age of 80; Hungary: 20 years after the sentence has been served; Latvia: 75 years of age; Poland: 35 years after conviction; Germany: DNA profiles are reviewed after ten years and removal depends on a court decision; Italy: 20 years after the incident but no profile can be kept for more than 40 years; and Sweden: ten years after sentence. It can thus be seen that member states have chosen many different approaches but there is, in my opinion, no principled basis upon which the system in operation in Northern Ireland can be held to be disproportionate, especially when compared with the significant number of countries which retain DNA profiles until death or effectively until death. Very few states have a process of review .”"

To that question only one answer can be given, in my opinion. Clearly, a far more nuanced, more sensibly targeted policy can be devised. At a minimum, the removal of some of the less serious offences from its ambit is warranted. But also, a system of review, whereby those affected by the policy could apply, for instance on grounds of exemplary behaviour since conviction, for removal of their data from the database would be entirely feasible. Similarly, gradation of periods of retention to reflect the seriousness of the offence involved would contribute to the goal of ensuring that the interference was no more intrusive than it required to be.",

There is no evidence that consideration has been given to the question of whether it is necessary for the effective combatting of crime that the materials concerned in this case should be retained indefinitely.",

He was unable to point to evidence, however, that the question of whether it was necessary that there be retention of all data from all convicted of recordable offences for all time had been considered. Absent such consideration and in light of the fact that it is eminently possible to conceive of measures which are less intrusive but which would conduce to the avowed aim of the policy, it is simply impossible to say that the policy in its present form is the least intrusive means of achieving its stated aim. ”"

But the margin of appreciation that is available to the state does not extend to its being permitted to act in a way which is not Convention compliant. If the state acts in such a way, it cannot insulate itself from challenge by recourse to the margin of appreciation principle. In Wingrove v. UK (1997) 24 EHRR 1, para 58, a ‘ broad margin ’ case, ECtHR emphasised that authorities within the state in question were in a better position than international judges to give an opinion \"on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the ‘ necessity ’ of the ‘ restriction ’ \". Domestic courts therefore have the responsibility to examine closely the proportionality of the measure without being unduly influenced by the consideration that the Strasbourg court, if conducting the same exercise, might feel constrained to give the contracting state ’ s decision a margin of appreciation.",

Initially there were delays before the Northern Ireland Assembly in adopting the piece of legislation designed to allow implementation of POFA in Northern Ireland which meant that additional powers had to be given to implement the POFA provisions. These were set out in a further piece of legislation, the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. However, following adoption of that Act, it came to light that a drafting error in POFA had been copied into the legislation for Northern Ireland. This error had the effect that a very significant volume of biometric data would inadvertently fall to be destroyed under the new legislative regime upon commencement. Therefore, the 2014 Act was not brought into force and an amendment was adopted to address the problem in a further piece of legislation. The United Kingdom informed the Committee of Ministers that this latest legislation would receive Royal Assent by summer 2015. However, on 13 April 2016 the United Kingdom informed the Committee of Ministers that due to unforeseen circumstances the legislative provisions were not commenced on the date expected (see DH-DD(2016)489)."

In respect of s.64 (1A) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act the Court found in S. and Marper (cited above, § 97) that the retention of the applicants ’ fingerprint and DNA records had a clear basis in the domestic law.

Accordingly it found it was not necessary to decide whether the wording of Section 64 met the “quality of law” requirements within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention (see S. and Marper (cited above § 99).

Moreover, it has not been suggested that it is possible to identify relationships between individuals from fingerprint or photograph data. The Court therefore accepts that in relation to fingerprints and photographs, periods of retention which end on or shortly after death could be considered comparable to indefinite retention; although, it is aware of the possibility of rapid technological advances in this domain in particular concerning technology for facial recognition and facial mapping (see the developments outlined in paragraphs 67 - 70 above).

However, the Court considers that the situation is different concerning DNA profiles and that there is a distinction between retaining DNA profiles indefinitely and setting a defined limit on the retention period linked to the biological life of the person concerned, even if the period of retention foreseen is long. That is because retaining genetic data after the death of the data subject continues to impact on individuals biologically related to the data subject. The Court recalls that when considering the nature of the interference with privacy occasioned by the retention of DNA profiles, it has observed that the use of DNA profiles for familial searching with a view to identifying a possible genetic relationship between individuals is of a highly sensitive nature and there is a need for very strict controls in this respect. In the Court ’ s view, the DNA profiles ’ capacity to provide a means of identifying genetic relationships between individuals is in itself sufficient to conclude that their retention interferes with the right to the private life of the individuals concerned. The frequency of familial searches, the safeguards attached thereto and the likelihood of detriment in a particular case are immaterial in this respect ( see S. and Marper, cited above, § 75). As familial searching can be carried out on DNA profiles after the death of the data subject, the Court cannot accept the submission that it is possible to equate the retention of biometric data up to a fixed point in time linked to the death of the person from whom it was taken, with its indefinite retention."

It is true that in S. and Marper, cited above, the Court found the United Kingdom was alone in retaining indefinitely the DNA of unconvicted persons and concluded that the strong consensus existing among the Contracting States was of considerable importance and narrowed the margin of appreciation left to the respondent State in the assessment of the permissible limits of the interference with private life in this sphere (see S. and Marper, cited above, § 112). The situation is not exactly the same in the present case where even taking account of the distinction identified between retention linked to the death of the data subject and indefinite retention in relation to DNA profiles, there are a small number of states amongst those surveyed who operate indefinite retention regimes (see paragraph 53 above). Nonetheless, the Court considers that those states are in a distinct minority. The majority of States have regimes in which there is a defined limit on the period for which data can be retained. It also takes account of the fact that the Government in their submissions, referred to schemes permitting indefinite retention of biometric data of convicted persons in Austria and Lithuania. However, those regimes have subsequently been amended to provide for definite periods of detention (see paragraph 53 above)."

The Government advanced a separate submission relating to the margin of appreciation, which was that the scheme in Northern Ireland means that DNA samples will only be taken (and so DNA profiles only retained) from people convicted of recordable offences, namely an offence which is punishable by a term of imprisonment. Accordingly, the retention regime has regard to a minimum degree of seriousness in relation to offending. The Court notes that the Grand Chamber previously rejected a similar submission in S. and Marper, cited above, where the fact that data was only taken and so retained in relation to recordable offences under the scheme examined, still left such a wide variety of offences falling within the retention regime that the regime could be characterised as applying whatever the nature or seriousness of the offence ( see S. and Marper, cited above, § § 26, 110 and 119 ). The Court sees no reason to take a different approach from the Grand Chamber."

The United Kingdom is one of the few Council of Europe jurisdictions to permit indefinite retention of DNA profiles, fingerprints and photographs of convicted persons. The degree of consensus existing amongst Contracting States has narrowed the margin of appreciation available to the respondent State in particular in respect of the retention of DNA profiles for the reasons set out above (see paragraphs 81 ‑ 82 above)."

With reference to the extensive amount of judicial scrutiny at the domestic level, the Government have contended that the question whether it was necessary to retain the applicant ’ s data falls within the state ’ s margin of appreciation and it was therefore not for this Court to decide. In this respect, the Court recalls that in Article 8 cases it has generally understood the margin of appreciation to mean that, where the independent and impartial domestic courts have carefully examined the facts, applying the relevant human rights standards consistently with the Convention and its case-law, and adequately balanced the applicant ’ s personal interests against the more general public interest in the case, it is not for it to substitute its own assessment of the merits (including, in particular, its own assessment of the factual details of proportionality) for that of the competent national authorities, unless there are shown to be compelling reasons for doing so (see McDonald v. the United Kingdom, no. 4241/12, § § 56 - 57, 20 May 2014)."

In this connection, it notes that the proportionality of the measure was scrutinised by the domestic courts up to and including the Supreme Court. However, the courts ’ made their assessment in particular relating to the retention of the applicant ’ s photograph on the basis that it was held on a local database and could not be searched against other photographs, a conclusion which appears to have been superseded by technological developments (see paragraph 69 above). In that respect the Court recalls the importance of examining compliance with the principles of Article 8 where the powers vested in the state are obscure, creating a risk of arbitrariness especially where the technology available is continually becoming more sophisticated (see Catt v. the United Kingdom, no. 43514/15, § 114, 24 January 2019). The Supreme Court also proceeded in its analysis on the basis that very few states have a process of review, whereas it would appear that of the States surveyed by the Court most have a form of administrative and / or judicial review available (see paragraphs 15 and 57 above). Finally, concerning DNA profiles, the Supreme Court considered that there was no distinction to be identified between retention linked to the death of the data subject, and indefinite retention (see paragraph 15 above). However, the Court has rejected the Government ’ s submission made on the same basis (see paragraph 81 above)."

In that case, the applicants had been repeatedly convicted of serious offences and sentenced to prison. The law provided for the indefinite retention of their biometric data. That data was retained for those convicted of serious and/or repeat offences, and the Federal Criminal Office was obliged to review at regular intervals whether the continued storage of the data was still necessary for the performance of its task or otherwise to be deleted at the latest every ten years. However, the Court has also found a regime with a definite retention period of forty years in law but which amounted to an indefinite period in practice, to be in violation of the Convention (see Aycaguer v. France, no. 8806/12, § 42, 22 June 2017). In that case, the applicant was convicted of a minor offence and subject to fine. His biometric data was retained under provisions which did not differentiate according to the nature and/or seriousness of the offence committed, and he had no possibility to request the deletion of the data (see Aycaguer, cited above, §§ 43-47). It also notes that the Court was satisfied in Peruzzo and Martens, cited above, that there was nothing to establish that the domestic courts or authorities in the proceedings at issue had not observed the relevant guarantees (see § 48). Whereas in Aycaguer, cited above, the authorities ’ failure to implement a decree had created a degree of ambiguity in the legal provisions governing the retention of data, and they had not given any follow up to the decision of the Constitutional Council of 16 September 2010 criticising the regime then in force (see § § 42 -43 )."

However, in light of the considerations set out above (see paragraph 87 ) the Court considers that in respect of retention regimes for the biometric data of convicted persons, the duration of the retention period is not necessarily conclusive in assessing whether a State has overstepped the acceptable margin of appreciation in establishing the relevant regime. In that connection, it underlines that there is not the same risk of stigmatisation in retaining the data as in S. and Marper ( cited above, § 122). Also of importance is whether the regime takes into account the seriousness of the offending and the need to retain the data, and the safeguards available to the individual. Where a State has put itself at the limit of the margin of appreciation in allocating to itself the most extensive power of indefinite retention, the existence and functioning of certain safeguards becomes decisive (see Catt, cited above, § 119)."

As to whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the measure of indefinite retention were “relevant and sufficient”, the Court notes that the Government submitted that the more data is retained, the more crime is prevented, providing a variety of different case studies to support that general contention. In this connection, the Court considers that accepting such an argument in the context of a scheme of indefinite retention would in practice be tantamount to justifying the storage of information on the whole population and their deceased relatives, which would most definitely be excessive and irrelevant (see M.K. v. France, no. 19522/09, cited above § 40, 18 April 2013 and Aycagauer, cited above, § 34).

The Government have explained in their submissions that the management of the Northern Ireland DNA database is a practical consideration selected by them in order to enable them to discharge their obligations under Article 46 § 2. The United Kingdom ’ s choice of means in that context falls outside the Court ’ s jurisdiction and cannot affect the examination of Convention principles that the Court is called upon to undertake in the present case. In the exercise of its competence under Article 46 § 2 of the Convention, the Committee of Ministers is better placed than the Court to assess the specific measures to be taken (see Rutkowski and Others v.

Croatia, no. 57856/11, § 52, 12 June 2014 ). Investigating ‘ cold cases ’, is also in the public interest, in the general sense of combating crime (see paragraph 75 above). However, also in the context of unlawful killings the Court has underlined that the police must discharge their duties in a manner which is compatible with the rights and freedoms of other individuals (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, § 121, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VIII ). Indeed, without respect for the requisite proportionality vis ‑ à ‑ vis the legitimate aims assigned to such mechanisms, their advantages would be outweighed by the serious breaches which they would cause to the rights and freedoms which States must guarantee under the Convention to persons under their jurisdiction (see Aycaguer, cited above, § 34)."

However, the applicant ’ s biometric data and photographs were retained without reference to the seriousness of his offence and without regard to any continuing need to retain that data indefinitely. Moreover, the police are vested with the power to delete biometric data and photographs only in exceptional circumstances (see paragraph 30 above). There is no provision allowing the applicant to apply to have the data concerning him deleted if conserving the data no longer appeared necessary in view of the nature of the offence, the age of the person concerned, the length of time that has elapsed and the person ’ s current personality ( see Gardel v. France, no. 16428/05, § 68, ECHR 2009). Accordingly, the review available to the individual would appear to be so narrow as to be almost hypothetical (see paragraph 31 above, and also M.K. v.

It underlines however that the test of proportionality is not that another less restrictive regime could be imposed. The core issue is whether, in adopting the measure and striking the balance it did, the legislature acted within the margin of appreciation afforded to it (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § 110, ECHR 2013 (extracts)."

All five justices agreed that Article 8 was applicable and that retention of the data amounted to an interference with the applicant’s rights under that article."

                "25. Lord Sumption delivered the leading opinion for the majority. He set out the applicable legal framework for collection and retention of data. After reviewing the requirements for “lawfulness” under Article 8 of the Convention, by reference to S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 99, ECHR 2008, he concluded that the interference was in accordance with the law. He noted that the Data Protection Act laid down principles that were germane and directly applicable to police information and contained a framework for their enforcement. These principles were supplemented by a statutory Code of Practice and administrative Guidance (see “Relevant domestic law and practice”, below), compliance with which was mandatory. While, inevitably, there were discretionary elements in the scheme, their ambit was limited. Lord Sumption considered the applicant’s argument that the Code of Practice and the Guidance did not enable him to know precisely what data would be obtained and stored or for how long to be unrealistic. He explained that the infinite variety of situations in which issues of compliance might arise and the inevitable element of judgment involved in assessing them made complete codification impossible. However, he noted, any person who thought that the police held personal information about him could seek access to it under section 7 of the Data Protection Act and, if he objected to its retention or use, could bring the matter before the Information Commissioner."
            ],
            [
                "26. Lord Sumption then turned to consider the proportionality of the interference. He observed that political protest was a basic right recognised by the common law and protected by Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. He summarised the facts of the applicant’s case, including the nature of Smash EDO’s activities and the applicant’s attendance at public demonstrations, and the framework for police collection and retention of data in this context. He concluded that the retention of information, including some which related to persons such as the applicant against whom no criminality was alleged, was justified. The starting point, in his view, was the nature and extent of the invasion of privacy involved in the retention of information of this kind, which he described as minor. While the information stored was personal information because it related to individuals, it was in no sense intimate or sensitive information. Rather, it was information about the overt activities in public places of individuals whose main object in attending the events in question was to draw public attention to their support for a cause. Although the collation of the information in the form in which it appeared in police records was not publicly available, the primary facts recorded were and always had been in the public domain; no intrusive procedures had been used to discover and record them."
            ],
            [
                "27. He then addressed the justification for retaining the personal data for someone who has a clean record and for whom violent criminality must be a very remote prospect indeed. Referring back to the National Coordinator’s statement (see paragraphs 18 to 20), he identified three reasons for the need to retain such data: (1) to enable the police to make a more informed assessment of the risks and threats to public order; (2) to investigate criminal offences where there have been any, and to identify potential witnesses and victims; (3) to study the leadership, organisation, tactics and methods of protest groups which have been persistently associated with violence. He also underlined some basic facts about intelligence-gathering commenting:",
                "“31 ... Most intelligence is necessarily acquired in the first instance indiscriminately. Its value can only be judged in hindsight, as subsequent analysis for particular purposes discloses a relevant pattern ... The most that can be done is to assess whether the value of the material is proportionate to the gravity of the threat to the public ...”"
            ],
            [
                "28. Lord Sumption further considered that the retention in a nominal record or information report of information about third persons such as the applicant did not carry any stigma of suspicion or guilt. It did not imply that all those mentioned as participating in events such as Smash EDO protests were being characterised as extremists. It was further noteworthy that the material was not usable or disclosable for any purpose other than police purposes, except as a result of an access request by the subject under the Data Protection Act. It was not used for political purposes or for any kind of victimisation of dissidents and was not available to potential employers. The material was also periodically reviewed for retention or deletion according to rational and proportionate criteria based on an assessment of danger to the public and value for policing purposes."
            ],
            [
                "29. In conclusion, Lord Sumption was of the view that sufficient safeguards existed to ensure that personal information was not retained for longer than required for the purpose of maintaining public order and preventing or detecting crime, and that disclosure to third parties was properly restricted."

Such dossiers require particular justification, not least because of their potentially chilling effect upon the right to engage in peaceful public protest. Mr Catt may be a regular attender at demonstrations, some of which are organised by a group which resorts to extreme tactics, but he himself has not been involved in criminal activity at those or any other demonstrations, nor is he likely to be in the future. Had the police kept a nominal record about him, therefore, I would have been inclined to agree with Lord Toulson that it could not be justified.”"

However, he considered that retention of the data was disproportionate. He explained that he had no difficulty in accepting in general terms the explanation given in the National Coordinator’s statement, but that there had to be limits, particularly in the case of a person who had never been accused of violence and had been assessed not to be a threat. The statement did not explain why it was thought necessary to maintain for many years after the event information on someone whom the police had concluded, as they had in July 2010, was not known to have acted violently and did not appear to be involved in the coordination of the relevant events. Nor did it explain why it was thought necessary and proportionate to keep details of the applicant’s attendance at other political protest events such as the Labour Party conference and the TUC conference."

He agreed with the Court of Appeal that the Commissioner had not shown that the value of the information relating to the applicant was sufficient to justify its continued retention. As to the suggestion that it would place too great a burden on the police to undertake frequent reviews, Lord Toulson pointed out that there was no evidence from the police that this would be over-burdensome. On the contrary, he said, the thrust of the evidence was that they did carry out regular reviews so there was nothing to indicate that deleting their historic records of the applicant’s attendances at protest events would create any real burden."

However, he did not agree that there was any risk of that being hampered by upholding the decision of the Court of Appeal in the applicant’s case. While the court should be slow to disagree with the evaluation of the potential usefulness of evidence by the police if a clear reason for it had been advanced, on the facts of this case Lord Toulson could not see what value they had identified by keeping indefinitely a record of the applicant’s attendances at events where he had done no more than exercise his democratic right of peaceful protest. He concluded:",
                "“69. One might question why it really matters, if there is no risk of the police making inappropriate disclosure of the information to others. It matters because in modern society the state has very extensive powers of keeping records on its citizens. If a citizen’s activities are lawful, they should be free from the state keeping a record of them unless, and then only for as long as, such a record really needs to be kept in the public interest.”",

The Court also agrees with the domestic courts that the police had an obvious role to monitor protests of Smash EDO where the activities of that group were known to be violent and potentially criminal. Therefore, even if the applicant himself was not suspected of being directly involved in that group’s criminal activities, it was justifiable for the police to collect his personal data. He had after all decided to repeatedly and publicly align himself with the activities of a violent protest group."

It shares the domestic courts’ concern that there is a need for caution before overriding the judgment of the police about what information is likely to assist them in their task (see paragraph 22 above). In this respect, the Court underlines that its conclusion does not call into question the fact that there may have been a pressing need for the police to retain the applicant’s personal data for a period of time after it was collected. However, in the absence of any rules setting a definitive maximum time limit on the retention of such data the applicant was entirely reliant on the diligent application of the highly flexible safeguards in the MOPI to ensure the proportionate retention of his data. Where the state chooses to put in place such a system, the necessity of the effective procedural safeguards becomes decisive (see mutatis mutandis S.M.M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 77450/12, § 84, 22 June 2017). Those safeguards must enable the deletion of any such data, once its continued retention becomes disproportionate."

In this connection, the Court observes that as the applicant’s personal data could potentially be retained indefinitely the only time limit that he could be certain of was that the data would held for a minimum of six years, at which point it would be subject to a scheduled review. In the present case, it is not clear that these six year reviews or any later reviews were conducted in any meaningful way. Certainly, they did not directly result in the deletion of any of the applicant’s personal data."

So far as the Court is aware, at least some of the applicant’s personal data concerning his involvement in non-violent protest was collected over six years ago and remains in the domestic extremism database (see paragraph 16, above) despite the fact that the police concluded, and the domestic courts affirmed that the applicant was not considered a danger to anyone (see paragraph 31, above)."

Engaging in peaceful protest has specific protection under Article 11 of the Convention, which also contains special protection for trade unions, whose events the applicant attended (see paragraph 10, above). In this connection it notes that in the National Coordinator’s statement, the definition of “domestic extremism” refers to collection of data on groups and individuals who act “outside the democratic process”. Therefore, the police do not appear to have respected their own definition (fluid as it may have been (see paragraph 105)) in retaining data on the applicant’s association with peaceful, political events: such events are a vital part of the democratic process (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, § 92, ECHR 2004 ‑ I). The Court has already highlighted the danger of an ambiguous approach to the scope of data collection in the present case (see paragraph 97 above). Accordingly, it considers that the decisions to retain the applicant’s personal data did not take into account the heightened level of protection it attracted as data revealing a political opinion, and that in the circumstances its retention must have had a “chilling effect”."

Relevant provisions can be found, notably, in the Information Act of 1992 (see paragraph 38 above) and various acts pertaining to confidentiality of medical information (see paragraphs 39-40 above). However, it appears that these safeguards remained largely inoperative in the applicant ’ s case, both during the processing of his personal data by his employer, and during the examination of his relevant claims by the domestic courts.",

First of all, in so far as the applicant complained that in the summer of 1997 his employer had collected without requisite justification and retained in his personnel file data which was excessive for the purposes of maintaining the obligatory military duty register of its employees, the Court notes at the outset that the disputed act of collection had taken place before the Convention entered into force in respect of Ukraine (11 September 19 97). It is therefore as such outside of the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction. At the same time, as the applicant ’ s complaint concerns, in essence, not only this initial act, but more broadly the fact that the relevant information was included in and retained on his file, the Court considers itself competent to address the issue of retention (see Rotaru, cited above, § 46)."

            [

In this connection the Court notes that the information added to the applicant ’ s file in 1997 contained nothing more than the wording of Article 5b of the 1973 Diseases and Handicaps Schedule. A reference to this Article had already been entered in the applicant ’ s file earlier, because this provision indicated the grounds for his dispensation from military service in peacetime. A reference to the grounds for dispensation from military service was a standard and mandatory entry in the military duty register as kept by every employer pursuant to Instruction no. 165. As the Court has been informed, the foregoing Schedule was a published document. Accordingly, the text of the aforementioned Schedule being publicly consultable at any point of time, the fact that the applicant ’ s employer obtained it from the military enlistment office in summer 1997 was of secondary importance. It follows that the applicant ’ s employer was in possession of the information concerning the grounds for the applicant ’ s dispensation from military service as a result of the general set-up of the applicable legislative framework, rather than the employer ’ s individual conduct, contrary to what the applicant suggests."

The Court notes that it is not in a position to substitute itself for the competent domestic authorities in deciding on the modalities of keeping the military duty registers. However, the Court reiterates that core principles of data protection require the retention of data to be proportionate in relation to the purpose of collection and envisage limited periods of storage (see S. and Marper, cited above, § 107 ). In line with this, the Court considers that delegating to every employer a public function involving retention of sensitive health-related data concerning their employees can only be justified under Article 8 if such retention is accompanied by particularly strong procedural guarantees for ensuring, notably, that such data would be kept strictly confidential, would not be used for any other purpose except that for which it was collected, and would be kept up ‑ to ‑ date (see, mutatis mutandis, I. v.

At the same time, notwithstanding these requirements, the applicant ’ s employer retained the information dating back to 1981 and used it for deciding in 1997 and 2000 on the applicant ’ s requests for promotion, considering it permissible to disclose this information to third parties in this context."

In addition to that, as it did not indicate the specific nature of the applicant ’ s medical condition diagnosed at that time, it was also incomplete for the purposes of deciding whether or not he could be entrusted with the requested position. It is also notable that in 2002 the applicant was referred by his employer for a medical examination with a view to determining his fitness for the position he sought to occupy. Having obtained a positive conclusion, he was placed on a reserve list and subsequently promoted to his satisfaction (see paragraphs 17-18 above).

They also noted that he had not ascertained the exact role of the individual officers in disclosing his mental-health data. It is not evident from the text of these judgments that the national courts analysed whether using the disputed data by the applicant ’ s employer in deciding, within its discretion, whether to promote the applicant and rejecting the promotion request on its basis struck a fair balance between the employer ’ s interests and the applicant ’ s privacy-related concerns. The same was also true concerning the applicant ’ s complaint about disclosure of this data to the applicant ’ s co-workers in context of the decision-making procedure and its communication to the court in the course of a public hearing (compare also with Panteleyenko v. Ukraine, no. 11901/02, §§ 57 ‑ 61, 29 June 2006). The crux of the applicant ’ s complaints was therefore left outside the scope of the judicial examination.

This card had contained a reference to Article 5b of the Diseases and Handicaps Schedule issued in 1973, on the basis of which in 1981 the applicant had been declared unfit for military service in peacetime. No text from this Article had appeared on the above document. Tavrida had acted unlawfully in 1997 in obtaining the wording of this Article, which contained sensitive medical data, from the military enlistment office without the applicant ’ s knowledge or consent. It had also acted unlawfully in including this information in the applicant ’ s personnel file in spite of its retention patently having been excessive for the purposes for which it had been kept. Next, Tavrida had acted unlawfully in using this information for a new purpose, that is to say for assessing and turning down the applicant ’ s applications for promotion in 1997 and 2000, in spite of the fact that this information had been very old and of inadequate detail for determining the applicant ’ s fitness for the position he sought. Above all, Article 5b of the Diseases and Handicaps Schedule was insufficiently specific. It applied equally to persons suffering from very serious psychotic disorders and to those suffering from mild temporary conditions. In fact, the applicant had never been in a psychotic state. Making any conclusions concerning his mental health on the basis of the information contained in this Article had created a false appearance that he might have suffered from a very serious disorder. Should the applicant ’ s employer have been concerned about his mental health in terms of his promotion, it could have solicited more recent and specific information, in particular by referring the applicant to a medical commission for the assessment of his fitness for promotion. Having obtained such a referral in 2002, the applicant had duly passed the necessary assessment and had eventually been placed on the reserve list and then promoted to an engineering position."

The fact that the information entered initially had not used the exact wording of Article 5b was immaterial in this context, as the Diseases and Handicaps Schedules had been accessible by the public. By contacting the military enlistment office in 1997, Tavrida had simply confirmed the information which had already been provided by the applicant himself, rather than actually obtaining additional information. In the Government ’ s view, this situation was factually comparable to that examined by the Court in the case of N.F. v. Italy (no. 37119/97, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX ).

Poland, cited above, § 94, and M.N. and Others v. San Marino, no. 28005/12, § 71, 7 July 201 5 ). The Court reiterates from its well established case-law that the wording “in accordance with the law” requires the impugned measure both to have some basis in domestic law and to be compatible with the rule of law, that is to say to be accessible, foreseeable and accompanied by necessary procedural safeguards affording adequate legal protection against arbitrary application of the relevant legal provisions (see, among other authorities, S. and Marper, cited above, § 95, and M.N. and Others, cited above, § 7 2 )."

In order to protect a person against arbitrariness, it is not sufficient to provide a formal possibility of bringing adversarial proceedings to contest the application of a legal provision to his or her case.

In determining whether the impugned measures were “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court will consider whether, in the light of the case as a whole, the reasons adduced to justify them were relevant and sufficient and the measures were proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued (see, for example, Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 76, ECHR 2003 ‑ I). In this latter respect the Court has noted that, regard being had to the fundamental importance of data protection for effective exercise of one ’ s right to respect for private life, the margin of appreciation afforded to the member States in designing their respective legislative and administrative frameworks in this sphere is rather limited ( see, in particular, Peck, cited above, § § 77-78; and S. and Marper, cited above, §§ 10 2 -103). In this connection, the question of “ necessity of interference” may overlap with the question concerning quality of the requisite procedural safeguards afforded in the domestic law of the respondent State ( S. and Marper, cited above, § 99, and Avilkina and Others, cited above, § 37 )."

To date, a certain level of consensus on the international level and, in particular, between the Council of Europe member States has been achieved as regards the fundamental data protection principles and the corresponding basic procedural safeguards to be included in the national legislative frameworks in order to justify the necessity of any possible interference. These principles were formulated in a number of treaties and other legal instruments, including the Council of Europe Data Protection Convention no. 108 and other documents (see paragraphs 53- 60 above). The Court has previously referred to the relevant international instruments, most notably the Data Protection Convention, in assessing data processing and protection practices in individual cases brought under Article 8 of the Convention. In particular, drawing from that Convention, the Court has stated that the domestic law of the member States should notably ensure that personal data in issue are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are being collected or stored; that they are preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored and that the retained data are efficiently protected from misuse and abuse ( see, among other authorities, Gardel v. France, no. 16428/05, § 62, ECHR 2009). In line with internationally recognised data protection principles, the Court has also stated that it was essential for the applicable law to provide clear, detailed rules governing the scope and application of the relevant measures; as well as minimum safeguards concerning, inter alia, duration, storage, usage, access of third parties, procedures for preserving the integrity and confidentiality of data and procedures for their destruction, thus providing sufficient guarantees against the risk of abuse and arbitrariness at each stage of its processing (see, in particular, S. and Marper, cited above, § 99 and the references therein, and M.M. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 195). There are various crucial stages at which data protection issues under Article 8 of the Convention may arise, including during collection, storage, use and communication of data. At each stage, appropriate and adequate safeguards which reflect the principles elaborated in applicable data protection instruments must be put in place in order to justify the necessity of interference under Article 8 (see M.M. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, ibid).",

It appears that this disagreement may have been connected to a structural problem in domestic law.

It is therefore as such outside of the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction. At the same time, as the applicant ’ s complaint concerns, in essence, not only this initial act, but more broadly the fact that the relevant information was included in and retained on his file, the Court considers itself competent to address the issue of retention (see Rotaru, cited above, § 46)."

A reference to this Article had already been entered in the applicant ’ s file earlier, because this provision indicated the grounds for his dispensation from military service in peacetime. A reference to the grounds for dispensation from military service was a standard and mandatory entry in the military duty register as kept by every employer pursuant to Instruction no. 165. As the Court has been informed, the foregoing Schedule was a published document. Accordingly, the text of the aforementioned Schedule being publicly consultable at any point of time, the fact that the applicant ’ s employer obtained it from the military enlistment office in summer 1997 was of secondary importance. It follows that the applicant ’ s employer was in possession of the information concerning the grounds for the applicant ’ s dispensation from military service as a result of the general set-up of the applicable legislative framework, rather than the employer ’ s individual conduct, contrary to what the applicant suggests."

The Court notes that it is not in a position to substitute itself for the competent domestic authorities in deciding on the modalities of keeping the military duty registers. However, the Court reiterates that core principles of data protection require the retention of data to be proportionate in relation to the purpose of collection and envisage limited periods of storage (see S. and Marper, cited above, § 107 ). In line with this, the Court considers that delegating to every employer a public function involving retention of sensitive health-related data concerning their employees can only be justified under Article 8 if such retention is accompanied by particularly strong procedural guarantees for ensuring, notably, that such data would be kept strictly confidential, would not be used for any other purpose except that for which it was collected, and would be kept up ‑ to ‑ date (see, mutatis mutandis, I. v.

At the same time, notwithstanding these requirements, the applicant ’ s employer retained the information dating back to 1981 and used it for deciding in 1997 and 2000 on the applicant ’ s requests for promotion, considering it permissible to disclose this information to third parties in this context."

They also noted that he had not ascertained the exact role of the individual officers in disclosing his mental-health data. It is not evident from the text of these judgments that the national courts analysed whether using the disputed data by the applicant ’ s employer in deciding, within its discretion, whether to promote the applicant and rejecting the promotion request on its basis struck a fair balance between the employer ’ s interests and the applicant ’ s privacy-related concerns. The same was also true concerning the applicant ’ s complaint about disclosure of this data to the applicant ’ s co-workers in context of the decision-making procedure and its communication to the court in the course of a public hearing (compare also with Panteleyenko v. Ukraine, no. 11901/02, §§ 57 ‑ 61, 29 June 2006). The crux of the applicant ’ s complaints was therefore left outside the scope of the judicial examination.

The basis of his complaint was a specific instance of such surveillance which took place in connection with criminal proceedings against him. As the Court must first ascertain whether the interference complained of was “in accordance with the law”, it must inevitably assess the relevant domestic law in force at the time in relation to the requirements of the fundamental principle of the rule of law. Such a review necessarily entails some degree of abstraction (see Kruslin, cited above, § 32). Nevertheless, in cases arising from individual applications, the Court must as a rule focus its attention not on the law as such but on the manner in which it was applied to the applicant in the particular circumstances (see Goranova-Karaeneva v. Bulgaria, no. 12739/05, § 48, 8 March 2011)."

Thus the central question for the Court to determine is whether the relevant domestic law, including the way in which it was interpreted by the domestic courts, indicated with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the discretion conferred on the public authorities, and in particular whether the domestic system of secret surveillance, as applied by the domestic authorities, afforded adequate safeguards against various possible abuses (compare Malone, cited above, § 70; Kruslin, cited above, §§ 35-36; Huvig, cited above, §§ 34-35; and Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, §§ 66-75, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ II ). Since the existence of adequate safeguards against abuse is a matter closely related to the question whether the “necessity” test was complied with in this case, the Court will address both the requirement that the interference be “in accordance with the law” and that it be “necessary ” (see Kvasnica, cited above, §§ 83-84)."

The statutory preconditions for issuing a secret surveillance order are the existence of a probable cause to believe that an individual alone, or jointly with others, has committed one of the offences proscribed by law (see paragraph 55 above; Article 181 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), and that an investigation in respect of the offences in issue is either not possible or would be extremely difficult (see paragraph 55 above; Article 180 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure)."

Strictly speaking, every individual under the jurisdiction of the Croatian authorities, when relying on these provisions of the relevant domestic law, should be confident that the powers of secret surveillance will be subjected to prior judicial scrutiny and carried out only on the basis of a detailed judicial order properly stipulating the necessity and proportionality of any such measure."

In particular, it explained that only a detailed statement of reasons in the secret surveillance orders “guarantees that the existence of a ‘ probable cause to believe ’ that an offence proscribed under the law has been committed will precede the use of secret surveillance measures, that a minimum degree of probability exists that an actual – and not some possible – offence has been committed, and that the use of State powers will be logical and convincing and subsequently challengeable during the proceedings before the competent courts”. In the absence of this, according to the Constitutional Court, a secret surveillance order will breach the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 57 above)."

It is therefore important that the authorising authority – the investigating judge in the instant case – determines whether there is compelling justification for authorising measures of secret surveillance (compare Iordachi and Others v. Moldova, no. 25198/02, § 51, 10 February 2009 )."

In particular, the Supreme Court held, dealing with the matter in the context of the admissibility of evidence, which is a different matter under the Convention (see paragraph 99 below), that a lack of reasons in the secret surveillance orders, contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, could be compensated by retrospective specific reasons with regard to the relevant questions at a later stage of the proceedings by the court being requested to exclude the evidence thus obtained from the case file (see paragraph 58 above). This appears to be accepted by the Constitutional Court, which, in its decision no. U-III-2781/2010 of 9 January 2014, held that if the secret surveillance orders did not contain reasons, under certain conditions reasons could be stated in the first-instance judgment or the decision concerning the request for exclusion of unlawfully obtained evidence (see paragraph 60 above)."

In an area as sensitive as the use of secret surveillance, which is tolerable under the Convention only in so far as strictly necessary for safeguarding the democratic institutions, the Court has difficulty in accepting this situation created by the national courts. It suggests that the practice in the administration of law, which is in itself not sufficiently clear given the two contradictory positions adopted by both the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 93 and 96, and 57-61 above), conflicts with the clear wording of the legislation limiting the exercise of the discretion conferred on the public authorities in the use of covert surveillance (compare Kopp, cited above, § 73; and Kvasnica, cited above, § 87)."

At the same time, the Government have not provided any information on remedies – such as an application for a declaratory judgment or an action for damages – which may become available to a person in the applicant ’ s situation (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, § 102)."

This court also refused the request by the defence to examine the case files of the Rijeka County Court no. Kir-Us-1/09 and the Zagreb County Court no.

In any event, as to the request by the defence that the secret surveillance orders be excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence, it should be noted that these are not evidence but court decisions so they cannot be excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence.

                "“It is to be noted that the question of the use of evidence obtained by special investigative measures in criminal proceedings is regulated under Article 182 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This provision expressly excludes the use of such evidence obtained contrary to Articles 180 and 182 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",
                "The submissions of the accused in support of their request for the exclusion of unlawfully obtained evidence on the grounds that the orders issued by the investigating judge (save for the one of 8 March 2008) contained no reasons and was thus ex lege unlawful evidence is not correct.",
                "Specifically, an order (just like judgments and decisions) is an act of the court and in principle (unlike judgments and decisions) contains no reasons. The duty to state reasons in court orders is exceptional where search orders and orders for the use of special investigative measures limiting constitutional rights and freedoms are concerned. The requirement for the court to give reasoned orders for the use of special investigative measures limiting constitutional rights and freedoms flows from the requirement contained in Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The lawmaker did not, however, seek to sanction conduct of the courts contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ..., Article 182 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that “the results [of the use of special investigative measures] cannot be used in criminal proceedings”.",
                "It follows that the lack of reasons for the orders concerning the use of special investigative measures limiting constitutional rights and freedoms does not render the evidence thus obtained unlawful. This also follows from the wording of the part of Article 9 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provides that unlawfully obtained evidence is evidence obtained in breach of the law on criminal procedure where such unlawfulness is expressly envisaged under a legal provision, which is not the case regarding conduct contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",
                "With regard to conduct contrary to Article 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which would provide grounds for a conclusion of unlawfulness of evidence, it is to be noted that this provision is multi-layered.",
                "Without doubt, evidence is ex lege unlawfully obtained if it is the result of the use of special investigative measures limiting constitutional rights and freedoms which have not been ordered by the court based on a request by the State Attorney; if the measures do not relate to an individual concerning one of the offences under Article 181 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; or if a measure other than those provided for by law is ordered.",
                "A further condition, referred to in the decision of the Constitutional Court [ no. U-III-857/2008 of 1 October 2008; see paragraph 57 above] invoked by the appellants is the requirement that the general conditions for the use of such orders have been met, namely, the existence of probable cause to believe that an individual has committed one of the offences listed under the law, with regard to which the order is issued, and that the investigation cannot be carried out by other means or that it would be extremely difficult.",
                "It goes without saying that the investigating judge, when ruling on the request of the State Attorney, must take these general conditions into account. However, since the lack of reasons does not render the evidence obtained unlawful ex lege, the mere fact that an order has been issued based on a request by the State Attorney indicates that the general conditions have been met. However, if the investigating judge disagrees with the request to issue an order for the use of special investigative measures, and finds that the general conditions have not been met, he or she will request the panel under Article 20 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to rule on the matter, ...",
                "Of course, a citizen whose constitutional rights and freedoms are thus limited, which is possible under Article 16 of the Constitution only in accordance with the law and in order to protect the rights and freedoms of others or the legal order, public morals or health, must be able to verify whether the legal conditions, including the general ones, for such limitation have been met, in order to protect his or her constitutional rights from unjustified infringement by the executive, and possibly judicial, authorities. It is therefore understandable that the accused are now challenging the lawfulness of the orders from the perspective of the general conditions for their use, which is certainly relevant for the question of the lawfulness of the evidence thus obtained. ...",
                "Furthermore, in order that the court may issue an order for the use of special investigative measures, the request for their use must contain a statement of reasons to the effect that the investigation cannot be conducted by means other than interfering with the constitutional rights and freedoms, or that this would be extremely difficult. The very fact that the order has been issued, ..., even if, contrary to the law, it does not contain reasons, in itself implies acceptance of the arguments contained in the reasons for the request [for the use of special investigative measures].",
                "However, fully accepting the rights of citizens to question the existence of the general conditions for issuing an order, the court being requested to exclude from the case file evidence obtained by such contested orders for the use of special investigative measures is obliged, where no reasons are stated in the order contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to provide specific reasons with regard to the relevant questions. That court ... must carefully analyse the content of the request of the State attorney [for the use of special investigative measures] and other accompanying material and decide whether it can conclude from the request that, at the relevant time, there existed a suspicion that an individual had committed one of the offences listed under the law, and why it considers that obtaining the evidence by the use of measures interfering with the constitutional rights of citizens is necessary ...",
                "These answers, contrary to the appeal submissions, can be given when ruling on the lawfulness of the orders issued [for the use special investigative measures] given that the orders, contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, do not contain a statement of reasons, and that the lawmaker, having regard to the provisions of Article 282 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, did not sanction it by unlawfulness of evidence obtained by the use of such defective orders. The purpose of the provision concerning unlawful evidence is not to exclude evidence in favour of persons in respect of whom there is a reasonable suspicion that they have committed an offence, but to protect citizens who are presumed innocent (until proven guilty ) from illegal actions by the judicial and executive authorities where such actions are illegal to such an extent that the lawmaker expressly categorised the results as unlawfully obtained evidence.”"

Indeed, the Court notes, given the Constitutional Court ’ s practice of declaring any constitutional complaint against an indictment inadmissible (see paragraph 61 above), that it was the only way for the applicant to bring his complaints about the alleged unlawful use of secret surveillance before the Constitutional Court, as required under the Court ’ s case-law (see paragraph 71 above; and Blaj v.

Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Bykov, cited above, § 78, and Blaj, cited above, § 128 )."

In assessing the existence and extent of such necessity the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation but this margin is subject to European supervision. The Court has to determine whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the “interference” to what is “necessary in a democratic society”. In addition, the values of a democratic society must be followed as faithfully as possible in the supervisory procedures if the bounds of necessity, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2, are not to be exceeded (see Kvasnica, cited above, § 80; and Kennedy, cited above, § 154).",

As the Court must first ascertain whether the interference complained of was “in accordance with the law”, it must inevitably assess the relevant domestic law in force at the time in relation to the requirements of the fundamental principle of the rule of law. Such a review necessarily entails some degree of abstraction (see Kruslin, cited above, § 32). Nevertheless, in cases arising from individual applications, the Court must as a rule focus its attention not on the law as such but on the manner in which it was applied to the applicant in the particular circumstances (see Goranova-Karaeneva v.

The statutory preconditions for issuing a secret surveillance order are the existence of a probable cause to believe that an individual alone, or jointly with others, has committed one of the offences proscribed by law (see paragraph 55 above; Article 181 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), and that an investigation in respect of the offences in issue is either not possible or would be extremely difficult (see paragraph 55 above; Article 180 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure)."

In an area as sensitive as the use of secret surveillance, which is tolerable under the Convention only in so far as strictly necessary for safeguarding the democratic institutions, the Court has difficulty in accepting this situation created by the national courts.

Č ., had, of his own motion, expressed concerns about the appearance of his impartiality as he had previously taken part in the proceedings extending the applicant ’ s pre-trial detention. Referring to the case-law of the Court and the relevant domestic practices, he had submitted that there were ascertainable facts raising doubts as to his impartiality. In the applicant ’ s view, this meant that the judge had lacked impartiality in terms of the subjective aspect of the Court ’ s relevant test and, in any event, that the trial bench had lacked objective impartiality as this had been sufficient evidence to raise legitimate doubts as to the lack of Judge Z. Č. ’ s impartiality. Moreover, the President of the Dubrovnik County Court had shared the concerns expressed by Judge Z.

The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to rebut the presumption of Judge Z.Č. ’ s impartiality in terms of the subjective aspect of the Court ’ s relevant test as the judge had never expressed any personal bias or prejudice in the applicant ’ s case. As to the objective test of impartiality, the Government considered that the mere participation of a judge at previous stages of the proceedings could not in itself raise any doubts as to his or her lack of impartiality. It was true that during the proceedings Judge Z. Č. had asked to withdraw from the case, but he had merely relied on his interpretation of the relevant domestic requirements without providing concrete grounds for the possible appearance of a lack of impartiality on his part. The final decision concerning his request had been given by the Supreme Court, which had examined the request for transfer of the proceedings to another court submitted by the President of the Dubrovnik County Court. The Supreme Court had explained that the fact that a judge had ordered pre-trial detention could not affect his or her impartiality as such a decision did not concern the same issues that the judge had to decide when examining the case on the merits. In the Government ’ s view, this interpretation had followed the relevant practice of the Court and the Constitutional Court. The applicant had thus misconstrued the request of Judge Z. Č. to withdraw from the case as that request had merely referred to the relevant practice on the matter and not any concrete circumstances of the case."

According to the Court ’ s case-law, there are two tests for assessing whether a tribunal is impartial within the meaning of Article 6 § 1. The first test (subjective) consists in seeking to determine the personal conviction of a particular judge in a given case. The personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary. As to the second test (objective), it means determining whether, quite apart from the personal conduct of a judge, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his/her impartiality (see, for example, Padovani v. Italy, 26 February 1993, § 26, Series A no. 257 ‑ B; Gautrin and Others v. France, 20 May 1998, § 58, Reports 1998 ‑ III )."

However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test) (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 119, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ III)."

Thus, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw (see Castillo Algar v. Spain, 28 October 1998, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VIII; and Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, § 98, ECHR 2009)."

It is perfectly normal that a judge may consider and dismiss an application for release lodged by a detained defendant. In doing so the judge is required, under both the Convention and the domestic law, to establish the existence of a “reasonable suspicion” against the defendant. The mere fact that a trial judge has already taken pre-trial decisions in the case, including decisions relating to detention, cannot in itself justify fears as to his impartiality; only special circumstances may warrant a different conclusion (see Hauschildt v. Denmark, 24 May 1989, § 51, Series A no. 154; Sainte-Marie v. France, no. 12981/87, § 32, 16 December 1992; and Romenskiy v. Russia, no. 22875/02, § 27, 13 June 2013).

Indeed, the questions which the judge has to answer when taking decisions on continuing detention are not the same as those which are decisive for his final judgment. When taking a decision on detention on remand and other pre-trial decisions of this kind the judge summarily assesses the available data in order to ascertain whether there are prima facie grounds for the suspicion against an accused of having committed an offence; when giving judgment at the conclusion of the trial he must assess whether the evidence that has been produced and debated in court suffices for finding the accused guilty. Suspicion and formal finding of guilt are not to be treated as being the same (see Jasiński v. Poland, no. 30865/96, § 55, 20 December 2005 ).",

These elements played a role in the assessment of the grounds for ordering pre-trial detention under the relevant domestic law and, as such, had to be reviewed by Judge Z.Č. from the point of view of justification for the applicant ’ s continued detention.

They set out a list of technical means for guarding, surveillance and control, CCTV systems being amongst them, in such institutions, and detailed technical and engineering standards in respect of those means. They provide, in particular, that each cell in penal institutions and pre-trial detention centres should be equipped with a CCTV camera, and describe the technical requirements and characteristics which every camera should satisfy (see paragraph 40 above). The documents in question, however, do not establish any methods, conditions or procedures for the use of CCTV cameras, and therefore cannot be regarded as a legal basis for the measure complained of in the present case."

The Court further notes that, in their relevant decisions the domestic courts also relied on executive order no. 204-dsp (“for internal use only”) of 3 November 2005, as amended by executive order no. 166-dsp (“for internal use only”) on 25 May 2011, of the Ministry of Justice (see paragraphs 27, 30, 35 - 38 and 44 - 55 above). It observes, firstly, that the executive order in question only concerns pre-trial detention centres and prisons, and thus clearly cannot serve as a legal basis for the impugned measure, in so far as it is applied in penal institutions of other types (see paragraph 32 above), such as the one in which the second applicant has been detained (see paragraph 20 above)."

At the same time, the applicants acknowledged that, upon their arrival at the relevant detention facilities, they had been made aware of the fact that would be placed under permanent video surveillance ( see paragraph 63 above). Against this background, the Court finds it reasonable to assume that the contents of the document under examination, at least the relevant part, was made sufficiently accessible to the applicants (compare Pasko v. Russia, no. 69519/01, §§ 81-83, 2 2 October 2009, and contrast Lebois, cited above, § 67)."

It further observes that, in so far as the relevant part of the executive orders under examination is quoted in the court decisions (see paragraphs 46 and 52 above), it only contains a general provision stating that “for the purposes of surveillance [CCTV] cameras may be used”. In essence, that provision does no more than reproduce the provisions of Article 83 of the Code of Execution of Sentences and section 34 of the Pre-trial Detention Act, but does not elaborate on them. It does not set out any specific rules governing the conditions in which the impugned measure may be applied and revoked, the duration or the procedures for review. It is also noteworthy in this connection that the Supreme Court of Russia, at two levels of jurisdiction, stated that the executive order under examination established general rules aimed at ensuring the observance of the regime in pre-trial detention centres and penal institutions, but did not establish any particular procedure for the use of CCTV cameras (see paragraphs 49 and 54 above)."

            [
                "94. So far as post-conviction penal institutions are concerned, Article 83 § 1 of the Code of Execution of Sentences provides for the use of audiovisual, electronic and other technical means of surveillance and control for the purposes of, among other things, “obtaining necessary information about convicts ’ conduct” (see paragraph 33 above). Neither this Article nor any other legal instruments available to the Court specify, however, whether the obtaining of such information is limited to monitoring by CCTV cameras, or whether that information is recorded and kept, and, if so, what the applicable safeguards and rules are governing the circumstances in which such data may be collected, the duration of their storage, the grounds for their use, and the circumstances in which they may be destroyed (compare M.M. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 199-206). It is relevant that the technical specifications approved by the Ministry of Justice provide for the technical possibility of keeping the recordings from a CCTV system for a period of thirty days (see paragraph 40 above ). The Court recalls that the domestic law must also afford adequate guarantees that retained personal data are efficiently protected from misuse and abuse (see S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 103, ECHR 2008)."

As to the Government ’ s reference to the inadmissibility decision in the case of Van der Graaf (see paragraph 79 above ), where the applicant ’ s placement under permanent video surveillance for a period of about four and a half months had been found to be “necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety and for the prevention of disorder or crime”, the Court notes that this case is distinguishable from the present one. In that case, the contested measure had been applied in respect of a detainee held under an individual detention regime, charged with the murder of a well ‑ known politician. It had been based on detailed domestic regulations, which, in particular, had provided an exhaustive list of grounds for the application of such a measure and established an applicable procedure. In accordance with those regulations, the applicant ’ s placement under permanent video surveillance had been ordered by individualised and reasoned decisions of a competent official, corroborated with necessary medical documents attesting to the state of the applicant ’ s mental health and assessing the presence of suicidal tendencies in his behaviour. Furthermore, each decision ordering the applicant ’ s placement under permanent video surveillance had been limited to two weeks at a time, with the result that there had been a regular review of the measure (see Van der Graaf ( dec. ), cited above)."

In the present case, however, the applicants ’ placement under permanent video surveillance was not based on an individualised and reasoned decision providing reasons which would have justified the measure in question in the light of the legitimate aims pursued; the contested measure was not limited in time, and the administrations of the penal institutions or pre ‑ trial detention centre as the case may be were not under an obligation to review regularly (or at all) the well- foundedness of that measure. Indeed, there does not appear to exist any basis in national law for the adoption of such individualised decisions, the Supreme Court of Russia noting in its decision of 12 March 2014 that the existing legal framework “[did] not provide for the adoption of any [individualised] decision [authorising] the use of technical means of control and supervision” (see paragraph 48 above)."

                "97. In such circumstances, whilst the Court is prepared to accept that the contested measure had some basis in national law, it is not convinced that the existing legal framework is compatible with the “quality of law” requirement. Whilst vesting in the administrations of pre-trial detention centres and penal institutions the right to use video surveillance, it does not define with sufficient clarity the scope of those powers and the manner of their exercise so as to afford an individual adequate protection against arbitrariness. In fact, as interpreted by the domestic courts, the national legal framework vests in the administrations of pre-trial detention centres and penal institutions an unrestricted power to place every individual in pre-trial or post-conviction detention under permanent – that is day and night – video surveillance, unconditionally, in any area of the institution, including cells, for an indefinite period of time, with no periodic reviews. As it stands, the national law offers virtually no safeguards against abuse by State officials."

In the light of the foregoing considerations, although the Court is prepared to accept, having regard to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of detention, that it may be necessary to monitor certain areas of pre-trial and penal institutions, or certain detainees on a permanent basis, including by a CCTV system, it finds that the existing legal framework in Russia cannot be regarded as being sufficiently clear, precise and detailed to have afforded appropriate protection against arbitrary interference by the authorities with the applicants ’ right to respect for their private life."

Accordingly, there is no need to examine whether it pursued any of the legitimate aims and was “necessary in a democratic society”, being proportionate to those aims. In particular, the Court will leave open the question of whether the fact that the permanent video surveillance was carried out by female operators of CCTV cameras was compatible with the requirements of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention, as, in its view, this is an element of the proportionality of the alleged interference."

According to the Government, the provisions in question provided that all areas (living, common and service areas ) within a penal institution to which detainees in pre-trial or post-conviction detention had access should be equipped with CCTV cameras. The administrations of penal institutions had an obligation to install CCTV cameras on premises where detainees were being held. A sufficient number of cameras had to be installed, in such a way as to avoid any blind zones. The Government also pointed out that all newly constructed penal institutions were to be equipped with CCTV cameras installed in accordance with the relevant construction documents, whereas in existing penal institutions it was the administrations who determined the location of CCTV cameras outside and inside the premises."

Firstly, it aimed to prevent escapes from penal institutions and pre ‑ trial detention centres. In this connection, they relied on information provided by the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences stating that, prior to the installation of CCTV cameras in penal institutions in Russia in 2010, there had been ten escapes, seven of which had been from pre-trial detention centres. In 2011 there had been seven escapes, and in 2013 there had been twenty-seven escapes."

They argued that video surveillance made it possible to monitor the conduct of a person under the State ’ s control, and to take necessary measures in case of emergency in order to prevent negative consequences. In that connection, they also relied on Recommendation Rec( 2003)23 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted on 9 October 2003 (see paragraph 56 above), which listed CCTV cameras as an additional security measure."

In this connection, they pointed out that, under the relevant regulations regarding the recruitment of staff of law-enforcement agencies, any Russian national, irrespective of, among other things, his or her gender, who met specific requirements and was capable of performing the relevant professional duties, could be employed as an officer of such agencies."

Whilst detention, like any other measure depriving a person of his or her liberty, entails various limitations of his or her rights and freedoms, that person does not forfeit his or her Convention rights merely because of his or her status as a detainee, including the rights guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention, so that restrictions on those rights must be justified in each case (see Khoroshenko v.

The law must thus be adequately accessible and foreseeable, that is, formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual – if need be with appropriate advice – to regulate his conduct. For domestic law to meet these requirements, it must afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness and accordingly indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see, among many other authorities, M.M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 24029/07, § 193, 13 November 2012 ). The Court must thus also be satisfied that there exist adequate and effective guarantees against abuse. This assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to permit, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law (see Benedik v.

Similarly, section 34 of the Pre-trial Detention Act establishes that “audio and video equipment may be used for the purposes of surveillance” of individuals in pre-trial detention. Whilst those legal provisions set forth a general rule enabling the administrations of penal institutions and pre-trial detention centres to have recourse to video surveillance, they provide no further details in that respect. They do not specify, for example, whether both the common parts and residential areas should be subject to surveillance; at which time of the day it should be operational; its conditions and length; the applicable procedures, and such like.

The criterion of foreseeability cannot be interpreted as requiring that all detailed conditions and procedures governing the interference be laid down in the substantive law itself, and the requirements of “lawfulness” can be met if points which cannot be satisfactorily resolved on the basis of substantive law are set out in enactments of lower rank than statutes (ibid., §§ 88-89 and 93-94; Association Ekin v.

They set out a list of technical means for guarding, surveillance and control, CCTV systems being amongst them, in such institutions, and detailed technical and engineering standards in respect of those means. They provide, in particular, that each cell in penal institutions and pre-trial detention centres should be equipped with a CCTV camera, and describe the technical requirements and characteristics which every camera should satisfy (see paragraph 40 above).

It does not set out any specific rules governing the conditions in which the impugned measure may be applied and revoked, the duration or the procedures for review. It is also noteworthy in this connection that the Supreme Court of Russia, at two levels of jurisdiction, stated that the executive order under examination established general rules aimed at ensuring the observance of the regime in pre-trial detention centres and penal institutions, but did not establish any particular procedure for the use of CCTV cameras (see paragraphs 49 and 54 above)."

Neither this Article nor any other legal instruments available to the Court specify, however, whether the obtaining of such information is limited to monitoring by CCTV cameras, or whether that information is recorded and kept, and, if so, what the applicable safeguards and rules are governing the circumstances in which such data may be collected, the duration of their storage, the grounds for their use, and the circumstances in which they may be destroyed (compare M.M. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 199-206).

In that case, the contested measure had been applied in respect of a detainee held under an individual detention regime, charged with the murder of a well ‑ known politician. It had been based on detailed domestic regulations, which, in particular, had provided an exhaustive list of grounds for the application of such a measure and established an applicable procedure. In accordance with those regulations, the applicant ’ s placement under permanent video surveillance had been ordered by individualised and reasoned decisions of a competent official, corroborated with necessary medical documents attesting to the state of the applicant ’ s mental health and assessing the presence of suicidal tendencies in his behaviour.

As regards the impugned measure in the present case, the relevant court decisions reveal that the national courts, including those of the highest level – the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court of Russia – generally considered permanent video surveillance to be a necessary element of convicts ’ punishment in the form of imprisonment as well as part of the mechanism which ensured the personal safety of detainees and staff of the relevant institutions, performance by detainees of their duties and obligations and observance of the regime of detention (see paragraphs 28, 43, 48 and 53 above).

The first applicant furthermore complained under Articles 6, 7 and 14 of the Convention about the outcome of the criminal proceedings in his case.

However, in light of the considerations set out above (see paragraph 87 ) the Court considers that in respect of retention regimes for the biometric data of convicted persons, the duration of the retention period is not necessarily conclusive in assessing whether a State has overstepped the acceptable margin of appreciation in establishing the relevant regime. In that connection, it underlines that there is not the same risk of stigmatisation in retaining the data as in S. and Marper ( cited above, § 122). Also of importance is whether the regime takes into account the seriousness of the offending and the need to retain the data, and the safeguards available to the individual. Where a State has put itself at the limit of the margin of appreciation in allocating to itself the most extensive power of indefinite retention, the existence and functioning of certain safeguards becomes decisive (see Catt, cited above, § 119)."

However, the applicant ’ s biometric data and photographs were retained without reference to the seriousness of his offence and without regard to any continuing need to retain that data indefinitely. Moreover, the police are vested with the power to delete biometric data and photographs only in exceptional circumstances (see paragraph 30 above). There is no provision allowing the applicant to apply to have the data concerning him deleted if conserving the data no longer appeared necessary in view of the nature of the offence, the age of the person concerned, the length of time that has elapsed and the person ’ s current personality ( see Gardel v. France, no. 16428/05, § 68, ECHR 2009). Accordingly, the review available to the individual would appear to be so narrow as to be almost hypothetical (see paragraph 31 above, and also M.K. v.

                "“( i ) The building up of a database of such data from those convicted of offences provides a very useful and proven resource in the battle against crime by reason of the assistance it provides in identifying individuals. It is clear that the larger the database the greater the assistance it will provide. While a universal database would be of immense help in combatting crime, weighing the private rights of individuals against the good which would be achieved by such a universal system requires the striking of a fair balance. Experience has shown that those who have committed offences may go on to commit other offences. A state decision to draw the line at those convicted of a substantial category of offences is entirely rational and furthers the legitimate aim of countering crime so as to protect the lives and rights of others.",
                "(ii) The rights and expectations of convicted persons differ significantly from those of unconvicted persons. The striking of a balance between the public interest and the rights of a convicted or an unconvicted individual will inevitably be appreciably different. Strasbourg recognises that even in the case of some unconvicted persons retention for a period may be justifiable in the public interest.",
                "(iii) A person can only be identified by fingerprints and DNA sample either by an expert or with the use of sophisticated equipment. The material stored says nothing about the physical make up, characteristics or life of the person concerned and it represents objective identifying material which can only be relevant or of use when compared with comparative material taken from a person lawfully subjected to a requirement to provide such material for comparison.",
                "(iv) The use to which the material can be lawfully put is severely restricted by the legislation.",
                "(v) As well as being potentially inculpatory the material may be exculpatory and thus in ease of a person such as the applicant. If it is inculpatory its use assists in the detection of someone likely to have been involved in crime which is a matter of deep interest to the public.",
                "(vi) There is in place an exceptional case procedure which permits of a possibility of an application to have data removed.",
                "(vii) Any differentiation within the system between categories of convicted persons calls for administrative action and has the potential for administrative complexity. Lord Steyn described how there was the potential for interminable and invidious disputes where differentiation is operated. While he was making that point in the context of differentiation between convicted and unconvicted persons (and thus was in error according to the Strasbourg court) the point retains its force in the context of differentiation between convicted persons. Carswell LCJ pointed out in Re McBride [1997] NI 269 at 274 that the legislature wished to have as wide a cover for the database as possible in order to give the police the best chance of detecting criminal offenders. Marper requires protections for unconvicted persons and the current legislation and policy have limited the retention of data to those convicted of recordable offences. To allow further exceptions would in the view of the authorities undermine the effectiveness of the process which is designed to build up a database of those who have been involved in criminality to assist in the war against crime. Such a conclusion by the state authorities is legitimate and rational.",
                "(viii) The current policy in fact does distinguish between (a) unconvicted persons and those convicted of offences which are not recordable and (b) those convicted of offences which are recordable. This represents a policy and legislative intent which is not blanket or indiscriminate as such but one which distinguishes between cases. The choice of that differentiation is one involving the exercise of judgment by the state authorities which seeks to balance, on the one hand, the very limited impact of retention and use of such material on a person ’ s real private life and its minimal impact on the intimate side of his life and, on the other hand, the benefit to society flowing from the creation of as effective a database as legitimately possible to help in combatting crime. The choice to retain the data of those convicted of recordable offences represents the exercise of a balanced and rational judgment by the authorities.",
                "(ix) In this case the offence committed by the applicant cannot, as the applicant asserts, be described as minor or trivial. It was an offence of a potentially dangerous anti-social nature. The criminal law has as one of its aims the protection of the lives of others and the consumption of alcohol by a driver endangers human life. Indeed the state under its operative duties under Article 2 must have in place laws which protect the lives of others. The offence was a recordable offence being one in respect of which a period of imprisonment could be ordered.",
                "(x) Time limitations on the retention of data for particular categories of offences can be imposed as has occurred in some legal systems such as in the Netherlands ( See W. and Van der Velden ). Different countries operate different policies in this field and some other countries follow practices similar to those followed in the United Kingdom. Any time restriction is inevitably somewhat arbitrary and it is difficult to point to any particular reason why one particular period as opposed to another should be chosen. To introduce time limitations for some offences simply to avoid a possible charge of disproportionality smacks of defensive policy making in a field which requires a proper balancing of the interests of the public against the consequences of criminal activity. The introduction of different time periods for different offences or for different sentences would clearly add to the administrative burden and would require changes and deletion of recorded data. This complexity would be aggravated in the case of those found guilty periodically of repeat offending in respect of minor offences. The removal of such data would give the offender no benefit other than the knowledge that his data is no longer recorded. As already noted the retention of the data represents a very minor intrusion into his private life.",
                "(xi) The retention of the data serves the added purpose of discouraging a convicted offender from reoffending for the offender has the knowledge that the police have available data which could lead to his detection. The permanent retention of that data thus serves a useful long term purpose in that regard.",

That did not mean that system in Northern Ireland (and the United Kingdom) for convicted persons was necessarily proportionate. However, the level of interference in the applicant ’ s Article 8 rights was low, and a fair balance must be struck between competing public and private interests when considering whether that interference is justified. The United Kingdom struck that balance by choosing recordable offences as the touchstone for retention, and this appeared proportionate and justified. He took into account the fact that the applicant was only fined and not imprisoned but highlighted that driving with excess alcohol is a serious offence. He also noted Principle 7 of the Committee of Ministers ’ Recommendation No. R(87)15 as giving some support for the proposition that the fact that a conviction may become spent is potentially relevant, but did not find this was decisive.

There is a much broader range of approaches in the case of those who have been convicted. The Secretary of State produced an annex setting out a summary of inclusions and removal criteria in other jurisdictions. It is attached to this judgment as Annex B. It shows that in such cases many countries retain biometric data for very long periods. In addition to England and Wales and Northern Ireland, Ireland and Scotland are I think the only jurisdictions which provide for indefinite retention. However, there are several states which provide for retention until death. They are Austria: five years after death or 80 years of age; Denmark: two years after death or at 80 years of age; Estonia: ten years after death; Finland: ten years after death; Lithuania: 100 years after inclusion or ten years after death; Luxembourg: ten years after death; The Netherlands: as stated above and 80 years after a conviction against minors; Romania five years after death or 60 years of age; and Slovakia: 100 years after date of birth. It seems to me that in the context of a person ’ s rights under article 8 there is little, if any, difference between retention for an indefinite period and retention until death or effectively until death.",

To that question only one answer can be given, in my opinion. Clearly, a far more nuanced, more sensibly targeted policy can be devised. At a minimum, the removal of some of the less serious offences from its ambit is warranted. But also, a system of review, whereby those affected by the policy could apply, for instance on grounds of exemplary behaviour since conviction, for removal of their data from the database would be entirely feasible. Similarly, gradation of periods of retention to reflect the seriousness of the offence involved would contribute to the goal of ensuring that the interference was no more intrusive than it required to be.",

There is no evidence that consideration has been given to the question of whether it is necessary for the effective combatting of crime that the materials concerned in this case should be retained indefinitely.",

He argued that this had been achieved by the exclusion of non-recordable offences and offences committed by children and by the fact that such material from those not convicted was no longer retained. He was unable to point to evidence, however, that the question of whether it was necessary that there be retention of all data from all convicted of recordable offences for all time had been considered. Absent such consideration and in light of the fact that it is eminently possible to conceive of measures which are less intrusive but which would conduce to the avowed aim of the policy, it is simply impossible to say that the policy in its present form is the least intrusive means of achieving its stated aim. ”"

But the margin of appreciation that is available to the state does not extend to its being permitted to act in a way which is not Convention compliant. If the state acts in such a way, it cannot insulate itself from challenge by recourse to the margin of appreciation principle. In Wingrove v. UK (1997) 24 EHRR 1, para 58, a ‘ broad margin ’ case, ECtHR emphasised that authorities within the state in question were in a better position than international judges to give an opinion \"on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the ‘ necessity ’ of the ‘ restriction ’ \". Domestic courts therefore have the responsibility to examine closely the proportionality of the measure without being unduly influenced by the consideration that the Strasbourg court, if conducting the same exercise, might feel constrained to give the contracting state ’ s decision a margin of appreciation.",

In respect of s.64 (1A) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act the Court found in S. and Marper (cited above, § 97) that the retention of the applicants ’ fingerprint and DNA records had a clear basis in the domestic law. However, it went on to observe that section 64 was far less precise in respect of the conditions attached to it and arrangements for the storing and use of this personal information (see S. and Marper, cited above, § 98). Overall, on this point the Court concluded that these questions were closely related to the broader issue of whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society. Accordingly it found it was not necessary to decide whether the wording of Section 64 met the “quality of law” requirements within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention (see S. and Marper (cited above § 99).

Second, that the scheme of retention in Northern Ireland is not unusually intrusive, as several other European jurisdictions retain biometric data, in some cases including DNA samples of convicted persons, indefinitely or for very long periods of time such as the lifetime of the person concerned. Third, that the scheme in Northern Ireland means samples will only be taken from people convicted of recordable offences, namely offences that are punishable by a term of imprisonment.

However, the Court considers that in concluding whether those two types of regime can be equated, consideration should be given to the nature of the data and the impact of retaining a person ’ s data after their death."

Moreover, it has not been suggested that it is possible to identify relationships between individuals from fingerprint or photograph data. The Court therefore accepts that in relation to fingerprints and photographs, periods of retention which end on or shortly after death could be considered comparable to indefinite retention; although, it is aware of the possibility of rapid technological advances in this domain in particular concerning technology for facial recognition and facial mapping (see the developments outlined in paragraphs 67 - 70 above). That said, for both fingerprints and photographs the majority of States surveyed have put in place regimes with defined retention periods."

However, the Court considers that the situation is different concerning DNA profiles and that there is a distinction between retaining DNA profiles indefinitely and setting a defined limit on the retention period linked to the biological life of the person concerned, even if the period of retention foreseen is long. That is because retaining genetic data after the death of the data subject continues to impact on individuals biologically related to the data subject. The Court recalls that when considering the nature of the interference with privacy occasioned by the retention of DNA profiles, it has observed that the use of DNA profiles for familial searching with a view to identifying a possible genetic relationship between individuals is of a highly sensitive nature and there is a need for very strict controls in this respect. In the Court ’ s view, the DNA profiles ’ capacity to provide a means of identifying genetic relationships between individuals is in itself sufficient to conclude that their retention interferes with the right to the private life of the individuals concerned. The frequency of familial searches, the safeguards attached thereto and the likelihood of detriment in a particular case are immaterial in this respect ( see S. and Marper, cited above, § 75). As familial searching can be carried out on DNA profiles after the death of the data subject, the Court cannot accept the submission that it is possible to equate the retention of biometric data up to a fixed point in time linked to the death of the person from whom it was taken, with its indefinite retention."

It is true that in S. and Marper, cited above, the Court found the United Kingdom was alone in retaining indefinitely the DNA of unconvicted persons and concluded that the strong consensus existing among the Contracting States was of considerable importance and narrowed the margin of appreciation left to the respondent State in the assessment of the permissible limits of the interference with private life in this sphere (see S. and Marper, cited above, § 112). The situation is not exactly the same in the present case where even taking account of the distinction identified between retention linked to the death of the data subject and indefinite retention in relation to DNA profiles, there are a small number of states amongst those surveyed who operate indefinite retention regimes (see paragraph 53 above). Nonetheless, the Court considers that those states are in a distinct minority. The majority of States have regimes in which there is a defined limit on the period for which data can be retained. It also takes account of the fact that the Government in their submissions, referred to schemes permitting indefinite retention of biometric data of convicted persons in Austria and Lithuania. However, those regimes have subsequently been amended to provide for definite periods of detention (see paragraph 53 above)."

Accordingly, the retention regime has regard to a minimum degree of seriousness in relation to offending. The Court notes that the Grand Chamber previously rejected a similar submission in S. and Marper, cited above, where the fact that data was only taken and so retained in relation to recordable offences under the scheme examined, still left such a wide variety of offences falling within the retention regime that the regime could be characterised as applying whatever the nature or seriousness of the offence ( see S. and Marper, cited above, § § 26, 110 and 119 ).

In this respect, the Court recalls that in Article 8 cases it has generally understood the margin of appreciation to mean that, where the independent and impartial domestic courts have carefully examined the facts, applying the relevant human rights standards consistently with the Convention and its case-law, and adequately balanced the applicant ’ s personal interests against the more general public interest in the case, it is not for it to substitute its own assessment of the merits (including, in particular, its own assessment of the factual details of proportionality) for that of the competent national authorities, unless there are shown to be compelling reasons for doing so (see McDonald v. the United Kingdom, no. 4241/12, § § 56 - 57, 20 May 2014)."

However, the courts ’ made their assessment in particular relating to the retention of the applicant ’ s photograph on the basis that it was held on a local database and could not be searched against other photographs, a conclusion which appears to have been superseded by technological developments (see paragraph 69 above). In that respect the Court recalls the importance of examining compliance with the principles of Article 8 where the powers vested in the state are obscure, creating a risk of arbitrariness especially where the technology available is continually becoming more sophisticated (see Catt v. the United Kingdom, no. 43514/15, § 114, 24 January 2019). The Supreme Court also proceeded in its analysis on the basis that very few states have a process of review, whereas it would appear that of the States surveyed by the Court most have a form of administrative and / or judicial review available (see paragraphs 15 and 57 above). Finally, concerning DNA profiles, the Supreme Court considered that there was no distinction to be identified between retention linked to the death of the data subject, and indefinite retention (see paragraph 15 above).

In that case, the applicants had been repeatedly convicted of serious offences and sentenced to prison. The law provided for the indefinite retention of their biometric data. That data was retained for those convicted of serious and/or repeat offences, and the Federal Criminal Office was obliged to review at regular intervals whether the continued storage of the data was still necessary for the performance of its task or otherwise to be deleted at the latest every ten years. However, the Court has also found a regime with a definite retention period of forty years in law but which amounted to an indefinite period in practice, to be in violation of the Convention (see Aycaguer v. France, no. 8806/12, § 42, 22 June 2017). In that case, the applicant was convicted of a minor offence and subject to fine. His biometric data was retained under provisions which did not differentiate according to the nature and/or seriousness of the offence committed, and he had no possibility to request the deletion of the data (see Aycaguer, cited above, §§ 43-47). It also notes that the Court was satisfied in Peruzzo and Martens, cited above, that there was nothing to establish that the domestic courts or authorities in the proceedings at issue had not observed the relevant guarantees (see § 48). Whereas in Aycaguer, cited above, the authorities ’ failure to implement a decree had created a degree of ambiguity in the legal provisions governing the retention of data, and they had not given any follow up to the decision of the Constitutional Council of 16 September 2010 criticising the regime then in force (see § § 42 -43 )."

In that connection, it underlines that there is not the same risk of stigmatisation in retaining the data as in S. and Marper ( cited above, § 122). Also of importance is whether the regime takes into account the seriousness of the offending and the need to retain the data, and the safeguards available to the individual.

Insofar as the Government ’ s submission could concern the substance of the proportionality test under Article 8, the Court considers that the necessity to preserve parts of the DNA database for the purposes of historic investigations is not significantly different to the general arguments advanced that retaining biometric data is helpful for investigating other types of ‘ cold cases ’, examples of which were included as case studies illustrating the Government ’ s general argument set out above (see paragraph 89 )."

                "93. The Court recalls in general terms that it has found in the context of the positive obligation arising under Article 2 that the public interest in investigating and possibly obtaining the prosecution and conviction of perpetrators of unlawful killings many years after the events is firmly recognised (see Jelić v. Croatia, no. 57856/11, § 52, 12 June 2014 ). Investigating ‘ cold cases ’, is also in the public interest, in the general sense of combating crime (see paragraph 75 above). However, also in the context of unlawful killings the Court has underlined that the police must discharge their duties in a manner which is compatible with the rights and freedoms of other individuals (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, § 121, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VIII ). Indeed, without respect for the requisite proportionality vis ‑ à ‑ vis the legitimate aims assigned to such mechanisms, their advantages would be outweighed by the serious breaches which they would cause to the rights and freedoms which States must guarantee under the Convention to persons under their jurisdiction (see Aycaguer, cited above, § 34)."

Having chosen to put in place a regime of indefinite retention, there was a need for the State to ensure that certain safeguards were present and effective for the applicant (see paragraph 88 above), someone convicted of an offence (now spent, see paragraph 7 above). However, the applicant ’ s biometric data and photographs were retained without reference to the seriousness of his offence and without regard to any continuing need to retain that data indefinitely. Moreover, the police are vested with the power to delete biometric data and photographs only in exceptional circumstances (see paragraph 30 above). There is no provision allowing the applicant to apply to have the data concerning him deleted if conserving the data no longer appeared necessary in view of the nature of the offence, the age of the person concerned, the length of time that has elapsed and the person ’ s current personality ( see Gardel v. France, no. 16428/05, § 68, ECHR 2009). Accordingly, the review available to the individual would appear to be so narrow as to be almost hypothetical (see paragraph 31 above, and also M.K. v. France, no. 19522/09, § 25, 18 April 2013)."

In that connection, in respect of photographs, the Court considers it of interest that the regime in England and Wales was changed after RMC to permit persons convicted of less serious recordable offences, to request deletion of their photographs after six years, with a presumption of deletion (see paragraph 39 above). It underlines however that the test of proportionality is not that another less restrictive regime could be imposed. The core issue is whether, in adopting the measure and striking the balance it did, the legislature acted within the margin of appreciation afforded to it (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § 110, ECHR 2013 (extracts)."

The Court recalls its finding that the State retained a slightly wider margin of appreciation in respect of the retention of fingerprints and photographs (see paragraphs 84 above). However, that widened margin is not sufficient for it to conclude that the retention of such data could be proportionate in the circumstances, which include the lack of any relevant safeguards including the absence of any real review."

Even though the recording had been declassified a day earlier by the SSD, it is the Court ’ s view that the recording still ought to have been kept confidential from the general public. As appears from the SSD ’ s letter, at that time the Attorney General ’ s Office was examining the recording in the framework of criminal proceedings, and, pursuant to Article 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, information about the pre-trial investigation had to remain confidential. Nonetheless, the conversation became known to the public. The fact that the SSD had exploited the information was also confirmed by the prosecutor on 11 November 2003 (paragraphs 14 and 15 above). The Court thus concludes that despite the legal provisions designed to ensure that the surveillance is carried out in strict accordance with the law in order to protect a person ’ s privacy against abuse, the actual practice followed in this case was different. Whilst acknowledging the Government ’ s argument that the public had a right to information about one of its civil servants, the Court nevertheless considers that the SSD was responsible for keeping the information confidential. Lastly, the Court cannot fail to observe that to this day the Lithuanian authorities have not discovered who leaked the conversation to the media (paragraphs 35 and 36 above). In these circumstances, the Court concludes that the lack of protection exercised in respect of the applicant ’ s telephone conversation with J.B. was not in accordance with the law. This gives rise to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention."

The Government noted that the necessity of the measure had been assessed twice, with a possibility of rejection – first by the Attorney General and subsequently by the Vilnius Regional Court. The contested operational measure had been necessary and had been applied in the interests of national security, public safety and the prevention of crime. The authorities had had operational information about the applicant ’ s possible involvement in criminal activities. The applicant had close connections with J. B. and persons from J.B. ’ s milieu. Most importantly, in the course of the operational investigation in respect of J. B. , the authorities had learned about his threats to the State President. That information had later been confirmed when intercepting the applicant ’ s telephone conversation with J.B., in which the latter used psychological pressure and demanded that his requirements be reported to the head of State. Subsequently, J.B. had been convicted of having threatened the State President. The Government also observed that both J. B. and the applicant had had close relations with the State President and had played a significant role in the political activities of the President ’ s political party and his electoral campaign; at the time of surveillance the applicant had been a member of the Vilnius City Municipal Council. In this connection the Government also referred to the Court ’ s judgment in Craxi v. Italy (no. 2) ( no. 25337/94, § 64, 17 July 2003 ), submitting that politicians inevitably and knowingly laid themselves open to close scrutiny by both journalists and the public at large. Therefore, even acknowledging that no investigation had been carried out by the SSD in order to reveal the circumstances in which the journalists had obtained the recording of the intercepted conversation, the question of fulfilment of the State ’ s positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention could not arise."

In the view of the Government, the measures of surveillance at issue did not go beyond what was strictly necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime and safeguarding public safety and national security. The legislation regulating telephone tapping precisely defined and thus limited the goals for which the restrictive measures could be applied. Furthermore, the applicant had been the target of operational actions for only two months and the operational investigation had been terminated in advance of the time-limit allowed for by the court. Only the conversations related to the aims sought subsequently comprised material from the preliminary investigation by serving as evidence in the criminal proceedings against J. B. , where the applicant had been questioned as a witness, and in the impeachment proceedings in respect of the State President. Moreover, in contrast to Odièvre v. France ([GC], no. 42326/98, § 29, ECHR 2003 - III), those conversations had not disclosed any information of a private nature; therefore, the applicant did not have a right to have access to such information either under the domestic law or the Convention."

The Court first turns to the Government ’ s suggestion that the applicant could have challenged the SSD ’ s “ actions ”, performed in the context of surveillance measures applied to him. It has difficulty accepting the Government ’ s argument. For the Court, it is hard to conceive how the applicant could have known initially that his telephone conversations were being intercepted and thus contested the “action” if he had not been informed of the court order authorising the monitoring. Furthermore, the Court also notes that all the applicant ’ s subsequent efforts to lodge complaints with the prosecutors, the SSD or domestic courts on the matter of disclosure of his telephone communications were unsuccessful (paragraphs 20, 22, 23, 2 5, and 3 2 -3 6 above).

Powers of secret surveillance of citizens, characterising as they do the police state, are tolerable under the Convention only in so far as strictly necessary for safeguarding the democratic institutions ( see Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 47, ECHR 2000- V )."

The Court also observes that, as the Government have pointed out, any individual measure of surveillance had to comply with the stringent conditions and procedures laid down in the legislation itself (see, in particular, Articles 6, 10 and 17 of the Law). In particular, it is satisfied that the measure was required to be authorised by a judge.",

Turning to the particular circumstances of the instant case, the Court notes that on 17 September 2003 the Vilnius Regional Court, acting on a request by the Attorney General, and “on the basis of the materials in the operation case file” authorised the tapping of the applicant ’ s telephone on the basis of information about the applicant ’ s possible participation in smuggling strategic materials and other crimes. Although the court order did not elaborate much further on the substance of the crimes the applicant was suspected of, having regard to the facts of the case (paragraphs 8, 21, 24, 26 and 31 above), the Court is ready to accept that the Regional Court had sufficient reasons to sanction the telephone tapping. On this point the Court also takes note of the fact that earlier that day the SSD had submitted information to the Attorney General about the applicant ’ s suspicious links with foreign citizens. It is reasonable to assume that the factual information was presented to the court (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). Accordingly, the Court is not ready to find that the authorisation was without grounds or that the surveillance was “general” or “exploratory” (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 51). Above all, on this last point the Court also reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. In principle, therefore, it is not for the Court to express an opinion contrary to that of the Vilnius Regional Court in its order of 17 September 2003 on the compatibility of the judicially ordered tapping of the applicant ’ s telephone with Articles 5 and 9 of the Law on Operational Activities (see Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, § 59, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ II )."

The Court next turns to the applicant ’ s argument about the unlawfulness, with regard to Article 6 § 3 of the Law on Operational Activities, of the interception of his telephone calls with the head of State (paragraph 13 above). Whilst observing that Lithuanian legislation indeed prohibits interception of the State President ’ s communications, the Court attaches particular weight to the fact that the operative measures had been ordered not in respect of the head of State, but in respect of the applicant. It also considers that it is not for the Court to speculate whether the SSD ’ s officers should have hung up the telephone once they heard the voice of Mr Rolandas Paksas at the other end. In other words, the Court is not ready to conclude that incidental involvement of the State President in a telephone conversation automatically meant that the interception became unlawful also in respect of his interlocutor. This appears to have been confirmed by the Attorney General ’ s Office (paragraph 20 above), notwithstanding its initial position. Accordingly, the applicant ’ s argument that a violation of Article 8 of the Convention arises from the unlawfulness, under the Lithuanian law, of the interception and recording of the telephone calls received by him from the head of State must be dismissed."

Turning to the matter of the disclosure of the applicant ’ s telephone conversations, the Court notes that the applicant complained about two separate sets of facts, namely the disclosure of his telephone conversation of 16 March 2003 with a Russian businessman, J. B. , and the disclosure of his conversations with his business partners and the State President while the impeachment proceedings were pending before the Constitutional Court. The Court will analyse each of these issues separately."

            [
                "60. The Court notes that on 2 November 2003 the recorded conversation between the applicant and J. B. was aired on two Lithuanian television channels. Even though the recording had been declassified a day earlier by the SSD, it is the Court ’ s view that the recording still ought to have been kept confidential from the general public. As appears from the SSD ’ s letter, at that time the Attorney General ’ s Office was examining the recording in the framework of criminal proceedings, and, pursuant to Article 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, information about the pre-trial investigation had to remain confidential. Nonetheless, the conversation became known to the public. The fact that the SSD had exploited the information was also confirmed by the prosecutor on 11 November 2003 (paragraphs 14 and 15 above). The Court thus concludes that despite the legal provisions designed to ensure that the surveillance is carried out in strict accordance with the law in order to protect a person ’ s privacy against abuse, the actual practice followed in this case was different. Whilst acknowledging the Government ’ s argument that the public had a right to information about one of its civil servants, the Court nevertheless considers that the SSD was responsible for keeping the information confidential. Lastly, the Court cannot fail to observe that to this day the Lithuanian authorities have not discovered who leaked the conversation to the media (paragraphs 35 and 36 above). In these circumstances, the Court concludes that the lack of protection exercised in respect of the applicant ’ s telephone conversation with J.B. was not in accordance with the law. This gives rise to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention."

            [
                "61. The Court lastly turns to the disclosure of the applicant ’ s conversations of October and November 2003 with his business partners and the State President. Given the bad language used by the applicant during those telephone calls, the Court attaches a certain weight to his sentiment that the disclosure thereof might to a certain extent have discredited his name in business circles and with public in general. That being so, the Court cannot overlook the fact that those conversations were disclosed in the framework of Constitutional Court proceedings strictly adhering to the requirements of the domestic law and having obtained authorisation from a prosecutor (paragraphs 27 and 3 0 above). Moreover, the reasons to play the conversations, on the basis of which the State President was later impeached, at the Constitutional Court ’ s hearing appear to be weighty. On this point the Court also reiterates that reporting, including comment, on court proceedings contributes to their publicity and is thus perfectly consonant with the requirement under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that hearings be public. Not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas; the public also has a right to receive them. This is all the more so where public figures are involved, such as, in the present case, the applicant, who was a founding member of the State President ’ s political party and a member of the Vilnius City Municipality Council, and the head of State. Such persons inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny by both journalists and the public at large (see Craxi, cited above, § 64 ). Furthermore, as it appears from the materials presented by the parties, the disclosed telephone conversations did not contain any details about the applicant ’ s private life. The Court therefore concludes that the disclosure of the applicant ’ s telephone conversations during the Constitutional Court proceedings was in accordance with the law and can be regarded as necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights of others. In view of the above, the Court finds no violation of Article 8 of the Convention as regards this part of the complaint."

On this point the Court shares the position of the Court of Appeal to the effect that the very nature and logic of secret surveillance dictate that not only the surveillance itself but also its authorisation may be effected without the individual ’ s knowledge (paragraph 25 above). It also observes that the requirements of the Convention, notably with regard to foreseeability, cannot be exactly the same in the special context of interception of communications for the purposes of criminal investigations as they are where the object of the relevant law is to place restrictions on the conduct of individuals. In particular, the requirement of foreseeability cannot mean that an individual should be enabled to foresee when the authorities are likely to intercept his communications so that he can adapt his conduct accordingly (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, § 67, Series A no. 82 ). The Court reiterates its opinion that such notification might serve to reveal the working methods and fields of operation of the intelligence services and even possibly to identify their agents (see Klass and Others, cited above, § 58). The Court also considers that the absence of prior notification was compensated for in the Law on Operational Activities by the fact that the Law, at least in theory, laid down strict conditions with regard to the implementation of the surveillance measures and the processing of the information thus obtained. In pursuance of Article 6 §§ 7 and 8 of the Law, information obtained in the course of operational activities, as well as that about a person ’ s private life, could not be disclosed, and information about private life which was irrelevant to the operational investigation had to be destroyed. It follows that the applicant ’ s argument must be dismissed and that no violation of Article 13 of the Convention arises in this respect."

            [
                "68. That being so, the Court cannot overlook the fact that, as regards the surveillance in the applicant ’ s case, the Law on Operational Activities did not allow for an examination of its legality and did not provide for sufficient protection against arbitrariness. The Court reiterates its conclusion that all the efforts by the applicant to lodge complaints with the domestic courts and the SSD in order to challenge lawfulness of the Vilnius Regional Court ’ s order of 17 September 2003 to start monitoring his telephone conversations were unsuccessful (see paragraphs 22, 25 and 36 above). Moreover, although Article 6 § 9 of the law in theory provided for a possibility to appeal against the “ actions ” of the operational activities ’ entities, the applicant ’ s attempts to bring complaints with the prosecutors, the SSD and the courts about the disclosure of his telephone conversation with J.B. by the media were futile (see paragraphs 20, 23, 25 and 3 5 above ). The Court accordingly finds that, in the specific circumstances of the applicant ’ s case, there was no institution which could effectively scrutinise any errors which could have occurred and did occur in the implementation of the operational measure (see paragraph 60 above and, by contrast, Kennedy v. the United Kingdom, no. 26839/05, § § 166 and 168, 18 May 2010 ).",

Insofar as the applicant complains that the SSD refused to reveal him the information gathered about his person when listening to his telephone communications, the Court recalls that the SSD indeed denied such a request by the applicant, its decision being upheld by the administrative courts at two instances (see paragraphs 24 and 3 2- 34 above). Even so, sight should not be lost of the special reasons justifying the Lithuanian courts ’ departure from the general rule, established in Article 7 § 1 of the Law on the Right to Obtain Information from State and Local Authorities, that a person was entitled to receive information of a private nature held about him by the State authorities. In particular, the principal reason for the refusal in this particular case was to ensure the effectiveness of pre-trial investigations in two sets of criminal proceedings, since only part of the telephone communications had already been disclosed and the public prosecutor had a legitimate interest in maintaining the other part secret, according to Article 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Given the seriousness of the charges in those two criminal investigations, the Court is ready to find that the applicant ’ s rights under Article 13 of the Convention had not been breached.",

The Court has also taken note of the cases referred to by the Government where former employees or collaborators of the KGB had provided a foreign country with state secrets leading to their conviction of treason (see paragraph 54 above). The Court concludes that the interference in question pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8, namely the protection of national security and public safety, the prevention of disorder as well as well as the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (compare, mutatis mutandis, Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, §§ 54-55 )."

The lawful government of the country was overthrown and Soviet rule was imposed by force. Interrupted by the German occupation in 1941-1944, Estonia remained occupied by the Soviet Union until its restoration of independence in 1991 (see Kolk and Kislyiy v.

He maintained that in the published announcement he had been depicted as an occupier of the Estonian State. It remained unclear, however, which acts he had committed against Estonia and in what way these acts had been criminal. His work as a driver of the Committee for State Security had been of a merely technical nature and had in fact not been directed against the Estonian State."

The Court of Appeal considered that the fact that a person did not contest the initial notice before its publication did not deprive him of a right to lodge a complaint against the publication of the announcement in Riigi Teataja Lisa. It also considered that the implementation of the Disclosure Act could in some circumstances involve indirect interference with a person ’ s fundamental rights caused by the acts of third parties as the person ’ s reputation could be damaged as a result of the disclosure of his relations with the Soviet security organisations.

The Chancellor of Justice established in his proceedings that according to the defendant ’ s administrative practice information about the merely technical employees was not, by way of exception, disclosed. According to the assessment of the Court of Appeal, the [applicant] cannot demand an exception to be made in respect of him. According to the assessment of the defendant, drivers of the security and intelligence organisations were related to the performance of the organisations ’ substantial tasks ... The court has no ground to take a different position in this question relating to the security risks. The Estonian State cannot establish decades later with absolute certainty whether a specific driver performed merely technical or also substantial tasks. Thus, one has to proceed from the possibility that a KGB driver may also pose a potential security risk and the disclosure of the information about him may be in the public interests. Therefore, it is proportionate to apply the [Disclosure Act] in respect of the persons who worked as drivers in the security or intelligence organisations. Thereby account must be taken of the fact that the publication of the announcement and the indirect interferences caused by that were not inevitably foreseen by law; the [applicant] could have prevented these consequences by making a confession pursuant to ... the [Disclosure Act].”"

                "41. On 27 June 1996 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe ( PACE ) adopted Resolution 1096 (1996) on measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems. It reads, in so far as relevant:",
                "“ 1. The heritage of former communist totalitarian systems is not an easy one to handle. On an institutional level this heritage includes (over)centralisation, the militarisation of civilian institutions, bureaucratisation, monopolisation, and over-regulation; on the level of society, it reaches from collectivism and conformism to blind obedience and other totalitarian thought patterns. To re-establish a civilised, liberal state under the rule of law on this basis is difficult - this is why the old structures and thought patterns have to be dismantled and overcome.",
                "3. The dangers of a failed transition process are manifold. At best, oligarchy will reign instead of democracy, corruption instead of the rule of law, and organised crime instead of human rights. At worst, the result could be the \"velvet restoration\" of a totalitarian regime, if not a violent overthrow of the fledgling democracy. In that worst case, the new undemocratic regime of a bigger country can present also an international danger for its weaker neighbours. The key to peaceful coexistence and a successful transition process lies in striking the delicate balance of providing justice without seeking revenge.",
                "4. Thus a democratic state based on the rule of law must, in dismantling the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems, apply the procedural means of such a state. It cannot apply any other means, since it would then be no better than the totalitarian regime which is to be dismantled. A democratic state based on the rule of law has sufficient means at its disposal to ensure that the cause of justice is served and the guilty are punished - it cannot, and should not, however, cater to the desire for revenge instead of justice. It must instead respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as the right to due process and the right to be heard, and it must apply them even to those people who, when they were in power, did not apply them themselves. A state based on the rule of law can also defend itself against a resurgence of the communist totalitarian threat, since it has ample means at its disposal which do not conflict with human rights and the rule of law, and are based upon the use of both criminal justice and administrative measures.",
                "5. The Assembly recommends that member states dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian regimes by restructuring the old legal and institutional systems, a process which should be based on the principle(s) of:",
                "i. demilitarisation, to ensure that the militarisation of essentially civilian institutions, such as the existence of military prison administration or troops of the Ministry of the Interior, which is typical of communist totalitarian systems, comes to an end;",
                "ii. decentralisation, especially at local and regional levels and within state institutions;",

                "6. This process must include a transformation of mentalities (a transformation of hearts and minds) whose main goal should be to eliminate the fear of responsibility, and to eliminate as well the disrespect for diversity, extreme nationalism, intolerance, racism and xenophobia, which are part of the heritage of the old regimes. All of these should be replaced by democratic values such as tolerance, respect for diversity, subsidiarity and accountability for one ’ s actions.",
                "7. The Assembly also recommends that criminal acts committed by individuals during the communist totalitarian regime be prosecuted and punished under the standard criminal code. If the criminal code provides for a statute of limitations for some crimes, this can be extended, since it is only a procedural, not a substantive matter. Passing and applying retroactive criminal laws is, however, not permitted. On the other hand, the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which at the time when it was committed did not constitute a criminal offence according to national law, but which was considered criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations, is permitted. Moreover, where a person clearly acted in violation of human rights, the claim of having acted under orders excludes neither illegality nor individual guilt.",
                "8. The Assembly recommends that the prosecution of individual crimes go hand-in-hand with the rehabilitation of people convicted of \"crimes\" which in a civilised society do not constitute criminal acts, and of those who were unjustly sentenced. Material compensation should also be awarded to these victims of totalitarian justice, and should not be (much) lower than the compensation accorded to those unjustly sentenced for crimes under the standard penal code in force.",
                "9. The Assembly welcomes the opening of secret service files for public examination in some former communist totalitarian countries. It advises all countries concerned to enable the persons affected to examine, upon their request, the files kept on them by the former secret services.",
                "11. Concerning the treatment of persons who did not commit any crimes that can be prosecuted in accordance with paragraph 7, but who nevertheless held high positions in the former totalitarian communist regimes and supported them, the Assembly notes that some states have found it necessary to introduce administrative measures, such as lustration or decommunisation laws. The aim of these measures is to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they cannot be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles, as they have shown no commitment to or belief in them in the past and have no interest or motivation to make the transition to them now.",
                "12. The Assembly stresses that, in general, these measures can be compatible with a democratic state under the rule of law if several criteria are met. Firstly, guilt, being individual, rather than collective, must be proven in each individual case - this emphasises the need for an individual, and not collective, application of lustration laws. Secondly, the right of defence, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed. Revenge may never be a goal of such measures, nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed. The aim of lustration is not to punish people presumed guilty - this is the task of prosecutors using criminal law - but to protect the newly emerged democracy.",
                "13. The Assembly thus suggests that it be ensured that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law, and focus on threats to fundamental human rights and the democratisation process ... ”"

The totalitarian communist regimes which ruled in central and eastern Europe in the last century, and which are still in power in several countries in the world, have been, without exception, characterised by massive violations of human rights. The violations have differed depending on the culture, country and the historical period and have included individual and collective assassinations and executions, death in concentration camps, starvation, deportations, torture, slave labour and other forms of mass physical terror, persecution on ethnic or religious grounds, violation of freedom of conscience, thought and expression, of freedom of the press, and also lack of political pluralism.",
                "3. The crimes were justified in the name of the class struggle theory and the principle of dictatorship of the proletariat. The interpretation of both principles legitimised the “elimination” of people who were considered harmful to the construction of a new society and, as such, enemies of the totalitarian communist regimes. A vast number of victims in every country concerned were its own nationals. It was the case particularly of the peoples of the former USSR who by far outnumbered other peoples in terms of the number of victims.",

Moreover, the authors of these crimes have not been brought to trial by the international community, as was the case with the horrible crimes committed by National Socialism (Nazism).",

Furthermore, moral assessment and condemnation of crimes committed play an important role in the education of young generations. The clear position of the international community on the past may be a reference for their future actions.",

The applicant was of the opinion that in the announcement of the Estonian Internal Security Service published in Riigi Teataja Lisa in 2004 he had been considered as a person who had occupied Estonia whereas in the announcements published later, in 2005, the persons in question had not been referred to as persons who had occupied Estonia but rather as persons who had been in the service of the intelligence organisations of the USSR. He argued that it was unclear on the basis of which evidence he was deemed as an occupier and why he was considered to be dangerous. He submitted that “occupier” ( okupant ) was a word that was understood to refer to a serious crime involving conquering the country with the use of arms and exercising occupation therein. At the time when the applicant had worked as a driver for the security department, the activities of this institution had been supervised by the local Communist Party committee where the Prime Minister of the Republic of Estonia of the time of the submission of the observations had held a position of responsibility."

However, after the publication of the announcement on the Internet under the title referring to an “occupier” he was being considered as an occupier, a traitor, a snitch among his colleagues and acquaintances. He was forced to quit his job and lost his income. The applicant considered that it was wrong and offending to call him an occupier."

                "54. The Government emphasised that it was not in dispute that from 1980 until 1991 the applicant had worked as a driver in the KGB. Furthermore, the interference with the applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life was in accordance with law and it was necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The Government pointed out that for the transfer from a totalitarian regime to a democratic system, Estonia took various measures which, in aggregate, had to ensure the development and security of the democratic system. Criminal liability for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed under the totalitarian regime was established and an obligation to take an oath of conscience was introduced for those seeking the highest offices in the country. The Disclosure Act dealt with the persons who had not committed any crimes but had been employed by or collaborated with the intelligence or counterintelligence authorities of the States which had occupied Estonia. It was found that such persons had to come to terms with their past and not to try to forget, conceal or be silent about it. There was also a significant public interest in the publicity of information relating to the past; this had to guarantee transparency and clarity as well as overall internal peace in the society. Obtaining complete information about the members and agents of the security and intelligence authorities which had operated on the territory of Estonia was also important for the protection of independence and security of the Republic of Estonia. Estonia was lacking the relevant information; such information, including the lists of persons who had worked in the KGB, was in the hands of foreign States. There could be attempts to recruit former staff of the security authorities and make them perform security or intelligence tasks, or they could be subject to blackmailing. Such situation was dangerous and damaging for Estonia. The Government referred to recent cases where former employees or collaborators of the KGB had provided a foreign country with state secrets leading to their conviction of treason."

            [
                "55. The Government also pointed out that persons falling under the Disclosure Act could express their loyalty to the Republic of Estonia by submitting a confession, in which case their data was not disclosed. Moreover, in order to secure protection to the persons concerned, the disclosure was subject to prior judicial review. As regards the question whether it was necessary to also disclose information about persons who, as the applicant, had worked as drivers, the Government argued that the formal job title was not decisive as the drivers could also perform other tasks, especially in rural regions where the applicant had worked. There had even been separate positions formally combining the tasks of the driver with other functions, such as “driver-intelligence officer” dealing with secret surveillance, and for some of the drivers the driver ’ s position had been a step for advancement to the next, “more important” position, like that of an operative agent or intelligence officer. The Government also argued that the Estonian Internal Security Service, having regard to their limited resources, focused on cases which were more important and which could involve real danger to the Republic of Estonia."

                "56. The Court considers that the publication of the information about the applicant ’ s service in the KGB concerned facts about his personal past that were made available to the public and also affected his reputation. It therefore constituted an interference with his right to respect for his private life (compare Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480 /00 and 59330/00, §§ 42-50, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII)."

                "57. The Court further notes that the lawfulness of the interference was not in dispute between the parties. It observes that the interference in question was based on the Diclosure Act that had been adopted by the Riigikogu and published according to the rules in force. Nor has it been disputed that the text of the law was sufficiently clear to enable those affected to foresee the consequences it entailed. The law ’ s accessibility and public awareness of it is also confirmed by the information provided by the Government according to which 1,153 persons submitted a confession to the Estonian Internal Security Service within one year of the entry into force of the Disclosure Act in order not to have information about their service in or collaboration with the security and intelligence organisations published. Thus, the Court is satisfied that the impugned interference was lawful for the purposes of the second paragraph of Article 8 of the Convention."

                "58. As regards the purpose of the interference, the Court notes that the registration and disclosure of the former employees and collaborators of the security and intelligence organisations of the regimes that had operated in Estonia were part of the measures taken to ensure the transparency, clarity and internal peace in the society, as well as to avoid security threats. The Court has also taken note of the cases referred to by the Government where former employees or collaborators of the KGB had provided a foreign country with state secrets leading to their conviction of treason (see paragraph 54 above). The Court concludes that the interference in question pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8, namely the protection of national security and public safety, the prevention of disorder as well as well as the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (compare, mutatis mutandis, Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, §§ 54-55 )."

                "59. Accordingly, the Court proceeds to the examination of whether the measure was “necessary in a democratic society”. The Court observes in this connection that there is no uniform approach among High Contracting Parties as to the measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems (see Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, § 36, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII ). Different measures have been applied and their application has given rise to a number of cases before the Court concerning a variety of issues such as restrictions on the persons ’ eligibility to stand for elections (see Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV, and Ādamsons v. Latvia, no. 3669/03, 24 June 2008) or to their employment (see Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323; Volkmer v. Germany (dec.), no. 39799/98, 22 November 2001; Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above; Rainys and Gasparavičius v. Lithuania, nos. 70665/01 and 74345/01, 7 April 2005; and Žičkus v. Lithuania, no. 26652/02, 7 April 2009) as well as lack of access to the information on the basis of which the persons ’ collaboration with former secret services was established (see Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, 24 April 2007) or reduction of pensions of the persons concerned (see Cichopek and Others v. Poland (dec.) no. 15189/10 and other applications, 14 May 2013). Against this background, the Court turns to the proportionality analysis of the impugned measures in the present case."
            ],
            [
                "60. The Court reiterates that in a number of previous cases it has criticised the lack of individualisation of the impugned measures. Thus, in Ādamsons it considered that the group of persons – former KGB agents – to which the restrictions to stand for elections applied, had been designed in a too broad manner without having regard to the period of service of the persons concerned, specific tasks assigned to them or their individual behaviour (see Ādamsons, cited above, § 125). Similarly, in Žičkus the lack of differentiation in domestic law between different levels of former involvement with the KGB was pointed out by the Court (see Žičkus, cited above, § 33). In addition to the lack of differentiation in domestic law as regards the premises for the application of the restrictions, the Court has also addressed the issue of broadly fashioned restrictions applied to the individuals concerned. Thus, in Sidabras and Džiautas, it noted that with the exception of references to “lawyers” and “notaries”, domestic law contained no definition of the specific private sector jobs, functions or tasks which the applicants were barred from holding (see Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, § 59)."

            [
                "61. The Court is of the view that the above considerations also apply to the present case. It notes that the Disclosure Act made no distinction between different levels of former involvement with the KGB. It is true that under the applicable procedure the applicant was informed beforehand of the text of the announcement to be published, and given a possibility to contest the factual information contained in it. However, there was no procedure put in place to assess the specific tasks performed by individual employees of the former security services in order to differentiate the danger they could possibly pose several years after the termination of their career in these institutions. The Court is not convinced that there existed a reasonable link between the legitimate aims sought by the enactment of the Disclosure Act and the publication of information about all former employees of the former security services including drivers, as in the applicant ’ s case, regardless of the specific function they performed in these services."
            ],
            [
                "62. The Court also notes that although the Disclosure Act came into force three and a half years after Estonia had declared its independence on 20 August 1991, the publication of the information about the former employees of the security services was stretched over several years. Thus, in the applicant ’ s case the information in question was only published in 2004 – almost thirteen years after the restoration of the Estonian independence. The Court is of the opinion that any threat the former servicemen of the KGB could initially pose to the newly created democracy must have considerably decreased with the passage of time. It notes that it does not appear from the file that any assessment of the possible threat posed by the applicant at the time of the publication of the information was carried out (compare Žičkus, loc. cit. )."

                "63. Lastly, the Court observes that the Disclosure Act in itself did not impose any restrictions on the applicant ’ s employment.

The Court considers that even if such a result was not sought by the Disclosure Act, it is nevertheless indicative of the seriousness of the interference with the applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life."

Romania, no. 41838/05, § 60, 19 July 2011 ). The Court confirms this approach in the present case. In respect of a person, like the applicant, who sought full access to her file created by the communist secret services with a view to refuting any allegation of her supposed collaboration with those services, the State should secure an “effective and accessible procedure” before the authority currently holding those files. It is important to underline that the procedure referred to above should enable an interested party to have access to all relevant and appropriate information which would allow that party to effectively counter any allegations of his or her collaboration with the security services (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of lustration proceedings, Matyjek v.

The Court observes that over that period of time the applicant faced various obstacles in her way to obtain full access to the file kept on her by the Institute. Certain obstacles were of a legislative character and those were gradually eliminated by three consecutive judgments of the Constitutional Court. However, the Parliament did not always properly implement the relevant judgments of the Constitutional Court. In addition, the applicant faced obstacles of an administrative nature created by the Institute which was unwilling to heed the calls of the Constitutional Court as regards the interpretation of the law.

However, the lack of review in this part [in respect of this provision] cannot justify negative administrative decisions issued on the basis of section 31 of the Institute Act only for the reason that section 31 § 1(2) survived as a result of the lack of challenge to it. Section 31 of the Institute Act is functionally connected with the content of section 30 § 2(2) and may produce legal consequences only in so far as it is harmonised with the content of section 30 § 2(2) following the intervention of the Constitutional Court in respect of the latter, as well as in respect of section 52a(5) of the Institute Act. What is decisive in such situations is the fact that a legal norm (included in section 52a(5) of the Institute Act, and used also in unchallenged section 31 § 1(2)) was declared unconstitutional in the judgment of the Constitutional Court. It is also relevant that section 31 of the Institute Act determines solely a form of the decision refusing request for access to copies of documents concerning [an applicant], while the immediately preceding it section 30 speaks of the individual right of access to documents, which is an implementation at the statutory level of the constitutional principle of access of every person to official documents and data collections specified in Article 51 § 3 of the Constitution. It is obvious that the provision regulating solely a form of a decision in respect of a given right, in this case an administrative decision, may not serve as the basis for determination of the substantive content of the right, its scope and the conditions for its realisation.”",

It should not be forgotten, as observed by the Constitutional Court, that the Institute ’ s archives contained information which had been often collected without any legal basis or unlawfully.

On 20 February 2007 the Institute informed the applicant that there had been other documents concerning her which could not be released.

This was often supported by an argument that the list had included not only persons considered by the Institute to be collaborators but also others who had been considered by the communist security services as potential candidates for collaboration or even victims.

This was true and symptomatic of the lack of a suitable remedy to address this very particular violation of the right to privacy. Both civil actions based on general civil law principles of protection of personal rights and lustration law cases had proved grossly ineffective in repairing the damage caused to so many persons as a result of the failure on the part of the Institute to protect the personal data and catalogues which had been at its possession."

                "“... [F] ingerprints and DNA profiles reveal only limited personal information. The physical samples potentially contain very much greater and more personal and detailed information. The anxiety is that science may one day enable analysis of samples to go so far as to obtain information in relation to an individual ’ s propensity to commit certain crime and be used for that purpose within the language of the present section [ section 82 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001]. It might also be said that the law might be changed in order to allow the samples to be used for purposes other than those identified by the section. It might also be said that while samples are retained there is even now a risk that they will be used in a way that the law does not allow. So, it is said, the aims could be achieved in a less restrictive manner ... Why cannot the aim be achieved by retention of the profiles without retention of the samples?",
                "The answer to [these] points is as I see it as follows. First the retention of samples permits ( a) the checking of the integrity and future utility of the DNA database system; (b) a reanalysis for the upgrading of DNA profiles where new technology can improve the discriminating power of the DNA matching process; (c) reanalysis and thus an ability to extract other DNA markers and thus offer benefits in terms of speed, sensitivity and cost of searches of the database; (d) further analysis in investigations of alleged miscarriages of justice; and (e) further analysis so as to be able to identify any analytical or process errors. It is these benefits which must be balanced against the risks identified by Liberty. In relation to those risks, the position in any event is first that any change in the law will have to be itself Convention compliant; second any change in practice would have to be Convention compliant; and third unlawfulness must not be assumed. In my view thus the risks identified are not great, and such as they are they are outweighed by the benefits in achieving the aim of prosecuting and preventing crime. ”"

In two cases, compelling DNA evidence linking one suspect to a rape and another to a murder had not been able to be used, as at the time the matches were made both defendants had either been acquitted or a decision made not to proceed for the offences for which the profiles had been obtained : as a result it had not been possible to convict either suspect."

The sample from “ I ” should have been destroyed, but had not been. “ I ” had pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced.

The offences involved included 53 murders, 33 attempted murders, 94 rapes, 38 sexual offences, 63 aggravated burglaries and 56 cases involving the supply of controlled drugs. On the basis of the existing records, the Home Office statistics estimated that there was a 40% chance that a crime- scene sample would be matched immediately with an individual ’ s profile on the national database.

As to the Convention analysis, Lord Steyn inclined to the view that the mere retention of fingerprints and DNA samples did not constitute an interference with the right to respect for private life but stated that, if he were wrong in that view, he regarded any interference as very modest indeed. Questions of whether, in the future, retained samples could be misused were not relevant in respect of contemporary use of retained samples in connection with the detection and prosecution of crime. If future scientific developments required it, judicial decisions could be made, when the need occurred, to ensure compatibility with the Convention. The provision limiting the permissible use of retained material to “ purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime ...” did not broaden the permitted use unduly, because it was limited by its context."

Counsel for the Home Secretary had contended that the aim of the retention had nothing to do with the past, that is, with the offence of which a person had been acquitted, but was to assist in the investigation of offences in the future. The applicants would only be affected by the retention of the DNA samples if their profiles matched those found at the scene of a future crime. Lord Steyn saw five factors which led to the conclusion that the interference was proportionate to the aim: (i) the fingerprints and samples were kept only for the limited purpose of the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime; (ii) the fingerprints and samples were not of any use without a comparator fingerprint or sample from the crime scene; (iii) the fingerprints would not be made public; (iv) a person was not identifiable from the retained material to the untutored eye; (v) the resultant expansion of the national database by the retention conferred enormous advantages in the fight against serious crime."

                "“ If justification for retention is in any degree to be by reference to the view of the police on the degree of innocence, then persons who have been acquitted and have their samples retained can justifiably say this stigmatises or discriminates against me – I am part of a pool of acquitted persons presumed to be innocent, but I am treated as though I was not. It is not in fact in any way stigmatising someone who has been acquitted to say simply that samples lawfully obtained are retained as the norm, and it is in the public interest in its fight against crime for the police to have as large a database as possible. ”"

The House of Lords further rejected the applicants ’ complaint that the retention of their fingerprints and samples subjected them to discriminatory treatment in breach of Article 14 of the Convention when compared to the general body of persons who had not had their fingerprints and samples taken by the police in the course of a criminal investigation. Lord Steyn held that, even assuming that the retention of fingerprints and samples fell within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention so as to trigger the application of Article 14, the difference of treatment relied on by the applicants was not one based on “status” for the purposes of Article 14: the difference simply reflected the historical fact, unrelated to any personal characteristic, that the authorities already held the fingerprints and samples of the individuals concerned which had been lawfully taken. The applicants and their suggested comparators could not in any event be said to be in an analogous situation. Even if, contrary to his view, it was necessary to consider the justification for any difference in treatment, Lord Steyn held that such objective justification had been established: firstly, the element of legitimate aim was plainly present, as the increase in the database of fingerprints and samples promoted the public interest by the detection and prosecution of serious crime and by exculpating the innocent; secondly, the requirement of proportionality was satisfied, section 64(1A) of PACE objectively representing a measured and proportionate response to the legislative aim of dealing with serious crime."

The report referred, in particular, to the lack of satisfactory empirical evidence to justify the present practice of retaining indefinitely fingerprints, samples and DNA profiles from all those arrested for a recordable offence, irrespective of whether they were subsequently charged or convicted. The report voiced particular concerns at the policy of permanently retaining the bioinformation of minors, having regard to the requirements of the 198 9 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child."

Familial searching is the process of comparing a DNA profile from a crime scene with profiles stored on the national database, and prioritising them in terms of “ closeness ” to a match. This allows possible genetic relatives of an offender to be identified. Familial searching might thus lead to revealing previously unknown or concealed genetic relationships.

Ethnic inferring through DNA profiles is possible as the individual “ethnic appearance” is systematically recorded on the database : when taking biological samples, police officers routinely classify suspects into one of seven “ethnic appearance” categories. Ethnicity tests on the database might thus provide inferences for use during a police investigation in order, for example, to help reduce a “ suspect pool ” and to inform police priorities. The report noted that social factors and policing practices lead to a disproportionate number of people from black and ethnic minority groups being stopped, searched and arrested by the police, and hence having their DNA profiles recorded; it therefore voiced concerns that inferring ethnic identity from biological samples might reinforce racist views of propensity to criminality.",

They stressed, in particular, the social stigma and psychological implications provoked by such retention in the case of children, which made the interference with the right to private life all the more pressing in respect of the first applicant."

Familial searching through partial matches only occurred in very rare cases and was subject to very strict controls. Fingerprints, DNA profiles and samples were neither susceptible to any subjective commentary nor provided any information about a person ’ s activities and thus presented no risk to affect the perception of an individual or affect his or her reputation.

It can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the person ’ s physical and social identity (see Mikulić v. Croatia, no. 53176/99, § 53, ECHR 2002-I). Elements such as, for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 (see, among other authorities, Bensaid v. the United Kingdom, no. 44599/98, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ I with further references, and Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ I ). Beyond a person ’ s name, his or her private and family life may include other means of personal identification and of linking to a family (see, mutatis mutandis, Burghartz v. Switzerland, 22 February 1994, § 24, Series A no. 280 ‑ B, and Ünal Tekeli v. Turkey, no. 29865/96, § 42, ECHR 2004 ‑ X ). Information about the person ’ s health is an important element of private life (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, § 71, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I ). The Court furthermore considers that an individual ’ s ethnic identity must be regarded as another such element (see, in particular, Article 6 of the Data Protection Convention quoted in paragraph 41 above, which lists personal data revealing racial origin as a special category of data along with other sensitive information about an individual). Article 8 protects, in addition, a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, for example, Burghartz, cited above, opinion of the Commission, p. 37, § 47, and Friedl v. Austria, 31 January 1995, Series A no. 305-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 20, § 45).

However, in determining whether the personal information retained by the authorities involves any of the private-life aspects mentioned above, the Court will have due regard to the specific context in which the information at issue has been recorded and retained, the nature of the records, the way in which these records are used and processed and the results that may be obtained (see, mutatis mutandis, Friedl, cited above, § § 49-51, and Peck, cited above, § 59 ).",

The Court notes in this regard that the Government accepted that DNA profiles could be, and indeed had in some cases been, used for familial searching with a view to identifying a possible genetic relationship between individuals. They also accepted the highly sensitive nature of such searching and the need for very strict controls in this respect. In the Court ’ s view, the DNA profiles ’ capacity to provide a means of identifying genetic relationships between individuals (see paragraph 39 above) is in itself sufficient to conclude that their retention interferes with the right to the private life of the individuals concerned. The frequency of familial searches, the safeguards attached thereto and the likelihood of detriment in a particular case are immaterial in this respect (see Amann, cited above, § 69 ). This conclusion is similarly not affected by the fact that, since the information is in coded form, it is intelligible only with the use of computer technology and capable of being interpreted only by a limited number of persons."

The possibility the DNA profiles create for inferences to be drawn as to ethnic origin makes their retention all the more sensitive and susceptible of affecting the right to private life. This conclusion is consistent with the principle laid down in the Data Protection Convention and reflected in the Data Protection Act that both list personal data revealing ethnic origin among the special categories of sensitive data attracting a heightened level of protection (see paragraphs 3 0-31 and 41 above)."

The Government were given a very wide remit to use samples and DNA profiles notably for “purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime”, “ the investigation of an offence” or “ the conduct of a prosecution”. These purposes were vague and open to abuse as they might, in particular, lead to the collation of detailed personal information outside the immediate context of the investigation of a particular offence. The applicants further submitted that there were insufficient procedural safeguards against misuse or abuse of the information. Records on the Police National Computer ( PNC ) were not only accessible to the police, but also to fifty-six non-police bodies, including government agencies and departments, private groups such as British Telecom and the Association of British Insurers, and even certain employers. Furthermore, the PNC was linked to the Europe-wide “Schengen Information System”. Consequently, their case involved a very substantial and controversial interference with the right to private life, as notably illustrated by ongoing public debate and disagreement about the subject in the United Kingdom. Contrary to the assertion of the Government, the applicants concluded that the issue of the retention of this material was of great individual concern and the State had a narrow margin of appreciation in this field."

In two other cases the retention of DNA profiles of the persons found guilty of certain minor offences (disorder and theft) led to establishing their involvement in other crimes committed later. In one case the retention of a suspect ’ s DNA profile following an alleged immigration offence helped his extradition to the United Kingdom a year later when he was identified by one of his victims as having committed rape and murder. Finally, in four cases DNA profiles retained from four persons suspected but not convicted of certain offences (possession of offensive weapons, violent disorder and assault) matched the crime- scene stains collected from victims of rape up to two years later."

Their retention was neither warranted by any degree of suspicion of the applicants ’ involvement in a crime or propensity to crime nor directed at retaining records in respect of investigated alleged offences in the past. The records were retained because the police had already been lawfully in possession of them, and their retention would assist in the future prevention and detection of crime in general by increasing the size of the database.

The need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned, not least when such data are used for police purposes. The domestic law should notably ensure that such data are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored; and preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored (see Article 5 of the Data Protection Convention and the Preamble thereto and Principle 7 of Recommendation No. R (87) 15 of the Committee of Ministers regulating the use of personal data in the police sector). The domestic law must also afford adequate guarantees that retained personal data were efficiently protected from misuse and abuse (see notably Article 7 of the Data Protection Convention). The above considerations are especially valid as regards the protection of special categories of more sensitive data (see Article 6 of the Data Protection Convention) and more particularly of DNA information, which contains the person ’ s genetic make-up of great importance to both the person concerned and his or her family (see Recommendation No. R (92) 1 of the Committee of Ministers on the use of analysis of DNA within the framework of the criminal justice system)."

In this respect, the Court must bear in mind that the right of every person under the Convention to be presumed innocent includes the general rule that no suspicion regarding an accused ’ s innocence may be voiced after his acquittal (see Rushiti v. Austria, no. 28389/95, § 31, 21 March 2000, with further references ). It is true that the retention of the applicants ’ private data cannot be equated with the voicing of suspicions.

While it may be true that the public perception of the principle of non-disclosure of sources would suffer no real damage where it was overridden in circumstances where a source was clearly acting in bad faith with a harmful purpose and disclosed intentionally falsified information, courts should be slow to assume, in the absence of compelling evidence, that these factors are present in any particular case. In any event, given the multiple interests in play, the Court emphasises that the conduct of the source can never be decisive in determining whether a disclosure order ought to be made but will merely operate as one, albeit important, factor to be taken into consideration in carrying out the balancing exercise required under Article 10 § 2.",

On Interbrew's evidence the leaked document was very similar if not identical to the Interbrew presentation, except for the following: (a) the substitution of an offer price for SAB shares of between 500 and 650 pence in place of the price of between 400 and 550 pence, which had apparently been in the original presentation; and (b) the insertion of a timetable for making the offer."

Mr Van Praag reported the conversation to Mr Powell, the Chief Executive Officer of Interbrew.

By judgment of 8 March 2002 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants'appeal ( Interbrew v. Financial Times et al. [2002] EWCA Civ 274 ). In the leading judgment of Sedley LJ, the Court of Appeal held that in order to justify the exercise of Norwich Pharmacal powers to compel production of documents or disclosure of information, Interbrew had to establish that each defendant had facilitated a civil wrong committed by an unknown person against whom they aimed to seek redress. The only civil wrong on which Interbrew could rely was that of a breach of confidence on the part of the source. While such a breach of confidence had been made out, what had not been made out was a “bigger and better cause of action in respect of the'lethal cocktail'of fact and falsehood, since the element of falsehood can neither form part of the protected confidence nor stand on its own as a discrete tort” ( at paragraph 28)."

But both, or at least the former, depend upon the falsity of the pages in the document showing bid price and timetable. False they were if one goes on such evidence as was before the court. But by definition their falsity is alleged against an absent and silent accused. We have no way of knowing, any more than – as [counsel for the applicants] stressed – the five defendants do, whether the source, if cornered, would demonstrate that he had simply assembled authentic documents from different places within Interbrew, GS and Lazards.",
                "I have to say that I find this aspect of the Norwich Pharmacal procedure troubling. A commercial enterprise which may very well have its own reasons for denying the authenticity of a document gets a clear run against a media defendant which can only, save in rare cases, take a neutral stand on the question. The court of first instance needs to be extremely circumspect before accepting evidence, especially when, as here, it is second- or third-hand, that goes to the heart of the case and cannot be controverted ... ”"

Nothing which has been put before us suggests that the court will be significantly better placed at an eventual trial than it is now to decide the key issues; and there is at least some force in Interbrew's complaint that its hands are tied vis-à-vis South African Breweries, and possibly other targets too, unless and until it can prevent a recurrence of this spoiling operation.",
                "50. ... Interbrew's prima facie entitlement to delivery up of the documents is established because – and solely because – it may enable them to ascertain the identity of the proper defendant to a breach of confidence action relating to the relatively anodyne, though not the explosive, parts of the document. From the sweep of Interbrew's original case and the “lethal cocktail” on which Lightman J founded his conclusions, the basis of the application now shrinks to this little measure. But though little, it is far from insignificant for Interbrew ...",
                "51. With it, one turns to s.10 of the 1981 Act. The section begins by barring any order for disclosure in circumstances such as these, since its very object is to discover the source of information which the defendants have published. Interbrew, however, can invoke one of the listed purposes for lifting the bar: that disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice. That it may also go to the prevention of crime cannot be ruled out as irrelevant, but it is peripheral because it is not a purpose for which Interbrew themselves are entitled to disclosure. Then is the public interest in the doing of justice sufficient in the particular circumstances of this case to make disclosure necessary? Reading that question through the lens of the Convention and its jurisprudence, as we are now required to do, the following elements separate themselves out.",
                "52. First, what is the nature and weight of the public interest in the confidentiality of sources? The right of free expression enshrined in art. 10 is undifferentiated, but as the European Court of Human Rights said in Goodwin ,'freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society', and'[p]rotection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom'(paras. 39, 40). Much judicial authority in this country says the same. The news media, in consequence, enjoy in s.10 of the 1981 Act a high initial level of protection, not in their own but in the public interest.",
                "53. The entitlement to reverse the balance is prescribed by law, as art. 10(2) requires. A required ground for doing so, founded on the no less important public interest in an effective system of justice, is present. Is it then necessary to reverse the balance? The following elements seem to me to matter here:",
                "• Any invasion of the protection must meet a pressing social need – not merely an individual one. This meets the need to counterpose one public interest to another. Here the need, in terms of s.10, is to enable Interbrew to restrain by court action any further breach of confidence by the source and possibly to recover damages for losses already sustained. In terms of art. 10(2) it is to protect the rights of Interbrew.",
                "• There must be no less invasive alternative. While I would not adopt the judge's approach of simply refusing to second-guess the view of the aggrieved parties'solicitors, I would infer from the evidence that as much has been done as can at present be done by the use of reputable private detectives to trace the source. I can see that to demand particulars of the admittedly general assertions about this could jeopardise the exercise.",
                "54. It seems to me that once the legitimacy of Interbrew's intended resort to law is accepted, the relatively modest leak of which they are entitled to complain does not diminish the prospective seriousness for them of its repetition. For the media, on the other hand, the public interest in their freedom to publish is constant, and with it the public interest in the confidentiality of their sources. While I do not think that the character of the material is irrelevant as a matter of law, I agree with Laws LJ in Ashworth at least to this extent, that it cannot be for the court to decide how interesting or important it thinks the material is. That is for journalists and their editors. But it may follow that the more the press decide to make of a story, the greater will be the affected party's legitimate interest in finding and suppressing its source.",
                "55. What in my judgment matters critically, at least in the present situation, is the source's evident purpose. It was on any view a maleficent one, calculated to do harm whether for profit or for spite, and whether to the investing public or Interbrew or both. It is legitimate in reaching this view to have regard not only to what Interbrew assert is the genuine document but also to the interpolated pages; for whether they are forged or authentic, integral or added, they were calculated to maximise the mischief. To this factual extent the'lethal cocktail'is material, despite its legal irrelevance to the earlier stages of the inquiry. The public interest in protecting the source of such a leak is in my judgment not sufficient to withstand the countervailing public interest in letting Interbrew seek justice in the courts against the source .”"

It would be an exceptional case indeed if a journalist were ordered to disclose the identity of his source without the facts of his case being fully examined.

The Government argued that it was open to the domestic court to make a range of orders against Interbrew for disclosure of documents, cross-examination and production of information but this would generally only be done on the application of either party. In the present case, there was no evidence that the applicants had made any formal applications of this nature. The Government further relied upon the fact that the applicants did not request a full trial of Interbrew's claim for delivery up of the leaked document. The Government concluded that the applicants did not argue before the domestic courts that the procedure adopted was unfair but instead chose to argue that Interbrew could not prove its case.

The applicants also accepted that no formal application was made for further information, but argued that an oral application in the course of argument sufficed when time was short. They explained that they had orally requested further details of Interbrew's investigations but that the judge ruled this to be unnecessary on the basis that it might prejudice ongoing enquiries. As to their failure to seek permission to cross-examine witnesses, the applicants pointed out that the relevant witness statements were lodged either late on 16 December 2001 or early on 17 December 2001, in the closing stages of the urgent application, and in any event recounted only hearsay evidence rather than dealing with the underlying facts of the leak and the investigation. Evidence, in the form of a letter from Kroll, concerning the progress of the investigation was merely appended to the witness statement of Interbrew's solicitors which meant that the applicants were not able, under the CPR, to directly cross ‑ examine the Kroll witness himself.

Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest.

While it may be true that the public perception of the principle of non-disclosure of sources would suffer no real damage where it was overridden in circumstances where a source was clearly acting in bad faith with a harmful purpose and disclosed intentionally falsified information, courts should be slow to assume, in the absence of compelling evidence, that these factors are present in any particular case. In any event, given the multiple interests in play, the Court emphasises that the conduct of the source can never be decisive in determining whether a disclosure order ought to be made but will merely operate as one, albeit important, factor to be taken into consideration in carrying out the balancing exercise required under Article 10 § 2.",

The order had been made by the domestic courts primarily on the grounds of the threat of severe damage to the company's business, and consequently to the livelihood of its employees, which would arise from disclosure of the information in their corporate plan while refinancing negotiations were continuing. The Court noted that a vital component of the threat of damage to the company had already been neutralised by an injunction to prevent dissemination of the confidential information by the press. While accepting that the disclosure order served the further purpose of bringing proceedings against the source to recover possession of the missing document and to prevent further dissemination of the contents of the plan, as well as of unmasking a disloyal employee or collaborator, the Court observed that, in order to establish the necessity of disclosure for the purposes of Article 10, it was not sufficient for a party seeking disclosure to show merely that it would be unable without disclosure to exercise the legal right or avert the threatened legal wrong on which it based its claim. The considerations to be taken into account by the Convention institutions in their review under Article 10 tipped the balance in favour of the interest of a democratic society in securing a free press. On the facts of that case, the Court stated (at § 45) that it could not find that the company's interests",

While the Court considers that there may be circumstances in which the source's harmful purpose would in itself constitute a relevant and sufficient reason to make a disclosure order, the legal proceedings against the applicants did not allow X's purpose to be ascertained with the necessary degree of certainty. The Court would therefore not place significant weight on X's alleged purpose in the present case."

                "67. As regards the allegations that the leaked document had been doctored, the Court recalls the duties and responsibilities of journalists to contribute to public debate with accurate and reliable reporting. In assessing whether a disclosure order is justified in cases where the leaked information and subsequent publication are inaccurate, the steps taken by journalists to verify the accuracy of the information may be one of the factors taken into consideration by the courts, although the special nature of the principle of protection of sources means that such steps can never be decisive but must be considered in the context of the case as a whole (see paragraph 6 3, above). In any event, the domestic courts reached no conclusion as to whether the leaked document was doctored, the Court of Appeal observing that it had no way of knowing, any more than the applicants, whether X, if cornered, would demonstrate that he had simply assembled authentic documents from different places within Interbrew, GS and Lazards. The Court likewise considers that it has not been established with the necessary degree of certainty that the leaked document was not authentic. The authenticity of the leaked document cannot therefore be seen as an important factor in the present case."

It remains to be examined whether, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the interests of Interbrew in identifying and bringing proceedings against X with a view to preventing further dissemination of confidential information and to recovering damages for any loss already sustained are sufficient to override the public interest in the protection of journalistic sources."

            [
                "69. In this respect, the Court observes at the outset that where an unauthorised leak has occurred, a general risk of future unauthorised leaks will be present in all cases where the leak remains undetected (see Goodwin, §§ 17-18 and 41). In the present case, the Court notes that Interbrew received notice, prior to publication of the initial FT article, that a copy of the leaked document had been obtained and that there was an intention to publish the information it contained. In contrast to the stance taken by the company in the Goodwin case, Interbrew did not seek an injunction to prevent publication of the allegedly confidential and sensitive commercial information. Moreover, the aim of preventing further leaks will only justify an order for disclosure of a source in exceptional circumstances where no reasonable and less invasive alternative means of averting the risk posed are available and where the risk threatened is sufficiently serious and defined to render such an order necessary within the meaning of Article 10 § 2. It is true that in the present case the Court of Appeal found that there were no less invasive alternative means of discovering the source, since Kroll, the security and risk consultants instructed by Interbrew to assist in identifying X, had failed to do so. However, as is apparent from the judgments of the domestic courts, full details of the inquiries made were not given in Interbrew's evidence and the Court of Appeal's conclusion that as much as could at that time be done to trace the source had been done by Kroll was based on inferences from the evidence before the court."

While, unlike the applicant in the Goodwin case, the applicants in the present case were not required to disclose documents which would directly result in the identification of the source but only to disclose documents which might, upon examination, lead to such identification, the Court does not consider this distinction to be crucial. In this regard, the Court emphasises that a chilling effect will arise wherever journalists are seen to assist in the identification of anonymous sources. In the present case, it was sufficient that information or assistance was required under the disclosure order for the purpose of identifying X (see Roemen and Schmit v. Luxembourg, no. 51772/99, § 47, ECHR 2003 ‑ IV)."

The Court observes that in one of those eight cases (application no. 14244/11) the applicants complained about the search of the first applicant ’ s office and seizure of her electronic devices both in the appeal complaint against the court search warrant and in the complaints about the authorities ’ allegedly unlawful actions under Article 125 of the CCrP. The applicants submitted their application to the Court on 5 February 2011, which was outside the six-month period as regards the appeal decision of 11 May 2010 on the lawfulness of the court search warrant (see § 51 above) and within the six-month period as regards the final decisions on the complaints under Article 125 of the CCrP (30 August, 23 and 30 September 2010, see §§ 52 – 54 above). The Court notes that the court search warrant of 25 March 2010 had imposed “no limitations” on the investigator ’ s discretion during the performance of the search (see § 50 above). Thus, the manner of the performance of the search of the flat and the seizure of the electronic devices resulted from the search warrant itself and its terms rather than from the authorities ’ unlawful actions, for instance, at variance with the search warrant. Therefore, a complaint under Article 125 of the CCrP could not have provided a redress to the applicants ’ grievances stemming from the terms of the search warrant itself."

Two applicants (applications nos. 32324/06 and 26067/08) argued that the State officials should have stopped their search of the premises after learning on site that those premises had been in fact used by lawyers. Three applicants (applications nos. 2397/11, 19667/16 and 36833/16) considered that the State officials had unlawfully extended the search to encompass the premises not covered by the search warrants. Two applicants (applications nos. 11264/04 (second search) and 73629/13) complained about the authorities ’ unlawful actions because the searches had been performed under the procedures not requiring a judicial authorisation at all, whether before or after the search. In the above circumstances, the applicants ’ grievances stemmed from the manner in which the authorities had acted, rather than from any supposed defects in the underlying judicial authorisation, where it existed. Given the courts ’ power to declare such actions unlawful or unjustified, the Court accepts that in the above circumstances the applicants ’ attempts to challenge the actions of the investigating authorities under Article 125 of the CCrP were reasonable."

The Court further notes that, with the exception of one ( application no. 36833/16 ), all of the above applications were submitted within six months after the appeal decisions taken on the complaints under Article 125 of the CCrP. Thus they were not belated. Mr Levchenko (application no. 36833/16) chose to continue the chain of appeals by using the two-tier cassation procedure and lodging an application with the Court within six months of its conclusion. That procedure, although it dealt with the applicant ’ s claim against the State, was governed by the CCrP. As to the latter, the Court established in Kashlan v. Russia ( (dec.), no. 60189/15, 19 April 2016) that the two-tier cassation procedure is not an effective remedy in proceedings under the CCrP. However, at the material time, the Kashlan decision had not yet been adopted and the previous case-law applied, in which the cassation procedure could be considered to be an effective remedy (see Kashlan, § 27; Myalichev v. Russia [Committee], 9237/14, § 13, 8 November 2016; and Rozhkani v. Russia [Committee], 14918/14, § 25, 9 July 2019 ).

The investigating authorities had obtained judicial authorisation for the searches in respect of the advocates, in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law.

The purpose of the searches had been to obtain information necessary for the criminal investigations. The investigating authorities had had sufficient grounds to believe that the applicants could have been keeping such information on their premises. The court search warrants instructed the investigating authorities to seize only documents pertaining to the relevant investigations. The Government asserted that the applicants had failed to show that any personal or legally privileged documents unrelated to the investigations in question had been seized or used against anyone. Thus, the searches had not affected the interests of the applicants or of their clients. The court search warrants had been scrutinised and the courts ’ decisions to issue them upheld on appeal.

The Court will proceed on the assumption that the searches in all applications were lawful in domestic terms and pursued the legitimate aim of the prevention of crime. It remains to be ascertained whether the impugned measures were “necessary in a democratic society”, in particular, whether the relationship between the aim sought to be achieved and the means employed can be considered proportionate ( see Yuditskaya and Others v.

Therefore, searches of lawyers ’ homes or offices should be subject to especially strict scrutiny (see Elçi and Others v. Turkey, nos. 23145/93 and 25091/94, § 669, 13 November 2003; Xavier Da Silveira v. France, no. 43757/05, § 41, 21 January 2010; and Leotsakos v. Greece, no. 30958/13, § 42, 4 October 2018; see also international legal materials on the protection of lawyer -client relationship, paragraphs 102 - 105 above ). To determine whether the measures were “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court has to ascertain whether effective safeguards against abuse or arbitrariness were available under domestic law and how those safeguards operated in the specific cases under examination. Elements to be taken into consideration in this regard are the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure were effected, whether they were carried out pursuant to an order issued by a judge or a judicial officer or subjected to after-the-fact judicial scrutiny, whether the order was based on reasonable suspicion, and whether its scope was reasonably limited. The Court must also review the manner in which the search was executed, including – where a lawyer ’ s office is concerned – whether it was carried out in the presence of an independent observer or whether other special safeguards were available to ensure that material covered by legal professional privilege was not removed. The Court must lastly take into account the extent of the possible repercussions on the work and the reputation of the persons affected by the search ( see Yuditskaya, cited above, § 27 )."

In the other fourteen applications the applicants were lawyers who were not under criminal investigation. In two applications (application nos. 32324/06 and 26067/08) the searches had been authorised in respect of the applicants ’ relatives, who were suspected of criminal offences.

Azerbaijan, nos. 68762/14 and 71200/14, § 184, 20 September 2018). The court search warrants were couched in very broad terms, giving the investigators unrestricted discretion as to how to carry out the searches. According to the Court ’ s case-law, search warrants have to be drafted, as far as practicable, in a manner calculated to keep their impact within reasonable bounds ( see Yuditskaya, cited above, § 29, with further references )."

Furthermore, as regards the applicants who were members of the Bar, the national courts appeared to believe that the only safeguard to be ensured during the search of the lawyers ’ premises was a prior judicial authorisation, and that that requirement was of a merely procedural character. The Court has previously held that judicial scrutiny in itself is not a sufficient safeguard against abuse (see Cronin v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 15848/03, 6 January 2004, and Gerashchenko v. Ukraine, no. 20602/05, § 130, 7 November 2013 ). At no point did the national courts attempt to weigh the obligation to protect lawyer -client confidentiality against the needs of criminal investigations. For instance, the courts did not examine the possibilities of obtaining the information sought from other sources (for instance, from the clients of the lawyers themselves). Furthermore, there is nothing to demonstrate that the courts had any rules by which to determine when it might be and when it might not be permissible to breach the confidentiality of legally privileged documents (see Sallinen and Others v. Finland, no. 50882/99, § 92, 27 September 2005). On the contrary, in issuing the search warrants, the courts seemed to imply that lawyer -client confidentiality could be breached in every case as long as there was a criminal investigation, even where such investigation was not against the lawyers but against their clients."

The lack of procedural safeguards at the material time is confirmed by the subsequent legislative amendments of 17 April 2017 (see paragraph 94 above). These, however, did not affect the applicants ’ situations prior to that date. At the material time, there existed no possibility of ensuring the presence of a representative of a Bar association or of having an investigating judge decide whether or not particular documents or objects could be used by the investigation if the applicants objected to it on the grounds of professional confidentiality ( compare with Robathin v. Austria, no. 30457/06, § 48, 3 July 2012 ). The presence of attesting witnesses was not a sufficient safeguard, as they were lay people without legal qualifications, unable to identify privileged material ( see Yuditskaya, cited above, § 30, with further references ).

It is for States to determine who is authorised to practise law within their jurisdiction, and under what conditions. Furthermore, it is also for States to establish a system of particular safeguards of professional secrecy in the interests of proper administration of justice, given lawyers ’ role as intermediaries between litigants and the courts (see André and Another v. France, no. 18603/03, §§ 41 -42, 24 July 2008, and Michaud v. France, no. 12323/11, §§ 118-19, ECHR 2012 ). In Russia, irrespective of the area of law, legal advice, as well as representation in court proceedings, may be provided by advocates and by “ other persons ”, with few limitations (see paragraphs 81 - 87 above ). However, professional secrecy is protected only to the extent that advocates are involved, thus leaving exposed the relationships between clients and other kinds of legal advisers (see paragraph 87 above ). The Court concedes that potential clients should be aware of the difference between the status of advocates and that of other legal advisers. Advocates enjoy additional privileges which correspond to the fact that their obligations towards clients are greater than those of other legal advisers (see paragraph 87 above). However, it would be incompatible with the rule of law to leave without any particular safeguards at all the entirety of relations between clients and legal advisers who, with few limitations, practise, professionally and often independently, in most areas of law, including representation of litigants before the courts. Therefore, the Court also considers that the searches of the premises of those applicants who were practising lawyers but not members of the Bar were conducted without sufficient procedural safeguards against arbitrariness."

The judge concluded that there was evidence on the tapes from which the jury could infer that the applicant was involved in the events of 3 February 1995, and it was not so unreliable that it could not be left to the jury to assess for themselves. The judge also rejected the applicant's counsel's arguments under sections 76 and 78 of PACE that the evidence from H. was obtained by oppression or by such impropriety as to render it inadmissible. He considered that the use of an informant to talk and listen to the accused over a substantial period of time did not result in any unfairness to the accused. The fact that H. might be considered as having much to gain in giving evidence was also a matter to be left to the jury in their assessment of the reliability of his evidence. The evidence was accordingly admitted before the jury. The judge's ruling on the admissibility of the evidence was given on 26 January 1998, after a voir dire (submissions on a point of law in the absence of a jury) and consisted of a judgment of eighteen pages."

You have the tape recordings of the conversations on 28 June when H. had been wired up, between [the applicant] and H., and you have the transcripts of the conversations between H. and the police. I suggest ... that you approach the evidence of H. with the very greatest caution and care. He is a professional criminal. He behaved, and has behaved as he acknowledged, dishonestly and criminally for years. He saw the likelihood of advantage to himself, both in terms of bail and in the sentence that he was likely to receive. You have heard that he has not yet been sentenced on matters for which he was in custody in early 1995. The defence say if you consider the whole picture you simply cannot rely upon H.; quite unsafe to do so. The prosecution say the contents of the tapes of 28 June can be relied on and are consistent with what H. says [the applicant] had said to him previously, before he, H., was wired up. Of course tapes of ... conversations cannot possibly constitute any independent confirmation of what H. says about what [the applicant] had said to him previously, because, and you will understand the logic of that, the information is all coming from one source, namely H. and the witness cannot strengthen his own evidence essentially by repetition.",

He also argued that the judge had erred in his directions as to the circumstances in which the jury could draw inferences from the applicant's failure to respond to police questions in interviews of 28 and 29 June, when the police strategy was to “spook” the applicant into a state of garrulousness when he returned to prison, where he had a conversation with H."

In the court's judgment of that date, Lord Justice Rose found that the trial judge gave a very careful and impeccable ruling as regards the admissibility of the tapes and evidence put forward by H. and that he had considered all the matters which he should have considered and had not considered any matter which he ought not to have considered. There was no basis for holding that the exercise of his discretion had been so flawed that the Court of Appeal should intervene. In so far as the applicant complained that the judge should have warned the jury not to take into account the applicant's failure to answer police questioning in the light of the police strategy to “spook” him, Lord Justice Rose found that the judge had given an entirely appropriate direction to the jury in the circumstances of the case."

The right protects against the use of State power to subvert the right of an accused to choose whether or not to speak to the authorities. Where the informer who allegedly acted to subvert the right to silence of the accused is not obviously a State agent, the analysis must focus on both the relationship between the informer and the State and the relationship between the informer and the accused. The right to silence will only be infringed where the informer was acting as an agent of the State at the time the accused made the statement and where it was the informer who caused the accused to make the statement. Accordingly two distinct inquiries are required. First ... was the evidence obtained by an agent of the State? Second, was the evidence elicited?

The conversation here would not have occurred or would have been materially different but for the authorities' intervention. Furthermore, the impugned statement was elicited. Parts of the conversation were functionally the equivalent of an interrogation and the appellant's trust in the informer as a friend was used to undermine the appellant's confidence in his lawyer's advice to remain silent and to create a mental state in which the appellant was more likely to talk.”"

It was of no consequence that the police officer was engaged in a subterfuge, permitted himself to be misidentified or lied, so long as the responses were not actively elicited or the result of interrogation. In this case the conversation had been initiated by the accused and the police officer picked up the flow and content of the conversation without directing or redirecting it in a sensitive area.

An undercover officer held a conversation with the accused pretending that his own brother-in-law was suspected of arson and the accused made admissions of his own involvement in a fire. The High Court of Australia found that the admissions should not have been admitted at trial as they had been elicited by a police officer in clear breach of the accused's right to choose whether or not to speak. The accused Pavic had been questioned by the police about a disappeared person and remained silent. After his release from custody, Pavic made incriminatory statements to a friend called C., who had been fitted with a listening device by the police. The High Court found that there was no impropriety involved and the admissions were reliable and should be admitted. C. had not been a police officer or a person in authority over Pavic. The fact that C. was regarded as trustworthy by Pavic was an indicator of the reliability of the admissions; a serious crime had been committed and there was no public interest to be served by rejecting the admissions.

It is whether the trick may be thought to involve such unfairness to the accused or otherwise to be so contrary to public policy that a court should exercise its discretion to exclude the evidence notwithstanding its high probative value. In the case of covertly obtained confessions, the line of forbidden conduct will be crossed if the confession may be said to have been elicited by police (or by a person acting as an agent of the police) in unfair derogation of the suspect's right to exercise a free choice to speak or to be silent.”",

As regards the use of the evidence from the surveillance at trial, the applicant submitted that the remarks recorded on tape were not an accurate reflection of the Kwik -Save murder, referring to discrepancies with regard to what in fact happened. The time over which the recordings were made, namely, weeks, was oppressive. As he was aware of the possible recording, he was in a no-win situation because if he whispered or gestured, that was said to be incriminating, and if his remarks were not incriminating, he was said to be tailoring his remarks for the microphone. The tapes were also used in the police interviews to unsettle the applicant and set him up for adverse inferences in the event that he exercised his right to silence. This case was also different from that in Khan (cited above) relied on by the Government as the recording in this case was much more invasive and protracted and the evidence obtained filled with inaccuracies and unreliable."

The police used H. not as an inanimate listening post but as a means of conducting surreptitious interrogation, circumventing the protections for a suspect who has availed himself of legal advice and exercised the right to silence (referring to the Canadian authorities' finding that this constituted a violation of the right to silence, Hebert and Broyles, both cited above). In particular, on 28 June 1995 the applicant was removed from prison to a police station and interrogated for a day as a “softening-up” process prior to his being questioned by H. The applicant's conviction was based substantially, if not decisively, on the evidence put forward by H. who was a persistent criminal under threat of sentencing which would depend on his role in the applicant's trial. The one and only alleged admission by the applicant of presence at the scene of the murder was not recorded but rested solely on the H.'s word. This was in all circumstances unfair and oppressive. The applicant further disputed that he suspected H.'s role in this connection or could in any way be regarded as waiving his right to complain about it."

The Government submitted, relying on Khan, cited above, that the admission at trial of recorded evidence obtained secretly by the police under the Guidelines did not violate Article 6. The surveillance had been lawful in domestic terms, there was no reason to suppose that the tapes were not an accurate reflection of what was said, they had not been obtained under any form of pressure and the applicant had an opportunity under domestic law to challenge their use. Furthermore, the tapes were not the only evidence against the applicant and the jury were made fully aware of any possible deficiencies in this evidence. There was no basis on which to distinguish this case from Khan, as in that case no violation was found despite the fact that the recording involved trespass and the evidence obtained was the only evidence against the applicant, whereas in this case the surveillance was lawful under domestic law and the recordings were not the only evidence against the applicant, as there was also the evidence put forward by H. They argued that in serious cases such as murder there was a particularly strong public interest in admitting such material, provided that, as here, the applicant had an opportunity to challenge its use."

Issues of H.'s credibility and reliability were fully argued and explained to the jury which was in a good position to determine whether any findings of fact could be drawn from his statements. The applicant's counsel had been able to cross-examine H. Furthermore, the applicant had spoken voluntarily to H., knowing or at least suspecting that his conversations were being recorded and therefore must be taken as waiving his right to complain about it. There was accordingly no unfairness contrary to Article 6 § 1 in the use of this evidence at trial. Finally, the Government disputed the relevance of the Canadian cases cited by the applicant, noting that the Hebert case concerned the use of evidence actively elicited by an undercover agent (not covert audio- or video-recordings) and which was the only evidence against the accused, while in Broyles the information given by the accused to his visitor was obtained in the functional equivalent of an interrogation and the accused's special trust in his friend exploited."

                "42. The Court reiterates that its duty, according to Article 19 of the Convention, is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting States to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is therefore primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see Schenk v. Switzerland, judgment of 12 July 1988, Series A no. 140, p. 29, §§ 45-46, and, for a more recent example in a different context, Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decision 1998-IV, p. 1462, § 34). It is not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence – for example, unlawfully obtained evidence – may be admissible or, indeed, whether the applicant was guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the “unlawfulness” in question and, where a violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found."

In that context, regard must also be had to whether the rights of the defence have been respected, in particular whether the applicant was given the opportunity of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use, as well as the opportunity of examining any relevant witnesses; whether the admissions made by the applicant during the conversations were made voluntarily, there being no entrapment and the applicant being under no inducement to make such admissions (see Khan, cited above, § 36); and the quality of the evidence, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubts on its reliability or accuracy (ibid., § 37). While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (ibid.)."

                "44. As regards the privilege against self-incrimination or the right to silence, the Court has reiterated that these are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of a fair procedure. Their aim is to provide an accused person with protection against improper compulsion by the authorities and thus to avoid miscarriages of justice and secure the aims of Article 6 (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports 1996-I, p. 49, § 45). The right not to incriminate oneself is primarily concerned with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent and presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seeks to prove the case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Saunders v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2064, §§ 68-69). In examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court will examine the nature and degree of the compulsion, the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures and the use to which any material so obtained is put (see, for example, Heaney and McGuinness v. Ireland, no. 34720/97, §§ 54-55, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and J.B. v. Switzerland, no. 31827/96, ECHR 2001-III).",

Similarly, there is no suggestion that any admissions made by the applicant during the conversations taped with Leroy Grant and J.N.S. were not voluntary in the sense that the applicant was coerced into making them or that there was any entrapment or inducement. Indeed, the applicant has stated that he was aware that he was possibly being taped while in the police station."

The applicant has argued that the evidence from the recordings was unreliable and contained many inconsistencies, while the Government have pointed to the admissions that it contained which were probative of the applicant's knowledge of the incident. As the applicant alleged that he knew of the possible recording and as the tapes indicated that a certain amount of whispering or gesturing was being carried out at times, the Court considers that an assessment of the strength or the reliability of the evidence concerned is not a straightforward matter. The applicant's conduct as a whole must have played a role in the assessment of the evidence and this Court is not well-placed to express a view. In those circumstances, the existence of fair procedures to examine the admissibility and test the reliability of the evidence takes on an even greater importance."

In that regard, the Court notes that the applicant's counsel challenged the admissibility of the recordings in a voir dire, and was able to put forward arguments to exclude the evidence as unreliable, unfair or obtained in an oppressive manner. The judge, in a careful ruling however, admitted the evidence, finding that it was of probative value and had not been shown to be so unreliable that it could not be left to the jury to decide for themselves. This decision was reviewed on appeal by the Court of Appeal which found that the judge had taken into account all the relevant factors and that his ruling could not be faulted. At each step of the procedure, the applicant had therefore been given an opportunity to challenge the reliability and significance of the recording evidence. The Court is not persuaded that the use of the taped material concerning Leroy Grant and J.N.S. at the applicant's trial conflicted with the requirements of fairness guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

While the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination are primarily designed to protect against improper compulsion by the authorities and the obtaining of evidence through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused, the scope of the right is not confined to cases where duress has been brought to bear on the accused or where the will of the accused has been directly overborne in some way. The right, which the Court has previously observed is at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure, serves in principle to protect the freedom of a suspected person to choose whether to speak or to remain silent when questioned by the police. Such freedom of choice is effectively undermined in a case in which, the suspect having elected to remain silent during questioning, the authorities use subterfuge to elicit, from the suspect, confessions or other statements of an incriminatory nature, which they were unable to obtain during such questioning and where the confessions or statements thereby obtained are adduced in evidence at trial."

                "51. Whether the right to silence is undermined to such an extent as to give rise to a violation of Article 6 of the Convention depends on all the circumstances of the individual case. In this regard, however, some guidance may be found in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, referred to in paragraphs 30-32 above, in which the right to silence, in circumstances which bore some similarity to those in the present case, was examined in the context of section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. There, the Canadian Supreme Court expressed the view that, where the informer who allegedly acted to subvert the right to silence of the accused was not obviously a State agent, the analysis should focus on both the relationship between the informer and the State and the relationship between the informer and the accused: the right to silence would only be infringed where the informer was acting as an agent of the State at the time the accused made the statement and where it was the informer who caused the accused to make the statement. Whether an informer was to be regarded as a State agent depended on whether the exchange between the accused and the informer would have taken place, and in the form and manner in which it did, but for the intervention of the authorities. Whether the evidence in question was to be regarded as having been elicited by the informer depended on whether the conversation between him and the accused was the functional equivalent of an interrogation, as well as on the nature of the relationship between the informer and the accused."

                "52. In the present case, the Court notes that in his interviews with the police following his arrest the applicant had, on the advice of his solicitor, consistently availed himself of his right to silence. H., who was a long-standing police informer, was placed in the applicant's cell in Stretford police station and later at the same prison for the specific purpose of eliciting from the applicant information implicating him in the offences of which he was suspected. The evidence adduced at the applicant's trial showed that the police had coached H. and instructed him to “push him for what you can”. In contrast to the position in Khan, the admissions allegedly made by the applicant to H., and which formed the main or decisive evidence against him at trial, were not spontaneous and unprompted statements volunteered by the applicant, but were induced by the persistent questioning of H., who, at the instance of the police, channelled their conversations into discussions of the murder in circumstances which can be regarded as the functional equivalent of interrogation, without any of the safeguards which would attach to a formal police interview, including the attendance of a solicitor and the issuing of the usual caution. While it is true that there was no special relationship between the applicant and H. and that no factors of direct coercion have been identified, the Court considers that the applicant would have been subjected to psychological pressures which impinged on the “ voluntariness ” of the disclosures allegedly made by the applicant to H.: he was a suspect in a murder case, in detention and under direct pressure from the police in interrogations about the murder, and would have been susceptible to persuasion to take H., with whom he shared a cell for some weeks, into his confidence. In those circumstances, the information gained by the use of H. in this way may be regarded as having been obtained in defiance of the will of the applicant and its use at trial impinged on the applicant's right to silence and privilege against self-incrimination."
