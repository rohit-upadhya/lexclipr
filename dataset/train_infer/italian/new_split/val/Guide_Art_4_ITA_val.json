                "151. In Rantsev, the Court considered that trafficking in human beings, by its very nature and aim of exploitation, is based on the exercise of powers attaching to the right of ownership. It treats human beings as commodities to be bought and sold and put to forced labour, often for little or no payment, usually in the sex industry but also elsewhere. It implies close surveillance of the activities of victims, whose movements are often circumscribed. It involves the use of violence and threats against victims, who live and work under poor conditions. It is described in the explanatory report accompanying the Anti-Trafficking Convention as the modern form of the old worldwide slave trade. In those circumstances, the Court concluded that trafficking itself, within the meaning of Article 3(a) of the Palermo Protocol and Article 4(a) of the Anti-Trafficking Convention, fell within the scope of Article 4 of the Convention (see Rantsev, cited above, §§ 281-282).",

The first, second and third applicants arrived in Milan on 12 May 2003 following a promise of work by X., a Roma man of Serbian nationality, residing in Italy, who accommodated them in a villa in the village of Ghislarengo, in the province of Vercelli, where he lived with his family. The third and the first applicants provided different versions on this point to the Italian authorities. In her declarations to the Italian police, on 24 May 2003, the third applicant maintained that she, her husband and her daughter, who lived in Bulgaria in a condition of extreme precariousness, moved to Italy in search of work; when they arrived in Milan they approached an individual who spoke their language, X., who proposed to them to work as domestic employees to take care of his big house. The first applicant, in her declarations to the public prosecutor on 11 June 2003, maintained that she had met X. in “Yugoslavia”, where she was with her mother in search of a job, and from there X. had driven them to Italy in his car after proposing a job. They remained in the villa for several days, during which time they undertook household chores. After a while, X. declared to the second applicant that Y., his nephew, wanted to marry his daughter (the first applicant). As the second and third applicants refused, X. threatened them with a loaded gun. Then the second and third applicants were beaten, threatened with death and forced to leave the first applicant in Italy and go back to Bulgaria. Although the applicants denied this, it seems from their initial submissions that the second and third applicants had been offered money to leave their daughter behind. On 18 May 2003, the second and third applicants went back to Bulgaria. On their return the second applicant was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which he alleged was a consequence of the stress endured."

The applicants submitted that during the month (following 18 May 2003) spent at the villa in Ghislarengo, the first applicant was kept under constant surveillance and was forced to steal against her will, was beaten, threatened with death and repeatedly raped by Y. while tied to a bed. During one of the robberies in which the first applicant was forced to participate, she had an accident and had to be treated in hospital.

She further feared that her daughter might be led into prostitution. They were settled in a monastery near Turin.

At about 2 p.m. that day, she was taken to a police station in Vercelli and questioned, in the presence of an interpreter, by two female and two male police officers. The applicants alleged that she was treated roughly and threatened that she would be accused of perjury and libel if she did not tell the truth. Allegedly she was then forced to declare that she did not wish her supposed kidnappers to be prosecuted, to answer “yes” to all other questions, and to sign certain documents in Italian, which she did not understand and which were neither translated into Bulgarian nor given to her.

On 4 June 2003 the Vercelli Police Headquarters transmitted the crime report ( notizia di reato ) to the Vercelli Public Prosecutor’s Office. From the communal registry it appeared that no person resided in the identified villa, but that it was owned by an individual who had a criminal record. In consequence, the police kept the place under surveillance. The police raided the villa on 11 June 2003, after having observed movement inside.

Relevant elements will include the proximity of the family tie – in that context, a certain weight will attach to the parent-child bond –, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, the involvement of the family member in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person and the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries. In these cases the essence of such a violation does not so much lie in the fact of the “disappearance” of the family member but rather concerns the authorities’ reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities’ conduct (see, Kurt v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, §§ 130-134, Reports 1998 ‑ III; Timurtaş v.

Indeed, the Court notes that on the same day that the first applicant was released and heard, the criminal proceedings which had been instituted against the assailants were turned into criminal proceedings against the first and third applicants (see paragraph 25 above).

By a letter dated 24 June 2003 the Bulgarian Embassy in Rome notified the CRD that, following a request by the second applicant, information had been received from the Head Office of the Criminal Police of Italy to the effect that the result of the inquiry and declaration of the first applicant indicated that her father had received money for a forthcoming wedding and therefore there were no grounds to institute criminal proceedings against the Serbian family. They further noted that the judicial authorities were considering the possibility of bringing proceedings against the first and third applicants for libel and perjury.

Marriage age was governed by custom according to the group to which the persons belonged, and in practice was generally a young age. Roma marriages were considered concluded with a wedding in the presence of the community and it did not require a civil or religious procedure to be considered sacred and indissoluble. The traditional Roma marriage consisted of two phases. The first, the engagement, regulated the pre-requisites of marriage such as the fixing of the bride’s “price”/“ransom”/”dowry”, which is a bargaining made by the fathers in view of the fact that the bride will then be part of the family of the groom. The second is the wedding, which includes a set of rituals, the most important of which was the consummation of the marriage, bearing in mind that virginity was a pre-requisite to the marriage.

With regard to the concept of “servitude”, the Court has held that what is prohibited is a “particularly serious form of denial of freedom” (see Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium, Commission’s report of 9 July 1980, §§ 78-80, Series B no. 44). The concept of “servitude” entails an obligation, under coercion, to provide one’s services, and is linked with the concept of “slavery” (see Seguin v. France (dec.), no. 42400/98, 7 March 2000; and Siliadin, cited above, § 124). For “forced or compulsory labour” to arise, the Court has held that there must be some physical or mental constraint, as well as some overriding of the person’s will (see Van der Mussele v. Belgium, 23 November 1983, § 34, Series A no. 70; Siliadin, cited above, § 117)."

The Court is not regularly called upon to consider the application of Article 4 and, in particular, has had only two occasions to date to consider the extent to which treatment associated with trafficking fell within the scope of that Article ( Siliadin and Rantsev, both cited above). In the former case, the Court concluded that the treatment suffered by the applicant amounted to servitude and forced and compulsory labour, although it fell short of slavery. In the latter case, trafficking itself was considered to run counter to the spirit and purpose of Article 4 of the Convention such as to fall within the scope of the guarantees offered by that Article without the need to assess which of the three types of proscribed conduct was engaged by the particular treatment in the case in question."

In Rantsev, the Court considered that trafficking in human beings, by its very nature and aim of exploitation, is based on the exercise of powers attaching to the right of ownership. It treats human beings as commodities to be bought and sold and put to forced labour, often for little or no payment, usually in the sex industry but also elsewhere. It implies close surveillance of the activities of victims, whose movements are often circumscribed. It involves the use of violence and threats against victims, who live and work under poor conditions. It is described in the explanatory report accompanying the Anti-Trafficking Convention as the modern form of the old worldwide slave trade. In those circumstances, the Court concluded that trafficking itself, within the meaning of Article 3(a) of the Palermo Protocol and Article 4(a) of the Anti-Trafficking Convention, fell within the scope of Article 4 of the Convention (see Rantsev, cited above, §§ 281-282).",

However, it considers that from the evidence submitted there is not sufficient ground to establish the veracity of the applicants’ version of events, namely that the first applicant was transferred to Italy in order to serve as a pawn in some kind of racket devoted to illegal activities. In consequence, the Court does not recognise the existence of circumstances capable of amounting to the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons for the purpose of exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. It follows that the applicants’ allegation that there had been an instance of actual human trafficking has not been proved and therefore cannot be accepted by the Court."

The first applicant, who was aged seventeen years and nine months at the time of the alleged marriage, never denied that she willingly married Y. She did, however, deny that any payment had been made to her father for the marriage. Nevertheless, the photos collected by the police appear to suggest that an exchange of money in fact took place.

The Court therefore considers that in relation to the events as established by the authorities, again, there is not sufficient evidence indicating that the first applicant was held in slavery. Even assuming that the applicant’s father received a sum of money in respect of the alleged marriage, the Court is of the view that, in the circumstances of the present case, such a monetary contribution cannot be considered to amount to a price attached to the transfer of ownership, which would bring into play the concept of slavery. The Court reiterates that marriage has deep-rooted social and cultural connotations which may differ largely from one society to another (see Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, no. 30141/04, § 62, ECHR 2010). According to the Court, this payment can reasonably be accepted as representing a gift from one family to another, a tradition common to many different cultures in today’s society."

What there has to be is work “exacted ... under the menace of any penalty” and also performed against the will of the person concerned, that is work for which he or she “has not offered himself or herself voluntarily” (see Van der Mussele, cited above, § 34, and Siliadin, cited above § 117).

Furthermore, according to the Court the post facto medical records submitted are not sufficient to determine beyond reasonable doubt that the first applicant actually suffered some form of ill-treatment or exploitation as understood in the definition of trafficking. Neither can the Court consider that the sole payment of a sum of money suffices to consider that there had been trafficking in human beings. Nor is there evidence suggesting that such a union was contracted for the purposes of exploitation, be it sexual or other. Thus, there is no reason to believe that the union was undertaken for purposes other than those generally associated with a traditional marriage."

The Court notes with interest the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe’s resolutions (see Relevant international texts above) showing concern in respect of Roma women in the context of forced and child marriages (the latter defined as the union of two persons at least one of whom is under 18 years of age) and it shares these apprehensions. The Court, however, notes that the resolutions airing such concerns and encouraging action in this respect are dated 2005 and 2010 and therefore at the time of the alleged events not only was there not any binding instrument, as remains the case to date, but in actual fact there was not enough awareness and consensus among the international community to condemn such actions. The prevailing document at the time (which was not ratified by Italy or Bulgaria) was the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages (1962) which determined that it was for the States to decide on an age limit for contracting marriage and allowed a dispensation as to age to be given by a competent authority in exceptional circumstances. This trend is reflected in the legislation of many of the member States of the Council of Europe which consider eighteen years to be the age of consent for the purposes of marriage, and provide for exceptional circumstances whereby a court or other authority (often on consulting the guardians) may allow a marriage to be contracted by a person who is younger (for example, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Hungary, Malta, San Marino, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden), the most common being at least sixteen years of age."

Indeed under Italian legislation, it is perfectly legal for a person aged sixteen or more to have consensual sexual intercourse (see by implication article 609 quarter in paragraph 40 above), even without the consent of the parent, and he or she may also leave the family home with the consent of the parents. Moreover, in the instant case there is not sufficient evidence indicating that the union was forced on the first applicant who had not testified that she had not consented to it and who emphasized that Y. had not forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. In this light it cannot be said that the circumstances as established by the authorities raise any issue under Article 4 of the Convention."

A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention. Admittedly, proving racial motivation will often be extremely difficult in practice. The respondent State’s obligation to investigate possible racist overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use its best endeavours and is not absolute; the authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances of the case (see Nachova and others, cited above, § 160)."

The work of the ILO supervisory bodies has served to clarify both of these elements. The penalty does not need to be in the form of penal sanctions, but may also take the form of a loss of rights and privileges. Moreover, the menace of a penalty can take many different forms. Arguably, its most extreme form involves physical violence or restraint, or even death threats addressed to the victim or relatives. There can also be subtler forms of menace, sometimes of a psychological nature. Situations examined by the ILO have included threats to denounce victims to the police or immigration authorities when their employment status is illegal, or denunciation to village elders in the case of girls forced to prostitute themselves in distant cities. Other penalties can be of a financial nature, including economic penalties linked to debts. Employers sometimes also require workers to hand over their identity papers, and may use the threat of confiscation of these documents in order to exact forced labour.",
                "25. As regards “voluntary offer”, the ILO supervisory bodies have touched on a range of aspects including: the form and subject matter of consent; the role of external constraints or indirect coercion; and the possibility of revoking freely-given consent. Here too, there can be many subtle forms of coercion. Many victims enter forced labour situations initially out of their own choice, albeit through fraud and deception, only to discover later that they are not free to withdraw their labour, owing to legal, physical or psychological coercion. Initial consent may be considered irrelevant when deception or fraud has been used to obtain it.”",

These factors help distinguish between “forced labour” and a helping hand which can reasonably be expected of other family members or people sharing accommodation. Along these lines, in the case of Van der Mussele v.

In the present case the first applicant was convinced that her administrative situation in France depended on her living with Mr and Mrs M., and that she could not free herself from their hold without placing herself in an illegal situation. That feeling was strengthened by certain incidents, such as her hospitalisation under the name of one of her cousins (see paragraph 19 above). What is more, the applicant did not attend school (the Court cannot take her refusal to enrol when she was a minor into consideration), and she received no training that might have given her any hope of ever finding paid work outside the home of Mr and Mrs M. With no day off and no leisure activities, there was no possibility for her to meet people outside the house whom she might ask for help. The Court accordingly considers that the first applicant had the feeling that her condition – that of having to do forced or compulsory labour at the home of Mr and Mrs M. – was permanent and could not change, especially as it lasted four years (see, mutatis mutandis, Siliadin, cited above, §§ 126 ‑ 129). That state of affairs started when she was still a minor and continued after she came of age.

She was less isolated than her sister, which is why she was able to alert the school nurse to her situation.

They referred to the Siliadin case (cited above), where the Court considered that Articles 225-13 and 225-14 of the Criminal Code did not deal specifically with the rights guaranteed by Article 4 of the Convention but concerned, in a much more restrictive way, exploitation through labour and subjection to working and living conditions incompatible with human dignity. The applicants affirmed that this lacuna in French law had paradoxically been confirmed by a judgment of the Court of Cassation of 13 January 2009 (see paragraph 50 above) which made an evolutive interpretation of Articles 225-13 and 225-14 of the Criminal Code."

Without such an appeal the acquittal had become final and the appeal to the Court of Cassation concerned only the civil aspect of the case.

Cyprus and Russia judgment of 7 January 2010. In the present case the applicants pointed out that when the social services submitted a report on children in danger to the public prosecutor in 1995, no further action had been taken. Not until a second report in 1999 was a judicial investigation opened. The applicants alleged that their exploitation continued from 1995 to 1999 even though the prosecuting authorities were aware of the situation. They also complained that the judicial investigation opened in 1999 had only concerned the offence under Article 225-14 of the Criminal Code, and that Mr M. had been brought before the courts only thanks to the applicants, the public prosecutor having failed to appeal against the finding of the investigating judge that there were no grounds for prosecution.

There was therefore no requirement under Article 13 of the Convention, or positive obligation under Article 4, that such an appeal by the Principal Public Prosecutor should be automatic; that would deprive him of his fundamental role in criminal proceedings. The Government submitted that in the present case the Prosecutor had considered that no error of law made it necessary for him to appeal to the Court of Cassation. In addition, the Government explained that the rule according to which a civil party could appeal on points of law only in respect of his civil interests did not prevent the Court of Cassation from verifying the conformity with the law of the judgment given by the Court of Appeal in the criminal proceedings. The civil part of the proceedings was contingent on the outcome of the criminal proceedings.

This was clearly the result of the jury selection procedure, in which the reasons militating for and against the choice of a certain person as juror were evaluated. The results were dependant on many factors, such as the element of luck, challenges brought by the defence and exemptions granted by the courts. It was true that women were exempted from jury service for social, family and cultural reasons; however, this was perfectly legitimate and lawful when it was as a consequence of a claim by the defence, the prosecutors or the presiding judge."

Belgium (23 November 1983, Series A no. 70). In the latter judgment, the Court held that the concept of “ normal civic obligation ” referred “ to all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily ”. The applicant emphasised that he had not offered himself voluntarily for jury service. On the contrary, this service had been exacted from him on pain of a fine, which could be converted into a term of imprisonment. The applicant made reference to judgments in which the United States Supreme Court dealt with issues related to jury service and discrimination in the selection of jurors ( Smith v. State of Texas, 25 November 1940, 311 US 128 (1941); Thiel v. Southern Pac. Co., 20 May 1946, 328 US 217 (1946); and Brown v. Allen, 9 February 1953, 344 US 44 3 (1953)).

One of the measures that had been taken was to add government or bank employees to the lists of jurors, amongst which groups women were well- represented. University graduates had also been added to the lists on the basis that there was an equal number of men and women. The Government noted that as a result of this ongoing process, in the lists of jurors published in the Gazette of 15 November 2004, there were 6,344 women and 10,195 men. They also clarified that while there was no maximum numerical limit to the number of people included on the lists of jurors, the number actually enrolled depended on checks made by the Commissioner of Police, and on the practice of putting on the lists only qualified individuals ( men or women ) who were less likely to be entitled to an exemption."

He alleged that the way in which the laws establishing jury service were applied had led to a situation in which only a small percentage of the population was summoned to serve as jurors. Of the hundreds of thousands of persons eligible for jury service, only a few hundred were actually called for service. The lists of jurors were not compiled every year and the same names were retained on the lists. Even if the law clearly required new lists to be compiled, the practice was, as substantially admitted by the Government, to make a simple annual check of those who had become disqualified or had died during the previous twelve months."

Moreover, in 1997 the number of male registered voters was 137,090; however, only 392 men were called to serve as foremen and 7,111 were called to serve as jurors.

In the applicant ’ s view, a civic obligation is normal if it is enforced and administered in a just and equitable manner and it is shared by the qualified members of the society. A fair cross section of society is imperative for a just and fair jury system. On the contrary, when, as in his case, such an obligation imposes an excessive and disproportionate burden on a single individual, discrimination contrary to the Convention occurs. The applicant referred to the above-mentioned judgments in which the United States Supreme Court criticised the practices of placing the burden of jury service upon only a section of the population and of excluding an ethnic or racial group from jury service. Moreover, the case of Taylor v. Louisiana (419 US 522 (1975)) concerned a situation whereby women could not be selected for jury service unless they had previously declared in writing that they wished to serve as jurors. The Supreme Court had held that “ if it was ever the case that women were unqualified to sit on juries or were so situated that none of them should be required to perform jury service, that time has long since passed ”. The applicant submitted that the situation in Malta was similar to that in the State of Louisiana at the time of the Taylor case."

However, not every difference in treatment will amount to a violation of Article 14.

The discrimination in issue was on the contrary based on what the applicant described as a well-established practice, characterised by a number of factors, such as the manner in which the lists of jurors were compiled and the criteria for exemption from jury service.

In the previous year this difference was even more significant, as only 147 women were placed on the lists of jurors, as opposed to 4,298 men.

Moreover, according to Article 604 (3) of the CC, an exemption from jury service might be granted to persons who had to take care of their family.

Such an approach is, in the Court ’ s view, only logical in light of the general obligation, outlined above, incumbent on all States under Article 4 of the Convention to investigate alleged trafficking offences. In addition to the obligation to conduct a domestic investigation into events occurring on their own territories, member States are also subject to a duty in cross-border trafficking cases to cooperate effectively with the relevant authorities of other States concerned in the investigation of events which occurred outside their territories. Such a duty is in keeping with the objectives of the member States, as expressed in the preamble to the Palermo Protocol, to adopt a comprehensive international approach to trafficking in the countries of origin, transit and destination (see paragraph 149 above).

Under the Act, any action identifiable as trafficking in human beings in the light of the Convention for the Suppression of Trafficking in Persons and of the Exploitation and Prostitution of Others, together with other acts of a similar nature specified by law, are an offence punishable by 10 years ’ imprisonment, the penalty being increased to 15 years where the victim is under 18 years of age.

If committed by persons in the victim ’ s entourage or persons wielding authority or influence over the victim, the penalty is 20 years in prison. According to the provisions of Article 4, using children for the production and sale of pornographic material is an offence. Article 7 grants State aid, within reasonable limits, to victims of exploitation; such aid comprises subsistence allowance, temporary accommodation, medical care and psychiatric support. Article 8 reaffirms the right to redress by stressing the power of the court to award punitive damages justified by the degree of exploitation or the degree of the accused person ’ s constraint over the victim. A foreign worker lawfully present in Cyprus who is a victim of exploitation can approach the authorities to find other employment up until the expiry of the initial work permit (Article 9). Lastly, the Council of Ministers, under Article 10, appoints a guardian for victims with the principal duties of counselling and assisting them, examining complaints of exploitation, and having the culprits prosecuted, as well as for pinpointing any deficiency or loophole in the law and for making recommendations with a view to their removal. ”"

                "“ 57. Trafficking in human beings is one of the most pressing and complex Human Rights issues faced by Council of Europe member states, including Cyprus. There is obviously a risk that the young women who enter Cyprus on artiste visas may be victims of trafficking in human beings or later become victims of abuse or coercion. These women are officially recruited as cabaret dancers but are nevertheless often expected also to work as prostitutes. They are usually from countries with inferior income levels to those in Cyprus and may find themselves in a vulnerable position to refuse demands from their employers or clients. The system itself, whereby the establishment owner applies for the permit on behalf of the woman, often renders the woman dependent on her employer or agent, and increases the risk of her falling into the hands of trafficking networks.",
                "58. The Commissioner urges the Cypriot authorities to be especially vigilant about monitoring the situation and ensuring that the system of artiste visas is not used for facilitating trafficking or forced prostitution. In this context, the Commissioner recalls the exemplary reaction of the Luxembourg authorities to similar concerns expressed in his report on the country and their withdrawal of the cabaret artiste visa regime. Changes to the current practice might, at the very least, include women having to apply for the visa themselves, and the information leaflet being given to the women, if possible, before they enter the country.",
                "59. The Commissioner welcomes the new National Action Plan for the Combating of Human Trafficking as a first step in addressing this issue and encourages the Ministry of the Interior to ensure its full implementation. The new law on trafficking, once enacted, will also play an important role. The variety of police activities in response to this phenomenon, such as the setting up of the Office for the Prevention and Combating of Human Trafficking, should also be welcomed.",
                "60. In order to respect the human rights of trafficked persons, the authorities need to be able to identify victims and refer them to specialised agencies which can offer shelter and protection, as well as support services. The Commissioner urges the Cypriot authorities to continue with the training of police officers in victim identification and referral, and encourages the authorities to include women police officers in this area. More effective partnerships with NGOs and other civil society actors should also be developed.

Already in 2003, the Commissioner for Administration (Ombudswoman) stated that Cyprus had been associated with trafficking both as a country of destination and transit, the majority of women being blackmailed and forced to provide sexual services. In 2008, the island still is a destination country for a large number of women trafficked from the Philippines, Russia, Moldova, Hungary, Ukraine, Greece, Vietnam, Uzbekistan and the Dominican Republic for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation ... Women are reportedly denied part or all of their salaries, forced to surrender their passports, and pressed into providing sexual services for clients. Most of these women are unable to move freely, are forced to work far above normal working hours, and live in desperate conditions, isolated and under strict surveillance.",

Victims of trafficking are recruited to Cyprus mainly on three-month so-called ‘ artiste ’ or ‘ entertainment ’ visas to work in the cabaret industry including night clubs and bars or on tourist visas to work in massage parlours disguised as private apartments ... The permit is sought by the owner of the establishment, in most cases so - called ‘ cabarets ’, for the women in question.",

It shows that an estimated 2 000 foreign women enter the island every year with short term ‘ artiste ’ or ‘ entertainment ’ work permits. Over the 20-year period 1982-2002, there was a dramatic increase of 111% in the number of cabarets operating on the island ...",

The Commissioner reiterates that trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation is a pressing and complex human rights issues faced by a number of Council of Europe member States, including Cyprus. A paradox certainly exists that while the Cypriot government has made legislative efforts to fight trafficking in human beings and expressed its willingness through their National Action Plan 2005, it continues to issue work permits for so-called cabaret artistes and licences for the cabaret establishments. While on paper the permits are issued to those women who will engage in some type of artistic performance, the reality is that many, if not most, of these women are expected to work as prostitutes.",
                "46. The existence of the ‘ artiste ’ work permit leads to a situation which makes it very difficult for law enforcement authorities to prove coercion and trafficking and effectively combat it. This type of permit could thus be perceived as contradicting the measures taken against trafficking or at least as rendering them ineffective.",
                "47. For these reasons, the Commissioner regrets that the ‘ artiste ’ work permit is still in place today despite the fact that the government has previously expressed its commitment to abolish it. It seems that the special information leaflet given to women entering the country on such a permit is of little effect, even though the woman needs to have read and signed the leaflet in the presence of an official.",

In this regard, it is noted that awareness of the problem of trafficking of human beings and the need to take action to combat it has grown in recent years, as demonstrated by the adoption of measures at international level as well as the introduction of relevant domestic legislation in a number of States (see also paragraphs 264 and 269 below). The reports of the Council of Europe ’ s Commissioner for Human Rights and the report of the Cypriot Ombudsman highlight the acute nature of the problem in Cyprus, where it is widely acknowledged that trafficking and sexual exploitation of cabaret artistes is of particular concern (see paragraphs 83, 89, 91, 94, 100 to 101 and 103 above)."

On the information available to the police officers who had contact with Ms Rantseva on 28 March 2001, there was no reason to suspect a real or immediate risk to Ms Rantseva ’ s life. The testimony of the police officers revealed that Ms Rantseva was calmly applying her make-up and that the behaviour of M.A. towards her appeared normal (see paragraphs 20 and 49 above ). Although Ms Rantseva had left her employment at the cabaret, she had not submitted any complaint regarding her employer or the conditions of her work. She did not make a complaint to the police officers while at the station and she did not refuse to leave with M.A..

In the first place, this obligation requires the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. However, it also implies, in appropriate circumstances, a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see Osman, cited above, § 115; Medova v.

Not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising.

In the present case, even if the police ought to have been aware that Ms Rantseva might have been a victim of trafficking (a matter to be examined in the context of the applicant ’ s Article 4 complaint, below), there were no indications during the time spent at the police station that Ms Rantseva ’ s life was at real and immediate risk.

He also complained about the limited number of witness statements taken by the police (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above), highlighting that five of the seven relevant statements were either from the police officers on duty at Limassol Police Station or those present in the apartment at the time of his daughter ’ s death, persons who, in his view, had an interest in presenting a particular version of events. The applicant further argued that any investigation should not depend on an official complaint or claim from the victim ’ s relatives. He contended that his daughter clearly died in strange circumstances requiring elaboration and that an Article 2-compliant investigation was accordingly required. The Cypriot investigation did not comply with Article 2 due to the inadequacies outlined above, as well as the fact that it was not accessible to him, as a relative of the victim."

He submitted that the Russian authorities should have applied to the Cypriot authorities under the Legal Assistance Treaty to initiate criminal proceedings in accordance with Articles 5 and 36 (see paragraphs 181 and 207 above), as he had requested. Instead, the Russian authorities merely sought information concerning the circumstances of Ms Rantseva ’ s death. The applicant ’ s subsequent application to the relevant authorities in Russia to initiate criminal proceedings was refused by the Chelyabinsk Prosecutor ’ s Office as Ms Rantseva died outside Russia. His repeated requests that Russian authorities take statements from two Russian nationals resident in Russia were refused as the Russian authorities considered that they were unable to take the action requested without a legal assistance request from the Cypriot authorities.

As the Court has consistently held, the obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State ’ s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, requires that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, § 161, Series A no. 324; Kaya v. Turkey, 19 February 1998, § 86, Reports 1998-I; Medova v. Russia, cited above, § 103 ). The obligation to conduct an effective official investigation also arises where death occurs in suspicious circumstances not imputable to State agents (see Menson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 47916/99, ECHR 2003 ‑ V ). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. The authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see, for example, İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 63, ECHR 2000-VII; Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, § 69 )."

The investigation must be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, § 71). A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in the context of an effective investigation within the meaning of Article 2 of the Convention (see Yaşa v. Turkey, 2 September 1998, §§ 102-104, Reports 1998-VI; Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, §§ 80-87 and 106, ECHR 1999-IV; and Kelly and Others, cited above, § 97 ).

By necessity, the investigation was required to consider not only the immediate context of Ms Rantseva ’ s fall from the balcony but also the broader context of Ms Rantseva ’ s arrival and stay in Cyprus, in order to assess whether there was a link between the allegations of trafficking and Ms Rantseva ’ s subsequent death."

Further, the statements of the police officers do not refer to any statement being taken from Ms Rantseva and there is nothing in the investigation file to explain why this was not done; a statement was made by M.A. (see paragraph 19 above).

The Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation provided an unsolicited undertaking that Russia would assist in any request for legal assistance by Cyprus aimed at the collection of further evidence (see paragraph 70 above).

He contended that in so doing, the Cypriot authorities had failed to take measures to protect his daughter from trafficking. They had also failed to conduct any investigation into whether his daughter had been a victim of trafficking or had been subjected to sexual or other exploitation.

They conceded that there were positive obligations on the State which required the penalisation and effective prosecution of any act aimed at maintaining a person in a situation of slavery, servitude or forced or compulsory labour.

Ms Rantseva herself had made no allegations of that nature prior to her death and the note she left in her apartment saying she was tired and was going back to Russia (see paragraph 17 above) was inadequate to support any such allegations.

Other positive obligations included obligations to discourage demand for human trafficking, to ensure an adequate law enforcement response to identify and eradicate any involvement of law enforcement officials in human trafficking offences and build victims ’ confidence in the police and judicial systems and to ensure that the identification of victims of trafficking took place efficiently and effectively by introducing relevant training.

It is relevant to the consideration of the proportionality of any positive obligation arising in the present case that the Palermo Protocol, signed by both Cyprus and the Russian Federation in 2000, requires States to endeavour to provide for the physical safety of victims of trafficking while in their territories and to establish comprehensive policies and programmes to prevent and combat trafficking (see paragraphs 153 to 154 above).

The requirement to investigate does not depend on a complaint from the victim or next-of-kin: once the matter has come to the attention of the authorities they must act of their own motion (see, mutatis mutandis, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, § 69, ECHR 2002 ‑ II ). For an investigation to be effective, it must be independent from those implicated in the events. It must also be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of individuals responsible, an obligation not of result but of means. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in all cases but where the possibility of removing the individual from the harmful situation is available, the investigation must be undertaken as a matter of urgency. The victim or the next-of-kin must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests (see, mutatis mutandis, Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, §§ 70 to 73 )."

                "289. Finally, the Court reiterates that trafficking is a problem which is often not confined to the domestic arena. When a person is trafficked from one State to another, trafficking offences may occur in the State of origin, any State of transit and the State of destination. Relevant evidence and witnesses may be located in all States. Although the Palermo Protocol is silent on the question of jurisdiction, the Anti-Trafficking Convention explicitly requires each member State to establish jurisdiction over any trafficking offence committed in its territory (see paragraph 172 above). Such an approach is, in the Court ’ s view, only logical in light of the general obligation, outlined above, incumbent on all States under Article 4 of the Convention to investigate alleged trafficking offences. In addition to the obligation to conduct a domestic investigation into events occurring on their own territories, member States are also subject to a duty in cross-border trafficking cases to cooperate effectively with the relevant authorities of other States concerned in the investigation of events which occurred outside their territories. Such a duty is in keeping with the objectives of the member States, as expressed in the preamble to the Palermo Protocol, to adopt a comprehensive international approach to trafficking in the countries of origin, transit and destination (see paragraph 149 above). It is also consistent with international agreements on mutual legal assistance in which the respondent States participate in the present case (see paragraphs 175 to 185 above).",

The law reflects the provisions of the Palermo Protocol and prohibits trafficking and sexual exploitation, with consent providing no defence to the offence. Severe penalties are set out in the legislation. The law also provides for a duty to protect victims, inter alia through the appointment of a guardian of victims. Although the Ombudsman criticised the failure of the authorities to adopt practical implementing measures, she considered the law itself to be satisfactory (see paragraph 90 above). The Council of Europe Commissioner also found the legal framework established by Law 3(1) 2000 to be “suitable” (see paragraph 92 above). Notwithstanding the applicant ’ s complaint as to the inadequacy of Cypriot trafficking legislation, the Court does not consider that the circumstances of the present case give rise to any concern in this regard."

                "291. However, as regards the general legal and administrative framework and the adequacy of Cypriot immigration policy, a number of weaknesses can be identified. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights noted in his 2003 report that the absence of an immigration policy and legislative shortcomings in this respect have encouraged the trafficking of women to Cyprus (see paragraph 91 above). He called for preventive control measures to be adopted to stem the flow of young women entering Cyprus to work as cabaret artistes (see paragraph 94 above). In subsequent reports, the Commissioner reiterated his concerns regarding the legislative framework, and in particular criticised the system whereby cabaret managers were required to make the application for an entry permit for the artiste as rendering the artiste dependent on her employer or agent and increasing her risk of falling into the hands of traffickers (see paragraph 100 above). In his 2008 report, the Commissioner criticised the artiste visa regime as making it very difficult for law enforcement authorities to take the necessary steps to combat trafficking, noting that the artiste permit could be perceived as contradicting the measures taken against trafficking or at least as rendering them ineffective (see also the report of the U.S. State Department at paragraphs 105 and 107 above). The Commissioner expressed regret that, despite concerns raised in previous reports and the Government ’ s commitment to abolish it, the artiste work permit was still in place (see paragraph 103 above). Similarly, the Ombudsman, in her 2003 report, blamed the artiste visa regime for the entry of thousands of young foreign women into Cyprus, where they were exploited by their employers under cruel living and working conditions (see paragraph 89 above)."

Further, the Court emphasises that while an obligation on employers to notify the authorities when an artiste leaves her employment (see paragraph 117 above) is a legitimate measure to allow the authorities to monitor the compliance of immigrants with their immigration obligations, responsibility for ensuring compliance and for taking steps in cases of non-compliance must remain with the authorities themselves. Measures which encourage cabaret owners and managers to track down missing artistes or in some other way to take personal responsibility for the conduct of artistes are unacceptable in the broader context of trafficking concerns regarding artistes in Cyprus. Against this backdrop, the Court considers that the practice of requiring cabaret owners and managers to lodge a bank guarantee to cover potential future costs associated with artistes which they have employed (see paragraph 115 above) particularly troubling. The separate bond signed in Ms Rantseva ’ s case is of equal concern (see paragraph 15 above), as is the unexplained conclusion of the AIS that M.A. was responsible for Ms Rantseva and was therefore required to come and collect her from the police station (see paragraph 20 above)."

First, it is clear from the Ombudsman ’ s 2003 report that here has been a serious problem in Cyprus since the 1970s involving young foreign women being forced to work in the sex industry (see paragraph 83 above). The report further noted the significant increase in artistes coming from former Soviet countries following the collapse of the USSR (see paragraph 84 above). In her conclusions, the Ombudsman highlighted that trafficking was able to flourish in Cyprus due to the tolerance of the immigration authorities (see paragraph 89 above). In his 2006 report, the Council of Europe ’ s Commissioner for Human Rights also noted that the authorities were aware that many of the women who entered Cyprus on artiste ’ s visas would work in prostitution (see paragraph 96 above). There can therefore be no doubt that the Cypriot authorities were aware that a substantial number of foreign women, particularly from the ex-USSR, were being trafficked to Cyprus on artistes visas and, upon arrival, were being sexually exploited by cabaret owners and managers."

In particular, under Article 10 of the Palermo Protocol, States undertake to provide or strengthen training for law enforcement, immigration and other relevant officials in the prevention of trafficking in persons. In the Court ’ s opinion, there were sufficient indicators available to the police authorities, against the general backdrop of trafficking issues in Cyprus, for them to have been aware of circumstances giving rise to a credible suspicion that Ms Rantseva was, or was at real and immediate risk of being, a victim of trafficking or exploitation.

They simply checked whether Ms Rantseva ’ s name was on a list of persons wanted by the police and, on finding that it was not, called her employer and asked him to return and collect her. When he refused and insisted that she be detained, the police officer dealing with the case put M.A. in contact with his superior (see paragraph 20 above).

In this regard, the Court highlights that the definition of trafficking adopted in both the Palermo Protocol and the Anti-Trafficking Convention expressly includes the recruitment of victims (see paragraphs 150 and 164 above). The need for a full and effective investigation covering all aspects of trafficking allegations from recruitment to exploitation is indisputable.

As to the applicability of Article 6 to inquest proceedings, the Court considers there is no criminal charge or civil right at stake for the applicant in the context of such proceedings.
