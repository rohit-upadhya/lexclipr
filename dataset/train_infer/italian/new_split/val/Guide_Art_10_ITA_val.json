In the present case, the applicant has chosen to be naked in public in order to give expression to his opinion as to the inoffensive nature of the human body (see paragraphs 55 and 147 above ). The Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant ’ s public nudity can be seen as a form of expression which falls within the ambit of Article 10 of the Convention and that his arrest, prosecution, conviction and detention constituted repressive measures taken in reaction to that form of expression of his opinions by the applicant. There has therefore been an interference with his exercise of his right to freedom of expression."

The appellant was walking along a public street in full view of anyone passing and he was completely naked with his private parts entirely on show. Such conduct would be severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people especially when it was being carried out in an ordinary public street. It might be different if he had been naked somewhere in private, even in a public place which was remote or where fewer people would be congregated, but in or near one of the main streets of a busy town his appearance in that state would be alarming.",

I came to the conclusion that the context in which the conduct was taking place – being naked in a brazen fashion in the public street with no attempt to cover himself and no obvious explanation or reason for the conduct – would cause serious disturbance to the community because of the reaction of ordinary people to his presence in that state in that place.

Equally, in our view, it is neither possible nor desirable to derive a comprehensive definition from a close analysis of the facts of individual cases in which it has been held that a breach of the peace had been committed ... [I]t is, in our view, clear that what is required to constitute the crime is conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community ... What is required, therefore, it seems to us, is conduct which does present as genuinely alarming and disturbing, in its context, to any reasonable person.",

The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection. States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see, amongst many authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

There exists a strong public interest in enabling such groups and individuals, outside the mainstream, to contribute to the public debate by disseminating information and ideas on matters of general public interest such as health and the environment ( Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 89, ECHR 2005-II and, mutatis mutandis, Bowman v. the United Kingdom, 19 February 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ I)."

It must also be borne in mind that, by virtue of the express terms of paragraph 2 of Article 10, whoever exercises his freedom of expression undertakes duties and responsibilities, the scope of which depends on his situation and the technical means he uses. These duties and responsibilities must be taken into account in the Court ’ s assessment of the necessity of the measure (see Handyside, cited above, § 49; and Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France, no. 71111/01, § 42, 14 June 2007 ). The Court has previously found that, in the context of religious opinions and beliefs, such duties and responsibilities may include an obligation to avoid as far as possible expressions that are gratuitously offensive to others and thus an infringement of their rights, and which therefore do not contribute to any form of public debate capable of furthering progress in human affairs. This being so, it said, it may be considered necessary in certain democratic societies to sanction or even prevent improper attacks on objects of religious veneration, provided always that the penalty imposed be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria, 20 September 1994, § 49, Series A no. 295 ‑ A )."

However, although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of people from minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 112, ECHR 1999-III; Leyla Şahin [GC], cited above, § 108; and Bayatyan v. Armenia ([GC], no. 23459/03, § 126, 7 July 2011 ). Pluralism and democracy must be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise, necessarily entailing various concessions on the part of individuals or groups of individuals, which are justified in order to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (see Leyla Şahin [GC], cited above, § 108; and Tănase v.

Respect by the State of the views of a minority by tolerating conduct which is not per se incompatible with the values of a democratic society or wholly outside the norms of conduct of such a society, far from creating unjust inequalities or discrimination, ensures cohesive and stable pluralism and promotes harmony and tolerance in society (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan, cited above, § 126)."

The fact that the applicant ’ s views on public nudity are shared by very few people is not, of itself, conclusive of the issue now before the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, § 63, Series A no. 44). As an individual intent on achieving greater acceptance of public nudity, the applicant is entitled to seek to initiate such a debate and there is a public interest in allowing him to do so. However, the issue of public nudity also raises moral and public- order considerations. The comparative data supplied by the Government show that even in the small number of States surveyed, the responses of the law and of the authorities to public nudity are far from uniform. In these circumstances, the applicable margin of appreciation in reacting to instances of public nudity, as opposed to regulating mere statements or arguments on the subject, is a wide one."

                "173. Turning to examine the approach to manifestations of public nudity in Scotland, the police and the Crown Office had discretion in deciding how to respond to such incidents, as demonstrated by the applicant ’ s own case. The measures taken against him were not the result of any blanket prohibition: each incident was considered on its facts and in light of the applicant ’ s own history of offending. Following his early arrests, he was generally released with no further action being pursued (see paragraphs 8 to 31 above). On the occasions when he was prosecuted, the courts demonstrated a similarly individualised approach. The applicant was only convicted after it had established at trial, on the basis of evidence as to his conduct in a particularly public place, that the offence of breach of the peace had been made out, namely that he had caused alarm to other people and serious disturbance to the community (see paragraph 101 above) On one occasion the Sheriff found on the prosecution evidence that there was no case to answer and three times the applicant was found not guilty, either following acceptance of a not guilty plea or after a trial of the facts (see paragraphs 19, 24, 36 and 48 above). Following the applicant ’ s 2011 trial, at which he also appeared naked (see paragraph 76 above), the Sheriff was satisfied that the applicant ’ s appearance naked on a public road outside HMP Perth was sufficiently severe to cause alarm to ordinary people and serious disturbance to the community (see paragraph 80 above). Although the applicant could have avoided arrest outside HMP Perth by complying with the police officers ’ request that he put on clothes, he refused to do so (see paragraph 75 above). The Sheriff commented that had the applicant appeared naked in a more remote place or in a place where fewer people would be congregated, rather than “in or near one of the main streets of a busy town ”, he might have reached a different conclusion (see paragraph 80 above)."

                "174. As to the severity of the sanctions, it is noteworthy that after his early convictions the applicant was either admonished (see paragraph 10 above) or received short sentences of imprisonment of between two weeks and three months (see, for example, paragraphs 11, 16 and 31 above). It was only after a number of convictions for public nudity that the courts began to impose more substantial custodial sentences on the applicant. Even then, efforts were made to reach a less severe penalty. When sentencing the applicant for breach of the peace in 2009, the Sheriff explored the possibility of a non-custodial sentence if the applicant would agree to wear clothes, and only imposed a one-year sentence when the applicant refused to accept a condition of remaining clothed (see paragraph 60 - 61 above). By the time of his 2011 conviction and sentence of 330 days, together with a requirement to serve in addition 237 days outstanding for a previous sentence (see paragraph 81 above), he had been arrested over thirty times for public nudity and convicted almost twenty times. In assessing the proportionality of the penalty imposed, the Court is therefore not concerned with the respondent State ’ s response to an individual incident of public nudity but with its response to the applicant ’ s persistent public nudity and his wilful and contumacious refusal to obey the law over a number of years (see for example the Sheriff ’ s comments as to sentence in respect of the June 2009 conviction at paragraphs 60 - 61 above)."

            [
                "175. It is true that by the time that the 2011 sentence was imposed, the applicant had already served a cumulative total of five years and three months in detention since 18 May 2006, on remand pending fifteen criminal prosecutions and post-conviction pursuant to twelve sentences of imprisonment, with only four days ’ spent at liberty during that period. At the point at which he subsequently left Scotland on 9 October 2012, he had spent almost six and a half consecutive years in prison with less than a dozen days at liberty throughout the entire period. The cumulative period of imprisonment in Scotland since 2003 for the repeated instances of his refusal to dress in public stands at over seven years. While the penalty imposed for each individual offence, taken on its own, is not such as to raise an issue under Article 10 in terms of lack of proportionality, the cumulative impact on the applicant of the measures taken by the respondent State, which was undeniably severe, is otherwise. However, the applicant ’ s own responsibility for the convictions and the sentences imposed cannot be ignored. In exercising his right to freedom of expression, he was in principle under a general duty to respect the country ’ s laws and to pursue his desire to bring about legislative or societal change in accordance with them (see, mutatis mutandis, Tănase, cited above, § 167). Many other avenues for the expression of his opinion on nudity or for initiating a public debate on the subject were open to the applicant. He was also under a duty, particularly in light of the fact that he was asking for tolerance in respect of his own conduct, to demonstrate tolerance of and sensibility to the views of other members of the public. However, the applicant appears to reject any suggestion that acceptance of public nudity may vary depending on the nature of the location and the presence of other members of the public. Without any demonstration of sensibility to the views of others and the behaviour that they might consider offensive, he insists upon his right to appear naked at all times and in all places, including in the courts, in the communal areas of prisons and on aeroplanes (see, for example, paragraphs 22, 29, 33, 53, 76 and 93 above)."

                "176. The applicant ’ s case is troubling, since his intransigence has led to his spending a substantial period of time in prison for what is – in itself – usually a relatively trivial offence (see paragraph 100 above). However, the applicant ’ s imprisonment is the consequence of his repeated violation of the criminal law in full knowledge of the consequences, through conduct which he knew full well not only goes against the standards of accepted public behaviour in any modern democratic society but also is liable to be alarming and morally and otherwise offensive to other, unwarned members of the public going about their ordinary business. Having regard to the considerations set out above and to the wide margin of appreciation, the Court finds that the reasons for the measures adopted by the police, the prosecuting authorities and the courts, and in particular those adopted in respect of his arrest in 2011, were “relevant and sufficient” and that the measures met a pressing social need in response to repeated anti-social conduct by the applicant. It cannot be said that the repressive measures taken in reaction to the particular, repeated form of expression chosen by the applicant to communicate his opinion on nudity were, even if considered cumulatively, disproportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued, namely the prevention of disorder and crime. In particular, Article 10 does not go so far as to enable individuals, even those sincerely convinced of the virtue of their own beliefs, to repeatedly impose their antisocial conduct on other, unwilling members of society and then to claim a disproportionate interference with the exercise of their freedom of expression when the State, in the performance of its duty to protect the public from public nuisances, enforces the law in respect of such deliberately repetitive antisocial conduct. Even though, cumulatively, the penalties imposed on the applicant undoubtedly did entail serious consequences for him, the Court cannot find in the circumstances of his case, having regard in particular to his own responsibility for his plight, that the public authorities in Scotland unjustifiably interfered with his exercise of freedom of expression.

In general terms, it secures to the individual a sphere within which he can freely pursue the development and fulfilment of his personality (see Sidabras and Džiautas v.

The notion of private life also protects a right to identity and to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. There is, therefore, a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of “private life” (see P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 56, ECHR 2001-IX; Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ I; Perry v. the United Kingdom, no. 63737/00, § 36, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX (extracts); and Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, no. 4158/05, § 61, ECHR 2010 (extracts))."

However, the fact that behaviour is prohibited by the criminal law is not sufficient to bring it outside the scope of “private life” (see A.D.T. v. the United Kingdom, no. 35765/97, § 23, ECHR 2000 ‑ IX; and Pay v. the United Kingdom (dec.). no. 32792/05, 16 September 2003).

The applicant, by deliberately and consistently appearing naked in very public places such as urban centres, courtrooms and the communal parts of prisons, was intent on making a public statement of his belief in the inoffensive nature of the human body. The Court has found that his conduct amounted to a form of expression protected by Article 10 (see paragraph 150 ). It has previously indicated that a distinction must be drawn between carrying out an activity for personal fulfilment and carrying out the same activity for a public purpose, where one cannot be said to be acting for personal fulfilment alone (see Friend and Others, cited above, § 42). Furthermore, as concerns in particular an individual ’ s personal choices as to his desired appearance in public (as referred to in S.A.S., cited above), on analogy with the applicability of Article 9 of the Convention to religious beliefs (text of Article 9 cited below at paragraph 185 ), Article 8 cannot be taken to protect every conceivable personal choice in that domain: there must presumably be a de minimis level of seriousness as to the choice of desired appearance in question (see, mutatis mutandis, in relation to Article 9, Bayatyan, cited above, § 110; and Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 48420/10, § 81, ECHR 2013 (extracts) ). Whether the requisite level of seriousness has been reached in relation to the applicant ’ s choice to appear fully naked on all occasions in all public places without distinction may be doubted, having regard to the absence of support for such a choice in any known democratic society in the world. In any event, however, even if Article 8 were to be taken to be applicable to the circumstances of the present case, the Court is satisfied that those circumstances are not such as to disclose a violation of that provision on the part of the public authorities in Scotland. In sum, any interference with the applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life was justified under Article 8 § 2 for essentially the same reasons given by the Court in the context of its analysis of the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 10 of the Convention (see paragraphs 171 - 176 above ).",

By a judgment of 17 July 2008 the Tartu Administrative Court upheld the applicant ’ s complaint in respect of the Internet site www.coe.ee and ordered Tartu Prison to grant him supervised access to that site via a computer adapted for that purpose. The Administrative Court noted that Tartu Prison had afforded its detainees access to the online version of Riigi Teataja, the database of judicial decisions, and the Internet sites of the European Court of Human Rights and the Supreme Court. The Administrative Court further referred to the Supreme Court ’ s judgment of 31 May 2007 (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above) and to section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act ( Vangistusseadus ) (see paragraph 21 below), which had entered into force on 1 June 2008.

The Administrative Court considered that the burden of having the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights translated into Estonian could not be placed on the applicant and concluded that he also had to be granted access to the Internet site www.coe.ee. It considered that this Internet site was similar to the database of judicial decisions referred to in section 31 -1 of the Imprisonment Act.

Thus, the Supreme Court had to determine whether that provision was in conformity with the Constitution. The Supreme Court found that section 31 - 1 of the Imprisonment Act interfered with the right – enshrined in Article 44 § 1 of the Constitution – to freely obtain information disseminated for public use. It noted that the aims of imprisonment included the protection of the legal order and steering detainees towards law-abiding behaviour. As the possibility could not be technically excluded that detainees might misuse the right to use the Internet, access to the Internet was prohibited to them by section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act. The exception made in respect of the official databases of legislation and the database of judicial decisions was necessary in order to ensure that detainees were afforded an effective possibility to protect their own rights. It had to be taken into account that the official texts of legal acts were only accessible to detainees via the Internet."

            [
                "16. The Supreme Court observed that the prohibition of the use of the Internet was necessary primarily in order to restrict detainees ’ ability to engage in communication for purposes that did not accord with those of their detention, such as obtaining information that could jeopardise the prison ’ s security or run counter to the directing of detainees towards law-abiding behaviour. Granting detainees access to any additional Internet site increased the security risk of their obtaining information running contrary to the aims of imprisonment. Moreover, this could create an opportunity for detainees to use the Internet for purposes other than that of freely obtaining information disseminated for public use. Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that the prohibition of detainees ’ access to the Internet sites www.coe.ee, www.oiguskantsler.ee and www.riigikogu.ee was justified by the need to achieve the aims of imprisonment and in particular the need to secure public safety."
            ],
            [
                "17. In respect of the proportionality of the restriction the Supreme Court considered that the denial of detainees ’ access to the Internet sites www.coe.ee, www.oiguskantsler.ee and www.riigikogu.ee prevented them from misusing the Internet via these sites and that public safety was thereby protected. Moreover, granting detainees access to these Internet sites could increase the risk of their engaging in prohibited communication; this in turn would necessitate increased levels of control (and therefore costs). Thus, there were no alternative, equally effective means – besides the prohibition imposed by section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act – of achieving the legitimate aim in question. Lastly, the Supreme Court noted that detainees were able to contact the Riigikogu and the Chancellor of Justice by mail and make a request for information ( teabenõue ). Therefore, detainees ’ access to the public information contained on the Internet sites in question was not unduly restricted. Detainees ’ access to the Internet site of the European Court of Human Rights was guaranteed, pursuant to section 31-1 of the Imprisonment Act; those of the Council of Europe ’ s conventions and treaties that had been ratified by Estonia were accessible on the Internet site www.riigiteataja.ee. The Supreme Court noted that it did not doubt that the printed works of the Council of Europe were accessible through prison libraries, and nor were detainees prevented from contacting the Council of Europe by post. The Supreme Court concluded that the restriction preventing detainees from accessing the Internet sites www.oiguskantsler.ee, www.riigikogu.ee and www.coe.ee was one of “ low intensity ”; the Supreme Court gave more weight to the aim sought by that restriction. It considered that permitting detainees extensive use of the Internet would increase the likelihood of prison authorities losing control over detainees ’ activities, as it could not be completely excluded that via the Internet sites in question detainees could use the Internet for other, unauthorised purposes. Accordingly, the impugned restriction was in conformity with the Constitution."

                "18. Four judges out of eighteen delivered a dissenting opinion according to which the applicant should have been granted access to all three of the Internet sites in question. They considered that the use of the Internet sites in question did not generally pose a threat to public safety and was in conformity with the aims of imprisonment. It was unclear what additional costs the State would have to bear, since – in line with the applicable law – prisons were equipped with computers specially adapted to allow detainees access to the official databases of legislation and judicial decisions, and the prison service exercised supervision over the use of such resources. The information available on the Internet sites in question aided the exercising of the right of recourse to the courts. While it was true that detainees could also avail themselves of the right to make a request for information, this was a more time-consuming avenue and, particularly in the case of the Internet site of the Chancellor of Justice, required knowledge of which information was available on such Internet sites. No request for information under the Public Information Act ( Avaliku teabe seadus ) could be made to the Council of Europe Information Office in Tallinn. The rulings of the European Court of Human Rights available in the HUDOC database – which was accessible to detainees – were not in Estonian ( unlike the unofficial translations published on the Internet site www.coe.ee ), and it could not be presumed that detainees had sufficient command of English or French to be able to read them. The printed works of the Council of Europe that were available in prison libraries did not include all the information that was published on the Internet site of the Council of Europe Information Office in Tallinn. Thus, the four dissenting judges concluded that the restriction in question was unconstitutional."

Thus, granting prisoners access to additional websites would increase the risk that they might obtain information prejudicial to the realisation of the objectives of imprisonment. The effort needed to reduce the risks arising from such additional access – such risks could not be completely eliminated – would be excessive in comparison with the benefits gained by granting prisoners wider access to the Internet.

Within this field, it has developed case-law in relation to press freedom, the purpose of which is to impart information and ideas on such matters. The Court has also found that the function of creating forums for public debate is not limited to the press. That function may also be exercised by non-governmental organisations, the activities of which are an essential element of informed public debate (see, for example, Österreichische Vereinigung zur Erhaltung, Stärkung und Schaffung v.

It considers that Article 10 cannot be interpreted as imposing a general obligation to provide access to the Internet, or to specific Internet sites, for prisoners.

By contrast, the applicant was of the opinion that allowing access to three more websites ( in addition to those already authorised ) would not have given rise to any additional security issues. Possible security issues were already effectively managed by the Ministry of Justice, which blocked any links or other such features on already authorised websites that could cause security concerns; there was no reason, according to the applicant, why this should be different in the case of the three requested additional websites."

The Court notes that the websites of the Council of Europe Information Office in Tallinn, the Chancellor of Justice, and the Riigikogu, to which the applicant wished to have access, predominantly contained legal information and information related to fundamental rights, including the rights of prisoners. For example, the website of the Riigikogu contained bills together with explanatory memoranda to them, verbatim records of the sittings of the Riigikogu, and minutes of committee sittings. The website of the Chancellor of Justice (who is also an ombudsman in Estonia) contained his selected legal opinions. The Court considers that the accessibility of such information promotes public awareness and respect for human rights and gives weight to the applicant ’ s argument that the Estonian courts used such information and the applicant needed access to it for the protection of his rights in the court proceedings. The Court has also taken note of the applicant ’ s argument that legal research in the form of browsing through available information (in order to find relevant information) and making specific requests for information were different matters and that the websites were meant for legal researches rather than making specific requests. Indeed, in order to make a specific request one would need to be aware of which particular information is available in the first place. The Court also notes that the domestic authorities have referred to alternative means of making available to the applicant the information stored on the websites in question (for example, by mail – see paragraph 17 above), but did not compare the costs of these alternative means with the additional costs that extended Internet access would allegedly incur."

The Court notes, in this connection, that when the applicant lodged his complaint with the domestic courts, the Estonian translations and summaries of the Court ’ s judgments were only available on the website of the Council of Europe Information Office and it was only later that this information was published elsewhere – in the online version of Riigi Teataja (see paragraph 40 above)."

Internet access has increasingly been understood as a right, and calls have been made to develop effective policies to attain universal access to the Internet and to overcome the “digital divide” (see paragraphs 23 to 25 above). The Court considers that these developments reflect the important role the Internet plays in people ’ s everyday lives. Indeed, an increasing amount of services and information is only available on the Internet, as evidenced by the fact that in Estonia the official publication of legal acts effectively takes place via the online version of Riigi Teataja and no longer through its paper version (see paragraph 7 above). The Court reiterates that the online version of Riigi Teataja also currently carries Estonian summaries and Estonian translations of the Court ’ s judgments (see paragraph 40 above)."

Lastly, the Court reiterates that under the Imprisonment Act the prisoners have been granted limited access to the Internet via computers specially adapted for that purpose and under the supervision of the prison authorities. Thus, the Court observes that arrangements necessary for the use of the Internet by prisoners have in any event been made and the related costs have been borne by the authorities. While the security and economic considerations cited by the domestic authorities may be considered as relevant, the Court notes that the domestic courts undertook no detailed analysis as to the security risks allegedly emerging from the access to the three additional websites in question, also having regard to the fact that these were websites of State authorities and of an international organisation. The Supreme Court limited its analysis on this point to a rather general statement that granting access to additional Internet sites could increase the risk of detainees engaging in prohibited communication, thus giving rise to the need for increased levels of monitoring. The Court also considers that the Supreme Court and the Government have failed to convincingly demonstrate that giving the applicant access to three additional websites would have caused any noteworthy additional costs. In these circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that sufficient reasons have been put forward in the present case to justify the interference with the applicant ’ s right to receive information."

Since its creation in August 2007 and the public swearing in of several hundred new members in October 2007, the Hungarian Guard has organised numerous public rallies throughout the country, including in villages with large Roma populations; despite apparently innocuous articles of association, amongst the group’s chief messages is the defence of ethnic Hungarians against so-called “Gypsy crime”.

The Constitutional Court, appreciating the historical origins of the Federal Republic of Germany, upheld, in derogation from the principle of priority, the restriction of the earlier announced demonstration in favour of a commemorating assembly on the concerned location with special regard to the anniversary of the surrender in World War II."

Black, 538 U.S. 343 (2003), in the context of cross burning (a traditional threatening activity of the Klu Klux Klan). According to this judgment, the burning of a cross is a “symbol of hate”, regardless of whether the message is a political one or also meant to intimidate. And while cross-burning sometimes carries no intimidating message, at other times the intimidating message is the only message conveyed. The protections afforded by the First Amendment are not absolute, and the government may regulate certain categories of expression, including the ban of a “true threat”. Intimidation, in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word, is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. The fact that cross-burning is a symbolic expression does not resolve the constitutional question. Sometimes the cross-burning is a statement of ideology, a symbol of group solidarity. The Supreme Court required effort to distinguish among these different types of cross-burnings and considered the contextual factors that were necessary to decide whether a particular cross-burning was intended to intimidate. The Supreme Court went on to state:",

Under section 11(2) of the Assembly Act, the police were empowered to remove from the venue those who disturbed the assembly. In the course of securing an assembly, a police officer might, upon the well-founded suspicion of an administrative or criminal offence, apprehend the perpetrator; under section 142(2) b) of Act no.

It could be expected that one group might intend to disturb the other assembly, and therefore the endeavour of the police to prevent any clashes between the participants in the two assemblies had been well-founded.

In fact, the police had acted to protect a lawful demonstration whose participants should have been able to hold the demonstration without having to fear that they would be subjected to physical violence by their opponents.

In cases such as the present one, which require the right to freedom of assembly to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression and, allegedly, against the right of others to freedom of assembly, the Court considers that the outcome of its scrutiny should not, in theory, vary according to whether the case has been lodged by a “demonstrator” or a “counter-demonstrator”. Accordingly, the margin of appreciation afforded to the national authorities should in principle be the same in both cases. Where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court’s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts as long as an overall, optimal balance between the competing rights has been achieved (see, mutatis mutandis, Von Hannover v.

The Court would add that a demonstration may annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote. The participants must, however, be able to hold the demonstration without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents; such a fear would be liable to deter associations or other groups supporting common ideas or interests from openly expressing their opinions on highly controversial issues affecting the community.

The MSZP demonstration was intended, among other things, to protest against intolerant views held by the extreme right-wing movements which often avails itself of Árpád -striped or similar flags, as observed by the European Committee against Racism and Intolerance (see paragraph 15 above). The applicant’s decision to display that flag in the vicinity of the MSZP demonstration must be regarded as his way of expressing – by way of a symbol – his political views, namely a disagreement with the ideas of the MSZP demonstrators.

Hungary, no. 33629/06, § 53, ECHR–2008).

Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 62, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV).

The Court does not exclude that the display of a contextually ambiguous symbol at the specific site of mass murders may in certain circumstances express identification with the perpetrators of those crimes; it is for this reason that even otherwise protected expression is not equally permissible in all places and all times. In certain countries with a traumatic historical experience comparable to that of Hungary, a ban on demonstrations – to be held on a specific day of remembrance – which are offensive to the memory of the victims of totalitarianism who perished at a given site may be considered to represent a pressing social need. The need to protect the rights to honour of the murdered and the piety rights of their relatives may necessitate an interference with the right to freedom of expression, and it might be legitimate when the particular place and time of the otherwise protected expression unequivocally changes the meaning of a certain display. Similar considerations apply if the expression, because of its timing and place, amounts to the glorification of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide (see Garaudy v. France (dec.), no. 65831/01, ECHR 2003–IX (extracts)).

In their view, that had been the result not only of A.C. ’ s gambling activities, but also of the fact that he had tried to negotiate with the applicant company ’ s reporters to present the incident differently. The applicant company ’ s attorneys further argued that the use of a hidden camera had been exceptional and had been resorted to following the receipt of information that could not have been verified otherwise, as nobody would have believed the journalists ’ allegations if they had reported on the issue without broadcasting the images. It can also be seen from the minutes that the members of the National Radio and Television Council expressed their disagreement regarding the use of a hidden camera, arguing that if anyone were able to use a hidden camera by claiming that there was an overriding public interest in doing so, then all citizens – especially if they were public figures – would be exposed to the possibility of being subject to pressure and extortion.

The Supreme Administrative Court laid down the conditions under which it is legitimate to broadcast an image that has been filmed with the method of hidden camera, by making a distinction between reporting on specific news, whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means, and the broadcasting of the relevant, secretly recorded image. According to that reasoning, recording by secret means an image which has as its main or only subject a specific person constitutes in principle a violation of that person ’ s right to his own image, which is protected by Articles 9 § 1 of the Constitution and 8 § 1 of the Convention, as a specific aspect of the right to respect for one ’ s private life. Consequently, the broadcasting on television of news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means cannot, in principle, be considered as constituting the legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, given that the disseminated news has been received under circumstances which constitute a violation of an individual ’ s right to his own image. Nevertheless, in certain cases it may be considered justified to broadcast such news, on account of its contribution to a debate of general interest and taking into account the secretly recorded person ’ s position or standing. However, even when broadcasting of the news is considered a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, this does not automatically render legitimate the broadcasting of the relevant, secretly recorded images, as that constitutes a much more intense [ έντονος ] limitation of the constitutionally protected right of that person to his own image than the simple transmission of news. In the domestic court ’ s view, broadcasting of a secretly recorded image can only be justified if the legitimate (for the reasons mentioned above) broadcasting of such news is completely impossible or particularly difficult without broadcasting the image that was recorded by hidden means and which constitutes the source of the news."

Given that, pursuant to Articles 2 § 1, 15 § 2 and 25 § 1 of the Constitution, the protection of human dignity is absolute, the broadcasting of such news is always forbidden, irrespective of whether such a broadcast includes the image in question. For those reasons, the judges who supported this opinion considered that the application for annulment should be dismissed."

According to the first one, in view of the fact that the National Radio and Television Council had considered that the broadcasting of news that had been recorded by secret means had constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, the same considerations should be extended to the broadcasting of the relevant image. The reason for this was the special nature of television, in comparison with the other media, owing to which the broadcasting of the image went hand-in-hand with broadcasting the news itself. Therefore, the application for annulment should have been allowed, given that the National Radio and Television Council ’ s decision had been based solely on the fact that the image of A.C. had been recorded by hidden means, without considering whether broadcasting news whose source was the above images constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information."
            ],
            [
                "18. Lastly, according to the other dissenting opinion, no constitutional provision justified the absolute protection of an image ( as was held by the majority ). A person ’ s right to his own image was susceptible to limitations that varied according to that person ’ s position and the space in which the recording in question had taken place. For individuals, protection against the recording of their image without their consent was absolute, irrespective of whether it took place in a public or private space, unless the recording was not directed to them or the recording of the image took place with a view to the prevention of crimes in public space. For public figures, however, protection was less absolute. In particular, public figures, such as politicians, were exposed to publicity and sometimes they even pursued it. As a result, there was a legitimate expectation on the part of the media and of the public to impart and receive information regarding their public activities. For these persons, there was an absolute protection of their image in their private space and in public spaces in which they shared private or family moments. When, however, public figures were in public spaces but not under the conditions described above, or acted in a way that was of interest to the public (such as in cases in which they engaged in behaviour contrary to what their public role entailed or contrary to the image they projected towards the public ), then the right to receive and impart information could justify the recording of that person without his consent and the broadcasting of the relevant images by the media. In this regard, the dissenting judges argued that it would be inconceivable to equate radio with television, as they did not operate on the same way; therefore, it would not be possible for a television show to simply announce the news without broadcasting the relevant images, as would be the case on the radio. In respect of legitimately recorded images, when there is a balance between transparency and the right to receive information on the one hand and the protection of a person ’ s image on the other hand, the presumption should be that the recorded image could be broadcast without consent. In view of the above, the four judges considered that the application for annulment should be allowed, taking into account especially the fact that A.C. was a public figure, that the recording of his image had taken place in a public space ( that is to say in a gambling arcade ), and that the broadcasting of the relevant images had served the purpose of informing the public of behaviour on the part of a member of Parliament that did not meet the requirements of his position. Therefore, the television channel ’ s decision to broadcast the image as a part of the television shows, which otherwise could be considered unfounded or even defamatory, had not breached the proportionality principle."

The applicant company maintained that the decision of the National Radio and Television Council to impose administrative sanctions on it on account of the three videos that had been filmed with a hidden camera and broadcast in two of its television shows had violated its right to freedom of expression. In particular, the applicant company argued that the fines imposed on it, specifically EUR 100,000 in respect of each of the two television shows during which the videos had been broadcast – as well as the obligation to broadcast the content of the above-mentioned decision – had interfered with its right to freedom of expression and in particular with its right to impart information."

The applicant company argued that the images recorded by the use of a hidden camera concerned the behaviour of a public figure who had been at the time a member of the Hellenic Parliament and chairman of the inter-party committee on the widespread use of electronic gambling. Therefore his participation in gambling games had been a matter of public interest in the light of A.C. ’ s public role and could have affected his duties as a member of parliament and as chairman of the parliamentary committee on electronic gambling. Viewers had had the right to learn the truth about an elected deputy. In any event, electronic gambling had been a matter of general interest in Greece at the time as many citizens had been financially destroyed owing to their participation in similar games. That had been the reason why the two television shows had prepared the broadcasts in question. In view of the above, the broadcasting of videos that had been filmed by the use of a hidden camera had been necessary, and A.C. ’ s right to private life had been outweighed by the applicant company ’ s right to impart information concerning a matter of public interest. Both the National Radio and Television Council ( which had imposed the administrative sanctions ) and the Supreme Administrative Court ( which had dismissed the application for annulment ) had failed in the present case to strike a fair balance between the applicant company ’ s right under Article 10 and A.C. ’ s right under Article 8 of the Convention."

In particular, A.C. had appeared to request that the journalists present the incident as if he had been gambling in order to experiment within the context of his parliamentary duties; in exchange he offered to appear live on the television shows. In the applicant company ’ s view, such behaviour on the part of a public figure had had to be exposed; therefore, the broadcasting of that video had been necessary and had fulfilled part of the applicant company ’ s duty to inform the public, pursuant to Article 10 of the Convention."

The same considerations applied to the second video; the sanctions had been imposed because of the broadcasting of the images and not because of the transmission of the news of the meeting that had taken place between A.C. and the television station ’ s reporters."

Additionally, the Government asserted that any interference with the applicant company ’ s right to impart information had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and reputation of others – specifically A.C. ’ s right to private life, as protected under Article 8 of the Convention."

In respect of the necessity of the alleged interference, the Government stressed that all three videos had been filmed by illegitimate means, namely a hidden camera, without the consent and knowledge of A.C. and in violation of the relevant legislation. In addition, the images on all three videos, as well as the filmed conversations of A.C. with journalists on the second and third videos, had breached criminal law and in particular Article 370A § 2 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, the applicant company had been aware that it had breached all the above-mentioned provisions of domestic legislation by filming and broadcasting the impugned videos. In the Government ’ s view, the applicant company had not advanced any argument as to why the broadcasting of the videos had been necessary and why it had not been sufficient to merely broadcast the news without showing the videos that had been recorded in violation of A.C. ’ s right to his own image. The videos had not contributed to a public debate but had merely satisfied the public ’ s curiosity and had been used as a means of securing higher ratings for the programmes; this could not have been considered a legitimate reason for violating A.C. ’ s right to his own image. In view of the above, the National Radio and Television Council – which considered that the applicant company could have broadcast the news but not the videos that had been the source of the news and had consequently imposed sanctions on the applicant company – had not erred but had struck a fair balance between the rights protected under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention. Referring to the Court ’ s case-law ( Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, §§ 72-73, ECHR 2016), the Government argued that the sanction imposed had constituted an exercise of the positive obligation arising from Article 8 in order to effectively protect A.C. ’ s right to his own image. In addition, it had been in accordance with the Court ’ s case-law, which made clear that the wide protection afforded to the press did not mean that journalists were not obliged to respect national legislation and the Code on Journalistic Ethics. The alleged interference had addressed a pressing social need – namely that in a democratic society dialogue should be conducted without the use of means which harmed the reputation and image of individuals unless such means contributing to a public debate."

In addition, national legislation provided for far more severe sanctions than the ones imposed on the applicant company.",

                "45. The Court notes that account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interests involved. Because of their direct, continuous contact with the realities of the country, a State ’ s courts are in a better position than an international court to determine how, at a given time, the right balance can be struck. For this reason, in matters under Article 10 of the Convention, the Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity and scope of any interference in the freedom of expression protected by that Article in particular when a balance has to be struck between conflicting private interests (see, among other authorities, Palomo Sánchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06, 28957/06, 28959/06 and 28964/06, § 54, ECHR 2011). However, this margin goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it – even those delivered by an independent court. In exercising its supervisory function, the Court ’ s task is not to take the place of the national courts, but rather to review, in the light of the case as a whole, whether the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provisions of the Convention relied on. If the balance struck by the national judicial authorities is unsatisfactory, in particular because the importance or the scope of one of the fundamental rights at stake was not duly considered, the margin of appreciation accorded to the decisions of the national courts will be a narrow one (see Aksu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 4149/04 and 41029/04, § 67, ECHR 2012 ). Where, however, the exercise of striking a balance between two conflicting rights was undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court ’ s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, §§ 104 ‑ 107, and Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés, cited above, §§ 90-92)."

Accordingly, although freedom of expression also extends to the publication of photographs, the Court recalls that this is an area in which the protection of the rights of others takes on particular importance, especially where the images contain very personal and intimate “information” about an individual or where they are taken on private premises and clandestinely through the use of secret recording devices (see Von Hannover, cited above, § 59; Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS ) v.

Turning to whether the report in question was capable of contributing to the public debate at issue (see Stoll, cited above, § 121, ECHR 2007 ‑ V), the Court observes that the report in question was not without political import. In particular, it could arouse the interest of the public with regard to the conduct of an elected representative vis-à-vis electronic gambling who, additionally, was chairman of an inter-party committee on electronic gambling.",

The Court reiterates that the role or function of the person concerned and the nature of the activities that are the subject of the news report and/or photograph constitute another important criterion to be taken into consideration (see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 110, and Axel Springer, cited above, § 91). The extent to which an individual has a public profile or is well-known influences the protection that may be afforded to his or her private life. Thus, the Court has acknowledged on numerous occasions that the public was entitled to be informed about certain aspects of the private life of public figures (see, inter alia, Karhuvaara and Iltalehti v. Finland, no. 53678/00, § 45, ECHR 2004 ‑ X)."

Nevertheless, in certain circumstances, even where a person is known to the general public, he or she may rely on a “legitimate expectation” of protection of and respect for his or her private life (see, inter alia, Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 97). Thus, the fact that an individual belongs to the category of public figures cannot in any way, even in the case of persons exercising official functions, authorise the media to violate the professional and ethical principles which must govern their actions, or legitimise intrusions into private life (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés, cited above, § 122)."

                "55. In the present case, the Court notes that A.C., as a member of Parliament and the chairman of the inter-party committee on electronic gambling, was undeniably a prominent political figure. The domestic authorities ought therefore to have considered the extent to which this prominence and those public functions were capable of influencing the protection which could be afforded to his private life ( ibid., § 124). The Court notes that the domestic authorities did not explicitly address this point. In fact, the National Radio and Television Council in its decision made no reference to A.C. ’ s public functions but merely referred to the relevant legislative provisions which provide the general protection of the right to private life and one ’ s right to one ’ s own image. The Supreme Administrative Court, however, stated that an exception could be made to the principle of the protection of private life whenever the facts disclosed could give rise to a debate on account of their impact, in the light of the status or position of the person concerned (see paragraph 14 above), although it drew no conclusion from that consideration in so far as broadcasting the impugned videos was concerned. Nevertheless, the Court considers that it can be derived from the domestic authorities ’ conclusions, notably that the news whose source was the videos that had been recorded with a hidden camera could legitimately be broadcast, those authorities took into account A.C. ’ s public functions (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 3), no. 8772/10, § 55, 19 September 2013). The Court therefore concludes that this element was sufficiently taken into account by the domestic authorities when striking a balance between the competing interests."

As regards the subject of the report, the Court notes that from the parties ’ arguments, as well as from the minutes of the hearing that took place before the National Radio and Television Council, where the applicant company ’ s attorneys admitted that the reporters had made use of a hidden camera following their receipt of specific information, it follows that the report focused on the behaviour of A.C. and not on a general discussion of electronic gambling (contrast Haldimann and Others, cited above, § 60). This is corroborated by the fact that all three videos were focused on A.C. and his reaction to the first video, which showed him entering a gambling arcade and gambling on electronic machines. Both the National Radio and Television Council and the Supreme Administrative Court accepted that the report concerning A.C. ’ s behaviour could be legitimately broadcast; nevertheless, they made a distinction between the news, whose source had been the videos recorded by hidden camera, and the broadcasting of the videos themselves."

                "57. The Court shares the domestic authorities ’ position. As regards the distinction made between the report on the one hand and the broadcasting of the videos on the other hand, the Court notes that its own case-law acknowledges that the protection of the rights and reputation of others takes on particular importance in the context of the publication of photographs which may contain very personal or even intimate information (see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 103, and Eerikäinen and Others, cited above, § 70). The same considerations apply – even more so – to the broadcasting of videos, since the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media (see Jersild, cited above, § 31). Therefore, even taking into account the special features of television, there can be no objection to distinguishing between reporting on specific news and the broadcasting of a video (see, mutatis mutandis, MGN Limited v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 148-156; Verlagsgruppe News GmbH and Bobi v. Austria, no. 59631/09, § 82, 4 December 2012; and Société de conception de presse et d ’ édition v. France, no. 4683/11, § 41, 25 February 2016), even though undoubtedly the broadcasting of the video added credibility to the account of events given in the report (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés, cited above, § 148).",

In the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the material in the case file is not in itself sufficient to enable it to take cognisance of or examine A.C. ’ s previous conduct with regard to the media. Moreover, the mere fact that a person has cooperated with the press on previous occasions cannot serve as an argument for depriving that person discussed in an article of all protection (see Egeland and Hanseid v. Norway, no. 34438/04, § 62, 16 April 2009). An individual ’ s alleged or real previous tolerance or accommodation with regard to publications touching on his or her private life does not necessarily deprive that individual of the right to privacy (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés, cited above, § 130).",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the protection afforded by Article 10 of the Convention to journalists is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information, in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism (see, mutatis mutandis, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], cited above, § 65; Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ I; Kasabova v.

However, the concept of responsible journalism, as a professional activity which enjoys the protection of Article 10 of the Convention, is not confined to the contents of information which is collected and/or disseminated by journalistic means. That concept also embraces, inter alia, the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist, including his or her public interaction with the authorities when exercising journalistic functions. The fact that a journalist has breached the law in that connection is a most relevant, albeit not decisive, consideration when determining whether he or she has acted responsibly (see Pentikäinen, cited above, § 90)."
            ],
            [
                "61. The Court reiterates in this context that journalists who exercise their freedom of expression undertake “duties and responsibilities” (see Stoll, cited above, § 102, and Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49 in fine, Series A no. 24). It will be recalled in this connection that paragraph 2 of Article 10 does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression, even with respect to media coverage of matters of serious public concern. In particular, and notwithstanding the vital role played by the media in a democratic society, journalists cannot, in principle, be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that, as journalists, Article 10 affords them a cast-iron defence (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Stoll, cited above, § 102; Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § 65; and Monnat v. Switzerland, no. 73604/01, § 66, ECHR 2006-X). In other words, a journalist cannot claim exclusive immunity from criminal liability for the sole reason that, unlike other individuals exercising the right to freedom of expression, the offence in question was committed during the performance of his or her journalistic functions (see Pentikäinen, cited above, § 91)."

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that both parties agreed in substance that the use of a hidden camera was not absolutely prohibited in domestic law, but that it could be accepted, subject to strict conditions. It was not disputed among the parties that pursuant to Article 9 § 1 of the Code on Journalistic Ethics, the use of this technique was permitted only where there was an overriding public interest in the dissemination of the relevant information, provided that the collection of the information did not violate a person ’ s dignity. The Court has already established that the report concerned a matter of public interest.

Therefore, the applicant company ’ s employees recorded the first video in a public space – that is to say a place accessible to anyone. By contrast, the second video was recorded in unknown premises and showed journalists of the television show projecting the first video to A.C.

In the Court ’ s view, however, there are significant differences between the circumstances under which the first video was filmed on the one hand and those under which the second and third videos were filmed on the other hand. Without a doubt, the use of a hidden camera in this case raises serious issues under the relevant Greek legislation in respect of all three videos. Nevertheless, the fact that the first video was filmed in a public space in which anyone could have taken a photograph or – as in the instant case – filmed a video of the member of the Parliament is a factor that should have been taken into consideration by the domestic authorities when assessing the journalists ’ conduct. The Court has previously considered in cases falling under the scope of Article 8, albeit in a different context, that on occasions when people knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which are or may be recorded or reported in a public manner, a person ’ s reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although not necessarily conclusive, factor (see P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 57, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX)."

On the contrary, as regards the second and third videos, the Court considers that, in light of the clear position under Greek criminal law, A.C. was entitled to have an expectation of privacy as he entered private spaces with a view to discussing the recorded incidents and for his conversations not to be recorded without his explicit consent. In this connection, the Court considers that the journalists of the applicant company did not act in good faith in their meetings with A.C., who would have been entitled to feel deceived. The Court also notes that the National Radio and Television Council emphasised that the second and third videos were recorded by the journalists with a view to exercising pressure on A.C. and the applicant company did not adduce any argument to rebut this, other than claiming that recording A.C. with a hidden camera had been necessary, as he would never have consented to being filmed."

In addition, as the Government pointed out, the journalists working in the applicant company breached criminal law and in particular Article 370A § 2 of the Criminal Code, which protects the confidentiality of conversations. In the Court ’ s view, the journalists of the television show, as professionals, must have been aware of the relevant legislative provisions and should have been aware that at that time they were in breach not only of professional ethics but also of criminal law. Therefore, such a breach can only be regarded as deliberate, irrespective of the veracity of the relevant information ( which was not disputed )."

The Court also notes that the National Radio and Television Council based its decision on the above-mentioned considerations and accordingly sanctioned the applicant company for its use of a hidden camera which resulted in an interference with A.C. ’ s right to his own image. From the minutes of the meeting it can also be seen that the Council attached significant weight to the “ entrapment ” of A.C. (see § 7 above). The same considerations apply to the Supreme Administrative Court which, without questioning the legitimacy of broadcasting news whose source had consisted of the impugned videos, ruled that the applicant company had acted in breach of the Code on Journalistic Ethics, which provided for the use of direct and legitimate means when one exercised the right to impart information (compare Tierbefreier e.V. v. Germany, no. 45192/09, §§ 52  56, 16 January 2014). The Supreme Administrative Court emphasised the fact that the applicant company had not put forward any argument as to why it had been necessary to broadcast the videos that had been filmed without the knowledge and consent of A.C. In the Court ’ s view, the domestic authorities ’ conclusion that the applicant company overstepped the limits of responsible journalism is not unreasonable, at least in so far as the second and third videos are concerned. In this connection, the Court attaches some weight to the fact that the applicant company had already been sanctioned for the same offence in the past. However, as regards the first video, the Court considers that the domestic authorities failed to take into consideration in their assessment the fact that it was filmed in a public place, an element which, in the Court ’ s view, weakens the legitimacy of any expectation of privacy A.C. might have had when he entered the gambling arcade."

In that case, the Court took into account the fact that the applicants had taken every measure to protect the broker ’ s image by pixellating his image and altering his voice. In the present case, however, it is clear that the applicant company made no effort to compensate for the intrusion into A.C. ’ s private life; on the contrary, his conduct had been the central subject matter of the videos, while the conduct of the journalists in the present case suggests that the breach of the Code on Journalistic Ethics and of the Criminal Code was deliberate."

On the basis of the above- mentioned considerations, it imposed on the applicant company the relevant sanctions, namely EUR 100,000 euros in respect of each of the two television shows during which the impugned videos were broadcast and the obligation to disseminate the content of the decision. The Supreme Administrative Court upheld the relevant sanctions, considering that they were proportionate and that the lack of specific details regarding the number of viewers or the size of the investment the applicant company had made did not have any impact on the proportionality of the sanctions. It further took into account the fact that Article 4 § 1 of Law no. 2328/1995 provided for far stricter penalties ( including fines as high as EUR 1,467,351.43 and the temporary suspension or even the indefinite interruption of the broadcasting of a television show ) than those imposed on the applicant company.

The Sergeant-major Jora approached the young Sergeant, who investigated the accident, and asked him in a way more like an order than a question: ‘ How many years have you been working for the Traffic Police? ’ – Two years... ‘ But I worked for twenty years; therefore you should listen to me. Don ’ t write anything, let the people come to an agreement themselves and the guilty one (i.e. the owner of the Opel ) pay to the second one approximately 30 Moldovan Lei (MDL).

Afraid that he would not get anything, Victor agreed to the sum of MDL 75. He later had his car fixed by some acquaintances, who laughed at him for being fooled like a boy. Victor spent a little bit more than MDL 200 for the repair – a sum that might seem ridiculous to some traffic inspectors. For Victor though, this is really big money. But it is not the money, that he ’ s worried about, but the way he was treated at the Traffic Police Centre, in particular this Sergeant-Major Jora, who treated him as a man from the lowest strata, almost as a nonentity. After a few days Victor went to Jora and asked for his driver ’ s licence back. The Sergeant-Major promised to return the driver ’ s licence, but only on condition that Victor paid a fine of MDL 18.

Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, in the interest of “ the protection of the reputation or rights of others ”, it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas of public interest. Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of “ public watchdog ” (see, for instance, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 29-30, § 59)."

These “duties and responsibilities” are liable to assume significance when, as in the present case, there is a question of attacking the reputation of private individuals and undermining the “rights of others”. By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ II, p. 500, § 39, and Fressoz and Roire v.

Austria, no. 26958/95, § 42, ECHR 2001 ‑ II).

The allegation of abuse of power was also justified given the extraordinary actions undertaken by Mr Kern in a private matter.

It was thus a generality suggesting regular untruthfulness on the part of the plaintiff. The explanations for this statement provided by Mr Michał Plisecki later in the course of trial cannot be of particular importance since the published text, and in the form in which it reached the readers, did not include them. This description should then be considered as an ordinary and unjustified epithet [ epitet ]. In this case the publisher cannot be discharged of the responsibility for besmirching the plaintiff’s good name either on the ground that the author of the statement was a lawyer, because he had not spoken as a professional, or because of the fact that publication was in the form of an interview as, unlike radio or television interviews, it was not a live broadcast and the publisher had the means, by acting with due diligence, to prevent the breach of the plaintiff’s personal rights by this statement. Moreover, it cannot be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff held a public function, so that he agreed there should be a wider limit of permissible criticism of him, or from the fact that he himself made a public appeal for help in finding his daughter, that he had agreed to publication of all free opinions and comments on this subject, including those breaching his personal rights. Given the above described character of the statement, it should be regarded as an evaluation ( ocenna ) that cannot be verified as true or false and in any case cannot [be seen] as a negative assessment of the plaintiff’s actions within the meaning of Article 41 of the Press Law.

It should be underlined that information concerning family life, and even unfavourable comment, does not have to breach personal rights. In this publication the limits of fair criticism and cultural expression had been overstepped. As with the allegation that the first plaintiff was a liar, the publisher is not protected by the fact that he had been quoting the statements of a lawyer who was obliged to exercise strict control over what he said, because matters concerning the family life of the first plaintiff did not have the nature of a legal opinion and the interview itself was not broadcast “live”.",

Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see, among many other authorities, Oberschlick v.

Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his words and deeds by journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see Lingens v.

Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders (see Castells v. Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, § 43). Journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v.

The mediatisation of this case was triggered by Mr Kern himself, who had made an appeal on the television for help in finding his daughter. Mr Kern also instituted criminal proceedings against Mr Gąsior and Mrs Malisiewicz-Gąsior, the parents of his daughter’s boyfriend, in the course of which they were arrested and remanded in custody, their house searched and phone calls tapped. Ultimately, after the proceedings had been transferred to another district, the charges of kidnapping were found groundless, the proceedings discontinued and disciplinary proceedings brought against the prosecutors who had instituted the case."

One of these, published on 16 August 1992, was an interview with Mr Michał Plisecki, the lawyer representing Mr Gąsior and Mrs Malisiewicz-Gąsior. In reaction to this publication, Mr Kern instituted civil proceedings against the applicant in which the domestic courts found him to have infringed the plaintiffs’ personal rights, i.e. good name, and ordered him to pay damages of approximately EUR 2,200 plus the plaintiffs’ legal costs and to publish an apology.",

Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, pp. 23-24, § 46; Ceylan v. Turkey [GC], no. 23556/94, § 34, ECHR 1999-IV; and Raichinov v. Bulgaria, no. 47579/99, § 51, 20 April 2006)."

The Court reiterates that the limits of critical comment are wider if a public figure is involved, as he inevitably and knowingly exposes himself to public scrutiny and must therefore display a particularly high degree of tolerance. In the context of a public debate the role of the press as a public watchdog allows journalists to have recourse to a certain degree of exaggeration, provocation or harshness. It is true that, whilst an individual taking part in a public debate on a matter of general concern – like the applicant in the present case – is required not to overstep certain limits as regards – in particular – respect for the reputation and rights of others, he or she is allowed to have recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation, or in other words to make somewhat immoderate statements (see Mamère v.

The exceptional context of the case is of crucial importance as the conflict in Mr Kern’s family lay at the heart of the case. While in general issues concerning relations between parents and their children belong to the sphere of private and family life, the manner in which that politician handled his family circumstances made the case of public interest. Moreover, Mr Kern himself mediatised the case with the result that the debate surrounding the alleged kidnapping of M.K., and the involvement of the prosecution in it, occupied the attention of the media, politicians, and important State institutions. In those circumstances, issues relating to Mr Kern’s family life were closely linked to his standing as a politician and contributed to a public debate."

France, [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 57).",

It also cannot be said that the purpose of the statements was to offend or to humiliate the criticised person. Taken as a whole, it can hardly be said that the statements for which the applicant was ordered to pay damages by the civil courts, even those relating to Mr Kern’s family life, were excessive or that they went beyond what is tolerable in a public debate."

The domestic courts apparently acknowledged that, as they considered that calling Mr Kern a liar was an “evaluation” that could not be verifiable as true or false. The Court reiterates that even a value judgment may be excessive where there is no factual basis to support it. In the instant case, however, it considers that the applicant’s statement, taken in its context, had a sufficient factual basis. Thus it cannot subscribe to the domestic courts’ assessment that the statement was excessive and should not enjoy the protection of Article 10 of the Convention. A similar position has been taken by the Court in another case involving a public figure who had been called a liar (see Almeida Azevedo v. Portugal, no. 43924/02, § 30, 23 January 2007)."

                "30. The general principles for assessing the necessity of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression were recently restated in Bédat v. Switzerland ([GC], no. 56925/08, § 48, 2 9 March 2016 ) and Pentikäinen v. Finland ( [GC], no. 11882/10, § 87, 20 October 2015 ) :",
                "“(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "(ii) The adjective ‘ necessary ’ within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘ pressing social need ’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ... ”"

            [
                "31. In this connection, the Court reiterates that in order to assess the justification of an impugned statement, a distinction needs to be made between statements of fact and value judgments. While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see Pinto Pinheiro Marques v. Portugal, no. 26671/09, § 43, 2 2 January 2015). The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10. The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive ( see Mustafa Erdoğan and Others v. Turkey, nos. 346/04 and 39779/04, § 36, 2 7 May 2014). As regards value judgments which have been found by the national courts to be of a defamatory character, the Court has assessed the national court ’ s findings on the question of whether the language used in the statement was of an excessive or dispassionate nature, whether an intention of defaming or stigmatising the opponent was disclosed, and if the statement had a sufficient factual basis ( see, among others, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, §§ 56-57, ECHR 2007 ‑ I; and Aurelian Oprea v. Romania, no. 12138/08, § 71, 19 January 2016 )."
            ],
            [
                "32. The Court further reiterates that a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult. If the sole intent of a particular form of expression is to insult a person, an appropriate sanction would not, in principle, constitute a violation of Article 10 of the Convention ( see Palomo Sánchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06, 28957/06, 28959/06 and 28964/06, § 67, ECHR 2011 )."

            [
                "33. Where a form of expression can be seen as a reaction to an article previously published in the press, in order to assess whether the reply concerns an issue of public interest, the Court should take into account both the first article and the reply (see, mutatis mutandis, Smolorz v. Poland, no. 17446/07, § § 37 and 38, 16 October 2012; and Gouveia Gomes Fernandes and Freitas e Costa v. Portugal, no. 1529/08, § 47, 29 March 2011)."

When called upon to examine the necessity of an interference in a democratic society in the interests of the “protection of the reputation or rights of others”, the Court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the Convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases, namely, on the one hand, freedom of expression protected by Article 10, and on the other the right to respect for private life, enshrined in Article 8 (see Mustafa Erdoğan and Others, cited above, § 37).",

Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that the applicant was convicted because of the opinion article he published in the weekly newspaper O Independente and, in particular, for having written that A.S. was “ a petty liar” and “ a poor wretch” (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above). The Court must therefore ascertain whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance between the applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression and A.S. ’ s right to protection of reputation (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés v.

It further notes that in his article – which he wrote in reply to the one published on 3 March 2006 – the applicant gave an additional explanation of the existing difficulties in the implementation of the project upon his removal from the post of coordinator. The applicant also gave his opinion on how A.S., as president of the IM, had publicly addressed those problems by downplaying his statements and casting aspersions on his professional skills and ability to lead a project funded by public money, specifically EU funding."

The Court reiterates in this connection there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § 102, ECHR 2013 (extracts); Lopes Gomes da Silva v.

In the present case the Portuguese courts characterised the applicant ’ s statements as value judgments and found him liable for insulting A.S. with those allegations, which they considered to be a personal attack and an insult to his honour and reputation. The Court observes that the domestic courts focused their analysis on the impact that the impugned part of the applicant ’ s article had on A.S. ’ s honour and reputation but failed to assess whether the applicant ’ s statements had been based on sufficient facts in order to constitute a fair comment under Article 10 (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above)."

The Court further notes that the applicant was also able to prove that his professional and academic competencies had been highly recognised at both the national and European level. These facts were disregarded by the domestic courts in the analysis of the context of the impugned part of the article. The domestic courts thus lost sight of the article ’ s overall content (see Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, § 47, ECHR 2003 ‑ V)."

In the Court ’ s view, a person who manages an institution financed from the public purse should be prepared to accept hard-hitting criticism particularly in the course of a public debate where matters of management of a project paid for with such funds are being discussed (see, mutatis mutandis, Kurłowicz v. Poland, no. 41029/06, § 50, 22 June 2010). In this regard, the Court notes that the applicant ’ s criticism of A.S., as the President of the IM, concerned his behaviour and statements made in his professional capacity, rather than in his private life. The Court reiterates in this connection that senior civil servants acting in an official capacity are subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see Aurelian Oprea, cited above, § 74)."

            [
                "41. With regard in particular to the statements that A.S. was “a petty liar”, the Court further notes that the case bears similarities to Kulís v. Poland (no. 15601/02, 18 March 2008), where the applicant had published an interview with a lawyer in which the latter had stated that a Deputy Speaker of the lower house of the Polish Parliament was a liar in the context of an investigation of a kidnapping; to Almeida Azevedo v. Portugal (no. 43924/02, 23 January 2007), where the applicant described a mayor as being a liar and a manipulator; and to Niskasaari and Otavamedia Oy v. Finland (no. 32297/10, 23 June 2015), where the applicant, a journalist, had been convicted for defamation for having criticised the work of a colleague by calling him a liar. In all these cases the Court considered that the applicants ’ statements had had a sufficient factual basis and thus had not been excessive. A similar position was taken by the Court in two other cases, within the academic domain, where the applicant had issued statements considering that an elected academic senate had been illegitimate ( see Kharlamov v. Russia, no. 27447/07, § 31, 8 October 2015 ) or where the applicant had accused an assistant professor of plagiarism (see Aurelian Oprea, cited above, § 71). In the instant case, however, the Court notes that the domestic courts did not take into account that the expression “petty liar” concerned the applicant ’ s opinion on A.S. ’ s denial of the existing management and financial problems with the project in question and, consequently, it had originated from a factual dispute (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above)."

            [
                "43. In the instant case, the Court considers that, even though the impugned statements were strongly worded and could be considered offensive, the applicant reacted to a public attack of A.S. In this context, and taking into consideration that the applicant had supported his statements with a certain factual background (see, mutatis mutandis, Lopes Gomes da Silva, cited above, § 34), his reaction did not convey a gratuitous personal attack. In addition, the Court recalls that persons taking part in a public debate on a matter of general concern are allowed to have recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation, or in other words to make somewhat immoderate statements (see, Marian Maciejewski v. Poland, no. 34447/05, § 79, 13 January 2015, with further references). Where there is no factual basis, such statements could, admittedly, appear excessive; but in the light of the established facts that is not so in the instant case (see, mutatis mutandis, Lopes Gomes da Silva, cited above, § 34 )."

Lastly, the Court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference (see, for example, Pentikäinen, cited above, § 112). In the present case, the applicant was subjected to a criminal sanction and sentenced to 250 day fines, totaling EUR 2,000. In addition, he was ordered to pay EUR 3,000 in compensation to A.S. (see paragraph 13 above). Having regard to the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the applicant ’ s conviction to a criminal fine, coupled with damages, was not proportionate (see, mutatis mutandis, Amorim Giestas and Jesus Costa Bordalo v.

The article examined the relationship between the State authorities and a private investment fund, D.H., which had been founded by and was managed by D.P., a private company. The focus was on the Government's practice of purchasing luxury cars without making any details public. It recalled two purchases of cars in 2003, including from D.H., for a total estimated value of 1,250,000 euros (EUR). Only after the press published details was the Government forced to acknowledge that this deal had taken place."

The article criticised the deal's lack of transparency, because it had not been published in the Official Gazette. It went on to describe the manner in which the cars had been distributed to the governors of 32 regions of Moldova and raised the issue whether that was a means for the Government to ensure that those governors, 31 of whom were communists as was the President of Moldova, would thereby have a better ability to spread communist propaganda in their regions ahead of the elections which were to be held a year later. The article cited the leader of a political party, who declared that rumours in the Government suggested that the price paid for each car was some EUR 7 ,000 more than its list price. No explanation was given by the authorities as to why luxury cars were needed if much cheaper new cars could be purchased for a fraction of the price. The article ended with an accusation of corruption at the highest State level, for which no one was going to be punished, and said that if the voters did not mete out justice at the forthcoming elections then only God's justice could be hoped for."

In addition, both the State authorities and the plaintiffs had refused to disclose any details about the deal, which seemed even more suspicious given that D.H.'s president was a member of the Economic Council assisting the Prime Minister.

However, in addition to the public interest in open debate about business practices, there is a competing interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of companies, for the benefit of shareholders and employees, but also for the wider economic good. The State therefore enjoys a margin of appreciation as to the means it provides under domestic law to enable a company to challenge the truth, and limit the damage, of allegations which risk harming its reputation (see Markt Intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann v.

Nevertheless, the Court considers that when a private company decides to participate in transactions in which considerable public funds are involved, it voluntarily exposes itself to an increased scrutiny by public opinion. In particular, if there are allegations that such transactions were detrimental to public finances, a company must accept criticism by the public (see paragraph 30 above). The Court notes that, in the present case, public opinion could be legitimately interested in the integrity of the transaction since the public authorities had failed to disclose any details concerning the purchase of the cars, the more so as D.H.'s president held an important advisory function within the Government (see paragraph 12 above)."

The part of the sentence relied on by the domestic authorities may indeed have created the impression for the reader that D.H. had given a bribe to the President of Moldova, which is a serious allegation of fact.

The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 ” (see Jerusalem v.

In deciding on the sanction to be applied, the court took into consideration the fact that the applicant had previously been sanctioned with fines for similar deeds and that those sanctions had proved to be inefficient. The court considered that the applicant ’ s deeds had been immoral because he had exposed obscene sculptures in a public place where they could be seen by anyone, including by children. The court based its findings on the statements of several prosecution witnesses who had stated that they had disliked the sculptures exposed by the applicant and had considered them to be indecent and obscene. The court also stated that assimilating public officials with genitals went beyond the acceptable limits of criticism in a democratic society and was therefore not an act protected under Article 10 of the Convention.

He reiterated that his protest had been against the corruption within the Prosecutor General ’ s Office and among high-ranking politicians, a phenomenon which was universally known and did not need to be proved. He also argued that the sculptures exposed by him could not be considered obscene. In any event, at the time of his protest, children were normally at schools and kindergartens. The fact that some of the prosecution witnesses disliked what they saw was not sufficient to hold him responsible for a criminal offence. The applicant admitted that the form of the protest chosen by him had been striking, however he considered this manner of protesting as the only way possible to make himself heard in a society which was oversaturated with subjects of discussion. The applicant finally submitted that the sanction applied to him had been disproportionately harsh and that it had had a chilling effect on him.

The latter premise is also implied by the title of the second programme. Evidently, those topics were of serious public interest.",
                "Freedom of expression is applicable not only to “ information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, among other authorities, Jersild v. Denmark, judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 23 -24, § 31; Janowski v. Poland [GC], no. 25716/94, § 30, ECHR 1999-I; and Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, § 43, ECHR 1999-VIII). Moreover, a constant thread running through the Court ’ s case-law is the insistence on the essential role of a free press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society. Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, regarding in particular protection of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest, including those relating to the administration of justice (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, pp. 233-34, § 37). Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas; the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of “public watchdog” (see Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 27, § 63, and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 62, ECHR 1999-III). Journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 313, p. 19, § 38; Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, §§ 45- 46, ECHR 2001-III; and Perna, cited above, § 39 ).",

The inquiry resulted in a report of 29 July 1991 by the Regional State Prosecutor, according to which the police in Frederikshavn had not complied with section 751 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act ( Retsplejeloven ). This provision, introduced on 1 October 1978, provides that a witness must be given the opportunity to read through his or her statement. The non-compliance had not been limited to the investigation in X ’ s case. Instead, allegedly in order to minimise errors or misunderstandings, the police in Frederikshavn usually interviewed witnesses in the presence of two police officers and made sure that crucial witnesses repeated their statements before a court as soon as possible. In this connection, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the High Court, before which X had been convicted in 1982, had not made any comments on the failure to comply with section 751 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act with regard to the witnesses who were heard before it in 1982. Finally, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the Frederikshavn district police were apparently not the only district police failing to comply with the said provision. The Regional State Prosecutor considered it unjustified to maintain that the taxi driver, when interviewed in December 1981, had stated that she had seen X on the day of the murder. During the inquiry this had been contradicted by the two police officers who had interviewed her in 1981. Moreover, the inquiry did not indicate that anyone within the Frederikshavn police had suppressed any evidence in X ’ s case, or in any other criminal case for that matter.",

This impression was strengthened by the first of the concluding questions: ‘ ... why did the vital part of the taxi driver ’ s explanation disappear and who, in the police or public prosecutor ’ s office, should bear the responsibility for this? ’. In connection with the scenes about the two police officers [the applicants] include two questions in the commentator ’ s narrative, to which the indictment relates; irrespective of the fact that they were phrased as questions, viewers undoubtedly received a clear impression that a report had been made about the taxi driver ’ s statement that she had seen X at the relevant time on 12 December 1981; that this report had subsequently been suppressed; and that such suppression had been decided upon either by the named chief superintendent alone or by him and the chief inspector of the Flying Squad jointly. The subsequent questions in the commentator ’ s narrative do not weaken this impression, and neither does the question whether the Chief Constable or the public prosecutor were aware of the taxi driver ’ s statement. On this basis we find that in the programme ‘ The Blind Eye of the Police ’ [ the applicants ] made allegations against the named superintendent which were intended to discredit him in the eyes of his peers, within the meaning of Article 267 § 1 of the Penal Code [ Straffeloven ].

In consequence of the ongoing proceedings for reopening the case, [ the applicants ] could not count on the chief superintendent and the two police officers who had interviewed the taxi driver in 1981 being prepared to participate in the programme and hence possibly anticipate proceedings in the Court of Revision.

The questions left it to the viewers to decide, between various logical explanations, who was responsible for the failures in the handling of the murder case. The questions did not assert that the chief superintendent had contravened the Penal Code. However, he had been the head of the police unit that performed the much ‑ criticised investigation that led to the wrongful conviction of X.

The applicants regretted the Chamber ’ s assessment and the method used in this respect with regard to review of facts in a case under the European Convention. In addition, although regretting that they had failed to verify the time of the funeral, the applicants contended that the taxi driver ’ s explanation had appeared highly plausible and credible and that she had had no reason not to tell the truth about what she had observed on 12 December 1981. Furthermore, her testimony had been a crucial element in the reopening of the case by the Special Court of Revision and the later acquittal of X. Moreover, the applicants had reason to believe that a significant statement such as the one the taxi driver had allegedly made to the police would be the subject of a police report. Accordingly, and taking into consideration the fact that the Frederikshavn police had failed to comply with section 751 of the Administration of Justice Act at the material time, it seemed likely that someone within that police district had either misplaced or concealed part of the taxi driver ’ s statement."

The applicants pointed out that the criticism was limited to the chief superintendent ’ s performance as head of the investigation in the specific case and did not concern his general professional qualities or performance or his private activities.

Leaving the viewers with these two options did not amount, as claimed by the applicants, to a range of possibilities.

Also, setting aside the fact that they could not accept that there was any basis for jumping from the taxi driver ’ s statement to the serious allegation against the chief superintendent, the Government submitted that the applicants had in any event failed to examine the validity of the taxi driver ’ s statement, which had emerged over nine years after the events had taken place. The applicants had failed to check simple facts such as whether the funeral of the taxi driver ’ s grandmother had actually taken place at 1 p.m. The Government found it sadly ironic that the programme, which by its own account aimed at clearing someone unjustly convicted in a court of law, had ended up unjustly convicting someone else in the court of public opinion.

Moreover, a constant thread running through the Court ’ s case-law is the insistence on the essential role of a free press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society.

In order to assess the justification of an impugned statement, a distinction needs to be made between statements of fact and value judgments in that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see, for example, Lingens v.

The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts (see Prager and Oberschlick, cited above, p.18, § 36). However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive ( see Jerusalem v.

The Court, like the Supreme Court, concludes that the accusation against the named chief superintendent, although made indirectly and by way of a series of questions, was an allegation of fact susceptible of proof.

Moreover, a general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press ’ s role of providing information on current events, opinions and ideas (see, for example, Thoma, cited above, § 64).",

The Court observes in this connection that protection of the right of journalists to impart information on issues of general interest requires that they should act in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide “reliable and precise” information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see, for example, Fressoz and Roire, § 54, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, § 58, and Prager and Oberschlick, pp. 18-19, § 37, all cited above). Under the terms of paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention, freedom of expression carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the media even with respect to matters of serious public concern. Moreover, these “duties and responsibilities” are liable to assume significance when there is a question of attacking the reputation of a named individual and infringing the “rights of others”. Thus, special grounds are required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals. Whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable with respect to the allegations (see, among other authorities, McVicar v. the United Kingdom, no. 46311/99, § 84, ECHR 2002-III, and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § 66). Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention individuals have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty (see, among other authorities, Worm v. Austria, judgment of 29 August 1997, Reports 1997-V, pp. 1551-52, § 50, and Du Roy and Malaurie v. France, no. 34000/96, § 34, ECHR 2000- X).",
                "During the domestic proceedings the applicants never endeavoured to prove their allegation, which was declared null and void. However, relying on Article 10 of the Convention and Article 269 § 1 of the Penal Code, the applicants claimed that, even if their questions amounted to an allegation, the latter could not be punishable because it had been disseminated in view of an obvious general public interest and in view of the interests of other parties.",
                "The Court must therefore examine whether the applicants acted in good faith and complied with the ordinary journalistic obligation to verify a factual allegation. This obligation required that they should have relied on a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis which could be considered proportionate to the nature and degree of their allegation, given that the more serious the allegation, the more solid the factual basis has to be."
            ],
            [
                "79. It is relevant to this assessment that the allegation was made at peak viewing time on a national television station in a programme devoted to objectivity and pluralism, that it was therefore seen by a wide audience, and that the audiovisual media often have a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media."
            ],
            [
                "80. The Court must also take into consideration the fact that the accusation was very serious for the named chief superintendent and would have entailed criminal prosecution had it been true. The offence alleged was punishable with up to nine years ’ imprisonment under Articles 154 and 164 of the Penal Code (see paragraph 39 above ). It is true that civil servants acting in an official capacity are, like politicians, subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals. However, it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent politicians do (see Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 2), judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, pp. 1274- 75, § 29; Janowski, cited above, § 33; and Thoma, cited above, § 47). Thus, although the chief superintendent was subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than a private individual, being a public official, a senior police officer and leader of the police team which had carried out an admittedly controversial criminal investigation, he could not be treated on an equal footing with politicians when it came to public discussion of his actions. All the less so, as the allegation exceeded the notion of “ criticism of the chief superintendent ’ s performance as head of the investigation in the specific case ” (see paragraph 56 above ) and amounted to an accusation that he had committed a serious criminal act. Thus, it inevitably not only prejudiced public confidence in him, but also disregarded his right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law."

            [
                "81. The police investigation in the original criminal trial against X involved about 900 people and more than 4,000 pages of reports, and 30 witnesses made statements before the High Court in 1982 (see paragraph 12 above ). When preparing their programmes, the applicant journalists had established contact with various witnesses through advertising in the local paper and via police reports."

            [
                "82. Yet, with regard to the accusation for which they were convicted, the applicants relied on one witness in particular, namely the taxi driver. The Court observes that, during the programme “ The Blind Eye of the Police”, the taxi driver claimed that in 1981 she had told the two police officers who interviewed her about two observations she had made on the day of the murder: she had seen a Peugeot taxi and she had seen X and his son shortly after noon on 12 December 1981. The reason she could remember the exact date and time so well was because she had to attend her grandmother ’ s funeral on that day at 1 p.m. (see paragraph 16 above )."
            ],
            [
                "83. The applicants ’ interview with the taxi driver was filmed on 4 April 199 1. The applicants were at that time aware that the taxi driver, at the request of X ’ s new counsel, had been interviewed by the police on 11 March 199 1 and that during that interview she had maintained that she had told the police already in 1981 about having seen X shortly after noon on 12 December 1981 (see paragraphs 19-20 above ). Despite the fact that this witness appeared over nine years after the events took place, the applicants did not check whether there was an objective basis for her timing of events. This could easily have been done, as shown by the check carried out by the police on 11 March 1991, which revealed that the funeral of the taxi driver ’ s grandmother had taken place, not at 1 p. m. , but at 2 p.m. on 12 December 1981 (see paragraph 22 above ). This fact was indeed important, not only in relation to the murder case, in which the crucial time was between 11.30 a.m. and 1 p. m. , but also as regards the reliability of the taxi driver who, calculating backwards from the time when the funeral took place, claimed to be completely accurate in her observations of the whereabouts of X. The Court also notes that the applicant journalists themselves found their failure to verify the time of the funeral “ regrettable ”."
            ],
            [
                "84. In addition, the Court observes that at no point during the programme “The Blind Eye of the Police” had the taxi driver asserted that the two police officers had definitely made a report containing her crucial statement; or that a report containing her crucial statement had been suppressed deliberately, or that it was the named chief superintendent who had intentionally suppressed the report. This being so, taking into account the nature and the seriousness of the applicant ’ s allegation against the named chief superintendent, the applicants ’ reliance on the taxi driver ’ s statement alone could not justify their three - fold speculation that the taxi driver had made her crucial statement to the police in 1981, that a report on it had been written, and that the chief superintendent had intentionally suppressed that report."

The applicants had obtained a copy of the report made by the two police officers in December 1981 mentioning the taxi driver ’ s sighting on 12 December 1981 of a Peugeot taxi (which had no relevance to the murder) (see paragraph 18 above ). The report itself did not contain any indication that something might have been deleted from it. Nor was there any evidence that another report had existed containing the taxi driver ’ s statement that she had seen X on the relevant day."
            ],
            [
                "86. When preparing the programmes, the applicants became aware that the police in Frederikshavn had not complied with section 751 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act, a provision which had been enacted on 1 October 1978 and provided that a witness should be given the opportunity to read his or her statement (see paragraph 39 above ). The non-compliance was confirmed by the inquiry into the specific police investigation of X ’ s case following the broadcast of the applicants ’ television programmes (see paragraph 25 above ). That inquiry resulted in a report of 29 July 1991 by the Regional State Prosecutor, stating, inter alia, that the police in Frederikshavn had not, in the course of their routine procedure, implemented the relevant provision. This non - compliance had not been limited to the investigation in X ’ s case. Instead, allegedly in order to minimise errors or misunderstandings, the police in Frederikshavn usually interviewed witnesses in the presence of two police officers and made sure that crucial witnesses repeated their statements before a court as soon as possible. In that connection, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the High Court, before which X had been convicted in 1982, had not made any comments on the non- compliance with section 751 ( 2 ) of the Administration of Justice Act with regard to the thirty witnesses who were heard before it in 1982. Finally, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the police district of Frederikshavn was apparently not the only police district which had failed to comply with the said provision. Consequently, on 20 December 1991 the Prosecutor General found the non- compliance unfortunate and open to criticism, and he informed the Ministry of Justice that he would produce a wider set of guidelines to be integrated into the Police Academy ’ s educational material."

            [
                "87. Notwithstanding this finding of a procedural failure in the conduct of the investigation in X ’ s case, neither the inquiry nor the statement by the Prosecutor General established that the taxi driver, when interviewed in December 1981, had indeed also claimed to have seen X on the day of the murder ( something that was in fact contradicted by the two police officers who had interviewed her in 1981 – see paragraph 25 above ), or that a report had been written containing such a statement, or that the existing police report of 1981 had not contained the taxi driver ’ s full statement, or that somebody within the Frederikshavn police had suppressed evidence in X ’ s case, or any other criminal case for that matter.",
                "Accordingly, in the Courts ’ view, the fact that the police in Frederikshavn had failed to comply with section 751 ( 2 ) of the Administration of Justice Act, whether taken alone or together with the taxi driver ’ s statement, could not provide a sufficient factual basis for the applicants ’ accusation that the chief superintendent had actively tampered with evidence."

                "88. The applicant journalists submitted that their programmes and the taxi driver ’ s testimony had been a crucial element in the Special Court of Revision ’ s decision of 29 November 1991 to reopen X ’ s trial and the High Court ’ s judgment of 13 April 1992 acquitting him. It is, however, to be observed that counsel for X had already requested a reopening of the trial on 13 September 1990, four days before the broadcast of the applicants ’ first programme and more than six months before the broadcast of the second (see paragraph 10 above ). The Court also notes that the Special Court of Revision was divided when the retrial was granted on 29 November 1991, in that only two judges out of five found that new testimonial evidence, including the taxi driver ’ s statement, had been produced on which X might have been acquitted had it been available at the trial. The retrial was granted nevertheless because the presiding judge found that in other respects special circumstances existed which made it overwhelmingly likely that the available evidence had not been assessed correctly in 1982 (see paragraph 24 above ). Finally, although X was acquitted by the High Court sitting with a jury on 13 April 1992, the judgment did not contain any specific reasoning with regard to the jury ’ s answers to the particular questions put by the prosecution (see paragraph 26 above ). Thus, the assertion that the applicants ’ programmes or the taxi driver ’ s testimony were a crucial element in the later acquittal of X amounts to speculation."

                "89. Even assuming that the applicants ’ programmes and the taxi driver ’ s testimony were instrumental in the reopening of the proceedings and the acquittal of X, the Court notes that none of those subsequent events, whether the reopening decision or the retrial, in any way supported the theory that led the applicants to include a serious allegation against the chief superintendent in their programme “the Blind Eye of the Police” broadcast on 22 April 1991."

The Frederikshavn police were, it is true, invited to participate in the first programme, “Convicted of Murder”, which was broadcast on 17 September 1990, four days after X had requested that the Special Court of Revision order a new trial. This invitation was declined, however, since the applicant journalists were not willing to furnish beforehand and in writing the questions to be put to the police (see paragraph 12 above ). On the other hand, the applicants have not substantiated their allegation that the named chief superintendent at some unknown time was invited to participate in the second programme “The Blind Eye of the Police”, which was broadcast on 22 April 1991. In any event, noting especially the statement by X ’ s new counsel made during that second programme that he had “ agreed with the public prosecutor and the President of the Special Court of Revision that statements to the press in this matter [would] in future only be issued by the Special Court of Revision” (see paragraph 19 above ), the Court is satisfied that the named chief superintendent was in fact precluded from publicly commenting on the case while it was pending before the Special Court of Revision."

In assessing the necessity of the interference, it is also important to examine the way in which the relevant domestic authorities dealt with the case, and in particular whether they applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 of the Convention (see paragraph 7 0 above ). A perusal of the Supreme Court ’ s judgment reveals that that court fully recognised that the present case involved a conflict between the right to impart information and protection of the reputation or rights of others, a conflict it resolved by weighing the relevant considerations in the light of the case - law under the Convention. Thus, the Supreme Court clearly recognised that the applicants ’ intention, in the programme, of undertaking a critical assessment of the police investigation was legitimate in relation to the role of the media as public watchdog. However, having balanced the relevant considerations, that court found no basis for the applicants to make such a serious allegation against the named chief superintendent as they did, in particular because they had sufficient other opportunities to achieve the aims of the programme."

The Court does not find these penalties excessive in the circumstances or to be of such a kind as to have a “chilling effect” on the exercise of media freedom (see, mutatis mutandis, Wille v.

Switzerland [GC], no. 69698/01, § 146, ECHR 2007 ‑ V ). Thus, the existence of other alternatives to direct newsgathering within the Reception Centre did not extinguish the applicant ’ s interest in having face-to-face discussions on and gaining first-hand impressions of living conditions there. In those circumstances the availability of other forms and tools of research were not sufficient reasons to justify the interference complained of or to remedy the prejudice caused by the refusal of authorisation to enter the Reception Centre."

Italy, no. 39128/05, §§ 45-46, 20 October 2009; Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, § 161, 23 June 2016; and Aydoğan and Dara Radyo Televizyon Yayıncılık Anonim Şirketi v.

In conclusion, the Court accepts that the domestic authorities are better placed than it is to say whether, and to what extent, access to the Reception Centre is compatible with the authorities ’ obligation to protect the rights of asylum-seekers. However, in view of the importance of the media in a democratic society and of reporting on matters of considerable public interest, the Court considers that the need for restrictions on freedom of expression must be convincingly established. In the present case, considering the rather summary reasoning put forward by the OIN and the absence in its decision of any real balancing of the interests in issue, in the Court ’ s opinion the domestic authorities have failed to demonstrate convincingly that the refusal of permission to enter and conduct research in the Reception Centre, which was an absolute refusal, was proportionate to the aims pursued and thus met a “pressing social need”."

                "51. In the instant case, the Sofia Court of Appeal considered that the first applicant had not acted professionally and in good faith because some of her allegations had not been sufficiently researched. The court was in particular of the view that although those allegations had been based on information obtained from a public prosecutor, the first applicant had been under a duty to check the story against other sources (see paragraph 19 above). The Court is unable to agree with that reasoning. It has in the past held that the press should normally be entitled to rely on the content of official reports without having to undertake independent research (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § § 68 and 72, and Colombani and Others v. France, no. 51279/99, § 65, ECHR 2002 ‑ V ). It later expanded the scope of application of that principle, saying that journalists must be free to report on events based on information gathered from official sources without further verification (see Selistö v. Finland, no. 56767/00, § 60, 16 November 2004 ). More recently, it applied that approach to information given orally by a public prosecutor in charge of the prosecuting authorities ’ relations with the press (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 105 ). The situation in the present case presents no material difference. In view of the practice of the Bulgarian prosecuting authorities to give routine informal press conferences in which prosecutors would talk to journalists about cases (see paragraph 9 above), the military prosecutor ’ s statement made on 30 May 1996 is to be similarly considered an official source of information obviating the need for further verification. The fact that the applicant was unable to establish the identity of that prosecutor does not detract from that position. Moreover, information about the case was published also by the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and was later on disseminated by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency. The national courts did not express doubts as to whether the prosecutor had indeed made the statement in issue, and the Court sees no reason to doubt that the first applicant acted in good faith in connection with that. A perusal of the text of the two articles (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above) shows that she did not adopt the allegations as her own (contrast Rumyana Ivanova, cited above, § 62 )."

Striking a balance between those rights always required an assessment of the specific facts.

Those allegations, based on a mere supposition, had been presented as established truth, with the explanation that an unnamed public prosecutor had given such information to reporters during a briefing in the Palace of Justice. However, it was clear that the investigation against N.T. had been at an early stage and that such allegations – which involved not only N.T. but also his spouse, who had not been charged with any offence – were frivolous and could not be made with any degree of certainty. The first applicant had no doubt been aware of that, but had presented the allegations as entirely true. She was an experienced journalist, who was surely well aware of the presumption of innocence and of the possibility that allegations might fail at trial. She should have therefore relayed with utmost care the information received from the prosecuting authorities. Instead, she had chosen to interpret that information loosely and to present it as unchallenged fact. Given her considerable experience, it was obvious that she had done that in order to introduce an element of sensation in the official information received from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. This was shown from the considerably more objective and nuanced way in which the story had been reported in other newspapers."

The main point was therefore not that the first applicant had failed to verify the accuracy of the information that she had obtained from the public prosecutor, but that she had consciously misused that information to give a sensational spin to otherwise unsensational news.

She had not broken any legal or ethical rules and had not acted negligently, both of which were essential elements of the tort under section 45. The Sofia Court of Appeal had failed to deal with those points.

The alleged falsity of the information concerning N.T. had been established solely on the basis of the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against him six years after the events due to the failure of the prosecuting authorities to make out the charges against him in court. At the material time the first applicant had had no reason to doubt that the statements made by a public prosecutor in that respect could be untrue. Under the Court ’ s case ‑ law, she had been entitled to rely on such statements without verifying them. She had suffered serious financial consequences and a blow to her professional reputation as a result of the ruling against her.

                "(a) The test of “necessity in a democratic society” requires the Court to determine whether the interference corresponded to a pressing social need. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those delivered by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(b) The Court ’ s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic courts but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully or in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the statements held against the applicant and the context in which he or she has made them.",

Although it must not overstep certain bounds, in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on political issues and on other matters of general interest (ibid., § 93, with further references). The Court must apply the most careful scrutiny when, as here, the sanctions imposed by a national authority are capable of discouraging the participation of the press in debates over matters of legitimate public concern (see, among other authorities, Tønsbergs Blad A.S. and Haukom v.

Under the terms of its second paragraph, the exercise of this freedom carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the press. These “duties and responsibilities” are liable to assume significance when, as in the present case, there is a question of attacking the reputation of named individuals and undermining the “rights of others”. By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see, among other authorities, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 65, ECHR 1999 ‑ III, and Aquilina and Others v. Malta, no. 28040/08, § 44, 14 June 2011 ). Indeed, in situations where on the one hand a statement of fact is made and insufficient evidence is adduced to prove it, and on the other the journalist is discussing an issue of genuine public interest, verifying whether the journalist has acted professionally and in good faith becomes paramount (see Flux v. Moldova (no. 7), no. 25367/05, § 41, 24 November 2009 )."

It must also take into account other factors, such as the nature of the activities that were the subject of the publication, the way in which the information was obtained, the way in which the report was published, and the way in which the person concerned was depicted in it (see, mutatis mutandis, Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, §§ 9 0 ‑ 94, 7 February 2012, and Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, §§ 109 ‑ 12, ECHR 2012 ‑ ... ). Other factors – and the list is not exhaustive – may include the source of the information ( see, for instance, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § § 68 and 72 ), the steps taken to verify it (see, for instance, Rumyana Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 36207/03, § § 64 ‑ 65, 14 February 2008; Kasabova v. Bulgaria, no. 22385/03, §§ 64 ‑ 65, 19 April 2011, and Bozhkov v. Bulgaria, no. 3316/04, §§ 47 ‑ 50, 19 April 2011 ), and the urgency of the matter (see Bozhkov, cited above, § 48 ). In relation to the last point, it should be borne in mind that news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest (see Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, § 60, Series A no. 216, and Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2), 26 November 1991, § 51, Series A no. 217)."

                "51. In the instant case, the Sofia Court of Appeal considered that the first applicant had not acted professionally and in good faith because some of her allegations had not been sufficiently researched. The court was in particular of the view that although those allegations had been based on information obtained from a public prosecutor, the first applicant had been under a duty to check the story against other sources (see paragraph 19 above). The Court is unable to agree with that reasoning. It has in the past held that the press should normally be entitled to rely on the content of official reports without having to undertake independent research (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § § 68 and 72, and Colombani and Others v. France, no. 51279/99, § 65, ECHR 2002 ‑ V ). It later expanded the scope of application of that principle, saying that journalists must be free to report on events based on information gathered from official sources without further verification (see Selistö v. Finland, no. 56767/00, § 60, 16 November 2004 ). More recently, it applied that approach to information given orally by a public prosecutor in charge of the prosecuting authorities ’ relations with the press (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 105 ). The situation in the present case presents no material difference. In view of the practice of the Bulgarian prosecuting authorities to give routine informal press conferences in which prosecutors would talk to journalists about cases (see paragraph 9 above), the military prosecutor ’ s statement made on 30 May 1996 is to be similarly considered an official source of information obviating the need for further verification. The fact that the applicant was unable to establish the identity of that prosecutor does not detract from that position. Moreover, information about the case was published also by the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and was later on disseminated by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency. The national courts did not express doubts as to whether the prosecutor had indeed made the statement in issue, and the Court sees no reason to doubt that the first applicant acted in good faith in connection with that. A perusal of the text of the two articles (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above) shows that she did not adopt the allegations as her own (contrast Rumyana Ivanova, cited above, § 62 )."

Moreover, journalists cannot be expected to act with total objectivity and must be allowed some degree of exaggeration or even provocation (see Selistö, cited above, § 56 ). The fact that the text of the articles and their captions contained expressions designed to attract the public ’ s attention does not in itself present a problem ( see Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 108). The first applicant did not use gratuitously offensive language (contrast Tammer v. Estonia, no. 41205/98, §§ 65 and 67, ECHR 2001 ‑ I )."

It is true that the first applicant could have phrased the impugned statements more carefully, so as to highlight the fact that they were reflecting statements made by law enforcement officials at the early stages of a criminal investigation. However, the question is, again, not how the Court or a national court would have worded those statements, but whether they went beyond the limits of responsible journalism. The Court does not consider that they did. The first applicant made it clear that she was quoting law enforcement officials and that the statements were based on the results of the investigation thus far. Moreover, the overall thrust of the first article made it clear that that investigation had just started. Nor was it unreasonable for the first applicant to include in her story statements concerning N.T. ’ s wife and father. She did not mention any irrelevant or private details ( see Flinkkilä and Others v. Finland, no. 25576/04, § 84, 6 April 2010, and contrast Tammer, cited above, §§ 66 and 68), whereas the business of N.T. ’ s wife and the fact that his father had held public office were clearly relevant to the story, and therefore had a direct bearing on a matter of public interest. In a democratic society, the authorities are entitled to inform the public about criminal investigations in progress, provided they choose their words carefully (see Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 41, ECHR 2000 ‑ X ), and do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (see Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, § 38, Series A no. 308 ). By disseminating such information, the authorities keep the public abreast of their efforts to combat crime, which is no doubt a matter of public interest."

It notes in this connection that when it first heard the case that same court found that the applicant had not failed to fulfil her professional duty (see paragraph 15 above); the Sofia City Court had earlier come to the same conclusion (see paragraph 14 above). The Court would also emphasise that if the national courts apply an overly rigorous approach to the assessment of journalists ’ professional conduct, the latter could be unduly deterred from discharging their function of keeping the public informed. The courts must therefore take into account the likely impact of their rulings not only on the individual cases before them but also on the media in general (see Kasabova, § 55, and Bozhkov, § 51, both cited above )."

As the Court found that the first applicant could not be regarded as having acted irresponsibly in those regards, it concludes that the reasons relied on by the respondent State to justify the interference with the second applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression were likewise not sufficient to show that that interference was “necessary in a democratic society”."

The Court considers that the Supreme Court of Cassation ’ s refusal to hear the applicants ’ appeal on points of law does not raise an issue under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention taken alone. That refusal was a result of a legislative amendment that came into force in November 2002 and increased the threshold for appealing on points of law from BGN 1,000 to BGN 5,000 (see paragraph 26 above). The right of access to a court by its very nature calls for regulation by the State and may be subject to limitations; that applies with even greater force to access to a cassation court. Increasing the financial threshold for appeals on points of law with a view to preventing the Supreme Court of Cassation from being overloaded with cases of lesser importance pursued a legitimate aim and could not be regarded as disproportionate ( see Brualla Gómez de la Torre v. Spain, 19 December 1997, §§ 34 ‑ 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VIII; Kozlica v. Croatia, no. 29182/03, §§ 32 ‑ 34, 2 November 2006; and Alkış v. Turkey (dec.)

The difference in treatment to which the applicants were subjected – their appeal on points of law not being examined, in contrast to the one lodged by N.T. about three years earlier – was not based on an identifiable personal characteristic of theirs. It was exclusively due to an intervening change in the rules governing the admissibility of appeals on points of law. It could not therefore be regarded as discriminatory (see, mutatis mutandis, Magee v. the United Kingdom, no. 28135/95, § 50, ECHR 2000 ‑ VI, and Hristozov and Others v.

During that time the case was examined on the merits four times. After that, the question whether the applicants ’ appeal on points of law was admissible was examined by two levels of court. The only serious delays attributable to the authorities during that period were a pause of about a year during the second examination of the case by the Sofia Court of Appeal, when the proceedings were stayed to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings against N.T., and a period of about a year and a half during which the case was waiting to be heard by the Supreme Court of Cassation pursuant to N.T. ’ s appeal on points of law (see paragraphs 13 ‑ 22 above). With regard to the former, the Court does not consider that the stay was arbitrary or unreasonable (see Djangozov v. Bulgaria, no. 45950/99, § 38, 8 July 2004, and Todorov v. Bulgaria, no. 39832/98, § 48, 18 January 2005 ), or that it lasted so long as to prejudice irretrievably the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings as whole. With regard to the latter, the Court observes that recently, in Nikolov and Others v. Bulgaria ( nos. 44184/05, 22250/06 and 37182/07, §§ 37 ‑ 42, 21 February 2012), it found a breach of Article 6 § 1 on account of delays of about two years in the examination of appeals on points of law by the Bulgarian Supreme Court of Cassation. However, the Court ’ s ruling in that case was based entirely on the very high stakes involved for the applicants, who had been challenging their dismissals from work. It is true that the stakes in the present case, which concerned the first applicant ’ s professional reputation, were also higher than normal (see, mutatis mutandis, Kalpachka v. Bulgaria, no. 49163/99, § 71, 2 November 2006 ). However, this is a question of degree. The situation here cannot be compared with those obtaining in cases, such as Nikolov and Others, where the outcome of the proceedings directly concerns a person ’ s employment. Delay in such cases may have serious negative repercussions on the litigants ’ livelihood. For that reason, a very high level of diligence is required of the authorities (see Nikolov and Others, cited above, § 41 ). It follows that the delay in the present case, while regrettable, cannot be regarded as having rendered the length of the proceedings as a whole unreasonable."

The Federal Labour Court considered that the Court of Appeal, when weighing the competing interests, had failed to establish correctly the seriousness of the applicant ’ s allegations and of the violation of the Deputy Mayor ’ s personality rights. Under the Criminal Code, perversion of justice was a crime subject to up to five years ’ imprisonment. In case of a criminal conviction under this provision, a deputy mayor would automatically lose his office. The conduct of a public service employee had to be measured against a stricter yardstick than that of an employee in the private sector. In particular, the employee was under an obligation to behave in such a way as not to interfere with his public employer ’ s reputation. Under the Professional Code of Conduct, the employee had to exercise special restraint when openly criticising a superior ’ s decisions. A public allegation of perversion of justice directed against a superior, in particular if it was unfounded, very seriously violated the superior ’ s personality rights and interfered, as a rule, with the employee ’ s professional duties."

Accordingly, in order duly to weigh the competing interests in the light of the right to freedom of expression, the Court of Appeal would have to examine whether the applicant ’ s allegations had been justified or not. It had further to be taken into account that the allegations had been made during a staff meeting. While it was true that criticism made in this context could occasionally be exaggerated or polemic without giving the employer a ground for dismissal, this right was limited by the obligation not to disturb peace in the office. It had to be taken into account in the applicant ’ s favour that the staff meeting concerned the suppression of the applicant ’ s field of work and that the atmosphere had been rather tense. However, this did not justify neglecting the fact that the allegation of perversion of justice did not concern the subject matter of the staff meeting, but a single incident which dated back several years and had not been mentioned by the applicant since 1997. The applicant did not make use of the possibility of informing the Mayor about his legal concerns regarding the Deputy Mayor ’ s decision. At the time of the staff meeting, the decision dated back such a long time that an attempt to put the decision into question must have lacked the prospect of success. Accordingly, it appeared that the applicant ’ s statement was rather aimed at attacking the Deputy Mayor."

Based on a detailed examination of the factual and legal situation in 1995/1996, the Labour Court of Appeal considered that the decision taken by the Deputy Mayor at that time had been lawful. The applicant ’ s written submissions of 17 December 1998 demonstrated that he was not willing to accept and implement politically legitimate decisions, if they concerned sanctions for misuse of property by house owners. The content of the letter to the editor (see paragraph 11, above) contained value judgments which did not amount to insult. However, the Deputy Mayor could not be expected to maintain daily co-operation with the applicant after reading this letter in which he had been described as incompetent.

The court observed that the applicant was currently working in the Public Procurement Office and that there was no negative information about his conduct. This was temporary employment which the applicant had obtained by court order in separate proceedings. The applicant had expressed his readiness to accept employment even at a lower level. However, the Labour Court of Appeal considered that the applicant would not have changed his attitude without his dismissal from office. The Municipality could reasonably expect that the applicant would have carried on with his self-righteous attitude if he had not been dismissed.

This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ....

As the applicant association had not claimed to have been party to the transfer of a building plot, it could not base its complaint on that status.

The Constitutional Court added that, in accordance with its established case-law, Article 10 did not require the State to grant access to information or to make information available of its own motion.

The Commission had therefore rightly taken the view that the applicant association ’ s request did not fall within the scope of section 1 of the Information Act.

While it is not for the Court to establish in which manner the Commission could and should have granted the applicant association access to its decisions, it finds that a complete refusal to give it access to any of its decisions was disproportionate. The Commission, which, by its own choice, held an information monopoly in respect of its decisions, thus made it impossible for the applicant association to carry out its research in respect of one of the nine Austrian Länder, namely Tyrol, and to participate in a meaningful manner in the legislative process concerning amendments of real property transaction law in Tyrol.

Austria (judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, p.37, § 4), the second limb of Article 5 § 3 does not give judicial authorities a choice between either bringing an accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release pending trial. Until conviction, he must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continuing detention ceases to be reasonable (see McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 41, ECHR 2006- ... )."

To this end they must, paying due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of the above-mentioned requirement of public interest justifying a departure from the rule in Article 5 and must set them out in their decisions on the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the established facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3 (see, for example, Labita v.

The Court must then establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were “relevant” and “sufficient”, the Court must also be satisfied that the national authorities displayed “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings. The complexity and special characteristics of the investigation are factors to be considered in this respect (see, for example, Scott v. Spain, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2399-2400, § 74, and I.A. v. France, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, p. 2978, § 102)."

For at least an initial period, the existence of reasonable suspicion may justify detention but there comes a moment when this is no longer enough. As the question whether or not a period of detention is reasonable cannot be assessed in the abstract but must be assessed in each case according to its special features, there is no fixed time-frame applicable to each case (see McKay, cited above, § 45).",

In respect of the latter, they referred to the fact that the applicant had not confessed. The domestic courts further considered that there had been a risk that the applicant, if released, might exert pressure on P.S., a co-defendant who had incriminated him (see paragraph 13 above). They also invoked the risk of the applicant going into hiding, without however specifying the grounds for such suspicion.

In this respect, the Court recalls that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the charges against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such a risk existed. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v.

As regards the risk of obstruction of the proceedings, the Court notes that in its decision of 15 January 2001 the Katowice Regional Court held that such risk was justified by the fact that the applicant had not confessed. In so far as the domestic courts appear to have drawn adverse inferences from the fact that the applicant had not confessed, the Court considers that their reasoning showed a manifest disregard for the principle of the presumption of innocence and cannot, in any circumstances, be relied on as a legitimate ground for deprivation of the applicant ’ s liberty (see Górski v. Poland, no. 28904/02, § 58, 4 October 2005; Leszczak v. Poland, no. 36576/03, § 48, 7 March 2006 ). Secondly, the judicial authorities considered that there had been a risk that the applicant might interfere with the course of the proceedings by exerting pressure on P.S., a co-defendant who had testified against them. The Court observes that it was legitimate for the authorities to consider that factor as capable of justifying the applicant ’ s detention at the initial stages of the proceedings.

In that regard the Court would also point out that, although such a potential danger may exist where an accused is charged with a serious offence and where the sentence faced is one of long term of imprisonment, the degree of that risk cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the offence and the anticipated sentence (see Muller v.

The presumption of innocence will be violated if a judicial decision or a statement by a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved guilty according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A premature expression of such an opinion by the tribunal itself will inevitably run foul of the said presumption (see, among other authorities, Deweer v.

It has acknowledged that in cases where an applicant was an important political figure at the time of the alleged offence the highest State officials, including the Prosecutor General, were required to keep the public informed of the alleged offence and the ensuing criminal proceedings.

The Court has emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence. Nevertheless, whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see, inter alia, Adolf v.

                "60. Press freedom is of cardinal importance in a democratic society, the press having both a right and a duty to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest and concern. Article 10 of the Convention does not, however, guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern. Under the terms of paragraph 2 of the Article the exercise of this freedom carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the press. These “duties and responsibilities” are significant when, as in the present case, there is a question of undermining the “rights of others”. Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention X had a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], cited above, § 65). By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism ( see Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ I)."

In 1997 he wrote an article about criminal proceedings which were then pending before the Turunseutu District Court ( käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten ). Those proceedings were public in nature. A defendant, X, was charged with various counts of tax fraud and aggravated fraud for allegedly deceiving the Social Insurance Institution ( kansaneläkelaitos, folkpensionsanstalten ) and insurance companies. The article was published in issue no. 6/ 19 97 of the magazine Alibi, and entitled: “It seemed legal, but... a woman entrepreneur cheated to obtain a pension of over 2 million marks?” ( In Finnish: Näytti lailliselta, mutta ... yrittäjärouva huijasi yli 2 miljoonan eläkkeen? ). The article did not mention X ’ s name. In the magazine ’ s table of contents, however, her first name was mentioned. The article included a reproduction of an article which had been published eight years previously with two photographs of X. That article, written by the first applicant, had been published in another magazine and mentioned X ’ s full name and included two photographs of her, one taken inside her home and another in her garden. The article was about a house purchased by the applicant which turned out to be full of rising damp. This situation naturally made her extremely miserable as she had spent her money on an uninhabitable house."

On 18 December 1997, however, the Espoo District Court dismissed the charges. X appealed to the Helsinki Court of Appeal ( hovioikeus, hovrätten ), which upheld the judgment on 1 April 1999. X was ordered to reimburse the applicants ’ legal costs."

She requested compensation for non-pecuniary damage amounting to 250,000 Finnish marks (FIM ) (approximately 42,047 euros (EUR)). In the alternative, she claimed compensation for the publication of her picture and non-pecuniary damages amounting to FIM 125,000 (EUR 21,023).

The case thus amounted to defamation, as set out in Chapter 27 of the Penal Code ( rikoslaki, strafflagen ). The court found that other parts of the article were not defamatory. Under the Tort Liability Act ( vahingonkorvauslaki, skadeståndslagen; Act no. 412/1974 ), the court ordered the applicants jointly and severally to pay X FIM 80,000 (EUR 13,455) for non-pecuniary damage and FIM 27,554 (EUR 4,634) for pecuniary damage, and to pay her legal costs.

The Supreme Court ruled that, in line with the grounds of the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment, the applicants were not guilty of defamation. It found, however, that by attaching the said illustration (in Finnish: kuvitus; that is by reproducing the old article which included X ’ s name and photographs ), the applicants had violated her right to privacy, and ordered them jointly to pay FIM 20,000 (EUR 3,364) for non-pecuniary damage together with interest from the service of the summonses in 1997 and to reimburse her legal costs.

                "According to this provision of law, making public [an article that discusses ] a person ’ s actions in public office or function, in business life, in a political or other comparable activity, is not to be considered an invasion of privacy if the reporting is necessary to address a matter of social importance. As noted in the travaux préparatoires (HE no. 84/1997 vp ... ) this is relevant chiefly in domains where decision-making takes place or in which the circumstances in reality may affect the every-day life of several persons or which have relevance of principle. According to the travaux préparatoires, such domains are first and foremost the attendance to a public office or function, business life and political activity. According to the said provision, what is essential is whether there is a significant social need to discuss the acts of the person concerned by making public facts which would otherwise belong to the sphere protected by the right to respect for private life.",
                "The criminal case, which has been the object of the article published in the Alibi magazine, has concerned, inter alia, the question whether [ X ] in order to obtain an unlawful financial benefit, by concealing that she received her livelihood as an entrepreneur, had misled the Social Insurance Institution and the insurance companies to grant her a disability pension thereby causing them economic loss. The acts mentioned in the charge related to [X ’ s] actions as an entrepreneur in a relatively small cleaning firm. Although the criminal case concerned substantial financial benefits, it was not a case which, viewed on its own, was of such general public interest that there would have been grounds to reproduce, as part of an article and without [X ’ s] consent, another article that included her name and photograph. Although the underlying purpose of the article might have been to draw attention to the abuse of social benefits in general by using an individual case and thus to a negative social phenomenon, it was not necessary or justified to publish without authorisation an illustration revealing the identity of an individual private person charged with or convicted of such an offence and in a similar position to [X].",
                "Thus, [the first applicant], who wrote the article in question and intentionally used as an illustration the afore-mentioned earlier published article written by him and the photograph of X in that connection, and [the second applicant], who in his capacity as the magazine ’ s editor-in-chief approved the publication of the article, have through their acts without a legal right by the use of a mass medium publicly spread information, an insinuation or photograph depicting the private life of [ X ] which was conducive to causing her damage or suffering.",
                "Whether or not the fact that [ X ] was recognisable was due to a mistake or other technical factor when the magazine was printed has no relevance in the legal assessment of the acts of [ the first and the second applicants ] since the article in question together with its illustration has been made public without seeing to and making sure that the typography of the article did not disclose [ X ’ s ] identity. ”"

Thus, it had not been necessary to refer to his position as head of the fire department or to his marriage to the suspect in order to give an account of the offence. The fact that the information had previously been published in print did not relieve the defendants of their responsibility to ensure, before publishing the information again, that the article did not contain information insulting the persons mentioned in it. The mere fact that the interview with the head of the fire department had been published in the newspaper did not justify the conclusion that he had also consented to its publication in the periodical. Repeating a violation did not necessarily cause the same amount of damage and suffering as the initial violation. The readers of the newspaper and the periodical were partly different, and the circulation of the newspaper apparently did not entirely coincide with that of the periodical. Therefore, and considering the differences in the content and tone of the articles, the Supreme Court found it established that the article published in the periodical was conducive to causing the head of the fire department additional mental suffering. The events reported in the article did not concern the plaintiff ’ s conduct in the performance of his duties as head of the fire department and it had not been necessary to mention the complainant ’ s name and profession for the purpose of discussing a matter involving significant public interest or reporting on the offences. By associating the complainant ’ s name and profession with the offences in question, the article had unlawfully spread information and insinuations concerning his private life likely to cause him damage and suffering. The disclosure of the complainant ’ s name and the emphasis on his occupation had amounted to an insult.

The gravity of the crime is also an obvious relevant factor. The central question is who is a public figure. There have been cases where spouses, girlfriends or boyfriends of public figures have argued that they were not, and won their case in court. Recently following a school massacre the Minister of the Interior disclosed the name of the killer in a live televised press conference, a few hours after the incident. The police also recently published the name and picture of a man accused of (and later convicted of) spreading HIV, as well as the names and pictures of two escaped convicts. The basis of the decision was public security. Many companies have their own code of conduct. According to most of the companies the name of a convicted person can be published if the sentence is two years or more in prison, that is, where the crime is serious.

A public debate had taken place, in which those judgments had been criticised. Furthermore, in December 2005 the Supreme Court had decided a case ( no. 2005:136; see paragraph 31 above ) which concerned another article published in the Alibi magazine. In that case, the majority of the Supreme Court judges had taken the view that the magazine had been entitled to publish the name of a convicted criminal. The incompatibility of that Supreme Court judgment with its judgment in the present case was, in itself, sufficient reason to find a violation. The applicants also observed that it was difficult for the Finnish media to report on legal proceedings because the domestic courts ’ decisions had made it difficult to predict when disclosure of the identity of a defendant or convicted person was within the sphere of freedom of expression and the public nature of legal proceedings and when, in contrast, disclosure constituted a criminal offence giving rise to a liability to pay damages. In the present case the Supreme Court had not even mentioned the Convention or Article 10 thereof. The names of accused and convicted persons were published daily in the Finnish media. There were no legal provisions defining when a defendant ’ s identity could be revealed. In the present case, the applicant ’ s actions had complied with the Guidelines for Journalists and no complaints had been lodged with the Mass Media Council ( julkisen sanan neuvosto, opinionsnämnden för massmedier )."

The District Court had held at least nine hearings before the impugned article was published. The applicants were surprised that neither the Government nor the Supreme Court had mentioned the principle of the public nature of legal proceedings, given that the case related exclusively to the disclosure of the identity of a defendant in such proceedings. Finnish legislation contained no provision which required the accused person ’ s consent prior to publication of his or her name or picture. At the relevant time the Constitution Act had not included a separate provision on the protection of privacy. The defendant ’ s identity in a trial had never before been considered as belonging to a person ’ s private life within the meaning of Chapter 27, Article 3a, of the Penal Code, and this principle still applied to public legal proceedings. For example, in its decision no. 2005:136 the Supreme Court majority had reached the opposite conclusion with regard to the publication of a convicted person ’ s name, ruling that “a criminal offence is not the private matter of the individual who committed the offence”. In the applicants ’ view, the Government defined the concept of private life too broadly when they claimed that information was part of private life unless specifically found otherwise. This claim contradicted the provisions of the Public Nature of Court Proceedings Act."

                "45. The provision on invasion of privacy required that, in order to constitute a criminal offence, the publication of the information had to be unlawful and intentional and had to relate to a person ’ s private life. The impugned article met none of these criteria. Firstly, the publication of public information, namely a person ’ s identity, was a legal right. Secondly, being accused of an offence in legal proceedings was not part of a person ’ s private life. Thirdly, the requirement of intent in criminal law was not met when a reporter had no idea that the disclosure of a defendant ’ s identity could constitute a criminal offence. The Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the present case was probably the first in Finnish history in which the opposite view had been upheld. The appellate court had found, in accordance with legal precedent until the present case, that reporting on charges which were the subject of public legal proceedings was legitimate, even though the information published could cause anguish to the defendant. The Guidelines for Journalists did not meet the “prescribed by law” requirement since they could not be applied when deciding whether an act constituted a criminal offence. The applicants did not deny the ethical demands placed upon the profession by the Guidelines. They observed that, despite their legal rights, they had sought to protect X ’ s identity in the article by crossing out her surname and her picture, but because of a printer ’ s error, her face and surname had been shown."

There was no pressing social need to depart from the established practice and regulations. In a democratic State, legal proceedings were public and a defendant ’ s identity was public information; this also served to ensure the legal protection of defendants. The question of whether the disclosure of X ’ s identity had been necessary for the purpose of dealing with a socially important matter was irrelevant, since the provisions on the public nature of legal proceedings were not associated with matters of social significance. In any event, the proceedings against X had significance for society. Offences of tax and accounting fraud did not belong to private life, and fraud concerning a disability pension amounting to almost FIM 2.5 million was a major offence. X had ultimately received a heavy sentence. The criminal charges against X had been significant enough to justify the publication of her name."

In the present case, X herself had taken the initiative of having an article about herself published in another magazine eight years previously.

                "58. As to whether the interference was “ prescribed by law ”, the applicants argued that the names of accused persons were published daily in the Finnish media and that they had not therefore been able to foresee that the publication of X ’ s name and photograph would render them liable in damages. The Government argued that the publication of names had never been usual in Finland in news reports on offences and that it had not been considered consistent with good journalistic practice to publish names of suspects or accused persons. The Court does not discern any ambiguity as to the contents of the relevant provision of the Penal Code (the spreading of information, an insinuation or an image depicting the private life of another person which was conducive to causing suffering qualified as invasion of privacy; see paragraph 22 above ). Nor was Chapter 5, section 6, of the Tort Liability Act unclear (see paragraph 21 above). Having regard also to the domestic case-law on the subject, the possibility that a sanction would be imposed was not unforeseeable. The position taken in the Supreme Court ’ s subsequent decision of 2005 does not detract from this position as the circumstances of that case concerning the conviction of a person of violent crime degrading the victim ’ s human dignity (see paragraph 3 1 above) were significantly different. The Court therefore concludes that the interference was thus “prescribed by law” (see Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611/96, § 34, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; Selistö v. Finland, no. 56767/00, § 34, 16 November 2004 and Karhuvaara and Iltalehti v. Finland, no. 53678/00, § 43, ECHR 2004 ‑ X).

In assessing whether such a “need” exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 58, ECHR 1999 ‑ III )."

Press freedom is of cardinal importance in a democratic society, the press having both a right and a duty to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest and concern. Article 10 of the Convention does not, however, guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern. Under the terms of paragraph 2 of the Article the exercise of this freedom carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the press. These “duties and responsibilities” are significant when, as in the present case, there is a question of undermining the “rights of others”. Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention X had a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], cited above, § 65). By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism ( see Fressoz and Roire v.

In another case, however, the Court attached particular importance to the fact that the subject in question was a news item of “major public concern” and that the published photographs “did not disclose any details of [the] private life” of the person in question (see Krone Verlag GmbH & Co. KG, cited above, § 37) and held that there had been a violation of Article 10. Similarly, in a case concerning the publication by President Mitterrand ’ s former private doctor of a book containing revelations about the President ’ s state of health, the Court held that “the more time that elapsed, the more the public interest in discussion of the history of President Mitterrand ’ s two terms of office prevailed over the requirements of protecting the President ’ s rights with regard to medical confidentiality” (see Editions Plon v.

In this connection, the Court notes that the Finnish Guidelines for Journalists, as in force at the relevant time, stated that the publication of a name and other identifying information in this context was justified only if a significant public interest was involved (see paragraph 32 above)."

The pictures of X were accompanied by a question (see paragraph 8 above) : “ It seemed legal, but ... a woman entrepreneur cheated to obtain a pension of over 2 million marks? ” Reading the 1997 article as a whole, the Court cannot find that this statement was excessive or misleading as it was clearly phrased as a question. Furthermore, it is of importance that the depicted events and quotations in the article were taken from the public prosecutor ’ s bill of indictment, which had become a public document the moment it was received by the District Court. In this case it is not in dispute that the reporting on the criminal case was based on facts.

That being said, in the earlier article the applicant had willingly shared with the readers her personal experiences and had consented in this connection to having her photograph published. The 1997 article must be considered to have reproduced an article which was irrelevant to the subject under discussion, giving X ’ s name and picture, which were thereby expressly communicated to the general public. It is however not for this Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted by journalists ( see Jersild v.

The criminal case brought against X was selected as an example illustrating the problems involved. While it is perfectly legitimate to use individual cases to highlight a more general problem, the question is whether the applicants went too far when they communicated X ’ s identity to the public. It is plain that X was not a public figure or a politician but an ordinary person who was the subject of criminal proceedings (see Schwabe v. Austria, 28 August 1992, § 32, Series A no. 242 ‑ B ). The fact that she ran a relatively small cleaning firm and had given an interview eight years previously to a magazine, which had come about in circumstances apparently not discussed during the domestic proceedings or at any length before the Court, does not mean that she had knowingly entered the public arena (see, mutatis mutandis, Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, § 75, Series A no. 294 ‑ B ). X ’ s status as an ordinary person enlarges the zone of interaction which may fall within the scope of private life.

                "27. As regards the prohibition on reporting on the pending claim for damages, the Court accepts that the allegation contained in Ms P. ’ s letter – that Judge Baskova had taken advantage of her office and connections in the judiciary – could indeed be damaging to Judge Baskova ’ s reputation and to the authority of the judicial system. Nevertheless, although the injunction corresponded to the legitimate aim it sought to achieve, in the Court ’ s view, its scope was excessively broad and disproportionate to that aim. It must be noted that the Russian legal system has no equivalent of the sub judice rule and the right to report on proceedings in open court is not in principle restricted. The Government ’ s argument that, the injunction notwithstanding, the proceedings on the claim for damages had retained their public character is irrelevant because the applicant alleged a violation of the right to impart information rather than a violation of the right to a public hearing. The Court reiterates in this connection that the duty of the press to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest extends to the reporting and commenting on court proceedings which contribute to their publicity and are thus perfectly consonant with the requirement under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that hearings be public (see News Verlags GmbH & Co. KG, cited above, § 56). It is relevant for the Court ’ s assessment that the scope of the injunction was not limited to the specific statement about Judge Baskova ’ s attempt to secure undue advantage in the proceedings, but rather restricted, in a general and unqualified manner, the possibility of printing any material whatsoever relating to these proceedings. The Court is unable to accept that such a sweeping prohibition was “ necessary in a democratic society ”. It agrees with the applicant that the injunction at issue was a disservice to the authority of the judiciary because it reduced transparency of the proceedings and may have given rise to doubts about the court ’ s impartiality, for “justice must not only be done; it must also be seen to be done” (see De Cubber v. Belgium, judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, p. 14, § 26). It is also a matter of particular concern for the Court that the injunction listed as one of its purposes the necessity to prevent the newspaper from publishing materials “stating the opposite view”. It reiterates that the possibility of expressing different views is the very essence of pluralism, without which there is no “democratic society”."

In both the defamation and compensation proceedings she had acted as an ordinary plaintiff rather than in her judicial capacity and the injunction had therefore not been required for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. The authority of the judiciary would have been better served if proceedings had been transparent and the general public had been able to form an opinion on them. Furthermore, the scope of the interlocutory injunction had been greater than that of the defamation claim. Judge Baskova had only challenged the statement that she had used her office to her advantage, the remainder of the publication had not been contested. However, the injunction had prohibited any mention of the traffic accident or of the proceedings in which Judge Baskova had been involved. This created a paradoxical situation where the applicant had been prevented from reporting on ongoing civil proceedings which had been conducted in public and had been open to anyone. Obviously, such a broad prohibition had not been “ necessary in a democratic society ”."

The Government submitted that an interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression had been required for maintaining the authority of the judiciary, since it had been alleged that Judge Baskova had used her office to secure undue advantage in the civil proceedings. The domestic courts had determined that the reputation of Judge Baskova required heightened protection and thus the interference had pursued a “ pressing social need ”. The interim measure had been proportionate to the legitimate aim as it had been strictly limited in its scope and time. Having regard to the accusatory nature of the allegation contained in the publication, a failure to indicate interim measures could have led to further publications and greater damage to Judge Baskova ’ s reputation. Accordingly, the application of such interim measures had been of greater public importance than affording the applicant the possibility of “endless stirring-up of doubts about circumstances which were simultaneously being examined in judicial proceedings”. Contrary to the applicant ’ s claim, the injunction had not affected the publicity of civil proceedings because they had been open to anyone wishing to attend them and also because the applicant had had a vested interest in their outcome. Furthermore, the Government referred to the Court ’ s finding to the effect that “the limits of permissible comment on pending ... proceedings may not extend to statements which are likely to prejudice, whether intentionally or not, the chances of a person receiving a fair trial or to undermine the confidence of the public in the role of the courts in the administration of justice” (see News Verlags GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria, no. 31457/96, § 56, ECHR 2000 ‑ I ). In the present case the Government considered that the purpose of the injunction had been the prevention of damage to Judge Baskova ’ s right to a fair trial and to her authority as a judge. The applicant could have unreasonably undermined the judge ’ s authority through her continued reporting on a dispute to which she had been a party and which was being considered by courts. If she had had doubts about the conduct of the judge, she could have applied to the judges ’ qualification panel with a complaint."

Austria, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, § 41). Subject to paragraph 2, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. Given the essential role played by the press in a democratic society, its duty is to impart – in a manner consistent with its duties and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest. Not only does it have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them (see, among many other authorities, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, §§ 59 and 62, ECHR 1999-III, and Colombani and Others v. France, no. 51279/99, § 55, ECHR 2002-V)."

As to the existence of an interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression, the Court reiterates that, in so far as the preliminary injunction has the effect of preventing journalists from engaging in research and publications on the subject to which it applied, the journalists may claim to be “victims” of that measure (see, as a classic authority, Times Newspaper Ltd., The Sunday Times, Harold Evans v. the United Kingdom, no. 6538/74, Commission decision of 21 March 1975, Decisions and Reports 2, p. 90; and Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, § § 9 and 49, Series A no. 216 ). In the instant case the interlocutory injunction was issued in the framework of the proceedings, to which the applicant was a party as a co- defendant. It prohibited the editor ’ s office from publishing any materials by any person, including the applicant, in so far as they concerned the road accident and the claim for damages (see paragraph 12 above).

As regards the legitimate aim of the interference, the parties agreed that one of them was the protection of the reputation of others. The Government further advanced that the interference had also pursued the aim of the maintaining of the authority of the judiciary. The applicant contested this argument. The Court, for its part, is prepared to accept that the injunction envisaged “ maintaining the authority of the judiciary” as one of its legitimate aims, since this phrase includes the protection of the rights of litigants and since the purpose of the injunction was to enable the defamation action to be heard without the plaintiff ’ s rights in the meantime being prejudiced by the commission of the very act which it was the purpose of the action to prevent (compare Observer and Guardian, cited above, § 56).

France, no. 58148/00, § 42, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV; Association Ekin v. France, no. 39288/98, § 56, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII; and Observer and Guardian, cited above, § 60).

Although the domestic courts have held the prohibition to be justified as a means of protecting the reputation of others and maintaining the authority of the judiciary, the reasons given by way of justification do not appear sufficient to the Court.

As regards the prohibition on information about the factual circumstances of the traffic accident in which Mrs Baskova had been involved, the Court notes at the outset that the applicant did not put forward any specific version of the incident as the true or the only possible one but rather presented several possible sequences of events as related by Mr and Ms P., by Mrs Baskova in her statement of claim, by the traffic police and by eyewitnesses. Not one of these versions was contested as untrue or inaccurate in the defamation proceedings, the scope of which was limited to the statement about Judge Baskova ’ s connections in the judiciary (see paragraph 9 above). In issuing the injunction in the defamation proceedings, the District Court merely referred to the fact that a technical study had been commissioned, without explaining why it considered that further research into, or publications on, the factual circumstances of the road accident would be prejudicial for the outcome of the proceedings. Moreover, since Mrs Baskova was involved in the accident as a private person, the Court finds that the injunction on further publications about the accident could not have been relevant for the purpose of maintaining the authority of the judiciary."

                "27. As regards the prohibition on reporting on the pending claim for damages, the Court accepts that the allegation contained in Ms P. ’ s letter – that Judge Baskova had taken advantage of her office and connections in the judiciary – could indeed be damaging to Judge Baskova ’ s reputation and to the authority of the judicial system. Nevertheless, although the injunction corresponded to the legitimate aim it sought to achieve, in the Court ’ s view, its scope was excessively broad and disproportionate to that aim. It must be noted that the Russian legal system has no equivalent of the sub judice rule and the right to report on proceedings in open court is not in principle restricted. The Government ’ s argument that, the injunction notwithstanding, the proceedings on the claim for damages had retained their public character is irrelevant because the applicant alleged a violation of the right to impart information rather than a violation of the right to a public hearing. The Court reiterates in this connection that the duty of the press to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest extends to the reporting and commenting on court proceedings which contribute to their publicity and are thus perfectly consonant with the requirement under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that hearings be public (see News Verlags GmbH & Co. KG, cited above, § 56). It is relevant for the Court ’ s assessment that the scope of the injunction was not limited to the specific statement about Judge Baskova ’ s attempt to secure undue advantage in the proceedings, but rather restricted, in a general and unqualified manner, the possibility of printing any material whatsoever relating to these proceedings. The Court is unable to accept that such a sweeping prohibition was “ necessary in a democratic society ”. It agrees with the applicant that the injunction at issue was a disservice to the authority of the judiciary because it reduced transparency of the proceedings and may have given rise to doubts about the court ’ s impartiality, for “justice must not only be done; it must also be seen to be done” (see De Cubber v. Belgium, judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, p. 14, § 26). It is also a matter of particular concern for the Court that the injunction listed as one of its purposes the necessity to prevent the newspaper from publishing materials “stating the opposite view”. It reiterates that the possibility of expressing different views is the very essence of pluralism, without which there is no “democratic society”."

In this respect the Court's attention has been drawn, first and foremost, to the fact that the courts chose to impose a prison sentence of eight months on the applicant, which cannot but be regarded as a harsh measure. The Court notes that the first instance-court observed that the sentence was commensurate with the applicant's degree of guilt and with the seriousness of the offence. The assessment of its seriousness had been made having regard to the nature and importance of the interests protected by the provision of substantive criminal law applied in the case (see § 13 above). In the Court's view, this reasoning of the domestic court does not seem to address sufficiently the question of why it considered that the applicant's guilt was so grave, and why, in the particular circumstances of the case, the offence was considered serious enough to warrant eight months' imprisonment.",

Austria, judgment of 29 August 1997, Reports 1997-V, § 40). What is at stake as regards protection of the authority of the judiciary, is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the accused, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, and also in the public at large (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, Fey v.

It is the Court's assessment that the sentence of eight months' imprisonment was disproportionately severe. Even if it is in principle, for the national courts to fix the sentence, in view of the circumstances of the case, there are common standards which this Court has to ensure with the principle of proportionality. These standards are the gravity of the guilt, the seriousness of the offence and the repetition of the alleged offences."

Furthermore, the gravity of the offence was not such as to justify the punishment inflicted on the applicant. Moreover, it was for the first time that the applicant overstepped the bounds of the permissible criticism. Therefore, while a lesser punishment could well have been justified, the courts went beyond what constituted a “necessary” exception to the freedom of expression."

Denmark, 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, § 31; Janowski, cited above, § 30, ECHR 1999-I; and Nilsen and Johnsen v.

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court.

In particular, it must determine whether the interference in question was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among other authorities, Nikula v.

Obviously dissatisfied with that reply, on 15 November 1994 the applicant sent a further letter to the President of the Katowice Regional Court, complaining about the unidentified judge who had replied to his first letter. It is not open to doubt that the applicant used insulting words in his second letter. He stated that “irresponsible clowns” were placed in the Penitentiary Division of that court, and went on to shower further abuse upon the author of the reply complained of: “small ‑ time cretin”, “some fool”, “a limited individual”, “outstanding cretin” (see § 9 above).

In this respect the Court's attention has been drawn, first and foremost, to the fact that the courts chose to impose a prison sentence of eight months on the applicant, which cannot but be regarded as a harsh measure. The Court notes that the first instance-court observed that the sentence was commensurate with the applicant's degree of guilt and with the seriousness of the offence. The assessment of its seriousness had been made having regard to the nature and importance of the interests protected by the provision of substantive criminal law applied in the case (see § 13 above). In the Court's view, this reasoning of the domestic court does not seem to address sufficiently the question of why it considered that the applicant's guilt was so grave, and why, in the particular circumstances of the case, the offence was considered serious enough to warrant eight months' imprisonment.",

Austria, judgment of 29 August 1997, Reports 1997-V, § 40). What is at stake as regards protection of the authority of the judiciary, is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the accused, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, and also in the public at large (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, Fey v.

                "Therefore, the question in the case is not whether the applicant should have been punished for his letter to the Regional Court, but rather whether the punishment was appropriate or “necessary” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2. It is the Court's assessment that the sentence of eight months' imprisonment was disproportionately severe. Even if it is in principle, for the national courts to fix the sentence, in view of the circumstances of the case, there are common standards which this Court has to ensure with the principle of proportionality. These standards are the gravity of the guilt, the seriousness of the offence and the repetition of the alleged offences."

Furthermore, the gravity of the offence was not such as to justify the punishment inflicted on the applicant. Moreover, it was for the first time that the applicant overstepped the bounds of the permissible criticism.

With regard to online publications, it has previously held that user ‑ generated expressive activity on the Internet provides an unprecedented platform for the exercise of freedom of expression ( see Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 110, ECHR 2015 ). In the light of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information, the Internet plays an important role in enhancing the public ’ s access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general. It is furthermore true that the risk of harm posed by content and communications on the Internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms is certainly higher than that posed by the press, as unlawful speech, including hate speech and calls to violence, can be disseminated as never before, worldwide, in a matter of seconds, and sometimes remain persistently available online (ibid., §§ 110 and 133). At the same time, it is clear that the reach and thus potential impact of a statement released online with a small readership is certainly not the same as that of a statement published on mainstream or highly visited web pages. It is therefore essential for the assessment of a potential influence of an online publication to determine the scope of its reach to the public."

Although the access to the impugned statement had not been restricted, it drew seemingly very little public attention. Indeed, even a number of the applicant ’ s acquaintances remained unaware of it, and, it appears it was only the criminal prosecution of the applicant for his online publication that prompted the interest of the public towards his comment (see paragraph 18 above ). It is also important to note that, at the time of the events under examination, the applicant does not appear to have been a well-known blogger or a popular user of social media ( see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, § 168, ECHR 2016), let alone a public or influential figure (contrast, Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( dec. ), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001, and Féret, cited above, §§ 75 and 76 ), which fact could have attracted public attention to his comment and thus have enhanced the potential impact of the impugned statements.

Turning to the reasoning of the domestic courts, the Court observes that they focused on the nature of the wording used by the applicant, limiting their findings to the form and tenor of the speech. They did not try to analyse the impugned statements in the context of the relevant discussion and to find out which idea they sought to impart. Whilst holding that that the applicant ’ s offence was particularly “blatant and dangerous for national security” as running against “the fundamentals of the constitutional system and State security”, the courts provided no explanation for the reasons for that conclusion. They made no attempt to assess the potential of the statements at hand to provoke any harmful consequences, with due regard to the political and social background, against which they were made, and to the scope of their reach. The Court thus finds that, in reaching their conclusions, the domestic courts failed to take account of all facts and relevant factors.

Moreover, although sentencing is in principle a matter for the national courts, the imposition of a prison sentence for an offence in the area of a debate on an issue of legitimate public interest will be compatible with freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been seriously impaired, as, for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see Otegi Mondragon v. Spain, no. 2034/07, §§ 59-60, ECHR 2011); the Court has already found (see paragraph 78 above) that the applicant ’ s text was not likely to encourage violence."

In the present case, although the wording of the impugned statements was, indeed, offensive, insulting and virulent ( for which the applicant eventually apologised), they cannot be seen as stirring up base emotions or embedded prejudices in an attempt to incite hatred or violence against the Russian police officers; as the Court has noted in paragraph 71 above, it was rather the applicant ’ s emotional reaction to what he saw as an instance of an abusive conduct of the police personnel. The Court furthermore discerns no other elements, either in the domestic courts ’ decisions or in the Government ’ s submission, which would enable it to conclude that the applicant ’ s comment had the potential to provoke any violence with regard to the Russian police officers, and thus posed a clear and imminent danger which required the applicant ’ s criminal prosecution and conviction ( compare Gül and Others, cited above, § 42)."

While some of the above concepts may overlap, the Special Rapporteur considers the following elements to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred: real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression; intent of the speaker to incite discrimination, hostility or violence; and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred was expressed, given that international law prohibits some forms of speech for their consequences, and not for their content as such, because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another. Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website. Similarly, artistic expression should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context, given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence, discrimination or hostility.",

People protected under the term “social group” might include members of the police or politicians, neither of whom is typically perceived as an oppressed group or as sharing fundamental bonds of identity.

They stressed that the applicant ’ s comment had been generalised, aggressive and aimed at turning a reader against a specific social group – police officers, and therefore the applicant ’ s actions had undoubtedly posed a danger to society. In their view, the authorities ’ tolerance of such abusive expressions in respect of representatives of law ‑ enforcement agencies could undermine the latter ’ s authority and encourage the public to disregard them and disobey their orders. They furthermore pointed out that the relevant national legislation had conferred on the applicant the right to complain about any actions or omissions of a police officer if he considered that his rights or interests had been breached by such actions or omissions; however, he had never lodged any such complaints but had chosen instead to resort to a public appeal to have police officers physically exterminated."

It also refers to the quality of the law in question, which should be accessible to the persons concerned and foreseeable as to its effects, that is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the persons concerned – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail and to regulate their conduct (see, among many other authorities, Öztürk v. Turkey [GC], no. 22479/93, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI; Lindon, Otchakovsky -Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 41, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV; and Dilipak v.

It is true that the need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see, for instance, Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, § 64, ECHR 2004 ‑ I, and Altuğ Taner Akçam v. Turkey, no. 27520/07, § 87, 25 October 2011). The scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see, for instance, Lindon, Otchakovsky -Laurens and July, cited above, § 41). It may be assumed therefore that, even if generally formulated, the provision in question may be regarded as compatible with the “quality of law” requirement, if interpreted and applied by the domestic courts in a rigorous and consistent manner. The Court is furthermore mindful that its task is not to review domestic law in the abstract but to determine whether the way in which it was applied to the applicant gave rise to a breach of the Convention (see Perinçek, cited above, § 136)."

The Court recognises that in the area under consideration it may be difficult to frame laws with absolute precision and that a certain degree of flexibility may be called for to enable the Russian courts to assess whether a particular action can be considered as capable of stirring up hatred and enmity on the grounds listed in that Article (see Dmitriyevskiy v. Russia, no. 42168/06, § 80, 3 October 2017, and the authorities cited therein). It has consistently held that in any system of law, including criminal law, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, there will inevitably be a need for interpretation by the courts, whose judicial function is precisely to elucidate obscure points and dispel any doubts which may remain regarding the interpretation of legislation (see, for instance, Öztürk, cited above, § 55, and, mutatis mutandis, Jorgic v.

The applicant, in turn, pointed to a lack of relevant practice of the Russian courts (see paragraph 42 above). Indeed, it was not before 2010- 11, several years after the applicant had been convicted at final instance, that the highest courts in Russia addressed the problem with the interpretation of Article 282 of the Criminal Code and provided at least some guidance in that connection for the national courts (see paragraphs 31 - 32 above ).

As to the criteria applied by the courts in the applicant ’ s case, this question relates rather to the relevance and sufficiency of the grounds given by them to justify his conviction, and should be addressed in the assessment of whether the interference with the applicant ’ s rights secured by Article 10 of the Convention was necessary in a democratic society."

The Court has stated, in particular, that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to Article 10 § 2, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see, among the recent authorities, Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 124, ECHR 2015; Pentikäinen v. Finland [GC], no. 11882/10, § 87, ECHR 2015; Perinçek, cited above, § 196; and Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 48, ECHR 2016)."

It is the Court ’ s consistent approach to require very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on such debate, for broad restrictions imposed in individual cases would undoubtedly affect respect for the freedom of expression in general in the State concerned (see Feldek v. Slovakia, no. 29032/95, § 83, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII, and Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV)."

Admittedly, it is first of all for the national authorities to assess whether there is such a need capable of justifying that interference and, to that end, they enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. However, the margin of appreciation is coupled with supervision by the Court both of the law and the decisions applying the law, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see, among many other authorities, Karataş v.

In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities, basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts, applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Chauvy and Others v.

With regard, more specifically, to the interference with freedom of expression in cases concerning expressions alleged to stir up or justify violence, hatred or intolerance, the Court reiterates that tolerance and respect for the equal dignity of all human beings constitute the foundations of a democratic, pluralistic society. That being so, as a matter of principle it may be considered necessary in democratic societies to sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify violence or hatred based on intolerance provided that any “formalities”, “conditions”, “restrictions” or “penalties” imposed are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, mutatis mutandis, Gündüz v. Turkey, no. 35071/97, § 40, ECHR 2003 ‑ XI ). It certainly remains open to the relevant State authorities to adopt, in their capacity as guarantors of public order, measures, even of a criminal-law nature, intended to react appropriately and without excess to such remarks (see Erdoğdu, cited above, § 62). Moreover, where such remarks incite violence against an individual, a public official or a sector of the population, the State enjoys a wider margin of appreciation when examining the need for an interference with freedom of expression (see, among many other authorities, Öztürk, cited above, § 66; and Ceylan v.

The domestic courts found, in particular, that the impugned statements, “generalised, impersonal [and] insulting”, were “imbued with hostility, hatred and humiliation of dignity” of police officers, arguing that they were inferior and ascribing to them humiliating characteristics (see paragraphs 22 - 23 above ). The Court observes in that connection, that the text in question is, indeed, framed in very strong words. In particular, its first part refers to police officers as “cops” and largely uses vulgar, derogatory and vituperative terms, labelling them all as “lowbrows and hoodlums ” as well as “the dumbest and least educated representatives of the animal world”. The second part of the text expresses a wish to see a ceremony of annihilation of “infidel cops” by fire in ovens “like [those] at Auschwitz”, with a view to “cleansing society of [the] cop-hoodlum filth” (see paragraph 13 above)."

Turkey, no. 4870/02, § 41, 8 June 2010, and Grebneva and Alisimchik v. Russia, no. 8918/05, § 52, 22 November 2016, and the authorities cited therein)."

The Court stresses that not every remark which may be perceived as offensive or insulting by particular individuals or their groups justifies a criminal conviction in the form of imprisonment. Whilst such sentiments are understandable, they alone cannot set the limits of freedom of expression. It is only by a careful examination of the context in which the offending, insulting or aggressive words appear that one can draw a meaningful distinction between shocking and offensive language which is protected by Article 10 of the Convention and that which forfeits its right to tolerance in a democratic society (see, for a similar approach, Vajnai v. Hungary, no. 33629/06, §§ 53 and 57, ECHR 2008).

It is thus clear that the discussion raised the issue of the alleged involvement of the police in silencing and oppressing the political opposition in the period of an electoral campaign and therefore concerned a matter of general and public concern, a sphere in which restrictions of freedom of expression are to be strictly construed (see paragraph 62 above). The Court furthermore reaffirms that it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely (see Długołęcki v.

The reference to the Auschwitz concentration camps and to the Nazis ’ killing practices as an example to be followed is particularly striking. Arguably, in particular, Holocaust survivors and especially those who escaped Auschwitz might be offended by such a statement. In the latter connection, the Court observes, however, that the protection of the rights of Holocaust survivors was never put forward by the domestic courts among the reasons for the applicant ’ s conviction. Moreover, the text in question does not reveal – and it has never been held otherwise by the domestic courts, nor has it been argued by the Government – any intention to praise or justify the Nazis ’ practices used at Auschwitz. The Court has previously held that a reference to the Auschwitz concentration camps and the Holocaust alone is insufficient to justify an interference with a freedom of expression, and that its impact on the rights of others should be assessed with due regard to the historical and social context in which that statement was made (see, for that approach, Annen v. Germany, no. 3690/10, § 63, 26 November 2015).

It is furthermore true that the risk of harm posed by content and communications on the Internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms is certainly higher than that posed by the press, as unlawful speech, including hate speech and calls to violence, can be disseminated as never before, worldwide, in a matter of seconds, and sometimes remain persistently available online (ibid., §§ 110 and 133). At the same time, it is clear that the reach and thus potential impact of a statement released online with a small readership is certainly not the same as that of a statement published on mainstream or highly visited web pages.

The courts, however, do not appear to have ever attempted to assess whether Mr B.S. ’ s blog was generally highly visited, or to establish the actual number of users who had accessed that blog during the period when the applicant ’ s comment remained available."

The Court observes in the above connection that the applicant ’ s comment had remained online for one month before the applicant, who found out the reasons for a criminal case against him, removed it (see paragraph 15 above). Although the access to the impugned statement had not been restricted, it drew seemingly very little public attention. Indeed, even a number of the applicant ’ s acquaintances remained unaware of it, and, it appears it was only the criminal prosecution of the applicant for his online publication that prompted the interest of the public towards his comment (see paragraph 18 above ). It is also important to note that, at the time of the events under examination, the applicant does not appear to have been a well-known blogger or a popular user of social media ( see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, § 168, ECHR 2016), let alone a public or influential figure (contrast, Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( dec. ), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001, and Féret, cited above, §§ 75 and 76 ), which fact could have attracted public attention to his comment and thus have enhanced the potential impact of the impugned statements. In such circumstances the Court considers that the potential of the applicant ’ s comment to reach the public and thus to influence its opinion was very limited."

                "82. Turning to the reasoning of the domestic courts, the Court observes that they focused on the nature of the wording used by the applicant, limiting their findings to the form and tenor of the speech. They did not try to analyse the impugned statements in the context of the relevant discussion and to find out which idea they sought to impart. Whilst holding that that the applicant ’ s offence was particularly “blatant and dangerous for national security” as running against “the fundamentals of the constitutional system and State security”, the courts provided no explanation for the reasons for that conclusion. They made no attempt to assess the potential of the statements at hand to provoke any harmful consequences, with due regard to the political and social background, against which they were made, and to the scope of their reach. The Court thus finds that, in reaching their conclusions, the domestic courts failed to take account of all facts and relevant factors. Therefore the reasons cannot be regarded as “relevant and sufficient” to justify the interference with the applicant ’ s freedom of expression."

            [
                "83. It further observes that the applicant was convicted in criminal proceedings and given a suspended sentence of one year ’ s imprisonment. The Court reiterates in this connection that a criminal conviction is a serious sanction, having regard to the existence of other means of intervention and rebuttal (see Perinçek, cited above, § 273). Moreover, although sentencing is in principle a matter for the national courts, the imposition of a prison sentence for an offence in the area of a debate on an issue of legitimate public interest will be compatible with freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been seriously impaired, as, for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see Otegi Mondragon v. Spain, no. 2034/07, §§ 59-60, ECHR 2011); the Court has already found (see paragraph 78 above) that the applicant ’ s text was not likely to encourage violence."

            [
                "84. The Court has noted in paragraph 66 above that it is the interplay between the various factors rather than any of them taken in isolation that leads it to a conclusion that a particular statement constitutes an expression which cannot claim protection of Article 10. In the present case, although the wording of the impugned statements was, indeed, offensive, insulting and virulent ( for which the applicant eventually apologised), they cannot be seen as stirring up base emotions or embedded prejudices in an attempt to incite hatred or violence against the Russian police officers; as the Court has noted in paragraph 71 above, it was rather the applicant ’ s emotional reaction to what he saw as an instance of an abusive conduct of the police personnel. The Court furthermore discerns no other elements, either in the domestic courts ’ decisions or in the Government ’ s submission, which would enable it to conclude that the applicant ’ s comment had the potential to provoke any violence with regard to the Russian police officers, and thus posed a clear and imminent danger which required the applicant ’ s criminal prosecution and conviction ( compare Gül and Others, cited above, § 42)."

The Court stresses in the above connection that it is vitally important that criminal law provisions directed against expressions that stir up, promote or justify violence, hatred or intolerance clearly and precisely define the scope of relevant offences, and that those provisions be strictly construed in order to avoid a situation where the State ’ s discretion to prosecute for such offences becomes too broad and potentially subject to abuse through selective enforcement."

The Court notes first of all that before the domestic courts the applicant challenged the decision by the Pravieniškės Correctional Home authorities, under whose effective control he was, not to grant him Internet access. For the applicant, such access was indispensable for the purposes of obtaining education - related information (see paragraph 17 above). The Court has also recently observed that an increasing amount of services and information is available only via the Internet (see Kalda v. Estonia, no. 17429/10, § 52, 19 January 2016 ). That being so, and given that the applicant ’ s complaint is construed as concerning the right to receive information – thus falling under Article 10 of the Convention − as opposed to a complaint about the denial of education as such, the Court rejects the Government ’ s objection concerning the failure to properly exhaust the domestic remedies by, firstly, not having written letters to Lithuanian educational institutions in Lithuania and by, secondly, not having pursued court proceedings against the Ministry (see paragraph 41 above). As to the first avenue, it was not even a remedy within the sense of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. As to the second avenue, the Court notes that as a remedy for his grievance of lack of access to information the applicant chose to pursue court proceedings against the Pravieniškės Correctional Home which had effectively barred him from accessing the Ministry ’ s website. In this context the Court recalls that in the event of there being a number of domestic remedies which an individual can pursue, that person is entitled to choose a remedy which addresses his or her essential grievance. In other words, when a remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Leja v. Latvia, no. 71072/01, § 4 6, 14 June 2011 )."

Furthermore, the use of mobile phones in prisons was prohibited so that prisoners could not continue their criminal activity whilst serving a sentence.

This holds true for all establishments, whether for sentenced prisoners or those awaiting trial. The CPT has observed that activities in many remand prisons are extremely limited. The organisation of regime activities in such establishments – which have a fairly rapid turnover of inmates – is not a straightforward matter. Clearly, there can be no question of individualised treatment programmes of the sort which might be aspired to in an establishment for sentenced prisoners. However, prisoners cannot simply be left to languish for weeks, possibly months, locked up in their cells, and this regardless of how good material conditions might be within the cells. The CPT considers that one should aim at ensuring that prisoners in remand establishments are able to spend a reasonable part of the day (8 hours or more) outside their cells, engaged in purposeful activity of a varied nature. Of course, regimes in establishments for sentenced prisoners should be even more favourable. ”"

The legislation relied on by the Government, namely point 6 of Annex 1 to the Code of the Execution of Sentences (see paragraph 30 above), which explicitly prohibited prisoners from having telephones and other means of communication such as radios, could not be regarded as formulated with sufficient precision to be foreseeable and therefore as meeting the Court ’ s standards. The fact that none of the legal rules clearly and unambiguously stated that prisoners may not be granted access to the Internet was further supported by the fact that Article 96 of the Code of the Execution of Sentences allowed prisoners to use computers and radios (see paragraph 29 above). The Government themselves stated that the restriction on Internet use by prisoners was only implicit, and was derived systemically from the regime applicable to prisoners per se."

The Ministry, as the official body responsible for providing information about study programmes, had indicated no alternative ways or means for the applicant to obtain that information. The applicant further submitted that information about study programmes and the opportunities for distant studies was of a constantly evolving nature. The educational establishments usually updated such information in the course of the year. Accurate information was therefore only available on the Internet and without Internet access the applicant had no means of obtaining the information necessary to pursue his studies. The applicant lastly pointed out that a number of States permitted limited Internet access in prisons for educational purposes, thus showing that the absolute restriction that existed in Lithuania was disproportionate."

The applicant ’ s complaints had been examined by the domestic courts, which had come to reasoned decisions.

Should the Court nevertheless find that there had been an interference with the applicant ’ s right to receive information, the Government considered that that interference had had a basis in law. The implicit prohibition of prisoners ’ use of the Internet stemmed from the statutory prohibition of the use of telephones and radios as communication devices, and this had been properly examined by the domestic courts in 2007. Taking into account the technological developments, the Code of the Execution of Sentences had been amended in 2010 in order to explicitly include a prohibition of the use of means of electronic communication by prisoners (see paragraph 31 above)."

As noted by the Supreme Administrative Court, the wide scope of opportunities afforded by the Internet could pose a threat to the rights of other persons. This, in turn, would require “ huge efforts ” by the prison authorities to prevent any such potential illegal acts. The Internet was only one means of receive information, and the prisoners could effectively exercise that right by other means, such as by postal correspondence (letters) via the prison authorities. In the present case, the information which the applicant sought was available in various forms – the information concerning admission to educational institutions is announced in the press, special publications are printed, and such information could also have been imparted by the applicant ’ s relatives. Prisoners may also receive information concerning the possibility of studies in social rehabilitation units or correctional institutions. General and vocational education was organised in Lithuania in prisons so as to guarantee the inmates ’ the right to education, and the applicant had made use of those possibilities whilst serving his sentence (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above)."

As noted by the Lithuanian courts, the applicant also sought access to his email accounts, whereas the Convention institutions had already accepted that certain limitations as regards prisoners ’ correspondence did not infringe the guarantees of Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention (the Government relied on the Commission decision in X v. the United Kingdom, no. 5270/72, 8 July 1974)."

The Court notes first of all that before the domestic courts the applicant challenged the decision by the Pravieniškės Correctional Home authorities, under whose effective control he was, not to grant him Internet access. For the applicant, such access was indispensable for the purposes of obtaining education - related information (see paragraph 17 above). The Court has also recently observed that an increasing amount of services and information is available only via the Internet (see Kalda v. Estonia, no. 17429/10, § 52, 19 January 2016 ). That being so, and given that the applicant ’ s complaint is construed as concerning the right to receive information – thus falling under Article 10 of the Convention − as opposed to a complaint about the denial of education as such, the Court rejects the Government ’ s objection concerning the failure to properly exhaust the domestic remedies by, firstly, not having written letters to Lithuanian educational institutions in Lithuania and by, secondly, not having pursued court proceedings against the Ministry (see paragraph 41 above). As to the first avenue, it was not even a remedy within the sense of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. As to the second avenue, the Court notes that as a remedy for his grievance of lack of access to information the applicant chose to pursue court proceedings against the Pravieniškės Correctional Home which had effectively barred him from accessing the Ministry ’ s website. In this context the Court recalls that in the event of there being a number of domestic remedies which an individual can pursue, that person is entitled to choose a remedy which addresses his or her essential grievance. In other words, when a remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Leja v. Latvia, no. 71072/01, § 4 6, 14 June 2011 )."

However, in the circumstances of the present case, since access to information relating to education is granted under Lithuanian law (see paragraph 34 above ), the Court is ready to accept that the restriction of access to the Internet site to which the Ministry referred the applicant in reply to his request to provide information constituted an interference with the right to receive information.",

The ban on the use of “ other means of electronic communication ”, which could be understood as also encompassing means providing Internet access, was only introduced in March 2010 in Annex no. 1 of the Code of the Execution of Sentences (see paragraph 31 above). Be that as it may, the Court notes that in 2006 numerous domestic legal norms did indeed provide for an explicit ban on telephone and radio communications by prisoners, prohibited the prisoners from working with radio and electronic communication devices, and required that all correspondence by prisoners ’ be conducted in writing and sent by post via the prison authorities (see paragraphs 29, 30 and 32 above). It is not unreasonable to hold that all those prohibitions could have been circumvented, if prisoners were allowed access to Internet. The Court therefore does not consider that the applicant was left without an indication that there was a prohibition on the use of the Internet in prison. It therefore concludes that the prohibition on the inmates ’ use of the Internet in prison was “prescribed by law” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention.",

This was moreover noted by the Pravieniškės Correctional Home authorities, as well as by the administrative courts of two instances (see paragraphs 14, 16 and 19 above).

The information on that site was regularly updated to reflect, for example, admission requirements for the current academic year. It also provided up to date information from the Lithuanian Labour Exchange about job vacancies and unemployment (see paragraph 7 above). It is not unreasonable to hold that such information was directly relevant to the applicant ’ s interest in obtaining education, which is in turn of relevance for his rehabilitation and subsequent reintegration into society. As underlined by the CPT, a satisfactory programme of activities, including education, is of crucial importance for the well-being of all detainees, including prisoners awaiting trial. This is all the more relevant in relation to sentenced prisoners (see paragraph 35 above), and the applicant, who was serving a sentence in the Pravieniškės Correctional Home, was one such prisoner (see paragraph 5 above). In fact, as regards the Pravieniškės Correctional Home, the CPT specifically noted after its 2008 visit that steps should be taken to ensure that all sentenced prisoners in that prison were able to engage in purposeful activities of a varied nature, such as educational programmes (see point 49 in fine of the CPT report, quoted in Mironovas and Others v.

Indeed, in order to make a specific request to an educational institution one would need to be aware of the competencies of that institution and the services provided by it. Such preliminary information would be provided by the AIKOS website. The Court furthermore notes the applicant ’ s argument that the information about the study programmes was of a constantly evolving nature (see paragraph 40 above).

It is true that the Pravieniškės Correctional Home authorities pointed out the presence of a secondary school in that prison, as well as the possibility of following computer courses at Elektrėnai vocational school (see paragraph 18 above). However, this appears to be a very remote proposition in relation to the applicant ’ s wish to acquire a second university degree (see paragraph 6 above). In the present case the Court also observes that the prison authorities or the Lithuanian courts did not even go so far as to argue that extended Internet access could incur additional costs for the State (see paragraphs 14, 15, 16 and 19 above). Whilst the security considerations arising from prisoners ’ access to Internet, as such, and cited by the prison authorities (see paragraph 14 above ) may be considered as relevant, the Court notes that the domestic courts failed to give any kind of consideration to the fact that the applicant asked for access to a website created and administered by the Ministry of Education and Science, which was a State institution.

Internet access has increasingly been understood as a right, and calls have been made to develop effective policies to achieve universal access to the Internet and to overcome the “digital divide” ( see Kalda, cited above, § 52 ). The Court considers that these developments reflect the important role the Internet plays in people ’ s everyday lives, in particular since certain information is exclusively available on Internet. Indeed, as has already been established in this case, the AIKOS website provides comprehensive information about learning possibilities in Lithuania. In this connection it is also noteworthy that the Lithuanian authorities did not even consider a possibility of granting the applicant limited or controlled Internet access to this particular website administered by a State institution, which could have hardly posed a security risk."

The Court notes that the Hamm Court of Appeal considered it necessary to impose a further-reaching prohibition in the instant case because it considered that the applicant association – unlike the defendants in the parallel proceedings – had disrespected the “ rules of intellectual battle of ideas” by having employed unfair means when militating against the C. company ’ s activities and that they could be expected to continue to do so if allowed to make further use of the footage. In reaching this conclusion, the Hamm Court of Appeal relied on a number of statements which had been made on the applicant association ’ s website (see paragraphs 15-16, above). Based on these statements, the Court of Appeal considered, for instance, that the applicant associations had approved of a personal attack against one of the C. company ’ s business associates. Conversely, the applicant association did not contest that these statements had been made on its website, but merely considered that they had been misinterpreted by the domestic authorities. The Court observes in this respect that the interpretations given by the Hamm Court of Appeal to the above-mentioned statements do not appear to be far-fetched and do not show any sign of arbitrariness. The German courts ’ argumentation based on “rules of intellectual battle of ideas” thus takes into account the context in which the statement is made, in particular the aspect of fairness and the limits set by criminal law (see the argumentation of the Hamm Court of Appeal in paragraph 11, above)."

The C. company was authorised under the relevant provisions of the Animal Welfare Act to perform animal experiments and to keep and breed animals (monkeys) for that purpose. During his working hours, M., using a hidden camera, produced 40 hours of film footage which documented the treatment of laboratory animals within the C. company ’ s premises."

The film showed a number of different scenes from within the C. company ’ s premises, accompanied by a critical commentary. The scenes primarily concerned the animals ’ accommodation and the way they were treated by staff. During the month of December 2003, other broadcasting companies showed excerpts of the footage."

The introduction to the film claimed that the applicable law was systematically flouted in the laboratories of the C. company. The film further showed various experiments being carried out on monkeys. The second half particularly dealt with the way in which staff treated the animals, alleging that the animals were repeatedly treated in a cruel and harsh way. The film contained the accusation that the applicable legal regulations on the treatment of animals were disregarded and closed by the statement that medicines were not being made safer by poisoning monkeys.

Basing its assessment on the opinions submitted by altogether four experts, the Court of Appeal considered that the way the animals were treated inside the laboratory justified criticism. There was, however, no evidence for cruelty to animals in the legal sense of the word. The Court of Appeal further observed that the film “Poisoning for profit”, through its accompanying commentary and through the way specific scenes were cut together, conveyed the core message that the C. company systematically contravened the law. Similar principles applied to two further short versions already broadcast.

Finally, the civil injunction was necessary for the prevention of disorder, as the danger existed that the dissemination of the film material by the applicant could lead to demonstrations involving violent acts."

Polemic statements or statements provoking specific emotions and moods did not yet constitute unfair means.

The Court observes that these provisions, under the established domestic case law, grant any person whose rights risk being violated by another person a claim to compel that other person to refrain from performing the impugned action. There is no doubt that the relevant texts were accessible to the applicant association. As to the question whether the domestic courts correctly applied these provisions, the Court reiterates that the application and the interpretation of the domestic law primarily fall within the competency of the domestic authorities which are, in the nature of things, particularly well placed to settle the issues arising in this connection (compare inter alia Barthold v. Germany, 25 March 1985, § 48, Series A no. 90). There is no indication that the application of the domestic law by the German courts was in any way arbitrary.

By contrast, by two judgments delivered on the same day, that same court prohibited two other defendants, the journalist M. and another animal rights activist, from further disseminating specific films produced from that footage, but allowed them further to use and disseminate the footage in other contexts.

The Court notes that the Hamm Court of Appeal considered it necessary to impose a further-reaching prohibition in the instant case because it considered that the applicant association – unlike the defendants in the parallel proceedings – had disrespected the “ rules of intellectual battle of ideas” by having employed unfair means when militating against the C. company ’ s activities and that they could be expected to continue to do so if allowed to make further use of the footage. In reaching this conclusion, the Hamm Court of Appeal relied on a number of statements which had been made on the applicant association ’ s website (see paragraphs 15-16, above). Based on these statements, the Court of Appeal considered, for instance, that the applicant associations had approved of a personal attack against one of the C. company ’ s business associates. Conversely, the applicant association did not contest that these statements had been made on its website, but merely considered that they had been misinterpreted by the domestic authorities. The Court observes in this respect that the interpretations given by the Hamm Court of Appeal to the above-mentioned statements do not appear to be far-fetched and do not show any sign of arbitrariness. The German courts ’ argumentation based on “rules of intellectual battle of ideas” thus takes into account the context in which the statement is made, in particular the aspect of fairness and the limits set by criminal law (see the argumentation of the Hamm Court of Appeal in paragraph 11, above)."

However, in the circumstances of the present case, since access to information relating to education is granted under Lithuanian law (see paragraph 34 above ), the Court is ready to accept that the restriction of access to the Internet site to which the Ministry referred the applicant in reply to his request to provide information constituted an interference with the right to receive information.",

This holds true for all establishments, whether for sentenced prisoners or those awaiting trial. The CPT has observed that activities in many remand prisons are extremely limited. The organisation of regime activities in such establishments – which have a fairly rapid turnover of inmates – is not a straightforward matter. Clearly, there can be no question of individualised treatment programmes of the sort which might be aspired to in an establishment for sentenced prisoners. However, prisoners cannot simply be left to languish for weeks, possibly months, locked up in their cells, and this regardless of how good material conditions might be within the cells. The CPT considers that one should aim at ensuring that prisoners in remand establishments are able to spend a reasonable part of the day (8 hours or more) outside their cells, engaged in purposeful activity of a varied nature. Of course, regimes in establishments for sentenced prisoners should be even more favourable. ”"

The legislation relied on by the Government, namely point 6 of Annex 1 to the Code of the Execution of Sentences (see paragraph 30 above), which explicitly prohibited prisoners from having telephones and other means of communication such as radios, could not be regarded as formulated with sufficient precision to be foreseeable and therefore as meeting the Court ’ s standards. The fact that none of the legal rules clearly and unambiguously stated that prisoners may not be granted access to the Internet was further supported by the fact that Article 96 of the Code of the Execution of Sentences allowed prisoners to use computers and radios (see paragraph 29 above). The Government themselves stated that the restriction on Internet use by prisoners was only implicit, and was derived systemically from the regime applicable to prisoners per se."

The Ministry, as the official body responsible for providing information about study programmes, had indicated no alternative ways or means for the applicant to obtain that information. The applicant further submitted that information about study programmes and the opportunities for distant studies was of a constantly evolving nature. The educational establishments usually updated such information in the course of the year. Accurate information was therefore only available on the Internet and without Internet access the applicant had no means of obtaining the information necessary to pursue his studies.

Should the Court nevertheless find that there had been an interference with the applicant ’ s right to receive information, the Government considered that that interference had had a basis in law. The implicit prohibition of prisoners ’ use of the Internet stemmed from the statutory prohibition of the use of telephones and radios as communication devices, and this had been properly examined by the domestic courts in 2007. Taking into account the technological developments, the Code of the Execution of Sentences had been amended in 2010 in order to explicitly include a prohibition of the use of means of electronic communication by prisoners (see paragraph 31 above)."

As noted by the Supreme Administrative Court, the wide scope of opportunities afforded by the Internet could pose a threat to the rights of other persons. This, in turn, would require “ huge efforts ” by the prison authorities to prevent any such potential illegal acts. The Internet was only one means of receive information, and the prisoners could effectively exercise that right by other means, such as by postal correspondence (letters) via the prison authorities. In the present case, the information which the applicant sought was available in various forms – the information concerning admission to educational institutions is announced in the press, special publications are printed, and such information could also have been imparted by the applicant ’ s relatives. Prisoners may also receive information concerning the possibility of studies in social rehabilitation units or correctional institutions. General and vocational education was organised in Lithuania in prisons so as to guarantee the inmates ’ the right to education, and the applicant had made use of those possibilities whilst serving his sentence (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above)."

As noted by the Lithuanian courts, the applicant also sought access to his email accounts, whereas the Convention institutions had already accepted that certain limitations as regards prisoners ’ correspondence did not infringe the guarantees of Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention (the Government relied on the Commission decision in X v. the United Kingdom, no. 5270/72, 8 July 1974)."

The Court notes first of all that before the domestic courts the applicant challenged the decision by the Pravieniškės Correctional Home authorities, under whose effective control he was, not to grant him Internet access. For the applicant, such access was indispensable for the purposes of obtaining education - related information (see paragraph 17 above). The Court has also recently observed that an increasing amount of services and information is available only via the Internet (see Kalda v. Estonia, no. 17429/10, § 52, 19 January 2016 ). That being so, and given that the applicant ’ s complaint is construed as concerning the right to receive information – thus falling under Article 10 of the Convention − as opposed to a complaint about the denial of education as such, the Court rejects the Government ’ s objection concerning the failure to properly exhaust the domestic remedies by, firstly, not having written letters to Lithuanian educational institutions in Lithuania and by, secondly, not having pursued court proceedings against the Ministry (see paragraph 41 above). As to the first avenue, it was not even a remedy within the sense of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. As to the second avenue, the Court notes that as a remedy for his grievance of lack of access to information the applicant chose to pursue court proceedings against the Pravieniškės Correctional Home which had effectively barred him from accessing the Ministry ’ s website. In this context the Court recalls that in the event of there being a number of domestic remedies which an individual can pursue, that person is entitled to choose a remedy which addresses his or her essential grievance. In other words, when a remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Leja v. Latvia, no. 71072/01, § 4 6, 14 June 2011 )."

However, in the circumstances of the present case, since access to information relating to education is granted under Lithuanian law (see paragraph 34 above ), the Court is ready to accept that the restriction of access to the Internet site to which the Ministry referred the applicant in reply to his request to provide information constituted an interference with the right to receive information.",

The ban on the use of “ other means of electronic communication ”, which could be understood as also encompassing means providing Internet access, was only introduced in March 2010 in Annex no. 1 of the Code of the Execution of Sentences (see paragraph 31 above). Be that as it may, the Court notes that in 2006 numerous domestic legal norms did indeed provide for an explicit ban on telephone and radio communications by prisoners, prohibited the prisoners from working with radio and electronic communication devices, and required that all correspondence by prisoners ’ be conducted in writing and sent by post via the prison authorities (see paragraphs 29, 30 and 32 above). It is not unreasonable to hold that all those prohibitions could have been circumvented, if prisoners were allowed access to Internet. The Court therefore does not consider that the applicant was left without an indication that there was a prohibition on the use of the Internet in prison. It therefore concludes that the prohibition on the inmates ’ use of the Internet in prison was “prescribed by law” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention.",

It is not unreasonable to hold that such information was directly relevant to the applicant ’ s interest in obtaining education, which is in turn of relevance for his rehabilitation and subsequent reintegration into society. As underlined by the CPT, a satisfactory programme of activities, including education, is of crucial importance for the well-being of all detainees, including prisoners awaiting trial. This is all the more relevant in relation to sentenced prisoners (see paragraph 35 above), and the applicant, who was serving a sentence in the Pravieniškės Correctional Home, was one such prisoner (see paragraph 5 above). In fact, as regards the Pravieniškės Correctional Home, the CPT specifically noted after its 2008 visit that steps should be taken to ensure that all sentenced prisoners in that prison were able to engage in purposeful activities of a varied nature, such as educational programmes (see point 49 in fine of the CPT report, quoted in Mironovas and Others v. Lithuania, nos. 40828/12, 29292/12, 69598/12, 40163/13, 66281/13, 70048/13 and 70065/13, § 65, 8 December 2015 )."

The Court also considers that accessing the AIKOS website in the manner advised by the Ministry of Education and Science – namely browsing through it in order to find information that was relevant – was more efficient than making requests for specific information, as was proposed by the Government (see paragraph 4 6 above). Indeed, in order to make a specific request to an educational institution one would need to be aware of the competencies of that institution and the services provided by it. Such preliminary information would be provided by the AIKOS website. The Court furthermore notes the applicant ’ s argument that the information about the study programmes was of a constantly evolving nature (see paragraph 40 above). This fact is also highlighted on the AIKOS website itself (see paragraph 7 above)."

Turning to the Lithuanian authorities ’ decisions, the Court cannot but observe that they essentially focussed on the legal ban on prisoners having Internet access as such, instead of examining the applicant ’ s argument that access to a particular website was necessary for his education (see paragraphs 10, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 19 above). It is true that the Pravieniškės Correctional Home authorities pointed out the presence of a secondary school in that prison, as well as the possibility of following computer courses at Elektrėnai vocational school (see paragraph 18 above). However, this appears to be a very remote proposition in relation to the applicant ’ s wish to acquire a second university degree (see paragraph 6 above). In the present case the Court also observes that the prison authorities or the Lithuanian courts did not even go so far as to argue that extended Internet access could incur additional costs for the State (see paragraphs 14, 15, 16 and 19 above). Whilst the security considerations arising from prisoners ’ access to Internet, as such, and cited by the prison authorities (see paragraph 14 above ) may be considered as relevant, the Court notes that the domestic courts failed to give any kind of consideration to the fact that the applicant asked for access to a website created and administered by the Ministry of Education and Science, which was a State institution. In fact, both courts were completely silent on the matter of education (see paragraphs 16 and 19 above)."

Lastly, the Court is mindful of the fact that in a number of the Council of Europe ’ s and other international instruments the public-service value of the Internet and its importance for the enjoyment of a range of human rights has been recognised. Internet access has increasingly been understood as a right, and calls have been made to develop effective policies to achieve universal access to the Internet and to overcome the “digital divide” ( see Kalda, cited above, § 52 ). The Court considers that these developments reflect the important role the Internet plays in people ’ s everyday lives, in particular since certain information is exclusively available on Internet. Indeed, as has already been established in this case, the AIKOS website provides comprehensive information about learning possibilities in Lithuania. In this connection it is also noteworthy that the Lithuanian authorities did not even consider a possibility of granting the applicant limited or controlled Internet access to this particular website administered by a State institution, which could have hardly posed a security risk."

To reach this objective it is not necessary to use statements that insult the person in question and for this reason exceed the boundaries of acceptable criticism. The concept of acceptable criticism applies to the offence of defamation and only in so far as it concerns a charge raised against such person. To cover by this principle a statement that was not a charge against this person, but an expression of contempt and disrespect, would be against the [law].

He emphasised that the language used by him had not overstepped the boundaries of admissible and civilised journalistic expression of criticism. The statements in question were not offensive and were not an intentional personal assault on that politician. The applicant ’ s intention was to highlight that politician ’ s incompetence in the context of upcoming local elections. Moreover, the statements were quoted after a well-known book by Laurence J.

Moreover, in the field of freedom of press the authorities should not have resorted to criminal proceedings as a criminal sentence carries various negative consequences for a person involved. The applicant considered it irrelevant that the domestic courts had conditionally discontinued the proceedings and had imposed a lenient penalty. It was important that they found that the applicant had committed the offence of proffering insult and that judicial decision entered the National Crime Register. In consequence of the institution of the criminal proceedings against him he had decided to stop publishing his newsletter. Thus, his right to freedom of expression had been violated."

The Court reiterates that freedom of expression, as secured in paragraph 1 of Article 10, constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see, among many other authorities, Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, § 57, and Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, § 43, ECHR 1999 ‑ VIII )."

Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV). In the context of a public debate the role of the press as a public watchdog allows journalists to have recourse to a certain degree of exaggeration, provocation or harshness. Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders (see Castells v. Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, § 43). It is true that, whilst an individual taking part in a public debate on a matter of general concern is required not to overstep certain limits as regards – in particular – respect for the reputation and rights of others, he or she is allowed to have recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation, or in other words to make somewhat immoderate statements (see Kuliś v.

While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. A requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment may be excessive where there is no factual basis to support it ( see Turhan v. Turkey, no. 4817 6/99, § 24, 19 May 2005, and Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, § 43, ECHR 2001-II)."

In so doing, the Court must look at the “interference” complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Vogt v. Germany, judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, pp. 25-26, § 52, and Jerusalem v. Austria, cited above, § 33 and Feldek v. Slovakia, no. 29032/95, § § 77 and 78, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII ). )."

For this reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely (see, Bowman v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, § 42).

The Court observes that it is undisputed that the domestic courts ’ decisions complained of by the applicant amounted to an “interference” with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression. The Court also finds, and the parties agreed on this point, that the interference complained of was prescribed by law, namely Article 216 §§ 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code, and was intended to pursue a legitimate aim referred to in Article 10 § 2 of the Convention, namely to protect “the reputation or rights of others”. Thus the only point at issue is whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve such aims."

                "42. The applicant, who was a journalist, had published, two days prior to municipal elections, an article concerning a local politician, a candidate for these elections and the former mayor of the commune. The domestic courts in the criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant upon an application lodged by that politician considered that the statement that “as mayor [A.W.] reached his level of incompetence a few years ago, but this blunder [had] not put him off and he [was] crawling up again to another level” amounted to proffering insult contrary to the Criminal Code.",
                "At the same time the domestic court acquitted the applicant of defamation in particular as regards the statements in which the applicant alleged that Mr A.W. as a mayor had been guilty of mismanagement when selling a water source to a private company. The court considered that this allegation had been sufficiently confirmed by the facts as to fall within the scope of permissible criticism and the freedom of press.",
                "The Court also notes that the impugned article ‘ The Peter Principle ’ was based on a theory developed in a 1968 book by Laurence J. Peter, which expounds the principle of hierarchiology, namely “in a hierarchy every individual tends to rise to his level of incompetence .”",
                "Finally, the Court observes that the applicant expressed his opinion in an eight-page-long free newsletter, self-edited and distributed, which was addressed to the inhabitants of Kolbudy commune. Its range and impact were thus very limited."

            ],
            [
                "44. As regards the reasons given by the domestic courts, the Court firstly notes that when acquitting the applicant of the charge of defamation the court considered that his statements were within the limits of acceptable criticism of a politician in the context of political debate (see paragraph 13 above). For instance, the domestic courts acknowledged that his allegations that the politician, as mayor of the commune, was incompetent, had a sufficient factual basis. However, when establishing that the applicant had insulted the politician by stating that he was crawling up to another level of incompetence, the domestic courts failed to take into consideration that the impugned statement was a value judgment on a matter of public interest. The domestic court adopted a narrow definition of what could be considered acceptable criticism, excluding from it all statements expressing “contempt and disrespect” (see paragraph 16 above). In doing so the court did not take into consideration the fact that the impugned statements had been made in the context of a heated political debate. Moreover, it failed to notice that the applicant was exercising his right to impart information and ideas on political questions and on other matters of public interest and in so doing might have recourse to a degree of exaggeration. The statements in question were limited to an assessment of the professional sphere of the life of Mr A.W. and denounced his alleged lack of ability as a politician. The Court notes that although political invective often spills over into the personal sphere, in the instant case the applicant ’ s critical comment did not concern the private or family life of that politician (see a contrario Lopes Gomes da Silva v. Portugal, no. 37698/97, § 34, ECHR 2000-X, and Kulis, cited above, § 5 2 ).",
                "Consequently, the Court finds that the domestic authorities failed to take into consideration the crucial importance of free political debate in a democratic society particularly in the context of free elections (see Malisiewicz-Gąsior v. Poland, no. 43797/98, § 67, 6 April 2006 ). Regard being had to the nature of the statements, and the fact that they had been made in the context of local elections, the Court is of the opinion that the reasons adduced by the domestic courts cannot be regarded as relevant and sufficient to justify the interference at issue."
            ],
            [
                "45. Lastly, the Court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference (see, for example, Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], cited above, § 64, and Chauvy and Others v. France, no. 64915/01, § 78, ECHR 2004-VI). In that connection, it notes that while the penalty imposed on the applicant was relatively light (a payment of PLN 50 to a charity and reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings which amounted in total to PLN 518 – approximately 12 0 euros (EUR) at the material time ), and although the proceedings against him were conditionally discontinued, nevertheless the domestic courts found that the applicant had committed a criminal offence of proffering insult. In consequence, the applicant had a criminal record. Moreover, it remained open to the courts to resume the proceedings at any time during the period of his probation should any of the circumstances defined by law so justify (see Dąbrowski v. Poland, no. 18235/02, § 36, 19 December 2006, and Weigt v Poland ( dec .), 74232/01, 11 October 2005 )."

                "46. Furthermore, while the penalty did not prevent the applicant from expressing himself, it nonetheless amounted to a kind of censorship which was likely to discourage him from making criticisms of that kind again in the future. Such a conviction is likely to deter journalists from contributing to public discussion of issues affecting the life of the community. By the same token, it is liable to hamper the press in the performance of its task of purveyor of information and public watchdog (see, mutatis mutandis, Barthold v. Germany, judgment of 25 March 1985, Series A no. 90, p. 26, § 58, and Lingens v. Austria, cited above, p. 27, § 44). Indeed, the applicant submitted that because of the criminal proceedings instituted against him, he had abandoned his journalistic activity."
            ],
            [
                "47. Finally, the Court notes that the criminal proceedings in the present case had their origin in a bill of indictment lodged by the politician himself and not by a public prosecutor (see, a contrario, Raichinov v. Bulgaria, no. 47579/99, § 50, 20 April 2006) and that they resulted in conditional discontinuation of these proceedings. In view of the margin of appreciation left to Contracting States a criminal measure as a response to defamation cannot, as such, be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued (see Lindon, Otchakovsky -Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 59, ECHR 2007-..., Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, § 40, ECHR 2004 ‑ II and Rumyana Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 36207/03, § 68, 14 February 2008). Nevertheless, the Court notes that when a statement, whether qualified as defamatory or insulting by the domestic authorities, is made in the context of a public debate, the bringing of criminal proceedings against the maker of the statement entails the risk that a prison sentence might be imposed. In this connection, the Court recalls that the imposition of a prison sentence for a press offence will be compatible with journalists ’ freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been impaired, as for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 115, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). For the Court, similar considerations should apply to insults expressed in connection with a public debate. The Court would further observe that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in its Resolution 1577 (2007) urged those member States which still provide for prison sentences for defamation, even if they are not actually imposed, to abolish them without delay (Resolution Towards decriminalisation of defamation adopted on 4 October 2007)."
