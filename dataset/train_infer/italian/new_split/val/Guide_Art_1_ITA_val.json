However, unlike in previous cases concerning alleged breaches of the Convention by the “MRT”, the Moldovan authorities in the present case were not limited to only fulfilling their positive obligations as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. The case is different in that, while not having control over the local authorities in Bender which disconnected prison no. 8 from the utilities, the Moldovan authorities had full control over that prison itself and the detainees there throughout the relevant period. They could have taken measures in the prison itself to cope with the effects of the disconnection from the utilities or they could have transferred the prisoners to other prisons at any time. By choosing to continue to detain the applicants in prison no. 8 without immediate action taken to ensure basic conditions of detention, the Moldovan authorities knowingly exposed them to the conditions which prevailed there after the disconnection from all utilities. In addition to the above-mentioned positive obligations, it was therefore also the direct responsibility of the Moldovan authorities to prevent or redress the alleged violation of the applicants ’ rights in that prison."

Turning to the situation in the “MRT”, the Court notes that in the past it has found a violation of Article 13 of the Convention in respect of the Russian Federation, precisely because it could not establish the existence of effective remedies in that country in respect of Convention breaches committed by the authorities of the “MRT” (see Mozer, cited above, §§ 211 and 218). In the same vein, the Court does not consider the lodging of a complaint in Moldovan courts against another country without the latter ’ s consent to be involved as a defendant (see paragraph 30 above) to be a remedy. It therefore finds that, in the absence of any effective remedy in Russia, any complaints against that country must be lodged with the Court within six months of the date of the alleged violation or the date when such a violation ended."

Insofar as the Government submitted that the applicants were warned about the conditions of detention in prison no. 8 and agreed to them before being transferred there, the Court reiterates at the outset that Article 3 of the Convention enshrines one of the most fundamental values of democratic society. It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim ’ s behaviour ( Muršić v. Croatia [GC], no. 7334/13, § 96, ECHR 2016). The Government ’ s submission could raise the question whether a waiver of the right under Article 3 is possible, notwithstanding the absolute nature of the prohibition. However, even assuming that such a waiver might be possible, the circumstances of the present case do not permit the conclusion that there has been any valid waiver. Indeed, the applicants were deprived of their liberty, and thus within the power of the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, M.S. v. Belgium, no. 50012/08, § 124, 31 January 2012). As the Court has held with respect to the waiver of certain procedural rights, a waiver must be of the applicant ’ s own free will and must be established in an unequivocal manner and attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see, among others, Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 135, 17 September 2009). However, the Government did not clarify the nature of the guarantees which would assure a free decision by the applicants."

Even though the Moldovan Government suggested that the authorities had taken action to improve the conditions of detention, their arguments refer to actions taken after February 2004 (see paragraph 59 above ), that is, close to the end of the applicants ’ detention in prison no. 8. The Court has no reason to depart from the domestic courts ’ assessment of the conditions of detention and finds, as did those courts, that prolonged detention in conditions where access to water, electricity, food, warmth and medication is severely limited amounts to inhuman treatment under Article 3 of the Convention."
