                "86. In order to determine whether Article 7 is applicable, the Court has to determine whether the offence for which the applicant was fined was “criminal” within the meaning of that Article. In so doing the Court will have regard to the three alternative criteria laid down in the Engel case (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 82, Series A no. 22, and Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, §§ 30-31, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIV ): (a) the classification of the offence under the domestic law, (b) the nature of the offence, and (c) the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The first criterion is of relative weight and serves only as a starting-point. If domestic law classifies an offence as criminal, then this will be decisive. Otherwise the Court will look behind the national classification and examine the offence in the light of the second and/or third criteria. Even though these criteria were initially developed for the purposes of determining the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention under its “criminal head”, they are equally pertinent to the issue of the applicability of Article 7 (see Nadtochiy, cited above, § 32)."

Namely, the mere fact that he possesses a residence permit is not a proof that would entitle him to import [his] car with total relief from payment of customs duties under the Convention on Temporary Admission because he does not have his domicile abroad.",
                "This is so because the procedure for temporary admission of private means of transport is regulated by Article 5 of Annex C to the [Istanbul] Convention in such a way that means of transport for private use must be registered in a territory other than that of temporary admission in the name of a person having a seat or domicile outside the territory of temporary admission and be imported and used by persons residing in that territory.",

Furthermore, after the accused was reported as having committed the administrative offence, he de - registered his domicile in Zagreb – in this authority ’ s view – merely to avoid liability for the offence. At the time of the commission of the offence the accused did not satisfy the conditions for temporary importation with total relief and [was thus not entitled to] operate a vehicle with foreign licence plates. Namely, [Article 5 of ] Annex C to the [Istanbul] Convention expressly provides that the right to temporary importation belongs to persons who have domicile outside the territory of temporary admission, that is, outside Croatia.",
                "This authority has examined the argument of the accused that he is not a taxpayer in Croatia, which is evident from the certificate of 23 June 2008 issued by the Tax Administration, as well as the evidence [to the effect] that he is neither insured with the Croatian Health Insurance Fund nor has social security [cover] in Croatia. However, that evidence cannot lead to the adoption of a different decision, because the fact of [having or not] health insurance or social security is not evidence of domicile abroad.",

However, having [health] insurance is itself not relevant for the adoption of a different decision because the fact of [possessing] insurance, which according to the accused ’ s own statement is voluntary, does not give [him] the right to temporary admission of the vehicle in question with total relief.",
                "On the basis of these findings of fact, and in accordance with the foregoing provisions, this authority has established beyond doubt that the accused did not satisfy the conditions for temporary admission, and that, by handling the vehicle in question contrary to [those] conditions, he committed the administrative offence defined in section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act.",

However, that evidence does not prove his domicile abroad, but only his stay. What is more, at the hearing held on 30 September 2008 the accused himself stated only the fact of his residence in the Czech Republic, which confirms that at the time of the commission of the offence he did not satisfy the conditions for the temporary admission of vehicles with total relief, in accordance with Annex C to the [Istanbul] Convention.",

However, [that statement] is not decisive for exempting [the accused] from liability because it was issued after this authority adopted its [first] decision of 31 July 2008 and because the statement in question does not give him the right to temporary admission with total relief.",
                "The statement given by P.Ć. (before a notary public on 22 September 2008), which was also examined during the proceedings, is illogical and contrary to [both] the statement of Miljenko Žaja and the solemn statement of 13 August 2008 in that it suggests that the flat [in Prague in which the applicant claimed to be living] was rented to P.Ć., and not to the accused, whereas the solemn statement of ERC of 13 August 2008 suggested that it provided Miljenko Žaja with accommodation at the address [in Prague]. After examining that evidence, this authority considers that it was obtained with a view to proving that the accused had rented accommodation to live in abroad.",

The accused could not pose in Croatia as a person having domicile abroad and enjoy the rights of [such] a person in [his own] country, where until 17 June 2008 he had his domicile. Therefore, the accused did not satisfy the conditions for the temporary admission of a foreign car to the territory of the Republic of Croatia with total relief under Annex C [to the Istanbul Convention] and the Decree on the implementation of the Customs Act because his domicile was in Croatia at the time of the commission of the offence.",

The Constitutional Court considers that the relevant administrative authority and the High Court for Administrative Offences, relying on the facts established in the proceedings, gave reasons for their views expressed in the contested decisions, which undoubtedly do not result from an arbitrary interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law.",

It is also evident that the complainant had an opportunity to follow and participate in the proceedings, and that he could undertake all permitted procedural actions and lodge a remedy.

However, once established, domicile is not lost by the mere loss of one of its constituent elements. For example, a person who is (temporarily) absent from the town where he or she has established his or her domicile will not lose that status if he or she wishes to live there permanently, that is, as long as he or she intends to return to it. Likewise, a person who has established his or her domicile in a particular town but no longer intends to (permanently) live there will not lose his or her domicile in that town while he or she still lives there, that is, as long as he or she does not actually move elsewhere."

In none of these opinions did the Customs Administration refer to the definition of domicile provided in either the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act or the General Tax Act. Rather, in one of the opinions (opinion of 31 May 2010) it cited the definition of habitual residence provided in the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act (see paragraph 32 above), whereas in four of the opinions (opinions of 22 November 2012 and of 3, 7 and 10 January 2013) it referred to the definition of habitual residence provided in the General Tax Act (see paragraph 31 above ). While in the first of the above-cited opinions (opinion of 19 December 2006 ) the Customs Administration held that persons having registered domicile in Croatia could not be considered to have habitual residence abroad, in another of the opinions it expressly stated that domicile was irrelevant for determining whether a person had habitual residence (opinion of 15 September 2011 )."

If he had been obliged to do so, he should and would have been stopped by Croatian customs officials at the border crossing when entering Croatia and instructed either to pay those taxes or to return to the Czech Republic. Therefore, his failure to pay the customs debt for the alleged importation of his car had not been in breach of customs regulations and thus could not constitute an offence. Yet, he had been convicted of the customs-related administrative offence specified in section 241( 1 ) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act (see paragraphs 22-23 and 29 above). That was so only because the domestic authorities had misinterpreted the term “persons resident” in the Istanbul Convention as “persons having domicile”, which had a different meaning in the domestic legislation. He explained that the Istanbul Convention, in its official text, did not refer to “domicile” but to “living” abroad and that the meaning given to certain legal terms in domestic legislation could not be relied on in interpreting the same or similar terms used in international agreements. Therefore, the fact that while living in Prague he could have, in the eyes of Croatian authorities, retained his domicile in Croatia was not relevant.

In the Government ’ s view, that meant that it was left to the States Parties to the Istanbul Convention to give meaning to that term themselves, that is, to interpret it independently, in accordance with their own legislation. The Croatian authorities had decided to interpret the term by equating it with the notion of domicile ( prebivalište ), which, according to the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act, is the place where a citizen has settled with an intention of permanently living there (see paragraph 32 above).

Furthermore, section 241( 1 ) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act prescribed that treating goods which did not meet the conditions for temporary admission set forth in the Istanbul Convention as if they did was an administrative offence punishable by a fine (see paragraph 29 above). Given that at the time of the commission of the offence, that is, when the applicant had entered Croatia in his car with foreign licence plates without paying the relevant taxes, he had been a Croatian citizen and had his domicile in Croatia (see paragraph 6 above), he had not satisfied the conditions for temporary admission set forth in Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention.

In particular, the applicant ’ s statement that he had entered Croatia with the intention of de - registering his domicile was (see paragraph 8 above), in the Government ’ s view, crucial evidence that he had known that having his domicile in Croatia made him ineligible for temporary admission and that by bringing his car to Croatia he had breached customs regulations. In fact, the Government argued, the applicant had never had the intention of de - registering his domicile. Rather, his real intention had been to continue living in Croatia, where he had accommodation and where his family lived, and to go only occasionally to the Czech Republic. He had de - registered his domicile in Croatia only to avoid paying the customs debt and escape liability for it. Thus, even though he had allegedly entered Croatia in order to de - register his domicile, he had not done so until 17 June 2008 (see paragraph 10 above), that is, six days after entering (see paragraph 8 above), and one day after the police had impounded his vehicle and the customs proceedings against him had commenced (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above).

The first criterion is of relative weight and serves only as a starting-point. If domestic law classifies an offence as criminal, then this will be decisive. Otherwise the Court will look behind the national classification and examine the offence in the light of the second and/or third criteria. Even though these criteria were initially developed for the purposes of determining the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention under its “criminal head”, they are equally pertinent to the issue of the applicability of Article 7 (see Nadtochiy, cited above, § 32)."

This follows from the fact that the fine imposed on the applicant was based on section 241(1) of the Customs Act (see paragraph 29 above) and not on provisions of the Criminal Code; that such a fine is not entered in a person ’ s criminal record; and that its amount does not depend on income, as in criminal law.

What is more, the fine imposed on the applicant was punitive in nature as it was not intended to serve as pecuniary compensation for unpaid customs duties but as a penalty to deter reoffending. The Court finds these elements sufficient for a conclusion that the purported customs-related administrative offence was of a criminal character and thus attracted the guarantees of Article 7 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Nadtochiy, cited above, §§ 21-22, and Jussila, cited above, § 38)."

                "“153. ... the guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment ( ... ).",
                "154. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows from these principles that an offence must be clearly defined in the law, be it national or international. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. The Court has thus indicated that when speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability ( ... ).",
                "155. The Court reiterates that however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial interpretation is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen ( ... ). ”"

Austria, no. 40825/98, § 90, 31 July 2008 ).

The Commission ’ s supervisory function, therefore, consists in making sure that, at the moment when the accused person performed the act which led to his being prosecuted, there was in force a legal provision which made that act punishable and that the punishment imposed does not exceed the limits fixed by that provision. ... [T]his supervisory function further consists in considering whether the national court, in reaching its decision, has not unreasonably interpreted, and applied to the applicant, the municipal law concerned.”"

Latvia, where it held that while it was primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation, so that the Court ’ s role was confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation were compatible with the Convention, the position was different and the Court ’ s powers of review greater when it was not the domestic legislation but the Convention itself, in particular Article 7, which expressly referred to the domestic law, that is, required that there should be a legal basis for a conviction and sentence. In such cases, a failure to comply with the domestic legislation could in itself entail a violation of the Convention. Accordingly, in such circumstances the Court had to have jurisdiction to decide whether the relevant provision of criminal law had been complied with as its application to an act not covered by that provision would directly result in a conflict with Article 7 of the Convention. In the Court ’ s view, to accord it a lesser power of review would render Article 7 devoid of purpose. The Court also held that the same principle applied to situations where the domestic courts had applied international law (see Kononov v.

This inconsistency in translation indeed makes the meaning of the term in question ambiguous as it could mean either domicile or residence, it being understood that those terms legally do not have the same meaning not only under Croatian law (see paragraphs 31-32 above ) but also in a number of countries (see the relevant Council of Europe instrument in paragraph 60 above). This ambiguity is further compounded by the fact that, from a strictly linguistic point of view, the more accurate translation into Croatian of the English term “persons resident” or the French term “ personnes résidant ” appearing in the original versions of the Istanbul Convention is “ osobe s boravištem ” ( “ persons having residence ” ) rather than “ osobe s prebivalištem ” ( “ persons having domicile ” ). Croatian versions or translations of international or European law instruments that refer to the same or similar terms do not provide any assistance in this matter (see paragraphs 59 and 6 1 above).

In their view any ambiguity as to the meaning of the term “persons resident” had been dispelled by the fact that those authorities had uniformly and consistently interpreted it as “persons having domicile”, where the notion of domicile was construed in the light of the relevant domestic legislation, in particular with regard to the definition of domicile in the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act (see paragraphs 8 0 -8 1 above)."

These applications concerned different preventive detention regimes, which evolved in respect of both their legal basis and their implementation in practice. In accordance with its case-law, the Court had to interpret the notion of penalty in Article 7 § 1 autonomously in these cases, also bearing in mind the classification of comparable measures in other Contracting Parties to the Convention (see M. v.

In the case of Glien (cited above, §§ 120-30) it found that the applicant’s preventive detention as enforced in the transitional period between the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment of 4 May 2011 and the application in practice of the Preventive Detention (Distinction) Act (see paragraphs 76-80 above), which entered into force on 1 June 2013 and entailed detention under a fresh regime in new preventive detention centres, still constituted a penalty for the purposes of Article 7 § 1.

It further found that the provisions of the Criminal Code on the imposition and duration of preventive detention as they then stood failed, however, to meet the constitutional requirement of differentiating between purely preventive measures of correction and prevention, such as preventive detention, and penalties, such as prison sentences (see paragraphs 70-72 above).

In that centre, the applicant was being deprived of his liberty under considerably improved material conditions compared to ordinary prison conditions, with a view to differentiating between those two forms of detention, as required by the German Constitution.

The comprehensive therapeutic provision for the applicant, addressing his mental condition, now included, in particular, one-to-one or group social therapy, participation in an intensive treatment programme for sexual offenders and therapy administered by an external psychiatrist. The Court notes that it was only after the period covered by the proceedings here at issue that the applicant accepted a part of the treatment offers made to him (see paragraph 47 above). However, the Court does not have any reason to doubt that the treatment offers made to the applicant were adequate, sufficient and available to the applicant at the relevant time.

However, having regard to the setting in which preventive detention orders are executed under the new regime, the Court is satisfied that the focus of the measure now lies on the medical and therapeutic treatment of the person concerned. The medical and therapeutic provision was central to the specific measures of care provided to the applicant.

Furthermore, his detention was subject to regular judicial reviews at relatively short intervals (see paragraph 64 above). That increased the probability that the measure would not last overly long.

The applicant’s preventive detention was imposed because of and with a view to the need to treat his mental disorder, having regard to his criminal history.

On 29 October 1999 the Regensburg Regional Court convicted the applicant of murder and, applying the criminal law relating to young offenders, sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment.

The court, having consulted two medical experts, found that the applicant had acted with full criminal responsibility when killing the woman for sexual gratification and in order to cover up his intended rape. The court noted that, despite indications to that effect, both experts had not wished to draw the conclusion that the applicant suffered from a sexual deviancy as the young applicant had made few statements on the motives for his offence."

Even assuming that the applicant could reasonably consider the sense of the words “thank you” in the above context as meaning that the applicant could commit a violent offence, it had to be noted that the Regional Court, including Judge P., had just established that the applicant still suffered from fantasies of sexual violence and that there was at that time a high risk that he would again commit serious offences against the life and sexual self ‑ determination of others. Assuming that Judge P. had indeed made the remark in question, his “advice” had therefore constituted in substance nothing more than the application of the Regional Court’s said findings to a particular case. The remark had further been made in the context of a confidential exchange between the participants in the proceedings in the absence of the applicant.

He was suffering from a sexual preference disorder, namely sexual sadism, as described by the relevant tool for the classification of diseases, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems in its current version (ICD-10); [1] this disorder had caused, and been manifested in, his brutal offence, and still persisted. The court, having regard to the experts’ findings, observed that the applicant had hidden the sadistic motives behind his offence in the proceedings before the trial court in 1999, which, despite some indications of sexual deviance, had then interpreted the offence as an intended rape which had failed. The applicant, who had given diverging versions of the motive for his offence, had only admitted in 2005/2006, during his examination by a psychological and a psychiatric expert, that in his murder he had put into practice intensifying fantasies of exercising power over women by attacking their neck and by masturbating on their inanimate bodies.

In accordance with a long-standing legal tradition, the German Criminal Code distinguishes between penalties ( Strafen ) and so-called measures of correction and prevention ( Maßregeln der Besserung und Sicherung ) to deal with unlawful acts. In this twin-track system of sanctions, penalties (see Articles 38 et seq. of the Criminal Code) mainly consist of prison sentences and fines, which are fixed in accordance with the defendant’s guilt (Article 46 § 1 of the Criminal Code). Measures of correction and prevention (see Articles 61 et seq. of the Criminal Code) consist mainly of placement in a psychiatric hospital (Article 63 of the Criminal Code), in a detoxification facility (Article 64 of the Criminal Code) or in preventive detention (Articles 66 et seq. of the Criminal Code). The purpose of these measures is to rehabilitate dangerous offenders and to protect the public from them. They may be imposed on criminally liable offenders in addition to their punishment (cf. Articles 63 et seq.). Such measures must, however, be proportionate to the seriousness of the offences committed, or expected to be committed, by the defendants, as well as to their dangerousness (Article 62 of the Criminal Code)."

Initially, a preventive detention order could only be made by a criminal court at the time of the defendant’s conviction, additionally to a term of imprisonment. Under Article 66 of the Criminal Code, this required, in particular, that the criminal court had convicted the defendant of an offence of a certain gravity (as specified in the law) and that, owing to his propensity to commit serious offences, the defendant presented a danger to the general public. Under the law in force prior to 31 January 1998 (Article 67d § 1 of the Criminal Code), the first period of preventive detention executed against a defendant could not exceed ten years.

The head of the psychology service indicated that, due to the limited staff resources, it was not possible to organise individual therapy on a weekly basis (...), that it was not possible to reach out to those who were lacking any motivation and were unwilling to engage themselves in therapeutic measures and that it was not possible to organise milieu therapy in an effective manner.",

Although a comprehensive and detailed concept for the treatment of persons in preventive detention had been prepared by the prison administration of Rhineland-Palatinate in May 2013, the visit revealed a striking discrepancy between theory and practice. Out of 40 inmates, only 24 were receiving individual therapy and only eight were participating in group therapy. It is also regrettable that no efforts had thus far been made by the prison administration to organise group sessions for art, music or drama therapy which may be particularly beneficial for those inmates who are unwilling or unable to participate in any other group therapy programme.

That prospective element is further reinforced after the changes made by the Federal Constitutional Court and the German legislator to the preventive detention regime applicable to persons such as the applicant. In line with these changes, it is required, in addition, that at the time of the order the persons concerned suffer from a mental disorder, as a result of which they are dangerous to the public."

The focus of the new overall concept of preventive detention now lay on the individualised medical and therapeutic treatment of the detainees. The statistical material available (see paragraph 91 above) showed that many of the detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged or ordered subsequently had been released since the M. v. Germany judgment had become final.

The interpretation of that term was too broad and imprecise. The EPLN noted that according to the Federal Constitutional Court, the notion of mental disorder under German law also covered non-pathological disorders. However, the term persons of unsound mind, or aliéné in the French text, designated persons who were at least in a severe pathological state and whose capacity for assessing the wrongfulness of their acts was non-existent or at least diminished. Moreover, in order to be convicted, the persons concerned had to have been criminally liable at the time of their offence, which was incompatible with the subsequent finding that these persons were of unsound mind."

In examining whether the applicant’s detention could be justified under any of the sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) of Article 5 § 1, the Court observes at the outset that his preventive detention was ordered subsequently, in a separate judgment of 3 August 2012 adopted after the trial court’s judgment of 29 October 1999. Having regard to the Court’s well-established case-law (see M. v. Germany, cited above, §§ 96-101; Glien, cited above, § 107; and Bergmann, cited above, § 104, concerning subsequently prolonged preventive detention, as well as B. v. Germany, cited above, §§ 71-76, and S. v. Germany, cited above, §§ 84-90, concerning subsequently imposed preventive detention), his detention could not, therefore, be justified under sub-paragraph (a) of Article 5 § 1 as detention “after conviction” as there was no sufficient causal connection between the applicant’s conviction by the trial court – which did not comprise a preventive detention order – and his deprivation of liberty as a result of the preventive detention order imposed in 2012."

Likewise, the applicant’s preventive detention could not be justified under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1 as being “reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence”. Under the Court’s well ‑ established case-law, this ground of detention was not adapted to a policy of general prevention directed against an individual who presented a danger on account of his propensity to crime. It only afforded Contracting States a means of preventing sufficiently concrete and specific offences as regards, in particular, the time and place of their commission and their victims (see M. v. Germany, cited above, §§ 89 and 102, and the references therein, and Jendrowiak v. Germany, no. 30060/04, § 35, 14 April 2011), which did not cover potential further offences the applicant might commit. This is indeed uncontested between the parties."

As pointed out above (see paragraphs 127 and 134), this requires, in the first place, that, at the relevant time of the decision ordering his preventive detention on 3 August 2012, the applicant was reliably shown to be of unsound mind, that is, a true mental disorder must have been established before a competent authority on the basis of objective medical expertise."

The court was satisfied that the applicant has had fantasies of sexual violence entailing attacks on the neck and the strangulation of women and masturbation on their inanimate bodies. That sexual sadism was of a serious nature and had affected the applicant’s development since his adolescence. The mental disorder had caused and been manifested in his brutal offence and still persisted. The applicant therefore suffered from a mental disorder for the purposes of section 1(1) of the Therapy Detention Act.

The third party, for its part, argued that the term persons of unsound mind should be interpreted as covering only persons in a serious pathological state whose capacity for assessing the wrongfulness of their acts was excluded or at least diminished (see paragraph 124 above)."

However, the Convention does not require that the notions used in domestic law, and in particular the notion of mental disorder for the purposes of section 1(1) of the Therapy Detention Act, be defined or interpreted in the same manner as terms used in the Convention. What is decisive, in the Court’s view, is whether the domestic courts, in the case before them, have established a disorder which can be said to amount to a true mental disorder as defined by this Court’s case-law.

As shown above, it is in the first place for the domestic courts to evaluate the qualifications of the medical expert(s) they consult (see paragraph 130 above). In the proceedings at issue, the Regional Court consulted two experienced external psychiatric experts, K. and F., who, in sum, had both considered the applicant to suffer from sexual sadism (see paragraph 35 above). The court had further regard to the findings of several medical experts who had previously examined the applicant since his arrest before concluding that the applicant suffered from sexual sadism (see paragraph 36 above). The applicant, who was aged 33 at the time when the experts drew up their report, did not bring forward any specific elements capable of demonstrating that the experts consulted manifestly lacked the necessary qualification to assess his mental condition and dangerousness.

Moreover, in the applicant’s case, the Regional Court in fact addressed the evolution in the assessment of the applicant’s mental condition by the medical experts and the courts. Having regard to the material before it, the Regional Court found that the applicant had hidden the sadistic motives for his offence at his trial in 1999. The trial court, which had also consulted two medical experts, had nevertheless already discerned some indications that the young applicant suffered from a sexual deviation. It was only in 2005/2006 that the applicant had admitted to two experts his fantasies of sexual violence which he had put into practice with his murder. The Regional Court further explained that the applicant’s new statements concerning his fantasies were more reconcilable with the trial court’s findings as to the manner in which the offence had been carried out (see paragraph 36 above)."

Moreover, in determining whether the mental disorder is of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement, it is usually necessary to assess the danger a person poses to the public at the time of the order and in the future. In view of these essential prospective elements, the preventive detention ordered against the applicant can best be described as “subsequent” to his previous offence and conviction, despite the fact that in the assessment of his dangerousness regard should also be had to his history of offences, thus embracing a retrospective aspect (see also paragraphs 104-106 above)."

In accordance with the constitutional principle of proportionality, persons of unsound mind could only be detained for an extended period of time if their dangerousness had already manifested itself in a serious offence. The applicant’s detention was being executed in the relevant period in a new preventive detention centre focused on comprehensive therapy provided by a multi ‑ disciplinary team of experts, which had made intensive efforts to motivate the applicant to undergo suitable treatment for his disorder.

The EPLN considered that the Bergmann case, to which the present application was a follow-up case, constituted a radical change in the Court’s case-law in that preventive detention which was ordered for therapeutic purposes against a person suffering from a mental illness was deemed no longer to constitute a penalty. In the EPLN’s view, preventive detention executed in the new preventive detention centres in accordance with the Preventive Detention (Distinction) Act still had to be classified as a penalty. It was only applicable to persons convicted of criminal offences. It was ordered by the criminal courts. It was aimed at prolonging the detention after convicted offenders had served their sentence. Furthermore, it was executed in centres located on the premises of prisons. Being of potentially unlimited duration, it was one of the most serious infringements of fundamental rights in a democratic society. Its “retrospective” imposition therefore breached Article 7 § 1."

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see Kafkaris v.

France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317 ‑ B; and Del Río Prada, cited above, § 81). The wording of the second sentence of Article 7 § 1 indicates that the starting-point – and thus a very weighty factor (see Glien, cited above, § 121; and Bergmann, cited above, § 150) – in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question was imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 142). The severity of the measure is not, however, in itself decisive, since many non-penal measures of a preventive nature may, just as measures which must be classified as a penalty, have a substantial impact on the person concerned (see Welch, cited above, § 32; Del Río Prada, cited above, § 82; and Bergmann, cited above, § 150)."

As shown above (see paragraph 140), while the Court had struck the application out of the list in respect of the alleged breach of Article 7 § 1 following the Government’s unilateral declaration acknowledging a violation of this provision during the time in which Mr W.P. was detained in prison, it found that Mr W.P.’s detention had complied with Article 7 § 1 in the period in which he had been detained in a new preventive detention centre.

The Court attaches decisive importance, in this context, to the fact that under sections 7(2) and 105(1) of the Juvenile Courts Act read in conjunction with the requirements set out in the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment of 4 May 2011, his subsequent preventive detention could, at the relevant time, only be ordered under a new, additional precondition, namely that he was found to suffer from a mental disorder."

                "226. This condition was independent of the initial sanction imposed for a criminal offence. It thus distinguishes the type of preventive detention in the applicant’s situation from preventive detention of dangerous offenders which was not ordered (or prolonged) subsequently. For the detention of this group of persons it is not required under domestic law that they suffer from mental disorders and they are not detained for the purposes of treating such disorders."

            [
                "227. For persons detained as medical health patients, the preventive purpose pursued by the amended preventive detention regime carries decisive weight. The Court does not overlook the fact that also in respect of this group of persons remanded in preventive detention, the link between the measure and the offence(s) in regard of which it was ordered is not completely severed. It remains a precondition for ordering or prolonging preventive detention subsequently that the person concerned was found guilty of a serious offence. However, having regard to the setting in which preventive detention orders are executed under the new regime, the Court is satisfied that the focus of the measure now lies on the medical and therapeutic treatment of the person concerned. The medical and therapeutic provision was central to the specific measures of care provided to the applicant. This fact altered the nature and purpose of the detention of persons such as the applicant and transformed it into a measure focused on the medical and therapeutic treatment of persons with a criminal history (cf. also Bergmann, cited above, §§ 164-177)."

Germany, cited above, §§ 124-32), “ordinary” preventive detention which is not executed with a view to treating the detainee’s mental disorder, even if implemented in accordance with the new legislative framework, still constitutes a penalty for the purposes of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention. The improved material conditions and care do not, in these circumstances, suffice to erase the factors indicative of a penalty.",

However, the Court takes account of the Government’s argument that the courts belonging to the criminal justice system were particularly experienced in assessing the necessity of confining mental-health patients who had committed a criminal act as they also dealt with decisions concerning detention in psychiatric hospitals under Article 63 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 84 above; cf. also Bergmann, cited above, § 178). It further observes that the criteria for the imposition of preventive detention would have been the same, irrespective of whether the civil or the criminal courts, which both belong to the courts with ordinary jurisdiction, had jurisdiction to impose that measure."

Finally, the Court observes, on the matter of the severity of the measure against the applicant, that the preventive detention order against him entailed detention without any maximum duration. It therefore remained among the most serious measures which could be imposed under the Criminal Code. The Court notes in that context that both the Council of Europe Annual Penal Statistics and the statistics submitted by the Government confirm that preventive detention orders are imposed as an ultima ratio measure. In March 2017, 591 persons were in preventive detention in Germany, a country of some 81 million inhabitants."

Moreover, unlike in the case of prison sentences, the detention had no minimum duration either. The applicant’s release was not precluded until after a certain lapse of time, but was dependent on the courts’ finding that there was no longer a high risk that the applicant would commit the most serious types of violent crimes or sexual offences as a result of his mental disorder."

                "235. The duration of the applicant’s detention thus depended to a considerable extent on his cooperation in necessary therapeutic measures. The Court notes in that context that the applicant’s transfer to the new Straubing preventive detention centre placed him in a better position to work towards his release by means of therapies tailored to his needs. Furthermore, his detention was subject to regular judicial reviews at relatively short intervals (see paragraph 64 above). That increased the probability that the measure would not last overly long. The severity of the preventive detention order was alleviated by these factors (cf. also Bergmann, cited above, §§ 179-80)."

In view of the foregoing considerations, the Court, having assessed the relevant factors in their entirety and making its own assessment, considers that the preventive detention implemented in accordance with the new legislative framework in the applicant’s case during the period here at issue can no longer be classified as a penalty within the meaning of Article 7 § 1. The applicant’s preventive detention was imposed because of and with a view to the need to treat his mental disorder, having regard to his criminal history. The Court accepts that the nature and purpose of his preventive detention, in particular, was substantially different from those of ordinary preventive detention executed irrespective of a mental disorder. The punitive element of preventive detention and its connection with the criminal offence committed by the applicant was erased to such an extent in these circumstances that the measure was no longer a penalty."

A detainee may obtain a fresh judicial review of a detention order before the ordinary courts even while a previous set of proceedings before the Constitutional Court is still pending (see paragraph 63 above; compare also Şahin Alpay v.

However, taking this element into account in the overall assessment of whether a decision has been given speedily is in line with the rationale behind its case-law (cited in paragraph 255 above) tolerating longer periods of review in proceedings before a second-instance court where the original detention order was imposed by a court in a procedure offering appropriate guarantees of due process."

            [
                "287. In its judgment of 2 February 2017 in the present case, the Chamber aptly summarised the principles relevant to the present case as follows (ibid., §§ 120-123):",
                "“The Court reiterates that the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to (i) a subjective test, where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge – that is to say whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and (ii) an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, inter alia, Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98, 39651/98, 43147/98 and 46664/99, § 191, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI, and Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine, no. 21722/11, § 104, ECHR 2013).",
                "... As to the subjective test, the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see Morel v. France, no. 34130/96, § 41, ECHR 2000 ‑ VI, and Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, § 94, ECHR 2009).",
                "... As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge’s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Wettstein v. Switzerland, no. 33958/96, § 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and Micallef, cited above, § 96).",
                "... It cannot be stated as a general rule resulting from the obligation to be impartial that a superior court which sets aside an administrative or judicial decision is bound to send the case back to a different jurisdictional authority or to a differently composed branch of that authority (see Ringeisen v. Austria, 16 July 1971, § 97, Series A no. 13, and Diennet v. France, 26 September 1995, § 38, Series A no. 325 ‑ A).”",
                "2. Application of these principles to the present case"
            ],
            [
                "288. The Court notes that, in its judgment in the present case, the Chamber gave the following reasons for its finding that the applicant had been heard by an impartial tribunal for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 in the proceedings at issue (ibid., §§ 124-128):",
                "“As regards the alleged lack of impartiality of Judge P. in the present case, the Court observes that the domestic courts examined the case on the assumption that Judge P. could have made the statement in question ... and it will therefore proceed on the basis of the same assumption. It further notes that Judge P. made the impugned statement in the course of a confidential exchange between the judges of the Regional Court and the applicant’s two defence lawyers. That discussion, which took place just after the Regional Court had delivered its first judgment ordering the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention on 22 June 2009, concerned the applicant’s possible future transfer to a psychiatric hospital. It appears uncontested between the parties, and the Court agrees with that interpretation, that the remark allegedly made by Judge P. within that context to the effect that the applicant’s female counsel should be careful that the applicant would not visit and “thank” her when released was to be understood as meaning that Judge P. considered that there was a risk that the applicant would commit a serious violent or sexual offence against his lawyer (similar to the one he had been found guilty of) if released.",
                "... The Court would stress at the outset the importance of professional conduct in the discharge of judicial functions. In determining whether it was established in view of this alleged remark that Judge P. was personally prejudiced against the applicant (see the above-mentioned “subjective test”), the Court attaches decisive weight to the context in which Judge P.’s statement was made. Assuming, as the national courts did, that he actually made the alleged remark, he did so immediately after the Regional Court, of which he was a member, had ordered the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention as it considered that the applicant was still suffering from violent sexual fantasies and that there was a high risk that the applicant would again commit serious sexual offences, including murder for sexual gratification, if released .... In these circumstances, Judge P.’s alleged remark amounted in substance to a confirmation of the Regional Court’s finding in the judgment it had just delivered. The Court therefore is not persuaded that, even assuming that the remark was made, there is sufficient evidence that Judge P. displayed hostility for personal reasons and was thus personally biased against the applicant.",
                "... The Court shall further examine whether Judge P.’s conduct may prompt objectively justified doubts as to his impartiality from the point of view of an external observer (see the above-mentioned “objective test”). It notes that in the proceedings at issue, the Regional Court, including Judge P., had to take a new decision on whether it was necessary to order the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention after the Federal Constitutional Court had quashed its judgment of 22 June 2009 and remitted the case to the Regional Court.",
                "... The Court, having regard to its case-law ..., considers that the mere fact that Judge P. had already been a member of the bench which had made the first order for the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention and moreover, following the quashing of that judgment, had been a member of the bench ordering the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention anew on 3 August 2012, did not suffice to raise objectively justified doubts as to his impartiality.",
                "... The Court further finds that the fact that Judge P., in his impugned remark, allegedly confirmed that he considered the applicant to be dangerous on 22 June 2009 does not raise objectively justified doubts that the judge lacked impartiality in the proceedings at issue here. In these proceedings, which were terminated some three years after the impugned remark, the Regional Court heard fresh evidence in order to determine whether, at that time and under the law as modified by the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment reversing its previous case-law, the applicant’s retrospective preventive detention had to be ordered. The impugned statement does not give any legitimate reason to fear that Judge P. would not have carried out that necessary fresh assessment of the level of danger that the applicant posed on the basis of the evidence produced and arguments heard in the new proceedings.”"

In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty at issue (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 64, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV; Waite v. the United Kingdom, no. 53236/99, § 65, 10 December 2002; and Kafkaris v.

Thus, had it not been for the amendment of Article 67d of the Criminal Code in 1998 (see paragraph 25 above), which was declared applicable also to preventive detention orders which had been made – as had the order against the applicant – prior to the entry into force of that amended provision (section 1a § 3 of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code; see paragraph 25 above), the applicant would have been released when ten years of preventive detention had expired, irrespective of whether he was still considered dangerous to the public."

The applicant's potential further offences were not sufficiently concrete and specific, as required by the Court's case-law, as regards, in particular, the place and time of their commission and their victims, and do not, therefore, fall within the ambit of Article 5 § 1 (c) (compare, mutatis mutandis, M. v. Germany, cited above, § 102). Nor is the Court satisfied that the domestic courts, which were called upon to determine whether the applicant was liable to reoffend owing to his criminal tendencies, based their decision to retain the applicant in preventive detention, executed in prison, on the ground that he suffered from a serious mental disorder and was thus “of unsound mind” within the meaning of sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 § 1."

The Court is aware of the fact that the domestic courts ordered the applicant's preventive detention beyond a period of ten years because they considered that there was still a risk that the applicant might commit serious sexual offences, in particular rape, if released. They thus acted in order to protect potential victims from physical and psychological harm amounting to inhuman or degrading treatment which might be caused by the applicant. Under the Court's well-established case-law, States are indeed required under Article 3 to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see, for example, A. v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 22, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VI; M.C. v.

These measures should provide effective protection and include reasonable steps to prevent ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge (see, inter alia, Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, § 73, ECHR 2001 ‑ V; D.P. and J.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 38719/97, § 109, 10 October 2002; compare also, in the context of Article 2, Mastromatteo v.

In other words, the Convention obliges State authorities to take reasonable steps within the scope of their powers to prevent ill ‑ treatment of which they had or ought to have had knowledge, but it does not permit a State to protect individuals from criminal acts of a person by measures which are in breach of that person's Convention rights, in particular the right to liberty as guaranteed by Article 5 § 1."

While it prohibits in particular the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused's disadvantage (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260 ‑ A ) or extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused's detriment, for instance by analogy (see Uttley v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 36946/03, 29 November 2005, and Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV ). ...",
                "120. The concept of “penalty” in Article 7 is autonomous in scope. To render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “penalty” within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A; Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317 ‑ B; and Uttley, cited above). The wording of Article 7 paragraph 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28; Jamil, cited above, § 31; Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 142 ).

At that time, a preventive detention order made by a sentencing court for the first time, read in conjunction with Article 67d § 1 of the Criminal Code in the version then in force (see paragraph 24 above), meant that the applicant could be kept in preventive detention for ten years at the most. Based on the subsequent amendment in 1998 of Article 67d of the Criminal Code, read in conjunction with section 1a § 3 of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code (see paragraph 25 above), which abolished that maximum duration with immediate effect, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences then ordered, in the proceedings here at issue, the applicant's continued preventive detention beyond the ten ‑ year point.

Submitting documentary evidence, he argued that owing to his unlawful detention between 2002 and 2009, he had been unable to work in his profession as a motor mechanic, to earn a salary which, statistically, would have amounted to EUR 280,000 gross, and to acquire pension rights. Moreover, he had had to pay EUR 8,693 to a psychologist for a behaviour therapy and for the treatment of his depressions in order to obtain the necessary psychological care helping him to come to terms with his illegal preventive detention. He could not be expected to have made a different therapy while in illegal detention. Furthermore, he had been obliged to pay EUR 12,620.12 for an antibody therapy to cure a cancer of his eyes, having refused a radiotherapy proposed by the prison authorities which had entailed a risk to go blind. He alleged that a statutory health insurance company, which would have been his insurer had he lived in freedom, would have reimbursed the costs of the antibody therapy."

He had failed to substantiate sufficiently that he could have earned in practice the salary claimed in his profession as a motor mechanic, which he had exercised only for a couple of months since 1972. As for the medical fees paid to his psychologist by his wife, the Government submitted that the applicant could not claim the reimbursement of the costs of his behaviour therapy he had not borne himself. The authorities had refused to pay for that therapy because the applicant should have made a more far-reaching social therapy in order to treat his personality disorder. He had, however, refused to accept the prison authorities'repeated offers of such treatment which would also have included help in order to deal with a long period of detention. As for the costs for the antibody therapy to cure the cancer of his eyes, the Government argued that those costs, paid again by his wife, had not been caused by his allegedly illegal detention. There was nothing to indicate that a compulsory health insurance company would have reimbursed those costs had he been at liberty as the radiotherapy offered to him had not entailed a substantial risk to go blind."

The Court notes with regard to the applicant's claim concerning pecuniary damage that the applicant failed to demonstrate that it was his preventive detention beyond the ten-year-point, in breach of Article 5 § 1 and Article 7 § 1, which prevented him from earning a salary as a motor mechanic he would have obtained otherwise. Consequently, no clear causal connection between the Convention violations and the applicant's loss of estimated earnings and pension rights has been established and the Court therefore rejects the applicant's claim in this respect. As to the costs for his psychological treatment, the Court observes that the applicant was offered a more comprehensive social therapy, including help to deal with his long detention. Therefore, the costs incurred for his behaviour therapy cannot be said to have been caused by his detention in breach of the Convention. Finally, the applicant failed to demonstrate that he would not have had to bear the costs of the antibody therapy he chose to cure the cancer of his eyes had he not been in detention at the relevant time; consequently, a causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged has not been established in this respect either.

Germany (cited above, §§ 124-133), the Court concluded that preventive detention under the German Criminal Code had to be classified as a “penalty” for the purposes of Article 7 § 1, second sentence. It takes note of the Government ’ s argument that the applicant ’ s preventive detention, contrary to the Court ’ s findings in the case of M. v. Germany, could no longer be considered as a “penalty” as a substantial difference was being established between the execution of a term of imprisonment and that of preventive detention."

In determining whether the applicant ’ s preventive detention, having regard to the criteria established in its case-law, constitutes a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 § 1, it reiterates that the starting-point – and thus a very weighty factor – in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence” (see paragraph 11 8 above). It notes that the applicant ’ s preventive detention was imposed by the Hanau Regional Court in December 1997 together with the applicant ’ s conviction for criminal offences, namely eleven counts of sexual abuse of children. Article 66 § 2 of the Criminal Code, under which the preventive detention order against the applicant was made, indeed allowed such an order to be made only against someone who has, amongst other requirements, been sentenced for (at least) three intentional offences to at least three years ’ imprisonment (see paragraph 34 above). The applicant ’ s situation is thus comparable to that of the applicant in the M. v. Germany case (cited above, § 124) in this respect."

The Court would add that it was still that preventive detention ordered in 1997 which was being executed and prolonged by the courts dealing with the execution of sentences in the proceedings at issue. In particular, no use was made of the possibility provided for by the Therapy Detention Act (see paragraphs 39 -40 above) to obtain an order of a civil section of the competent Regional Court for the applicant ’ s placement in a suitable institution for mental health patients in view of his current dangerousness. Unlike preventive detention under the Criminal Code, therapy detention under the Therapy Detention Act is not a measure imposed following and together with the conviction for a criminal offence, despite the fact that it can be ordered only in respect of persons who committed certain serious offences and were previously kept in preventive detention. Therapy detention is not designed as a sanction for a criminal offence imposed by the criminal courts. It is a measure ordered by the civil courts, outside the criminal law context, and aimed at the medical and therapeutic treatment and reduction of the current dangerousness of persons suffering from a mental disorder, who previously manifested that they posed a high risk to the public by committing a serious criminal offence."

                "124. As regards the characterisation of preventive detention under domestic law, the Court notes that in Germany such detention is not, and has never been, considered as a penalty to which the constitutional absolute ban on retrospective punishment applies. In its leading judgment of 4 May 2011, the Federal Constitutional Court has again confirmed that preventive detention, contrary to this Court ’ s findings in respect of Article 7 of the Convention, was not a penalty for the purposes of the absolute prohibition of the retrospective application of criminal law under the Basic Law (see paragraph 4 7 above). In that context, the Court agrees with the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s finding that a schematic alignment of the meaning of the constitutional notion of “penalty” to that under the Convention was not mandatory if, in substance, the minimum standards set by the Convention were complied with (see paragraphs 4 5 and 4 7 above). As laid down in its case-law, the Court, for its part, must interpret the notion of “penalty” in Article 7 § 1 autonomously, having regard also to the classification of comparable measures in other Contracting Parties to the Convention (see M. v. Germany, cited above, § 126)."

Having regard to the manner in which the preventive detention order was implemented in the present case, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s detention at the relevant time was executed in prison, in a separate wing for persons in preventive detention. As found above (see paragraphs 9 5 -9 6 ), the Court, having regard to its findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 127) and to the material before it, is not convinced that the alterations to the applicant ’ s detention regime at the relevant time were such as to distinguish the execution of the preventive detention order against him from that of a prison sentence."

In the present case, the Court, referring to its findings above (see paragraphs 9 8 -9 9 ), notes that at the time of the applicant ’ s preventive detention as a result of the proceedings here at issue, extensive measures had been initiated in the defendant State on judicial, legislative and executive level with a view to adapting the execution of preventive detention to the requirements, in particular, of the fundamental right to liberty in the near future. As a result of the changes, the adequate treatment of persons in preventive detention with a view to reducing their dangerousness shall be at the heart of the execution of preventive detention orders. However, the Court is not persuaded that during the period of the applicant ’ s detention here at issue, the applicant was provided with any such additional measures."

Finally, as regards the severity of a preventive detention order – which, as reiterated above (at paragraph 118 ), is not in itself decisive – the Court refers to its findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 132) and observes that that measure still entailed detention which, following the change in the law in 1998, no longer had any maximum duration. It is true that the persons concerned had a real prospect of being released if they participated in the treatment and measures considered necessary to reduce their dangerousness. Nevertheless, the applicant ’ s release was not to be ordered simply after the lapse of a certain time. It was subject to a court ’ s finding that it was not highly likely that the applicant, owing to specific circumstances relating to his conduct, would commit the most serious offences or that he did not suffer from a mental disorder. The latter requirements set up by the Federal Constitutional Court were stricter than those at issue in the case of M. v. Germany (ibid.). Preventive detention, however, still remained among the most severe measures which may be imposed under the German Criminal Code. It is noted in that context that the applicant to date has been in preventive detention approximately three times the length of the prison sentence imposed for his sexual offences."

In his reports, the expert, having regard to the common instruments for the classification of diseases ( inter alia, the ICD-10 and the psychopathy checklist), had considered the applicant as dangerous for being a psychopath and as suffering from paedophilia towards boys and from a dissocial personality, which could not be considered as pathological.

Reversing its previous position, the Federal Constitutional Court held that all provisions concerned, both on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective ordering of such detention, were incompatible with the Basic Law as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a State governed by the rule of law, read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty."

In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged retrospectively, or ordered retrospectively under Article 66b § 2 of the Criminal Code, the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned, owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct, were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if, additionally, they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 1 § 1 of the newly enacted Therapy Detention Act. As regards the notion of mental disorder, the Federal Constitutional Court explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of “persons of unsound mind” in Article 5 § 1 sub-paragraph (e) of the Convention made in this Court ’ s case-law (see §§ 138 and 143-156 of the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s judgment).

In line with the Court ’ s findings in the case of M. v.

The Federal Constitutional Court noted that the European Court of Human Rights had considered preventive detention to be a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., § § 102, 140). It considered that it was not necessary schematically to align the meaning of the constitutional notion of “ penalty ” to that under the Convention.

Specific disorders in a person ’ s personality, conduct, sexual preference and control of impulses were covered by the notion of “mental disorder” in section 1 § 1 of the Therapy Detention Act.

Accordingly, on 7 March 2012 the Government had submitted to the Federal legislator a draft Act on establishment, at federal level, of a difference in the provisions on preventive detention compared to those on prison sentences ( Gesetz zur bundesrechtlichen Umsetzung des Abstandsgebotes im Recht der Sicherungsverwahrung ) which was being examined by Parliament at the time of their submissions to the Court. Likewise, the Land Rhineland-Palatinate (in which Diez Prison was situated) had drafted an act on the enforcement of preventive detention to implement the new federal legislation. The Federal Constitutional Court had thus paved the way so that in cases as the present one preventive detention was only executed if it was justified under sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 § 1. The implementation of a difference between the execution of penalties and of preventive detention guaranteed that the institutions in which preventive detention was executed against persons suffering from a mental disorder were suitable institutions for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 (e)."

In the transitional period, the Federal Constitutional Court had therefore permitted the continuing execution of preventive detention under restrictive conditions as the authorities and courts would be faced with problems which could hardly be solved if all persons in preventive detention were to be released immediately. The Government considered that the Court had accepted this approach in its case-law. A transitional period was necessary in order for the respondent State to comply with its duty under Article 3 to protect the public from most dangerous offenders. Therefore, the Court equally had to give Member States sufficient time to fully implement its case-law."

A multidisciplinary staff would work in that unit. The applicant was transferred to that new building on 7 June 2013."

Persons in preventive detention as the applicant could leave their living spaces most of the time during the day, move within the prison wing and use the courtyard whenever they wished, and not only one hour per day. They could use a recreation room, a gym and the unit ’ s kitchen and had more wide-ranging shopping opportunities than persons serving a term of imprisonment. They could further furnish their living spaces more individually and keep birds. Furthermore, they could telephone their relatives and friends almost without restriction."

Referring to the authorities ’ and domestic courts ’ findings in this respect (see paragraphs 26-30 above), the Government argued that the applicant had, however, lacked motivation to undergo therapy since his conviction of sexual abuse of children in 1984. Consequently, the applicant had been detained in an institution suitable for him for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 (e) as, given his lack of motivation to undergo therapy, he could not have profited from further offers of long-term treatment.",

The Court reiterates that Article 5 § 1 sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) contain an exhaustive list of permissible grounds for deprivation of liberty, and no deprivation of liberty will be lawful unless it falls within one of those grounds (see, inter alia, Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, § 96, Series A no. 39; Witold Litwa v. Poland, no. 26629/95, § 49, ECHR 2000 ‑ III; Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 43, ECHR 2008; and Del Rio Prada v. Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, § 123, 21 October 2013 ). Only a narrow interpretation of the exhaustive list of permissible grounds for deprivation of liberty is consistent with the aim of Article 5, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty (see, among many others, Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, § 37, Series A no. 33; Guzzardi, cited above, § 98; and Shimovolos v.

Russia, no. 58973/00, § 26, 28 October 2003). An individual cannot be deprived of his liberty as being of “unsound mind” unless the following three minimum conditions are satisfied: firstly, he must reliably be shown to be of unsound mind, that is, a true mental disorder must be established before a competent authority on the basis of objective medical expertise; secondly, the mental disorder must be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement; thirdly, the validity of continued confinement depends upon the persistence of such a disorder (see Winterwerp, cited above, § 39; and Stanev v.

In deciding whether an individual should be detained as a person “of unsound mind”, the national authorities are to be recognised as having a certain discretion, in particular on the merits of clinical diagnoses, since it is in the first place for the national authorities to evaluate the evidence adduced before them in a particular case; the Court ’ s task is to review under the Convention the decisions of those authorities (see Winterwerp, cited above, § 40; X v. the United Kingdom, 5 November 1981, § 43, Series A no. 46; H.L. v. the United Kingdom, no. 45508/99, § 98, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX; Puttrus v. Germany (dec.), no. 1241/06, 24 March 2009; and S. v. Germany, no. 3300/10, § 81, 28 June 2012 ). The relevant time at which a person must be reliably established to be of unsound mind, for the requirements of sub ‑ paragraph (e) of Article 5 § 1, is the date of the adoption of the measure depriving that person of his liberty as a result of that condition (compare Luberti v. Italy, 23 February 1984, § 28, Series A no. 75; B v. Germany, no. 61272/09, § 68, 19 April 2012 )."

They had to establish, on the other hand, whether the applicant suffered from a mental disorder (see paragraph 4 4 above and, in contrast, the situation in Kallweit, cited above, § 56; O.H. v.

The Court notes that the domestic courts, endorsing the findings made by the expert they had consulted, found that the applicant was a psychopath suffering from paedophilia, a sexual deviation, and from a dissocial personality. His dissocial personality was characterised by continuous irresponsibility and disregard for social rules and obligations, his inability to maintain long-term relationships, his inability to feel guilty and to learn from experience, as well as his tendency to blame others and to superficially rationalise his own behaviour (see paragraph 16 above)."

                "“117. The guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 of the Convention in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 34, Series A no. 335 ‑ B; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 32, Series A no. 335 ‑ C; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 50, ECHR 2001 ‑ II; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 137). ...",
                "120. The concept of “penalty” in Article 7 is autonomous in scope. To render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “penalty” within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A; Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317 ‑ B; and Uttley, cited above). The wording of Article 7 paragraph 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28; Jamil, cited above, § 31; Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 142 ). The severity of the measure is not, however, in itself decisive, since, for instance, many non-penal measures of a preventive nature may have a substantial impact on the person concerned (see Welch, cited above, § 32; compare also Van der Velden, cited above). ”",

In determining whether the applicant ’ s detention resulting from the impugned decisions complied with the prohibition of retrospective penalties under Article 7 § 1, second sentence, of the Convention, the Court notes that the applicant committed the offences of sexual abuse of children in respect of which his preventive detention was ordered between July 1986 and December 1996. At that time, a preventive detention order made by a sentencing court for the first time, read in conjunction with Article 67d § 1 of the Criminal Code in the version then in force (see paragraph 36 above), meant that the applicant could be kept in preventive detention for ten years at the most. Based on the subsequent amendment in 1998 of Article 67d of the Criminal Code, read in conjunction with section 1a (3) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code (see paragraph 37 above), which abolished that maximum duration with immediate effect, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences then ordered, in the proceedings here at issue, the applicant ’ s continued preventive detention beyond the ten - year point. Thus, the applicant ’ s preventive detention – as that of the applicant in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above) – was extended with retrospective effect, under a law enacted after the applicant had committed his offences."

It takes note of the Government ’ s argument that the applicant ’ s preventive detention, contrary to the Court ’ s findings in the case of M. v.

It notes that the applicant ’ s preventive detention was imposed by the Hanau Regional Court in December 1997 together with the applicant ’ s conviction for criminal offences, namely eleven counts of sexual abuse of children. Article 66 § 2 of the Criminal Code, under which the preventive detention order against the applicant was made, indeed allowed such an order to be made only against someone who has, amongst other requirements, been sentenced for (at least) three intentional offences to at least three years ’ imprisonment (see paragraph 34 above).

Unlike preventive detention under the Criminal Code, therapy detention under the Therapy Detention Act is not a measure imposed following and together with the conviction for a criminal offence, despite the fact that it can be ordered only in respect of persons who committed certain serious offences and were previously kept in preventive detention. Therapy detention is not designed as a sanction for a criminal offence imposed by the criminal courts. It is a measure ordered by the civil courts, outside the criminal law context, and aimed at the medical and therapeutic treatment and reduction of the current dangerousness of persons suffering from a mental disorder, who previously manifested that they posed a high risk to the public by committing a serious criminal offence."

In that context, the Court agrees with the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s finding that a schematic alignment of the meaning of the constitutional notion of “penalty” to that under the Convention was not mandatory if, in substance, the minimum standards set by the Convention were complied with (see paragraphs 4 5 and 4 7 above). As laid down in its case-law, the Court, for its part, must interpret the notion of “penalty” in Article 7 § 1 autonomously, having regard also to the classification of comparable measures in other Contracting Parties to the Convention (see M. v.

As a result of the changes, the adequate treatment of persons in preventive detention with a view to reducing their dangerousness shall be at the heart of the execution of preventive detention orders.

It is true that the persons concerned had a real prospect of being released if they participated in the treatment and measures considered necessary to reduce their dangerousness. Nevertheless, the applicant ’ s release was not to be ordered simply after the lapse of a certain time. It was subject to a court ’ s finding that it was not highly likely that the applicant, owing to specific circumstances relating to his conduct, would commit the most serious offences or that he did not suffer from a mental disorder. The latter requirements set up by the Federal Constitutional Court were stricter than those at issue in the case of M. v. Germany (ibid.). Preventive detention, however, still remained among the most severe measures which may be imposed under the German Criminal Code.

The former are detained in larger and well-equipped apartment units, are provided with common rooms and equipment to occupy themselves and are granted more individual freedom, including freedom of movement. More importantly, substantive means have been made available in order to provide detainees in preventive detention with individual and intensive psychiatric, psychotherapeutic or sociotherapeutic treatment aimed at reducing the risk they pose to the public, as prescribed by Article 66c of the Criminal Code and section 4 ( 2 ) of the Lower Saxony Preventive Detention Act. Despite the fact that preventive detention has remained a State reaction to a criminal offence depriving the persons concerned of their liberty, the Court is satisfied that the manner in which the measure is now enforced has considerably changed."

The Court considers it of particular importance that, under section 316f ( 2 ), second sentence, of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code, a new additional condition must be met if the preventive detention of a person is to be prolonged retrospectively, namely that the person concerned must be found to suffer from a mental disorder. This element was not relevant under domestic law for the court issuing the preventive detention order in 1986 and alters the nature of the detention of the persons concerned. Despite the fact that the link of the measure to the offences in respect of which it was ordered is not completely severed, the focus of the measure then lies on the medical and therapeutic treatment of the person concerned."

The Court observes that, in accordance with the new concept of preventive detention as regulated from 2013 onwards, the applicant in the present case was offered, and partly accepted, treatment with a view to addressing his mental disorder. The treatment comprised, in particular, medication, a treatment programme for offenders, regular meetings with a psychologist, and treatment aimed at preventing detainees from relapsing into excessive alcohol consumption. The Court therefore considers that there was a substantial change in the medical and therapeutic care offered to the applicant after his transfer to the Rosdorf centre. The nature of the preventive detention thus changed in the case of the applicant, whose detention was extended because he was considered to pose a particular danger to the public as a result of his mental disorder."

In reaching its conclusion, the Court had regard to the situation of persons in preventive detention and, in particular, the lack of special measures aimed at reducing the risk they posed to the public."

However, the legislator, as required by the Federal Constitutional Court in its leading judgment of 4 May 2011, further developed and strengthened the preventive and therapeutic aspect of preventive detention. In line with section 2 ( 1 ) of the Lower Saxony Preventive Detention Act, preventive detention centres have been created in which a number of specific measures are offered to detainees in order to help them reduce their dangerousness to such an extent that they may be released. As a result of the changes, adequate treatment of persons in preventive detention with a view to reducing their dangerousness is now at the heart of preventive detention."

The Court is nevertheless mindful of the fact that preventive detention can be imposed only if the person concerned was found guilty of several intentional criminal offences of certain gravity. When a trial court orders preventive detention together with punishment for an offence, the person concerned may well understand it as an additional punishment. It clearly entails also a deterrent element, which is not eclipsed by the additional treatment measures in better material conditions of detention. In prison sentences and preventive detention alike, these serve the purpose of allowing detainees to become capable of leading a socially responsible life without committing new offences."

                "176. In line with its above findings concerning the nature of the measure (see paragraphs 167-169 above), the Court considers, however, that, contrary to the situation prevailing when the applicant ’ s preventive detention was ordered, and contrary to the situation for persons whose preventive detention was not prolonged (or ordered) retrospectively, it was a new precondition for the prolongation of the applicant ’ s detention that he was found to suffer from a mental disorder. The Court finds that the preventive purpose pursued by the amended preventive detention legislation attains decisive weight in these circumstances. The applicant ’ s preventive detention could only be prolonged because of his dangerousness as a result of his mental disorder. That mental disorder was not a precondition for the sentencing court ’ s order for preventive detention and is thus a new, additional element which is independent of the initial sanction imposed and clearly distinguishes the nature of his detention for medical treatment purposes. Moreover, as stated above, the applicant ’ s medical treatment is central to the specific measures of care offered to him. In the Court ’ s view, this focus on the applicant ’ s medical treatment in order to reduce his dangerousness distinguishes his situation and that of detainees in a similar situation from detainees in preventive detention who are offered treatment which, in a less extensive form, is also offered to ordinary prisoners serving a term of imprisonment."

In examining the procedures involved in the making and implementation of orders for preventive detention such as that imposed on the applicant, the Court observes that, just as in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 131) and Glien (cited above, § 128), the applicant’s preventive detention was ordered by the (criminal) sentencing courts. Its implementation was determined by the courts responsible for the execution of sentences, that is, courts also belonging to the criminal justice system, in a separate procedure. The procedure differs in this respect from that under sections 1 and 4 of the Therapy Detention Act, which provides that the civil sections of the Regional Court decide on the confinement of particularly dangerous offenders suffering from a mental disorder (see paragraph 64 above). However, the Court takes account of the Government’s argument in that respect (see paragraph 146 above) that the courts dealing with the execution of sentences were particularly experienced in assessing the necessity of confining mental-health patients as they also dealt with decisions concerning detentions in psychiatric hospitals under Article 63 of the Criminal Code."

                "179.  Lastly, as regards the severity of a preventive detention order which, as reiterated above (at paragraph 150), is not in itself decisive – the Court observes that that measure, just as in the cases of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 132) and Glien (cited above, § 129), still entailed detention which, following the change in the law in 1998, no longer had a maximum duration. The applicant’s release was not to be ordered simply after the lapse of a certain time. However, it must equally be noted that, other than for prison sentences, there was also no minimum duration of detention. The duration of detention thus depended to a considerable extent on the applicant’s cooperation. However, even though he was put in a better position, by the new framework in which his preventive detention was implemented, in order to work towards the reduction of his dangerousness, his release was still subject to a court finding that it was no longer highly likely that he would again commit serious crimes of violence or sexual offences as a result of his mental disorder."

The latter requirements, initially set up by the Federal Constitutional Court and taken up by the legislator in section 316f(2), second sentence, of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code, are stricter than those at issue in the case of M. v. Germany (ibid.). Preventive detention, however, still remains among the most severe measures which may be imposed under the Criminal Code. It is noted in that context that at the time of the proceedings at issue, the applicant had already been in preventive detention for more than twelve years, following his term of imprisonment of fifteen years."

                "181.  In view of the foregoing, the Court, having assessed in their entirety the relevant factors to determine whether the measure constitutes a penalty and making its own assessment, considers that preventive detention implemented in accordance with the new legislative framework as a rule still constitutes a “penalty” for the purposes of Article 7 § 1. It finds that the more preventive nature and purpose of the revised form of preventive detention do not suffice to eclipse the fact that the measure, which entails a deprivation of liberty without a maximum duration, was imposed following conviction for a criminal offence and it is still determined by courts belonging to the criminal justice system."

However, in cases such as that of the applicant, where preventive detention is extended because of, and with a view to the need to treat his mental disorder, the Court accepts that both the nature and the purpose of his preventive detention substantially changed and that the punitive element, and its connection with his criminal conviction, is eclipsed to such an extent that the measure is no longer to be classified as a penalty within the meaning of Article 7 § 1."

In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged retrospectively, or ordered retrospectively under Article 66b § 2 of the Criminal Code, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned, owing to specific circumstances relating to their personality or their conduct, were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if, additionally, they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 1 ( 1 ) of the newly enacted Therapy Detention Act. As regards the notion of mental disorder, the Federal Constitutional Court explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of “persons of unsound mind” in Article 5 § 1 sub-paragraph (e) of the Convention made in this Court ’ s case-law (see §§ 138 and 143-56 of the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s judgment). If the above pre-conditions were not met, those detainees had to be released no later than 31 December 2011. The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality; as a general rule, proportionality was respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released."

It stressed, in particular, that the constitutional requirement to differentiate between preventive detention and imprisonment and the principles laid down in Article 7 of the Convention required an individualised and intensified offer of therapy and care to the persons concerned. In line with the Court ’ s findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 129), it was necessary to provide a high level of care by a team of multi-disciplinary staff and to offer the detainees an individualised therapy if the standard therapies available in the institution had no prospects of success (see § 113 of the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s judgment)."

The latter was a measure of correction and prevention, which was not aimed at punishing criminal guilt, but was a purely preventive measure aimed at protecting the public from a dangerous offender (see §§ 100-01 and 141-42 of the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s judgment). The Federal Constitutional Court noted that the European Court of Human Rights had considered preventive detention to be a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 102 and 140). It considered that it was not necessary schematically to align the meaning of the constitutional notion of “penalty” with that under the Convention. Recourse should rather be had to the value judgments ( Wertungen ) under the Convention in a result-oriented manner in order to prevent breaches of public international law (ibid., §§ 91 and 141 et seq .)."

The Court further observes in that context that the applicant had already been found to have, in particular, a sexual deviance at the time of the offences in respect of which his preventive detention had been ordered.

France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317 ‑ B; and Del Río Prada, cited above, § 81 ). The wording of the second sentence of Article 7 § 1 indicates that the starting-point – and thus a very weighty factor (see Glien, cited above, § 121) – in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question was imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; and Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 142, ECHR 2008 ).

In its leading judgment of 4 May 2011, the Federal Constitutional Court again confirmed that preventive detention, contrary to this Court ’ s findings in respect of Article 7 of the Convention, was not a penalty for the purposes of the absolute prohibition on the retrospective application of criminal law under the Basic Law (see paragraph 71 above). It further found that the former provisions of the Criminal Code on the imposition and duration of preventive detention failed, however, to meet the constitutional requirement of differentiating between purely preventive measures of correction and prevention, such as preventive detention, and penalties, such as prison sentences (see paragraph 67 above). The court therefore ordered the legislator to amend the provisions on preventive detention in the Criminal Code so as to reflect that difference."

However, the Court observes that, unlike in the above-mentioned cases, the applicant ’ s preventive detention was not effected in an ordinary prison in a separate wing for persons in preventive detention. At the relevant time, the applicant was detained as a person “of unsound mind” in the preventive detention centre on the premises of Rosdorf Prison, where he was offered treatment with a view to addressing his mental disorder (compare also Berland v.

This element was not relevant under domestic law for the court issuing the preventive detention order in 1986 and alters the nature of the detention of the persons concerned.

The Court therefore considers that there was a substantial change in the medical and therapeutic care offered to the applicant after his transfer to the Rosdorf centre.

The Court finds that the preventive purpose pursued by the amended preventive detention legislation attains decisive weight in these circumstances. The applicant ’ s preventive detention could only be prolonged because of his dangerousness as a result of his mental disorder. That mental disorder was not a precondition for the sentencing court ’ s order for preventive detention and is thus a new, additional element which is independent of the initial sanction imposed and clearly distinguishes the nature of his detention for medical treatment purposes. Moreover, as stated above, the applicant ’ s medical treatment is central to the specific measures of care offered to him. In the Court ’ s view, this focus on the applicant ’ s medical treatment in order to reduce his dangerousness distinguishes his situation and that of detainees in a similar situation from detainees in preventive detention who are offered treatment which, in a less extensive form, is also offered to ordinary prisoners serving a term of imprisonment."

Its implementation was determined by the courts responsible for the execution of sentences, that is, courts also belonging to the criminal justice system, in a separate procedure. The procedure differs in this respect from that under sections 1 and 4 of the Therapy Detention Act, which provides that the civil sections of the Regional Court decide on the confinement of particularly dangerous offenders suffering from a mental disorder (see paragraph 64 above). However, the Court takes account of the Government’s argument in that respect (see paragraph 146 above) that the courts dealing with the execution of sentences were particularly experienced in assessing the necessity of confining mental-health patients as they also dealt with decisions concerning detentions in psychiatric hospitals under Article 63 of the Criminal Code."

The applicant’s release was not to be ordered simply after the lapse of a certain time. However, it must equally be noted that, other than for prison sentences, there was also no minimum duration of detention. The duration of detention thus depended to a considerable extent on the applicant’s cooperation. However, even though he was put in a better position, by the new framework in which his preventive detention was implemented, in order to work towards the reduction of his dangerousness, his release was still subject to a court finding that it was no longer highly likely that he would again commit serious crimes of violence or sexual offences as a result of his mental disorder."

The purpose of this legal provision does not appear to be to inflict a punishment in relation to a particular offence of which a person has been convicted, but is rather aimed at ensuring public confidence in the profession in question. It is aimed at members of a professional group possessing a special status, specifically liquidators in insolvency proceedings (compare Müller-Hartburg, cited above, § 45, and Biagioli, decision cited above, § 54).

In this connection, he referred to Article 28 of the Slovenian Constitution, which sets out the principle of legality in criminal law prohibiting, inter alia, any retroactive application of criminal law.

He argued that over the years in this profession, he had gained extensive experience and had built up his reputation.

The wording of Article 7 § 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a “penalty” is whether the measure in question is imposed following a decision that a person is guilty of a criminal offence. However, other factors may also be taken into account as relevant in this connection, namely the nature and purpose of the measure in question; its characterisation under national law; the procedures involved in the making and implementation of the measure; and its severity (see G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others, cited above, § 211). These factors resemble the criteria to be considered in determining whether or not there was a “criminal charge”, commonly known as the “Engel criteria” (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, §§ 82-83, Series A no. 22), which apply also to Article 7 of the Convention and Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (see Lázaro Laporta v.

Greece (dec.), no. 53372/07, 23 August 2011). It noted that the dismissal had been imposed solely on the objective basis of a final criminal conviction. The purpose of the dismissal had not been to punish the applicant for the offence he had committed but had been based on the fact that the applicant had no longer possessed, as a result of his conviction, the qualities and guarantees necessary to carry out his job. The Court later noted in Kapetanios and Others v. Greece (nos. 3453/12 and 2 others, § 87, 30 April 2015) that in cases such as Vagenas (decision cited above) the disciplinary proceedings had had a certain autonomy vis ‑ à ‑ vis the criminal proceedings, in particular as regards the manner in which they had been carried out and their purpose."

San Marino ((dec.), no. 8162/13, 13 September 2016) that the offences brought against the applicants – a lawyer, and both a notary public and a lawyer respectively – in the disciplinary proceedings had not been criminal but disciplinary in nature. It observed that the fact that acts which could have led to a disciplinary sanction had also constituted criminal offences (specifically in those particular cases fraudulent conversion and making false declarations in public documents respectively) had not been sufficient to consider a person responsible under disciplinary law as having been “charged” with a crime. As regards the nature of the disciplinary offences in question, the Court further noted that the offences had related solely to professional misconduct and the applicable disciplinary law had not been aimed at the general public but to members of a professional group possessing a special status (see Müller-Hartburg, cited above, § 44, and Biagioli, decision cited above, § 54). In both cases the purpose of the proceedings had been to protect the public trust in, and the reputation of, the profession (see Müller-Hartburg, cited above, § 45, and Biagioli, decision cited above, § 55). The Court further observed in Müller ‑ Hartburg that the disciplinary authorities had been required to have particular regard not only to the degree of culpability but to the damage resulting from the commission of the offence, in particular to members of the public (cited above, § 45)."

The Court went on to note that, although not crucial to this finding, being disbarred did not necessarily have a permanent effect because a professional who had been disbarred might be reinstated if he or she had been rehabilitated and it were shown that his or her conduct had not been reprehensible (ibid., § 56)."

It took into account, inter alia, the fact that the licence had been withdrawn a while after the relevant driving offences had been committed, which had meant that prevention and deterrence for the protection of the safety of road users could not have been the only purposes of the measure, and that the severity of the measure, namely suspension of the applicant’s driving licence for eighteen months, had been in itself so significant, regardless of the context of his criminal conviction, that it could ordinarily be viewed as a criminal sanction. In a similar, more recent, case ( Rivard v. Switzerland, no. 21563/12, § 24, 4 October 2016) the Court, finding under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 that the revocation of the applicant’s driving licence was of a criminal nature, took account of the potential seriousness of the measure, including a possibility of revocation for an unlimited period.",

S.R.L. and Others, cited above, §§ 228-32).

The measure was thus not set out in criminal law (contrast Gouarré Patte, cited above, § 30). Moreover, the Court appreciates from the Constitutional Court’s decision of 1 June 1995 that although a measure that prevented a person from obtaining a licence to practise a certain profession amounted to a “legal consequence” of a conviction, it was not to be considered to be a sanction that was criminal in nature (see paragraph 37 above). Having said that, the Court must interpret the concept of a “penalty” in an autonomous manner (see G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others, cited above, § 216). It must thus consider whether any other factors (see paragraphs 53 to 54 above) lead to the conclusion that Article 7 is applicable in the present case."

The purpose of this legal provision does not appear to be to inflict a punishment in relation to a particular offence of which a person has been convicted, but is rather aimed at ensuring public confidence in the profession in question. It is aimed at members of a professional group possessing a special status, specifically liquidators in insolvency proceedings (compare Müller-Hartburg, cited above, § 45, and Biagioli, decision cited above, § 54). Therefore, the revocation of the licence did not have a punitive and dissuasive aim pertaining to criminal sanctions."

In the present case, the Court observes that as a result of his criminal conviction the applicant’s licence was revoked with permanent effect, which in itself appears to be a rather severe consequence (see paragraphs 18 to 26 and 29 above). However, bearing in mind the above principle and taking into account the considerations made in respect of other factors mentioned in paragraphs 62 to 65 above and the fact that the revocation of the applicant’s licence did not prevent him from practising any other profession within his field of expertise (see, mutatis mutandis, Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine, no. 21722/11, § 93, ECHR 2013), the Court finds that, in the circumstances of the present case, the mere fact that the impugned measure was of a permanent nature does not suffice for the revocation of the applicant’s licence to be regarded as a penalty within the meaning of Article 7."

Where, as a consequence of the restrictions, the applicant’s income and the value of his clientele and, more generally, his business, had fallen, the Court held that there had been an interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Malik v. the United Kingdom, no. 23780/08, § 90, 13 March 2012). In cases concerning the granting of licences or permits to carry out a business, the Court has indicated that the revocation or withdrawal of a permit or licence had interfered with the applicants’ right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, including the economic interests connected with the underlying business (see Malik, cited above, § 91 and the cases cited therein)."

On 13 January 2012 the Ljubljana District Court, by means of a judgment, joined the three above-mentioned prison sentences, including the one for robbery which the applicant had already completed, in an overall sentence. Applying the 2008 Criminal Code as applicable before the introduction of the 2011 Amendment (see paragraphs 22 and 23 below), the court noted that the applicant should have had an overall sentence imposed on him as the conditions under Article 53 of the 2008 Criminal Code (see paragraph 22 below) had been met but the provision had not been applied in his case. While acknowledging that Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code applied to the case (see paragraph 22 below), the District Court sentenced the applicant to an overall term of thirty years ’ imprisonment. In its reasoning, it noted that the principle of the rule of law required, inter alia, that criminal-law provisions be drafted in a clear and precise manner in order to avoid sentences being imposed arbitrarily. It went on to note that the legislation applicable to the present case was unclear, ambiguous and deficient for the following reasons. Although the maximum sentence applicable under the 2008 Criminal Code had been thirty years ’ imprisonment and the rules on combining multiple sentences in an overall sentence, enshrined in Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, provided that the overall sentence must exceed each of the individual sentences, these same rules prescribed a maximum sentence of twenty years. The court took the view that the legislature had not intended to enact legislation enabling those offenders who had been sentenced to thirty years ’ imprisonment for one of the offences for which they subsequently had had their sentences joined to benefit from an overall sentence that would have been ten years lower than the highest individual sentence to which the offender had been sentenced. In support of its view, the District Court pointed out that the 1994 Criminal Code (see paragraph 21 below) had provided that in cases where an offender had been due to serve thirty years ’ imprisonment along with sentences for other offences, the overall sentence would have consisted only of that term. Therefore, the District Court considered that the legislature had made an obvious error in Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, which had, however, been rectified in the meantime by the 2011 Amendment. The court found that the latter made the rules on the determination of an overall sentence certain, clear and complete and that “[o]nly the so amended provisions therefore prevent [ed] arbitrary sanctioning of criminal offenders for multiple criminal offences as required by the principle of legality”."

It was only where that method proved unsatisfactory in determining how a certain rule should be applied that other methods of interpretation should be applied.

In the Higher Court ’ s opinion, the District Court had correctly assessed that the legislature had not intended to permit individuals convicted of several offences from benefiting from a lower maximum term of imprisonment than they would have had to serve if they had been convicted of only one of those offences. According to the Higher Court, such an interpretation would lead to a situation “defying the law as well as common sense”."

The Supreme Court referred to the Higher Court ’ s judgment, pointing out that the latter court ’ s reasoning evidently showed that the historical interpretation of the rule on combining multiple sentences also had to be taken into account in assessing the aim of the legislature in enacting the provision at issue. That method of interpretation entailed the examination of not only the provision in its original form, as relied on by the applicant, but also the subsequent amendment, which showed the true aim of the provision. In addition, the Supreme Court relied on the systematic interpretation of the rule in question, emphasising that it could not be interpreted entirely separately from the provisions prescribing that individual prison sentences for various criminal offences must be combined to form an overall sentence. Since under the un - amended 2008 Criminal Code a prison sentence could be imposed for a term not shorter than fifteen days and not longer than thirty years, it was not logical that an overall sentence combining several prison terms, one of which was for thirty years, could be ten years lower than the highest individual prison sentence imposed. According to the Supreme Court, the rules on multiple offences were aimed not at reducing the general maximum prison sentence, but at ensuring that the overall length of several sentences did not exceed the general maximum prison sentence, which in the applicant ’ s case was thirty years."

Moreover, since the applicant complained about the application of Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code to the his case rather than about the content of the legal provision itself, a review of its constitutionality does not seem to be a remedy relevant to his grievance and thus effective."

Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 109, 17 September 2009). In its judgment in the case of Gouarré Patte v.

He was sentenced to prison terms of four years, thirty years and five months respectively (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above). The second and the third judgment concerned offences committed before the applicant had started serving the term of imprisonment of four years imposed by the first judgment and the courts were therefore required under domestic law to determine one overall sentence for all three criminal offences (see paragraphs 13 and 22 above ). As they had not done so, the applicant, on 28 November 2011, applied to have an overall sentence determined under the provisions concerning the so - called irregular reopening of proceedings (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above). On the basis of his application the court, on 13 January 2012, delivered a new judgment which modified the previously imposed sentences by determining one overall sentence of thirty years (see paragraph 13 above)."

However, the law under which the overall sentence was later determined in the applicant ’ s case, that is to say the 2008 Criminal Code, provided a maximum limit for the overall sentence of twenty years ’ imprisonment, save for the situation where two or more sentences of thirty years had been imposed (see paragraph 22 above). There is no dispute between the parties that the applicant was entitled to the determination of the overall sentence under the 2008 Criminal Code, which had been in force when his last conviction had become final as well as when the judgment imposing the overall sentence had been given (see paragraphs 13, 22 and 25 above). The dispute in the present case rather relates to the question whether the 2008 Criminal Code could be interpreted as setting the maximum overall sentence for the applicant ’ s multiple offences at thirty years, instead of the explicitly provided limit of twenty years."

In particular, the application of the wording of Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code to the applicant ’ s situation led to contradictory results. While, according to the terms of this provision, the applicant should not have had an overall sentence of more than twenty years imposed on him, the overall sentence should exceed each individual sentence, which in the applicant ’ s case included a term of imprisonment of thirty years (see paragraph 22 above). The Court notes that this deficiency resulted from the legislature ’ s failure to regulate an overall sentence for a situation such as the applicant ’ s in the 2008 Criminal Code. It moreover notes that the resultant lacuna in the legislation pertained for three years (see paragraphs 22, 23 and 39 ) and that no special reasons have been adduced by the Government to justify it (see, by contrast, Ruban v.

It further understands that the domestic courts were in a difficult position when called to apply an overall sentence in the applicant ’ s case while lacking a clear legal basis to do so. The Court notes in this connection that while the courts were certainly the best placed to interpret and apply domestic law, they were at the same time bound by the principle, embodied in Article 7 of the Convention, that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( see Del Río Prada, cited above, § 105).

It is clear from the foregoing that the more favourable to the applicant would have been the first option, which, most importantly, would have complied with the maximum limit on the overall sentence explicitly provided in the legislation (see paragraph 22 above) and thus avoided filling the legislative lacuna by way of extensive judicial interpretation."

They did so despite the fact that such a penalty was heavier than the maximum sentence explicitly provided for in the applied legal provision and that, having regard to the actual wording of that provision, it was clearly to the detriment of the applicant. Accordingly and having regard to the above considerations (see paragraphs 56. and 57 above ), the Court concludes that the domestic courts failed to ensure the observance of the principle of legality enshrined in Article 7 of the Convention.

While it may well be true that the Attorney General gave weight to a number of criteria before taking his decision, it is also true that any such criteria were not specified in any legislative text or made the subject of judicial clarification over the years. The law did not provide for any guidance on what would amount to a more serious offence or a less serious one (based on enumerated factors and criteria). The Constitutional Court (see paragraph 14 above) noted that there existed no guidelines which would aid the Attorney General in taking such a decision. Thus, the law did not determine with any degree of precision the circumstances in which a particular punishment bracket applied. An insoluble problem was posed by fixing different minimum penalties. The Attorney General had in effect an unfettered discretion to decide which minimum penalty would be applicable with respect to the same offence. The decision was inevitably subjective and left room for arbitrariness, particularly given the lack of procedural safeguards. Neither could such a decision be seen only or mainly in terms of abuse of power, even if, as the Government suggested without however substantiating their view, this might be subject to constitutional control (see paragraph 29 above). The Court is not persuaded by the Government’s argument to the effect that it was possible that the minimum punishment before the Criminal Court would not be handed down. The Court considers that the domestic courts were bound by the Attorney General’s decision as to which court would have been competent to try the accused. The Court observes that Article 21 of the Criminal Code provides for the passing of sentences below the prescribed minimum on the basis of special and exceptional reasons. However, section 120A of the Medical and Kindred Professions Ordinance, which provides for the offence with which the applicant was charged, specifically states in its subsection (7) that Article 21 of the Criminal Code shall not be applicable in respect of any person convicted of the offence at issue. On an examination of the provision, the Court finds that it would not be possible to interpret the wording of that provision otherwise. Moreover, this interpretation has been confirmed by the domestic courts, the most recent decision being that of 2008 in the above-mentioned case of The Republic of Malta v. Stanley Chircop, in which the Criminal Court considered that the application of Article 21 to the relevant offences was excluded and therefore the court could not impose a sentence below the minimum established by law. Furthermore, the Government have not provided any examples of decisions showing that a domestic court had actually done so. Thus, a lesser sentence could not be imposed despite any concerns the judge might have had as to the use of the prosecutor’s discretion ( ibid .)."

The court further pointed out that unlike in the case of Huber v.

The fact that the Attorney General (in his role as public prosecutor) could choose the forum in which to try the accused did not give him the powers of a judge in that instance. In essence the public prosecutor had no control over the finding of guilt or innocence of an individual. The situation would have been different had the public prosecutor been involved in the determination of an individual’s guilt. In reference to domestic jurisprudence, it added that the means by which a case was brought before a court could not impair its independence. In so far as an individual was aware of the minimum and maximum punishments established by law at the time when the crime was committed, there could be no violation of Articles 6 or 7 of the Convention. Moreover, the applicant had not shown in what way this decision had affected him. Nevertheless, noting that the Attorney General (in his role as public prosecutor) exercised his own discretion in choosing the appropriate forum also according to the seriousness of the crime, the Constitutional Court considered that it would be desirable, for the sake of fairness and transparency, that criteria to be used by the public prosecutor should be established."

He considered that any assumption to the contrary would be in contrast with the wording of the law. Indeed in the case of The Republic of Malta v. Stanley Chircop (decided by the Criminal Court on 11 January 2008) the court had held that, as the law stood, it could only give effect to the recommendation of clemency made by the jury by imposing the minimum sentence established by law for the Criminal Court, but it could not impose a sentence below the minimum.

For example, the applicant made reference to a domestic case whereby two persons (M. and G.) had been charged with possession of the same quantity of drugs with intention to supply. Following the decision of the Attorney General, M. had been tried before the Court of Magistrates, where he had been sentenced to fifteen months’ imprisonment. G., however, had been tried before the Criminal Court, where he had eventually been given a twenty-year prison sentence which was reduced on appeal to nine years ( The Republic of Malta v Godfrey Ellul, decided by the Court of Criminal Appeal (Superior) on 17 March 2005).

If the decision was that the accused should be tried in the Criminal Court, the inquiry (before the Court of Criminal Inquiry) was carried out by the Executive Police, under the supervision of the Attorney General, to ensure that all the evidence was produced. If the Court of Criminal Inquiry decided that there was sufficient evidence, the Attorney General issued a bill of indictment. At that stage, taking account of the evidence, the Attorney General could also send the case back to be tried by the Court of Magistrates instead of the Criminal Court if this appeared to be more suitable. Thus, his decision could be subject to change on the basis of the inquiry. However, once the accused had been charged, the Attorney General could only issue counter-orders to the benefit of the accused, but not to his or her prejudice. Therefore, in order for an accused to be tried before the Criminal Court, the Court of Criminal Inquiry must have issued an Article 6-compliant decision to commit for trial, in respect of which the Attorney General had no say."

While acknowledging that the Attorney General had links with the executive, the Government argued that he was not a member of the tribunal and could not therefore participate in any finding of guilt or innocence and therefore there could be no breach of the independence or impartiality requirement. Indeed the Attorney General did not undertake the investigation of the crime, nor did he have the power to issue a detention order (with reference to Huber v. Switzerland, 23 October 1990, Series A no. 188), or have any other judicial function, but exclusively performed the function of prosecutor. They contended that the Attorney General enjoyed independence from the executive in his functions as a prosecutor as laid down in the Constitution (see “Relevant Domestic Law”). The Government compared the impugned decision to that which a prosecutor made in his or her administrative capacity in respect of the offences with which the accused was to be charged. They argued that this discretion was necessary given that the circumstances which enabled the identification of more serious drug-related crimes varied considerably and could not be exhaustively listed a priori. Therefore, the system allowed for the examination of cases on an individual basis rather than providing for pre-established categories. This discretion served a legitimate and proportionate aim given the difference between the cost to society of ordinary drug-related crimes and more serious large-scale drug dealing."

Grech, decided by the Constitutional Court on 27 September 1990) finding that such a discretion (although in relation to section 22 of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance – but still comparable to the one at issue) did not impair the fairness of the proceedings. They further pointed out that, according to unspecified case-law of the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction and the case of The Republic of Malta v. Mario Camilleri (decided on 23 January 2001 by the Criminal Court), the Criminal Court retained the power to impose sentences below the minimum established by law and to apply Article 21 of the Criminal Code (see “Relevant Domestic Law”) on constitutional grounds where it found that the Attorney General had abused his power when he referred the case to the Criminal Court. This was so, despite the exclusion of the application of this Article to cases of drug trafficking under the ordinary law, particularly in view of the proviso to that exception (see “Relevant Domestic Law”). In the Government’s submission, it was therefore a possibility that the minimum punishment before the Criminal Court would not be handed down. The Government further referred to the case of Claudio Porsenna v. the Attorney General (decided by the First Hall of the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction on 6 April 2011) whereby in relation to the discretion arising from section 22 of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, the court held that such discretion, when exercised in a reasonable manner, would not be exercised during the pendency of the criminal proceedings and therefore fell outside the scope of the relevant provisions dealing with a fair trial. Things would be different if any discretion were exercised during the proceedings, even during the proceedings before the Court of Criminal Inquiry, in which case the exercise of that discretion would have to be scrutinised and examined from the point of view of both the Constitution and the Convention."

In the present case, the decision to try the applicant before the Criminal Court had been based on the large quantity of drugs seized as well as the fact that these had been discovered concealed in a quarry, and the lack of co-operation by the applicant with the police which pointed to a serious crime involving drug dealing on a large scale."

They contended that the Attorney General’s power under section 120A was adequately circumscribed and that an accused would be aware not only of the two ranges of punishment applicable but also to which particular range of punishment he would be subjected in view of the seriousness of the crime committed, without needing to take legal advice.

This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, §§ 93-94, 17 September 2009)."

                "35. When speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statute law as well as case-law and implies qualitative requirements, including those of accessibility and foreseeability (see Cantoni v. France, 15 November 1996, § 29, Reports 1996 ‑ V, Coëme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 145, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII, § 145, and E.K. v. Turkey, no. 28496/95, § 51, 7 February 2002). These qualitative requirements must be satisfied as regards both the definition of an offence and the penalty the offence in question carries (see Kafkaris, cited above, § 140). An individual must know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable and what penalty will be imposed for the act and/or omission committed (see, among other authorities, Cantoni, cited above, § 29)."

                "36. In consequence of the principle that laws must be of general application, the wording of statutes is not always precise. One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. That means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent are vague, and their interpretation and application depend on practice. Consequently, in any system of law, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, including a criminal law provision, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances (see Scoppola (no. 2), cited above § 100)."

Moreover, it is a firmly established part of the legal tradition of the States party to the Convention that case-law, as one of the sources of the law, necessarily contributes to the gradual development of the criminal law (see Kruslin v. France, 24 April 1990, § 29, Series A no. 176 ‑ A). Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 50, ECHR 2001 ‑ II)."

The Court further notes that there is no doubt that section 120A (2) of the Medical and Kindred Professions Ordinance provided for the punishment applicable in respect of the offence with which the applicant was charged. In fact, it provided for two different possible punishments, namely a punishment of four years to life imprisonment in the event that the applicant was tried before the Criminal Court, or six months to ten years if he was tried before the Court of Magistrates. While it is clear that the punishment imposed was established by law and did not exceed the limits fixed by section 120A (2) of the above-mentioned Ordinance, it remains to be determined whether the Ordinance’s qualitative requirements, particularly that of foreseeability, were satisfied, regard being had to the manner of choice of jurisdiction, as this reflected on the penalty that the offence in question carried."

It observes that although these cases were not totally analogous (in that G., unlike M., was a recidivist), they were based on the same facts, offences in relation to which guilt was found, and a similar quantity of drugs. However, G. was tried before the Criminal Court and eventually sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment whereas M. was tried before the Court of Magistrates and sentenced to fifteen months’ imprisonment. More generally, the domestic case-law presented to this Court seems to indicate that such decisions were at times unpredictable. It would therefore appear that the applicant would not have been able to know the punishment applicable to him even if he had obtained legal advice on the matter, as the decision was solely dependent on the prosecutor’s discretion to determine the trial court."

While it may well be true that the Attorney General gave weight to a number of criteria before taking his decision, it is also true that any such criteria were not specified in any legislative text or made the subject of judicial clarification over the years. The law did not provide for any guidance on what would amount to a more serious offence or a less serious one (based on enumerated factors and criteria). The Constitutional Court (see paragraph 14 above) noted that there existed no guidelines which would aid the Attorney General in taking such a decision. Thus, the law did not determine with any degree of precision the circumstances in which a particular punishment bracket applied. An insoluble problem was posed by fixing different minimum penalties. The Attorney General had in effect an unfettered discretion to decide which minimum penalty would be applicable with respect to the same offence. The decision was inevitably subjective and left room for arbitrariness, particularly given the lack of procedural safeguards. Neither could such a decision be seen only or mainly in terms of abuse of power, even if, as the Government suggested without however substantiating their view, this might be subject to constitutional control (see paragraph 29 above). The Court is not persuaded by the Government’s argument to the effect that it was possible that the minimum punishment before the Criminal Court would not be handed down. The Court considers that the domestic courts were bound by the Attorney General’s decision as to which court would have been competent to try the accused. The Court observes that Article 21 of the Criminal Code provides for the passing of sentences below the prescribed minimum on the basis of special and exceptional reasons. However, section 120A of the Medical and Kindred Professions Ordinance, which provides for the offence with which the applicant was charged, specifically states in its subsection (7) that Article 21 of the Criminal Code shall not be applicable in respect of any person convicted of the offence at issue. On an examination of the provision, the Court finds that it would not be possible to interpret the wording of that provision otherwise. Moreover, this interpretation has been confirmed by the domestic courts, the most recent decision being that of 2008 in the above-mentioned case of The Republic of Malta v. Stanley Chircop, in which the Criminal Court considered that the application of Article 21 to the relevant offences was excluded and therefore the court could not impose a sentence below the minimum established by law. Furthermore, the Government have not provided any examples of decisions showing that a domestic court had actually done so. Thus, a lesser sentence could not be imposed despite any concerns the judge might have had as to the use of the prosecutor’s discretion ( ibid .)."

There is no dispute between the parties as to the correct test for common law contempt of court. The test required, in particular, that two elements be present: first, there had to be an act which created a “real risk” of prejudice to the administration of justice; and second, there had to be an intention to create that risk (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above). It is true that, in its summary of the test, the Divisional Court omitted the word “real” from its description of the risk (see paragraph 32 above). However, it subsequently held that the applicant had caused “actual prejudice” to the due administration of justice, and not merely a risk of such prejudice (see paragraph 37 above). It is not, therefore, arguable that the Divisional Court in her case applied a lower threshold than the test required. Further, the summary of the test in the subsequent case of Davey and Beard shows that the court in the applicant ’ s case did not alter the nature of the risk which had to be demonstrated (see paragraph 54 above)."

The Court considers that it must be quite evident to any juror that deliberately introducing extraneous evidence into the jury room contrary to an order of the trial judge amounts to intending to commit an act that at the very least carries a real risk of being prejudicial to the administration of justice. In deciding that specific intent could be derived from the foreseeability of the consequences of certain actions, the Divisional Court was not replacing the specific intent test with a test of “breach of an order” or with a more basic intent test. Rather, it was finding the specific intent test to be met in the circumstances of the applicant’s case. This approach to proof of specific intent had clear precedent (see paragraph 47 above). While it was open to the applicant’s counsel to argue, as it appears that he to some extent did, that it was not appropriate to proceed in this way in her case (see paragraph 30 above), it cannot reasonably be suggested that the approach of the Divisional Court was not foreseeable, having regard to existing case-law on this question.

The jury members were clearly told, twice, that they were not to “go on the internet”. They were told not to “try and do any research of [their] own” and that, once they left the courtroom, they were not to deal with the case in any way (see paragraph 11 above). While the judge’s direction was in broad terms, it is not argued that the applicant understood the direction as prohibiting any use of the Internet whatsoever. Had she done so, she could have sought clarification from the trial judge. The judge further alluded to the Fraill case (see paragraphs 50-52 above) and warned the jurors of the severe problems which arose for a juror who went on the Internet (see paragraph 11 above). The fact that no explicit penal warning was included in the direction does not affect the clarity of the instruction given by the judge. Such a warning is not required under domestic law and had the applicant wished to know further details of the sanctions applicable to a breach of the direction, she could again have sought clarification from the judge. The consequences of contempt of court by Internet research were also made clear in the notices in the jury waiting room (see paragraph 9 above).

The court emphasised that the jury ’ s deliberations, and ultimately their verdict, had to be exclusively based on the evidence given in court, a principle which applied as much to communication with the Internet as it did to discussions by members of the jury with individuals not on the jury. Information provided by the Internet was not evidence and its use by a juror exposed her to the risk of being influenced.

In its report no. 340 on Contempt of Court (1) Juror Misconduct and Internet Publications, published on 9 December 2013, the Law Commission identified problems with the law and procedure for dealing with jurors who sought extraneous information about the case that they were trying. It noted that the relevant conduct was treated as contempt because it was a breach of the order made by the judge at the start of the trial instructing jurors not to undertake research into the case, but that there was no specific form of words that judges had to use. As a consequence, the scope of the criminal contempt depended on the exact wording that each judge adopted in warning the jurors at the start of the trial. Further, while the prohibition on searching for extraneous material was explained to jurors as forbidden because it was “a contempt of court”, the Law Commission doubted whether, from the point of view of a layperson, it was obvious what “a contempt ” was or what the implications of this were. It considered that the message would be clearer for jurors if they were told that such conduct was a crime. Finally, the Law Commission pointed to doubt whether extraneous research by jurors was a contempt by its own nature or only because it was a breach of the directions given by the judge. This, the Law Commission said, was a further source of confusion. It continued:",

It allows the legislature to set down with clarity the elements of the offence, and to debate publicly the mischief which the offence seeks to address. The Parliamentary process and the fact that the offence has been enshrined in statute adds to the legitimacy of any offence created and the sanction which committing the offence attracts. ”"

She emphasised that her case from the first had been that the “specific intent” test was the law, and she had not agreed to any revised test. In her submission, the whole exchange between her counsel and the court had to be taken into account: on a proper reading of this exchange there was not agreement to a different test (see paragraphs 30 - 34 and 39 - 40 above). In any case it was wrong to suggest that counsel had the authority to agree a course which compromised a person ’ s human rights."

In particular, the nature of the contempt had to be defined with precision. Oral directions to the jury formulated on a case-by-case basis lacked consistency. Since Internet use varied widely, there was a need for a clear definition of what was permitted. In her case, there were several possible interpretations of the direction or order. The words “go on the internet”, used in the judge ’ s direction (see paragraph 11 above), were not adequately defined. She further argued that a penal warning was necessary because it was not clear which directions, if breached, could attract a criminal penalty and which would not. The reference to the “severe problems” of a juror who had done so was equally insufficient to meet the requirements of an order with a penal notice. An oral direction to persons unfamiliar with court procedure required simplicity and considerable clarity to be properly understood."

For the Divisional Court to move to a “breach - of - an - order” test in these circumstances was not foreseeable, even with legal advice, since it was unprecedented, it removed constituent elements of the offence which essentially changed its legal character, the test had not been applied since her case and it had led to an extensive construction of the law to her detriment. In developing the law by application and interpretation in a common law system, the court ’ s law-making function had not remained within reasonable limits."

                "66. In finding the applicant guilty of contempt of court at common law, the Divisional Court had applied well-established law. The applicant, in complaining that it had formulated a new test of liability, had mischaracterised and misunderstood the domestic judgment and domestic law. In particular, the court had applied the well-established mental element required, namely an intent to impede or prejudice the due administration of justice. It had merely reformulated the law to the specific facts of the applicant ’ s case. The nature of the order in her case was a prohibition on doing an act which was inherently and inevitably prejudicial to the fairness of the proceedings, prejudicial to the administration of justice and contrary to the jury oath or affirmation. In these circumstances, the question whether the applicant had intended to prejudice the administration of justice was indistinguishable from the question whether she had deliberately disobeyed the order of the court. Her counsel had agreed that there was no distinction between these two questions (see paragraphs 32 - 34 above). The approach of the court was uncontroversial : it was the approach that the Divisional Court had previously taken in Fraill (see paragraphs 50 - 52 above ); it was supported by the Supreme Court in the applicant ’ s case when refusing permission to appeal (see paragraph 42 above); and it was clear from the subsequent case of Davey and Beard (see paragraphs 53 - 54 above) that, in the applicant ’ s case, the court had done nothing more than find that the requisite intent had been proved by reference to the particular issues in her case. Even if it were possible to formulate an academic argument that there was a distinction between proof of deliberate disobedience of the judicial order and proof of an intent to impede or prejudice the due administration of justice, the application of the former test would not violate Article 7. Liability based on disobedience of such an order was obviously foreseeable, having regard to the fact that it had a foundation in domestic case-law, including in the Fraill judgment (see paragraph 50 - 52 above)."

            [
                "67. The Government further disputed the suggestion that there was a lack of clarity in the judge ’ s direction. The clarity of the direction was a matter of fact and had been determined by the Divisional Court, which had found that the jury had been directed in “unequivocal terms” not to seek information about the case from the Internet. It had also held that the judge ’ s direction was an order and that the applicant ’ s disobedience of it was deliberate. The prohibition imposed by the judge was consistent with the information given by the jury officer, the written notices in the jury room and the applicant ’ s oath or affirmation. The Divisional Court did not believe the applicant ’ s claim that there was a lack in clarity in her mind as to the order and concluded that she had understood its scope “perfectly well” (see paragraph 37 above). The fact that the order was not in writing and did not contain a penal warning was irrelevant."

                "68. Finally, it was also irrelevant for the purposes of domestic law and for the purposes of any analysis under Article 7 whether the prohibition imposed by the judge was characterised as a direction, an order or both. First, as matter of domestic law, there was no doubt that Internet research by a juror in disobedience of a direction given by a judge constituted contempt of court. Second, as a matter of domestic law, the meaning of “direction” and “order” depended on the context and both could mean the same. Third, the Divisional Court had held that in the context of the applicant ’ s case the judge ’ s direction was an order and that the applicant appreciated that it was an order (see paragraph 37 above)."

Among its guarantees, it lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment. It follows that offences must be clearly defined by law. When speaking of “law”, Article 7 implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision, if need be with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and after taking appropriate legal advice, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see Del Río Prada v. Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, §§ 77-80 and 91, ECHR 2013; S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, §§ 34-35, Series A no. 335 ‑ B; and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, §§ 32-33, Series A no. 335-C )."

There is no dispute between the parties as to the correct test for common law contempt of court. The test required, in particular, that two elements be present: first, there had to be an act which created a “real risk” of prejudice to the administration of justice; and second, there had to be an intention to create that risk (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above). It is true that, in its summary of the test, the Divisional Court omitted the word “real” from its description of the risk (see paragraph 32 above). However, it subsequently held that the applicant had caused “actual prejudice” to the due administration of justice, and not merely a risk of such prejudice (see paragraph 37 above). It is not, therefore, arguable that the Divisional Court in her case applied a lower threshold than the test required. Further, the summary of the test in the subsequent case of Davey and Beard shows that the court in the applicant ’ s case did not alter the nature of the risk which had to be demonstrated (see paragraph 54 above)."

The Court considers that it must be quite evident to any juror that deliberately introducing extraneous evidence into the jury room contrary to an order of the trial judge amounts to intending to commit an act that at the very least carries a real risk of being prejudicial to the administration of justice. In deciding that specific intent could be derived from the foreseeability of the consequences of certain actions, the Divisional Court was not replacing the specific intent test with a test of “breach of an order” or with a more basic intent test. Rather, it was finding the specific intent test to be met in the circumstances of the applicant’s case. This approach to proof of specific intent had clear precedent (see paragraph 47 above). While it was open to the applicant’s counsel to argue, as it appears that he to some extent did, that it was not appropriate to proceed in this way in her case (see paragraph 30 above), it cannot reasonably be suggested that the approach of the Divisional Court was not foreseeable, having regard to existing case-law on this question. Thus, by stating that intent could be demonstrated by the foreseeability of consequences, the court did not overstep the limits of what can be regarded as an acceptable clarification of the law."

The Court cannot accept that the direction given by the judge, especially when taken in the context of the other information provided to the applicant by the jury officer, the notices posted around the court building and her oath or affirmation at the start of the trial (see paragraphs 8-10 above), was ambiguous. The jury members were clearly told, twice, that they were not to “go on the internet”. They were told not to “try and do any research of [their] own” and that, once they left the courtroom, they were not to deal with the case in any way (see paragraph 11 above). While the judge’s direction was in broad terms, it is not argued that the applicant understood the direction as prohibiting any use of the Internet whatsoever. Had she done so, she could have sought clarification from the trial judge. The judge further alluded to the Fraill case (see paragraphs 50-52 above) and warned the jurors of the severe problems which arose for a juror who went on the Internet (see paragraph 11 above). The fact that no explicit penal warning was included in the direction does not affect the clarity of the instruction given by the judge. Such a warning is not required under domestic law and had the applicant wished to know further details of the sanctions applicable to a breach of the direction, she could again have sought clarification from the judge. The consequences of contempt of court by Internet research were also made clear in the notices in the jury waiting room (see paragraph 9 above). The applicant went on the Internet to conduct research into the previous conviction of the defendant in the case in which she was sitting as a juror. On any interpretation of the judge’s direction, such action was clearly prohibited."

Relying on the same facts as established in the lower courts ’ decisions, the Supreme Court held that the applicant ’ s actions and the company ’ s activities had been improper and unlawful. The Supreme Court ’ s judgment, in so far as relevant, read as follows:",
                "“On the basis of the wealth of material, documents and experts ’ reports which have been adduced before the trial and appeal courts, it is clear that the accused collected considerable amounts of money and foreign currency from members of the public by means of false promises to repay the amounts and pay high interest rates, knowing that he was incapable of keeping his promises. In contrast to the accused ’ s claims, the [lower] courts established that the taking of money from members of the public, in the form of so-called loans, was carried out for the sole purpose of acquiring property for the accused himself and other persons. The accused was not capable of securing the amounts in question relying solely on the money taken from members of the public and he knew that he could not obtain profits in a lawful manner in order to repay the loans.",
                "The undertaking to pay back the money collected from members of the public was not based on the company ’ s realisable profits, but on the prospect of attracting money in the same way from other members of the public. The [lower] courts established that no lawful and normal commercial company could secure the interest rates needed to cover the high rate of interest that the accused offered to persons from whom he had collected extraordinarily large sums of money.",
                "In augmenting untruthfully the value of investments he had made using the money taken from members of the public, the accused ’ s purpose was to attract a large number of persons in response to the competition from the so-called foundations and other pyramid schemes which were operating at the time, and to instil in the public the false idea that he possessed property and other assets which would underwrite the obligations he had entered into. The increase in interest rates for creditors and the shortening of deadlines for the repayment of loans fell into this same category.",
                "Regard being had to the whole body of evidence which was analysed in detail by the District Court and by the Court of Appeal, it emerges that, using money taken from members of the public, the accused created a pyramid scheme the base of which consisted of loans collected from members of the public who had been deceived, while its apex consisted of repayments which, as established by the courts, were not sufficient to fulfil the accused ’ s [contractual] obligations.",
                "It appears from the investigation and the case file that the criminal intent to commit theft by way of deception had its genesis in 1994, through the process of loan-taking. With the passage of time this intent evolved as the applicant expanded his activities, which took on staggering proportions as the scheme was rolled out across the country until 23 January 1997, the date that marked the end of his pyramid scheme.",
                "At its inception, the document used by the company for the taking of loans consisted of a simple letter or an order ( mandat ). The interest rates were between 5% and 6% per month. This corresponded to the period between the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995.",
                "With the passage of time the documents were modified and took on more stereotypical form, containing the first name and surname of the lender, referred to as the creditor, and the name of the borrower, i.e. the accused. These documents, which were the same as those used in other pyramid schemes – the so-called foundations – were unilaterally and systematically used to lie to, deceive and abuse the trust of thousands and thousands of poor people who dreamed of earning money from the accused.",
                "In 1996 the accused concocted a refinement to the scheme, based on deception and lies, when he issued the so-called savings books ( librezë kursimi ), which were never put into use.",
                "In order to increase the trust of creditors and also make it easier to steal from and deceive them, the accused raised the interest rates to 8%, while applying higher interest rates to his closest circle [of acquaintances], who spread the word about the miracles performed by his company.",
                "It is obvious that Vefa, even though it expanded across the country and was made up of many subsidiaries, existed as a single financial and economic unit. Even the company ’ s balance sheets were submitted as a single balance sheet covering the whole company. More specifically, according to the 1993 balance sheet, the company had a net profit amounting to ALL 63,000 and a workforce of six people. According to the 1994 balance sheet, the company ’ s net profit was ALL 305,928, which was equal to 0.04% of the outstanding debt owed to its creditors.",
                "In 1995 there was an increase in the number of loans [made by members of the public]. Consequently, Vefa ’ s balance sheet reflected increased values. The company ’ s net profit for that year reached ALL 73,150,201, the equivalent of 0.02% of the outstanding debt owed to its creditors.",
                "By 1996 the process of loan-taking had assumed unprecedented proportions and, consequently, the company ’ s net profit totalled USD 2,125,882, the equivalent of 0.004% of the outstanding debt owed to its creditors."

                "60. The Supreme Court upheld the findings of the Court of Appeal regarding the total number of creditors, namely 57,923. However, it concluded that the total amount of the applicant ’ s liabilities was ALL 22,374,141,130 (approximately USD 157,453,000 at the material time) after having deducted the company ’ s cash flows, which totalled ALL 6,875,481,331. The Supreme Court ’ s judgment, in so far as relevant, read as follows:",
                "“ ... Any eventual change in the number of creditors does not affect the accused ’ s guilt or his sentence in respect of the offence he has committed. A final court decision in the criminal case is binding on the court examining civil liabilities only in so far as the commission of the criminal offence is concerned and if the offence was committed by the accused. It does not have any consequences for the resolution of civil proceedings that may be instituted in the future.",
                "During the investigation stage, as well as in the trial and appeal proceedings, the accused claimed that, since his actions vis-à-vis his creditors constituted civil relations in the form of fulfilment of a contractual obligation resulting from the loans taken, they could not give rise to criminal liability. This argument was dismissed by the domestic courts as unfounded. The accused also complained that no criminal offence had been committed, on the grounds that the property in his possession was far greater than the value of his liabilities vis-à-vis creditors.",
                "The [lower] courts, having assessed the evidence in their possession, concluded that this claim was unfounded. The perception of the accused among members of the public as the owner of huge assets was one of the forms of deception he employed to attract large amounts of money from citizens. The court notes that the [lower] courts drew this conclusion on the basis of voluminous documents, explanations provided by experts and the experts ’ reports that were compiled. ... As regards the valuation of objects, their value does not reflect the reality, as the valuation was unilateral and was fictitiously increased compared to the purchase price and the real market value. The District Court reached the same finding via more detailed reasoning.",
                "In these circumstances, the [lower] courts accepted that the accused had committed the criminal offence of theft by way of lies and abuse of trust.”"

                "61. The Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeal had incorrectly applied Article 143 § 2 of the CC. In passing sentence on the applicant, the Supreme Court reasoned that he should be held criminally liable on as many counts as the overall number of creditors, namely 57,923, in accordance with Article 143 § 1 of the CC, which prescribed a term of imprisonment of five years. Referring to Article 55 of the CC, it decided that the cumulative sentence should not exceed the maximum penalty of twenty years ’ imprisonment. Consequently, it sentenced the applicant to twenty years ’ imprisonment. The Supreme Court rejected the applicant ’ s argument that, by re - characterising the criminal offence, the Court of Appeal had not given him adequate time to prepare his defence."

            [
                "62. In this connection, the relevant parts of the judgment read as follows:",
                "“The Tirana District Court convicted the accused of deception and applied Article 143 only once. The Court of Appeal, while finding that the accused ’ s conviction on only one count under Article 143 was unfounded, incorrectly characterised the criminal offence, finding the accused guilty and sentencing him under Article 143 § 2 of the CC. In its decision, the Court of Appeal, relying on Article 3 § 3 of the CC, reasoned that the offence should be classified under Article 143 § 2 of the CC, on the grounds that, as a newly introduced criminal-law provision, the latter was more favourable than the previous provisions.",
                "The argument employed by the District Court that the criminal offence constitutes a continuous crime ... is not borne out by the deception that has been carried out. In order for a crime to be continuous, the following elements must be present: each offence must not stand on its own, the acts or the failure to act must have constituted the same criminal offence, and the criminal intent which joins separate acts in a single integral offence must exist.",
                "In the present case the [lower] courts have accepted that the accused committed different acts over different periods of time. The criminal activity took place over a long time and, as argued above, was not the consequence of the same criminal intent. The latter was subject to continuous modification owing to competition from other unlawful loan-taking companies. This took the form of changing interest rates, varying deception techniques to adapt to different people and different circumstances, developing diverse strategies to make the deception credible, either through propaganda in the broadcast media or through efforts to make the criminal activity appear as normal banking activity.",
                "The court adopts the same position with the unifying decision (no. 284) of 15 September 2000 of the Supreme Court Joint Benches to the effect that persons who have committed the offence of deception shall be criminally liable under Article 143 of the CC on as many counts as the number of people deceived.",
                "The Supreme Court considers that the Court of Appeal ’ s reasoning that Article 143 § 2 should be applied as it is more favourable does not have any legal basis. Article 82 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that “the most serious criminal offence shall be considered to be that which attracts the most severe maximum penalty or, where the most severe maximum penalties are equal, the most severe minimum penalty.” On that basis, taking the most severe maximum penalty as the criterion for the most serious offence, it is clear that Article 143 of the Criminal Code, which was in force when the criminal offence was committed and which provides for a penalty of five years ’ imprisonment, is more favourable than the second paragraph, which was added to the provision and provides for a maximum penalty of twenty years ’ imprisonment. The fact that the cumulative sentence imposed may be higher than the penalty provided for in Article 143 § 2 of the Criminal Code cannot provide a basis for finding that Article 143 is less favourable.",
                "For these reasons the Court of Appeal, having aggravated the accused ’ s position, should not have classified the offence under Article 143 § 2 of the CC. The accused ... should be found guilty and sentenced on the basis of Article 143 for the criminal offence of deception on 57,923 counts, equal to the number of injured persons.",
                "The Supreme Court considers the defendant ’ s complaint that his right to defence was breached by the change of characterisation of the criminal offence by the Court of Appeal, contrary to Articles 372, 376/1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article 31 (a) of the Constitution, ill-founded. The court, by giving the facts a different determination, may re-characterise the offence, which may be less serious or more so. In the latter case, this does not mean that the accused ’ s position has been aggravated. In accordance with Article 375 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court may give the facts a different determination from that given by the prosecutor, since the court is independent and makes its own assessment of the facts.",
                "In this context, Article 375 does not oblige the court to give the accused time in the defence of his interest, whereas pursuant to Article 372, 373 and 374 the accused is granted additional time to secure his defence against new charges lodged by the prosecutor. The latter provisions make reference to the prosecutor who, prior to the completion of the judicial examination has the right to modify the charges, to lodge a different charge or to charge the accused with a new offence. On these occasions, because the defence rights should be secured, the law provides that the court makes time available to the accused to secure his defence against the new charges. In the case of the application of Article 375 of the CCP, when the court proceeds with a different requalification of the offence, the same binding procedure does not apply as in the case of the filing of new charges by the prosecutor. The court, after an examination of facts, may give the facts a new and different legal determination. The criminal procedural law does not envisage adjournment of hearings or granting of [additional] time to the defence when the re-characterisation of the criminal offence is made by the court by virtue of its final decision. Contrary to the defendant ’ s complaint, it cannot be said that there has been a breach of the accused ’ s right to defence.",
                "The spirit of the law (Article 375 of the CCP) has been so that, owing to its amendment by virtue of law no ..., the lawmaker intended to clarify its content. According to the amendment, it is stated that “by way of the final decision the court may give the fact a different determination from that given by the prosecutor or the injured party, which may be more favourable or more serious, provided that it is competent ratione personae to examine the offence.”",
                "The defendant ’ s complaint that the courts did not question all Vefa ’ s creditors is ill-founded. The prosecutor and the courts questioned as many creditors as was deemed necessary. Questioning of creditors does not constitute a legal necessity, since deception is not a criminal offence which can be prosecuted solely on the strength of a complaint. Furthermore, such questioning was not necessary in order to clarify or substantiate the charge against the accused.",
                "The defendant ’ s complaint that the replacement of the appeal prosecutor by the Prosecutor General, at the stage of the appeal proceedings before the Court of Appeal, was in breach of Article 27/1 of the CCP, is ill-founded. It results that the replacement of the appeal prosecutor by the Prosecutor General was in accordance with Article 27 of the CCP, because according to the Prosecutor General the appeal prosecutor had expressed his prior opinion about the case.",
                "Having regard to the foregoing, the Court concludes that the accused should be declared guilty on 57,923 counts of the criminal offence of deception in accordance with Article 143 of the Criminal Code. In passing the sentence, the court takes account of the danger which the accused presents to society, the large number of injured parties and the considerable amount of damage caused and, it considers that the applicant should be sentenced to twenty years ’ imprisonment.”",

                "“Article 55 lays down special provisions for the determination of sentence where a person, by way of his actions or omissions, has committed two or more criminal offences, at the same or different times, prior to the adoption of a court decision in relation to any of the [said] offences.",
                "The rule laid down for the determination of sentences is that the court determines a [separate] sentence for each offence committed by the defendant and, in the end, imposes a cumulative sentence, within the limits provided for by the criminal-law provisions, having regard to the risk posed to society by the perpetrator and any extenuating or aggravating circumstances. The conditions for imposing a cumulative sentence are as follows.",
                "(a) Two or more offences designated by different provisions of the [Criminal] Code must have been committed. None of the offences may be time-barred or have been the subject of an amnesty or of proceedings which were discontinued. For example, a cumulative sentence shall be imposed where the defendant committed intentional homicide by way of the illegal possession of firearms. In determining sentence, the court shall fix the sentence for the offence of intentional homicide and then the sentence for the offence of illegal possession of firearms. The court then imposes a single sentence, not on the basis of arithmetic addition but by imposing the most severe cumulative sentence. More specifically, the court imposes fifteen years ’ imprisonment for the offence of intentional homicide and five years ’ imprisonment for the offence of illegal possession of firearms. By applying a cumulative sentence, the court imposes a penalty of eighteen years ’ imprisonment, which corresponds to the most severe cumulative sentence. This means that three years were added to the most severe sentence of fifteen years ’ imprisonment, resulting in the most severe cumulative sentence of eighteen years ’ imprisonment.",
                "A cumulative sentence cannot be imposed where the same actions, committed repeatedly, form part of a single offence under the [Criminal] Code. For example, serious injury caused to several people, irrespective of the fact that it was inflicted recurrently and by way of the same actions against two, three or more people, forms part of a single offence specifically provided for under Article ... and cannot be subject to a cumulative penalty.",
                "(b) The other condition for the imposition of a cumulative sentence is that no court decision should have been taken in respect of any of the offences. Trial and sentencing must take place at the same time in relation to all the offences. ...",
                "The second paragraph of Article 55 provides that the most severe cumulative sentence should not exceed either the total sum of the sentences determined separately or the maximum sentence within the type of penalty imposed.",

It finally imposed on him a cumulative sentence of seven years. In this case, the most severe cumulative sentence was correctly applied, in that the sentence did not exceed the total sum of the separate sentences imposed (eight years), or the maximum sentence within the type of penalty imposed, i.e. imprisonment.",
                "In another case, the Supreme Court stated as follows: “V. has committed an offence of sexual intercourse with minors and one of intentional and serious injury to the victim. For the first offence, he shall be sentenced to fifteen years ’ imprisonment and for the second to ten years ’ imprisonment. He shall be cumulatively sentenced to twenty-two years ’ imprisonment.” In this case also the law was correctly applied, as the court imposed the most severe cumulative offence without exceeding the maximum term of imprisonment, which is twenty-five years.",

In that case the new law had extended the limitation period and thus prolonged the period of time during which prosecutions could be brought in respect of the offences imputed to the applicants. The Court admitted that the application of the new law “detrimentally affected the applicants’ situation, in particular by frustrating their expectations”, but that it did not “entail an infringement of the rights guaranteed by Article 7, since that provision cannot be interpreted as prohibiting an extension of limitation periods through the immediate application of a procedural law where the relevant offences have never become subject to limitation”."

The Court will now turn to the applicants’ conviction under Article 198 and 199 for the use of various tax-minimisation techniques in respect of both company taxes and personal income taxes. The Court observes that “tax evasion” is defined in Articles 198 and 199 of the Criminal Code in very general terms (see paragraph 429 above). The Code describes tax evasion as “knowing” inclusion of “false data” in the fiscal declarations. By itself such a broad definition does not raise any issue under Article 7 of the Convention. Forms of economic activity are in constant development, and so are the methods of tax evasion. In order to define whether a particular behaviour amounts to “tax evasion” in the criminal-law sense the domestic courts may invoke legal concepts from other areas of law, in particular the tax law. The law in this area may be sufficiently flexible to adapt to new situations, without, however, becoming unpredictable."

                "792. The applicants argued that the declarations of the trading companies did not include any “false” information. The applicants had every reason to believe that those declarations faithfully reflected all the transactions of the trading companies and were thus accurate for the purposes of the ZATO Act. Similarly, the applicants duly reported on the amounts they had been receiving from the Isle of Man companies, in accordance with the Small Business Act. Both acts were formulated very precisely and did not use such concepts as “business purpose”, “sham” or “bad faith”. The Government argued that the then existing case-law developed the concept of “tax evasion” in sufficient detail to make the applicants’ conviction foreseeable."

                "793. The Court has examined the cases produced by the Government in support of their position. It observes that the Supreme Court’s Ruling no. 8 of 4 July 1997, referred to by the Government (see paragraph 753 above), explained some of the concepts related to the concept of “tax evasion” and of the constituent elements thereof. However, it did not describe such phenomena as “transfer pricing”, “sham” companies or transactions, which were at the heart of the applicants’ criminal case. The use of “frontman” companies as a method of tax evasion was first mentioned explicitly in the Supreme Court’s Ruling no. 64 of 28 December 2006 (see paragraph 434 above). That Ruling cannot support the Government’s case, because the acts imputed to the applicants related to 1998-2000."

                "794. Other case-law referred to by the Government is, for the most part, irrelevant, since it concerned other forms of tax evasion, such as, for example, the straightforward failure to declare revenues. There were few cases which concerned the use of “front” or “sham” companies, but they were decided in 2002 or even later (see, in particular, the cases of Mironov and Selivanov summarised in paragraph 754 above). The Court is not aware of any other case-law on the matter contemporary to the relevant period of time. Writings of legal scholars referred to by the Government were scarce and inconclusive. The Court concludes that in the criminal law sphere there was no case-law directly applicable to the transfer pricing arrangements and allegedly sham transactions as those in the heart of the applicants’ case."

                "795. The Government’s next argument was that the illegal character of such arrangements might have been established with reference to general principles derived from other areas of law, in particular the tax and civil law. This argument is not devoid of merit. The Court observes that the position of the authorities in the tax proceedings against Yukos was centred on the concept of “sham transaction”. The prosecution in the applicants’ case alleged that the applicants were submitting “false” information to the authorities. For many purposes “sham” is a synonym of “false”, so the logic of the State authorities in the two cases was broadly similar. A person cannot enter into a “sham” transaction by inadvertence; it is always a deliberate act. In other words, submitting tax declarations based on sham operations can be construed as “knowingly” submitting “false information” to the tax authorities, a situation falling within the ambit of Articles 198 and 199 of the Criminal Code."

            [
                "796. The concept of “sham transaction” was known in Russian law (see paragraphs 417 et seq. above). The courts had always the power to apply the “substance-over-form” rule and invalidate a transaction as “sham” under Articles 167 and 170 of the Civil Code (see the case-law in paragraphs 422 et seq.). A similar (albeit not identical) legal construction existed in the Tax Code: for example, in certain situations the Code allowed tax authorities to disregard a contract and calculate taxes due by the parties to it on the basis of imputed “market prices” (see paragraph 414 above). Thus, the “substance-over-form” approach also existed in the field of the tax law. The Court emphasises that such an approach exists in many European countries and that the Court does not see anything unreasonable or unusual in it."

Some of the case-law referred to by the parties speak in favour of the Government’s position. In particular, in the cases of Mechel or Grin Haus (paragraphs 422 and 425 above) the courts re-characterised the transactions of taxpayers as “sham” at the request of the Tax Service."

                "798. The judgments in cases concerning transfer pricing in the low-tax zones were more supportive of the applicants’ position. An illustration is the case of the Tax Service v. OOO Pribrezhnoe (see paragraph 439 above), analysed in §§ 593-594 of the Yukos judgment. In that case a commercial court refused to recalculate taxes due by a company registered in the low-tax zone despite several factual elements indicative of the “sham” character of the operations of that company. Factual elements relied on by the Tax Service in the Pribrezhnoye case were very close to those relied on by the prosecution in the criminal case against the applicants. The domestic court accepted the documents submitted by the defendant (contracts, lists of personnel, payrolls, bills, etc.) at face value and rejected the prosecution’s arguments about the fictitious character of the impugned operations as unconvincing."

Energosintez (see paragraph 437 above), where the commercial court held in favour of the defendant company registered in a ZATO, despite the fact that industrial facilities for processing and transporting oil (which was the main business of that company) did not belong to the company and were located outside the territory of the ZATO. The court found those arguments irrelevant."

The Court notes that the cases of Pribrezhnoye and Energosintez may create an impression that the courts at the time were reluctant to apply the “substance-over-form” approach to transfer pricing arrangements. However, in the Court’s opinion, those cases were mostly decided on the facts. They cannot be construed as negating the power of the courts to invalidate a particular transaction as “sham”. Rather, the courts in those cases found that evidence produced by the Tax Service was insufficient to reach such a conclusion. The fact that in one or two cases the Tax Service failed to produce sufficient evidence and prove the fictitious character of a taxpayer’s operations does not mean that it would fail in all subsequent cases in respect of other taxpayers."

Similarly, the domestic court’s conclusions in the case of Siblekon relied on by the applicants (see paragraph 438 above) did not mean that the existence of a preferential tax agreement always relieves the taxpayer from liability for not paying taxes in full. The existence of such an agreement with the ZATO administration is a powerful argument strengthening the presumption that the taxpayer acted bona fide, but it does not give absolute immunity from possible re-characterisation of operations based on that agreement as “sham”."

Whether or not a business operation was a “sham transaction” remained ultimately a question of fact. Likewise, in the criminal-law sphere the question of whether a taxpayer knowingly misinformed the tax authorities about his operations is a factual question."

            ],
            [
                "805. The Court acknowledges that there are legitimate methods of tax minimisation: a company may organise its business processes in such a way as to benefit from special tax regimes. However, the tax-minimisation scheme deployed by Yukos was not fully transparent; some of the elements of the scheme were concealed from the authorities. Such behaviour by the taxpayer might have reasonably been construed as amounting to the submission of “false data” to the tax authorities within the meaning of the Criminal Code, which constitutes the actus reus of tax evasion."
            ],
            [
                "806. First, the Court observes that tax minimisation was the sole reason for the creation of the network of the trading companies in Lesnoy. It was not claimed by the applicants, neither in the domestic proceedings nor before this Court, that the trading companies were registered in Lesnoy in order to facilitate logistics, save on production costs, hire qualified staff, etc. As the Court put it in the Yukos case (§ 593), “the arrangement [i.e. the tax minimisation scheme] was obviously aimed at evading the general requirements of the Tax Code, which expected taxpayers to trade at market prices”."
            ],
            [
                "807. Second, the Court observes that despite the formal domiciliation of the trading companies in Lesnoy, all business activities which generated profit were in fact carried out in Moscow. The trading companies presented themselves as real companies having assets and personnel in the low-tax zone; however, as was established in the domestic proceedings and later confirmed by the Court in the Yukos case (see § 591), all of the trading companies had virtually no assets or personnel in the ZATO, and had enjoyed no operational independence whatsoever from the Moscow headquarters. Thus, the trading companies claimed tax cuts as if they were really operating in the low-tax zone, but in reality they were merely registered there for form’s sake, and all the operations were conducted in Moscow."
            ],
            [
                "808. Third, the Court does not find any proof that the applicants ever informed the tax authorities about their true relation to the trading companies. Quite the contrary: the system of oil sales set by Yukos was deliberately opaque. The trading companies were registered in the names of third persons not formally connected to Yukos or its managers, and had been managed by fictional directors. Benefits of the trading companies were returned to Yukos indirectly, through a special fund which received “gifts” from the trading companies. The fact that the Lesnoy town trading companies were wound up in 2001 following audits by the Tax Service, and that immediately afterwards similar entities were registered in other low-tax zones demonstrates that Yukos was not prepared to defend the lawfulness of the tax optimisation technique in courts. Such a coordinated reorganisation implies that it was done in order to render it more difficult for the authorities to scrutinize the business operations of those companies, to trace their assets and their affiliation with other companies and persons. In sum, by organising its sales in this way the applicants evaded application of the provisions of the Tax Code which permitted recalculation of taxes on the basis of “market prices” in the relations between affiliated companies."
            ],
            [
                "809. The Court concludes that the applicants’ behaviour cannot be compared to that of a bona fide taxpayer who fails to declare his revenues or submit other relevant information due to some unintended omission or a genuine misinterpretation of the tax law. In the present case, whereas a part of the tax-minimisation scheme was visible to the authorities, the applicants misrepresented or concealed some important aspects of that scheme which arguably might have been crucial for defining eligibility of the trading companies to tax cuts."

            [
                "810. The applicants also challenged the finding of the domestic courts to the effect that they (the applicants) had played a leading role in mounting and managing the impugned tax-optimisation scheme. In the opinion of the Court it is difficult to imagine that the applicants, as senior executives and co-owners of Yukos, were not aware of the entire transfer pricing arrangement and did not know that the information included in the fiscal reporting of the trading companies did not reflect the true nature of their operations (see, mutatis mutandis, Soros, cited above, § 59). Thus, the mens rea of the impugned crime was self-evident."
            ],
            [
                "811. The Court is not called upon to develop a comprehensive legal theory explaining the differences between legitimate tax-minimisation techniques and tax evasion. Similarly, it is impossible to set an exhaustive list of criteria for defining a particular operation or a company as “sham”. However, the cumulative effect of the elements discussed was sufficient to demonstrate that the operations of the trading companies were likely to be “sham”, that the reporting based thereon did not reflect the realities of the business operations, and that the applicants therefore “knowingly” submitted “false data” in order to reduce the overall tax burden of the company. Such inferences of fact were not “arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable”."

In so far as the personal income-tax evasion is concerned, the applicants claimed that in reality they had rendered consulting services to the two Isle of Man companies, i.e. Status Services and Hinchley and/or to the “end-users”. Again, this is a question of fact which was disputed in the domestic proceedings. If the “consultancy agreements” between the applicants and the Isle of Man companies were indeed “sham” or “fictitious” – and that was the finding of the domestic courts – one can reasonably consider that the applicants had knowingly submitted false data in their declarations, thus committing an offence under Article 198 of the Criminal Code."

            [
                "813. The domestic courts, after having examined the evidence before them, concluded that the fees received by the applicants under the service agreements were de facto payment for the applicants’ work in Yukos and in the affiliated structures – payment which would normally be taxable under the general taxation regime. The applicants’ own explanations concerning their relations with the unnamed “end-users” were quite vague. Even though the applicants were allowed to remain silent, the overall picture of their relations with the two Isle of Man companies and/or “end-users” required some explanation, especially in the light of their parallel work as senior executives of Yukos, work for which they received only a symbolic compensation, and in view of other evidence discovered by the prosecution which showed the links between the applicants and the two Isle of Man companies. The provenance of the money paid by the Isle of Man companies under the “service agreements” – an element which the applicant considered as important – in the eyes of the domestic courts was not important for establishing the true purpose of those transfers, and the Court does not see any reason to disagree with this. In such circumstances the inferences made by the Russian courts as to the real nature of the payments received by the applicants from the two Isle of Man companies were not unreasonable or arbitrary."
            ],
            [
                "814. Equally, the Court is unable to accept the applicants’ alternative argument, namely that by opting for a licence the applicants simply used a legitimate tax-minimisation technique falling short of tax evasion. The right to choose a particular mode of operation with a view to minimising taxes does not relieve the taxpayer from the obligation to submit true information to the tax authorities. In the domestic proceedings (as well as before this Court) the applicants claimed that they had provided consulting services to various clients, including those not related to Yukos. Apparently, their tax declarations were formulated in similar terms. However, the Russian courts did not accept that assertion, holding that the sums received by the applicants had nothing to do with any consulting services but solely related to their work as senior executives in Yukos. In other words, the applicants did not inform the tax authorities of the true nature of their activities. This was clearly not an unintended or minor omission, or a simple misinterpretation of the tax law. In this respect the applicants’ situation was different from that of the defendant in the Vliran case they referred to (see paragraph 443 above)."

The applicants’ last line of argument also concerned their prosecution for tax evasion and the authorities’ attitude to such tax-minimisation schemes during the period when they operated. The applicants’ claimed that they had been the first to suffer from a novel interpretation of the criminal law, and that no other businessmen who had been using similar tax-minimisation techniques had been prosecuted and/or convicted for that. Furthermore, the tax-minimisation scheme operated on the basis of preferential tax agreements, and several tax assessments conducted in respect of the trading companies confirmed the lawfulness of the tax cuts.

The Court admits that in certain circumstances a long-lasting toleration of certain conduct, otherwise punishable under the criminal law, may grow into a de facto decriminalisation of such conduct. However, this was not the case here, primarily because the reasons for such toleration are unclear. It is possible that the authorities simply did not have sufficient information or resources to prosecute the applicants and/or other businessmen for using such schemes. The Court does not exclude that similar “tax-optimisation techniques” might have been known to the tax authorities, for example from the FATF documents (see paragraph 750 above). It is also conceivable that a global analysis of money-flow and sales of Yukos oil might be suggestive of the use of some tax-minimisation techniques. However, there is no evidence that the tax authorities knew exactly what Yukos was doing; as the Court put it in the Yukos case (§ 592):",

In reply to the request the defence did not ask for additional time to prepare their arguments. The second applicant explained, in particular, that there had been nothing new in the prosecution’s requests for detention since 2003, and that he was prepared to give his arguments immediately.

Thus, he constantly missed his daily walks because of the need to read the materials in the case file or participate in the hearings. On weekends and holidays, when there were no court hearings he could not go outside because he was ill. Further, the food in the prison was incompatible with his illnesses, and he only received appropriate food from his relatives or lawyers to a limited extent. It was impossible to have a hot meal at midday when there was a hearing or when he was reading the case file. During the Christmas holidays the second applicant was transferred to an overcrowded “common” cell. Despite his requests, he was not given a calculator or a magnifying glass.

The cell had a folding bed, a washbasin with cold water, a toilet, a shelf for toiletries, a chair and a table. The cell was ventilated naturally, and was lit by a day-time lamp and a night-time lamp (dezhurnoye osvescheniye). In addition, the cell had a window measuring 60 x 90 cm. The cell was equipped with a cistern for boiled water which was supplied by the warders when necessary. Referring to the certificates issued by the head of the remand prison, Mr Tagiyev, dated 7 August 2008, the Government alleged that illumination, temperature and humidity in the isolation cell had corresponded to the sanitary standards. The distance between the toilet and the bed was one metre, which was explained by the small dimensions of the cell; such a distance, however, respected basic requirements of hygiene. The bed was unfolded during the night, namely between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. During the daytime the second applicant could sit on the chair. The Government also attached a report of inspection of sanitary conditions of certain other premises of the remand prison (not apparently related to the cells where the second applicant was detained), dated January 2006, as well as two reports of the inspection of the ordinary cells where the second applicant was detained dated February 2004 and January 2005, which concluded that sanitary condition of the cells was satisfactory.

Those companies claimed to operate in Lesnoy, and, on that ground, they qualified for tax cuts.

The first applicant, in his turn, asked the court to be shown instructions or rules which fixed that distance and, more generally, defined the conditions of the communication between a defendant and his lawyer in the courtroom. The prosecutor replied that the defendants had to solve the matter not with the judge but with the administration of the remand prison or the escort service. Judge Kolesnikova then explained to the parties that she was not against them communicating during the breaks. However, in her words, the question of transmitting documents between the defence lawyers and the applicants did not belong to the competence of the court; the defendants were detained on remand and all questions related to the exchange of documents were within competence of the respective institution, in particular the escort service, and were regulated by the internal rules.

Mr Shchekin also explained that in his opinion there was no basis for characterising the trading companies as sham companies.

However, if in that prison there were no places vacant, the detainee could be sent to serve his sentence in the nearest region where it was possible to accommodate him.

According to the District Court, that decision was taken within the competence of FSIN, and did not violate the law.

Mr Dubov, another major shareholder of Yukos, testified that on 24 October 2003 (the day before the first applicant’s arrest) Mr Surkov (one of the closest aids of President Putin) had said that “all government institutions had been forbidden from having any contact with Open Russia and that President Putin had stated that Yukos was going to be eliminated from the political sphere”. Mr Dyatelev, one of the applicants’ lawyers, gave evidence that a former Tax Minister, Mr Pochinok, was told by Mr Surkov not to give evidence at the applicant’s trial in relation to the tax charges. Mr Ivlev, a lawyer with ALM Feldmans (a law firm working for Yukos), testified that in November 2003 he had met Mr Shuvalov, another aid to President Putin, who had said that there had been absolutely nothing he could do to stop the attacks on the first applicant and Yukos, and implied that decision concerning their fate had been taken at the highest level within the Presidential Administration.",

The prosecution carries out various investigative measures, such as searches, questioning of witnesses, expert examinations of material evidence, etc. For certain investigative measures the prosecution has to request a court order; the same concerns preventive measures, in particular the detention of the suspect. If having collected the evidence the prosecution concludes that a particular person has committed a crime, the prosecution makes an order formally charging the said person. The accused person may challenge any decisions (or inaction) of the prosecution before a higher prosecution official or, in some instances, before a court.

The time for reading the case file by the accused and his counsel may be limited (for example, when the defence deliberately delays the proceedings).

The prosecutor opens the case for the accusation by setting out succinctly the essence of the accusation with reference to the relevant Articles of the Criminal Code. The judge then asks the accused if he (the accused) understands the accusation and whether or not he considers himself guilty. If the accused understands the charges and does not plead guilty, the examination of evidence produced by the prosecution begins. The prosecution decides on the order in which witnesses are called and other evidence is presented to the court. The defence can intervene and challenge the witnesses for the prosecution, put questions, etc., but the presiding judge can reject leading or irrelevant questions. An expert witness who gave an opinion during the preliminary investigation may be summoned and questioned in court; further expert examinations can be ordered if necessary.

It concerned, in particular, interpretation of the concept of “other means” used in Article 199 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiffs in that case considered that the concept of “other means” was too vague, might lead to arbitrary interpretation and was therefore unconstitutional. In particular, Mr T., one of the plaintiffs, was a director of a firm which had an outstanding tax debt. Instead of paying that debt he spent the money of his firm for other purposes. Such behaviour was considered as tax evasion “by other means” and Mr T. was convicted. The Constitutional Court held that “taxes ... can be considered as lawfully established only where the law defines clearly the object of taxation, the taxable amounts, the amounts of tax payments, category of taxpayers [concerned] and other substantive elements of a fiscal obligation”.

The court found that 70 per cent of the average number of staff in the company were ZATO residents and that they received more than 70 per cent of wages paid by the company.

All the above circumstances as such did not exclude that the company was carrying out its activities on the territory of the ZATO and are irrelevant for the case at hand, since they are not taken into account by the tax law in order to define conditions for tax cuts.",

In breach of Article 3 (7) of the Tax Code the lower courts [wrongly] assumed that since the law did not refer to other criteria for defining whether the business activity was carried out on the territory of ZATO other than the presence of fixed assets, personnel and wages [there], the tax inspectorate or the court could establish such criteria by themselves.",

The documents submitted by the company to the Tax Inspectorate demonstrated that the company satisfied all requirements of section 5 (1) of the Law on ZATOs. The Tax Inspectorate, within a “desk” tax audit, was not empowered to visit premises of the company. Although after the decision bringing the company to tax liability the Tax Inspectorate conducted an “on-the-site” tax audit of the company, its results cannot be used to support the conclusions of the decision of 2000.

Vliran Ltd (case No. A19-884/02-24-F02-2873/02C1). That case concerned a service agreement concluded between Mr K. and the taxpayer - Vliran Ltd. Under that agreement Mr K. was supposed to work as a general manager of the taxpayer company, in exchange of a fee. Mr K. was registered as an individual entrepreneur; at the same time he was the sole owner of the Vliran Ltd (i.e. the taxpayer company). As a result, the service agreement had his signatures on behalf of both sides: he signed it in the capacity of an individual entrepreneur and in the capacity of the sole owner of the company. The fees paid by the company to Mr K. were included in its declaration as “costs”. The Tax Inspectorate considered that these fees could not be regarded as “costs” on the ground that the service agreement between the company and Mr K. was null, since it was signed by the same person on both sides. The court of cassation, however, ruled in favour of the taxpayer company. It held, in particular, that the charter of the company did not provide for the position of a general director, and that his functions could therefore be transferred to an external person. Furthermore, there was nothing in the law to prevent the company from “outsourcing” the managerial function to somebody else. The court ruled that there was no evidence that the company acted in bad faith, and the service contract was therefore valid.",

At the same time, § 2 provides that where the insolvency of a legal person is caused by its owners or by other persons who “have the power to give binding orders to that legal person or are capable of controlling its activities otherwise”, those persons, in case the assets of the legal person are insufficient to satisfy the creditors’ claims, bear subsidiary liability for its debts."

The criminal procedure law distinguishes between the figures of the victim of the crime and of the “civil plaintiff” (i.e. the person whose pecuniary interest had been affected by the crime): they are not necessarily the same person. Similarly, the criminal defendant (the suspect or the accused person) is not necessarily the same person as the “civil defendant”. The latter is defined in Article 54 of the new Criminal Procedure Code as “a legal person or an individual, who, under the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, bears [civil] liability for the damage caused by the crime [committed by the criminal defendant]”."

As a general rule, liability for tort is conditioned upon the fault of the tortfeasor; however, in some cases the law may provide for strict liability. The last paragraph of that provision stipulates that where the victim of the tort has asked for the damage to be caused, or has agreed to it, no liability for tort arises. In addition, Article 1068 of the Civil Code provides for liability of a legal person for the damage caused by an employee of that legal person. Insofar as relevant it reads as follows:",

In the 21 st General Report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) ( CPT/Inf (2011) 28) made certain recommendations on the solitary confinement of prisoners. It noted, in p. 55, that “solitary confinement further restricts the already highly limited rights of people deprived of their liberty. The extra restrictions involved are not inherent in the fact of imprisonment and thus have to be separately justified”. For the CPT, it is appropriate to apply the traditional tests developed by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. In particular, any further restriction of a prisoner’s rights must be linked to the actual harm the prisoner has caused in the prison setting. During solitary confinement there should, for example, be no automatic withdrawal of rights to visits, telephone calls and correspondence or of access to resources normally available to prisoners (such as reading materials). Given the potentially very damaging effects of solitary confinement, the CPT considers that the principle of proportionality requires that it be used as a disciplinary punishment only in exceptional cases and as a last resort, and for the shortest possible period of time, no higher than 14 days for a given offence, and preferably lower. Prisoners undergoing solitary confinement as a disciplinary sanction should be entitled to at least one hour’s outdoor exercise per day, from the very first day of placement in solitary confinement, and should also be permitted access to a reasonable range of reading material (for further details see Razvyazkin v. Russia, no. 13579/09, § 89, 3 July 2012). On the last point the 21 st General Report reiterated recommendation made in respect of the Russian Federation in the Report on the 2001 visit to the Russian Federation (CPT/inf (2003) 30), made public on 30 June 2003, where it urged the Russian authorities in § 119 to “take steps to ensure throughout the country that prisoners placed in disciplinary cells have access to reading matter.”"

In previous cases the Court analysed such factors as access to natural light or air in the cells, adequacy of heating arrangements, compliance with basic sanitary requirements, the opportunity to use the toilet in private and the availability of ventilation (see, for example, Peers v.

Whatever the real reason for imposing a disciplinary sanction, the Court considers that the applicant’s fault, if any, was not particularly serious and did not probably call for such a measure (see in this respect the CPT’s recommendation that such a serious punishment as solitary confinement should be commensurable to the disciplinary offence for which it was imposed, paragraph 455 above). The Court reiterates that although it is not for the Court to specify which security measures may be applied to prisoners, “the absence of any substantive reasons” for placing a detainee in a solitary confinement cell for a considerable period of time can be a relevant factor for characterising this form of disciplinary punishment as “inhuman and degrading treatment” (see Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 24027/07, 11949/08, 36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09, § 211, 10 April 2012; see also Razvyazkin, cited above, § 107)."

In particular, the Court takes it as accepted that the cell had a window measuring 90 x 60 cm. It is questionable whether such a window would provide enough natural light for a cell measuring 5.5 square metres. The permanent electric light in the cell may have been very disturbing for a detainee, and the one-metre distance between the open toilet pan and the sleeping place was clearly insufficient. Furthermore, the applicant had been deprived of all social contacts, could not read books or magazines or watch TV (see paragraph 452 above), and could not lie down on the bunk-bed, since it was unfolded only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m."

However, the Court is not required to resolve this factual controversy on those points. Even if the applicant’s description of the other conditions of detention was accurate, and even if such conditions might indeed be very uncomfortable, it is crucial to note that the situation complained of lasted for only seven days (cf. with Popandopulo v. Russia, no. 4512/09, § 95, 10 May 2011, or A.B. v. Russia, cited above, §§ 105 et seq., where the applicants’ solitary confinment lasted much longer). The Court concludes that in the circumstances of the present case the degree of suffering to which the applicant was exposed, given its short duration and in view of the applicant’s age and mental and physical condition, did not reach the minimal threshold of severity to amount to “inhuman or degrading” treatment.

As follows from the Government’s explanations, the detainees were allowed to use a kettle in the premises of the Meshchanskiy District Court. It was therefore possible for the applicant to prepare tea, coffee or instant food during the day.

The Court has frequently found that a short duration of outdoor exercise, limited to one hour a day, was a factor that further exacerbated the situation of applicants who were confined to their cells for the rest of the time without any kind of freedom of movement (see Skachkov v. Russia, no. 25432/05, § 54, 7 October 2010; Gladkiy v. Russia, no. 3242/03, § 69, 21 December 2010; and Yevgeniy Alekseyenko v. Russia, no. 41833/04, § 88, 27 January 2011). The applicant in the present case claimed that for most of the time he had been deprived even of that short walk. The Government’s responses in this respect indicate that walks had been available to detainees only if they left the remand prison some time after sunrise and returned there before sunset. The Court reiterates its factual findings in the case of Trepashkin v. Russia (no. 2) (no. 14248/05, § 119, 16 December 2010), which analysed the situation in the same remand prison in the following terms:",

Between January and April 2004 the applicant was taken to the courts almost every second working day ... As appears from the evidence in the case file, the logistical arrangements in the remand prison were such that groups of prisoners were dispatched to different courts in Moscow in the same prison van. As a result, the applicant was usually woken up early and returned to the remand prison quite late. This fact is confirmed by, amongst other sources, the letter from the Ministry of Justice concerning the delays in dispatching prisoners to and back from the Moscow courts ...",

However, the Government did not explain whether any special arrangements had been made for those returning from the courts in the evening, especially in winter, when the “daytime” is short.

In the circumstances the Court is prepared to assume that on most of the days when the applicant was taken to the court he could not take walks in the remand prison.

Thus, the applicant was accused of non-violent crimes, he had no criminal record, and there was no evidence that he was predisposed to violence. The Government’s reference to certain “security risks” was too vague and was not supported by any specific fact. It appears that “the metal cage in the ... courtroom was a permanent installation which served as a dock and that the applicant’s placement in it was not necessitated by any real risk of his absconding or resorting to violence but by the simple fact that it was the seat where he, as a defendant in a criminal case, was meant to be seated” (see Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia, cited above, § 127). Furthermore, the applicant’s own safety or the safety of the co-accused was not at stake. Finally, the applicant’s trial was covered by almost all major national and international mass media, so the applicant was permanently exposed to the public at large in such a setting. As in Ashot Harutyunyan the Court concludes that “such a harsh appearance of judicial proceedings could lead an average observer to believe that an extremely dangerous criminal was on trial.

                "504. In their submissions the Government described in detail the circumstances of the second applicant’s arrest and claimed that his behaviour at that point, as well as his informal exchanges with his lawyers had been indicative of his inclination to flee (see paragraph 489 above). However, the Court notes that these arguments did not constitute part of the domestic courts’ reasoning. The Government further referred to the testimony of potential witnesses who had fled the country, allegedly at the insistence of the Yukos management (see paragraph 491 above). The Court notes that that testimony was collected only in 2007-2008 and, consequently, had not been relied upon by the domestic courts in 2003 ‑ 2005. The same concerns information about credit cards issued by foreign banks in the applicant’s name, real-estate abroad and private jets which had allegedly been at the applicant’s disposal at Vnukovo airport: those factual elements were not mentioned in the extension orders under examination. The Court reiterates in this respect that “it is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in [the detention orders] and of the established facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3” (see, for example, Wiensztal v. Poland, no. 43748/98, § 50, 30 May 2006). In the present case the Court will take into consideration only those arguments and information which were explicitly relied upon by the domestic courts in their decisions (see paragraphs 47 et seq. above) and which the applicant had an opportunity to discuss in the domestic proceedings."

                "505. During the period under consideration the domestic courts extended the second applicant’s detention with reference to two risks: the risk of tampering with evidence and the risk of absconding. As to the former, the Court notes that by June 2004, when the trial started, all documentary evidence had been already seized by the prosecution, all prosecution witnesses and experts had been questioned and their recorded testimony had been submitted to the court. By the end of 2004 the court had completed its examination of evidence collected by the prosecution. These developments significantly reduced the risk of tampering with evidence. Furthermore, throughout 2004 the main assets of Yukos were attached and sold at auction (see the Yukos case, §§ 92 et seq.). Thus, the second applicant ceased to exercise de facto control over the company; his ability to influence the company’s personnel was accordingly reduced. Despite those changes the domestic courts continued to repeat the reasons set out in their earlier detention orders."

            [
                "506. The other reason justifying the second applicant’s detention was, according to the domestic courts, a risk of absconding. However, the existence of that risk was not convincingly demonstrated in the extension orders. Thus, the mention of the second applicant’s “international connections” was too vague and was not supported by any evidence. The Court stresses that, given the advanced stage of the proceedings, the domestic courts were in a position to take a closer look at the second applicant’s alleged “international connections” and explain it in their decisions (compare Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, § 187, 22 December 2008, and Aleksandr Makarov v. Russia, no. 15217/07, § 126, 12 March 2009). The reference to the second applicant’s character “was not accompanied by any description of the applicant’s character or an explanation as to why it made his detention necessary” (see Polonskiy v. Russia, no. 30033/05, § 152, 19 March 2009). The fact that other Yukos managers and shareholders had left Russia might probably have been relevant at the initial stage of the investigation, but “the fact that a person is charged with acting in criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention; his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account” (see Sizov v. Russia, no. 33123/08, § 53, 15 March 2011). Furthermore, the Court notes that “the behaviour of a co-accused cannot be a decisive factor for the assessment of the risk of the detainee’s absconding. Such assessment should be based on personal circumstances of the detainee” (see Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, § 76, 1 June 2006)."

                "507. The Court also notes that in ordering the extensions the courts used a stereotyped wording. Such an approach may suggest that there was no genuine judicial review of the need for the detention (see Yağcı and Sargın v. Turkey, 8 June 1995, § 50 et seq., Series A no. 319 ‑ A) at each extension."

The Court reiterates that when deciding whether a person should be released or detained the authorities have an obligation under Article 5 § 3 to consider alternative measures of ensuring his or her appearance at trial. This Convention provision proclaims not only the right to “trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial” but also lays down that “release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial” (see Jabłoński v. Poland, no. 33492/96, § 83, 21 December 2000, and Sulaoja v. Estonia, no. 55939/00, § 64, in fine, 15 February 2005). In the present case the authorities did not consider the possibility of ensuring the second applicant’s attendance by the use of a more lenient preventive measure, such as bail, house arrest, or other measures provided by the Russian law, and “the context of the case was not such as to make the applicant obviously “non-bailable” (see Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), § 196, with further references)."

On 14 December 2004 the defence team was given two hours and thirty minutes to prepare objections to the state prosecutor’s oral request for extension of the second applicant’s detention; and on 2 March 2005 the defence team was given no time to prepare.

The defence subsequently filed an eight-page appeal against the ruling of the Meshchanskiy District Court of 14 December 2004.

On the other hand, this same factor speaks in favour of the Government’s contention under Article 5 § 4 that the defence had sufficient time to respond to the prosecution’s requests, in view of their similarity. The Court reiterates in this respect that “Article 5 contains more flexible procedural requirements than Article 6 while being much more stringent as regards speediness” (see Lebedev (no. 1), § 84). The Court observes that the applicant was represented by a group of highly professional lawyers, that the hearings were adjourned for one or two hours each time when the defence asked for it, and that the defence did not seek extra adjournments (see paragraph 49, 51 and 53 above). The Court concludes that even though the prosecution had more time to develop their arguments, given the nature of the proceedings, this disparity between the parties did not perturb the principle of equality of arms to an extent incompatible with Article 5 § 4 of the Convention."

Slovenia, no. 29462/95, §§ 82-88, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and G.B. v. Switzerland, no. 27426/95, §§ 34-39, 30 November 2000). Where domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 § 4; at the same time, the standard of speediness “is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal.... The Court would not be concerned, to the same extent, with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees” (see Shakurov v. Russia, no. 55822/10, § 179, 5 June 2012). In the case of Mamedova, cited above, which, like the present case, concerned appeal proceedings, it found that the “speediness” requirement was not complied with where the appeal proceedings lasted thirty-six, twenty-six, thirty-six, and twenty-nine days respectively, stressing that their entire duration was attributable to the authorities (see Mamedova, § 96; see also, for longer delays, Ignatov v. Russia, no. 27193/02, §§ 112-114, 24 May 2007, and Lamazhyk v. Russia, no. 20571/04, §§ 104-106, 30 July 2009). By contrast, the length of appeal proceedings that lasted ten, eleven and sixteen days was found to be compatible with the “speediness” requirement of Article 5 § 4 (see Yudayev v. Russia, no. 40258/03, §§ 84-87, 15 January 2009, and Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), § 247). Finally, the Court reiterates that the delay for which the State may be held responsible should not include the time when the defence was preparing their brief of appeal (see Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), § 247), unless the defence was prevented from finalising it through the fault of the authorities (see Lebedev (no. 1), § 100)."

In that case the Court held that delays of forty-four and sixty-seven days, of which twenty-seven and forty ‑ seven were attributable to the authorities, constituted a breach of Article 5 § 4 (see §§ 98-108). During the period now under examination the detention order of 10 September 2004 was reviewed within twenty-three days, if calculated from the date when the brief of appeal was introduced (see paragraphs 49 et seq. above). The detention order of 14 December 2004 was reviewed by the City Court within twenty-six days.

In Mamedova a similar delay was found to be in breach of Article 5 § 4, and the Court does not see any reason to hold otherwise in the present case. The Court has not overlooked that the applicant in casu introduced his appeal during the period of long public holidays (New Year and Orthodox Christmas).

France, 20 May 1998, § 58, Reports 1998-III; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 30, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; and Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 118, ECHR 2005-XIII)."

Italy, 26 February 1993, § 26, Series A no. 257-B; Kyprianou, cited above, § 119, and Kontalexis v. Greece, no. 59000/08, § 54, 31 May 2011). In applying the second test the Court often observed that “even appearances may be of a certain importance”, although the standpoint of the accused is not decisive, and what is determinant is whether the fear of partiality may be held to be objectively justified (see Sutyagin v. Russia, no. 30024/02, § 182, 3 May 2011). The mere disagreement with the procedural decisions taken by a judge does not provide a legitimate reason to doubt his or her impartiality (see Academy Trading Ltd and Others v. Greece, no. 30342/96, § 46, 4 April 2000). Similarly, the mere fact that a professional judge had already tried a co ‑ accused and knows the facts of the case is not, in itself, sufficient to cast doubt on that judge’s impartiality (see Miminoshvili v. Russia, no. 20197/03, §§ 116-120, 28 June 2011).",

The Court, however, is not convinced by that argument. In Morel v. France (no. 34130/96, §§ 45 et seq., ECHR 2000 ‑ VI, with further references) the Court held that the mere fact that a judge had already taken pre-trial decisions could not by itself be regarded as justifying concerns about his impartiality. What mattered was the scope and nature of the measures taken by the judge before the trial. For example, a preliminary analysis of the available information for the purposes of taking a procedural decision does not mean that the final analysis in the judgment had been prejudged."

However, this is conceivable without the judge being biased against the defendant. To overcome the presumption of impartiality (see paragraph 538 above), which is a starting point for its analysis under the subjective test, the Court must have a stronger evidence of personal bias than a series of procedural decisions infavourable to the defence. The Court reiterates that it may not necessarily agree with all of the decisions taken by Judge Kolesnikova, and will scrutinise them in more detail below; however, there was nothing in them to reveal any particular predisposition against the applicants (see Miminoshvili v. Russia, cited above, § 114).",

Italy, 7 August 1996, § 59, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ III, and Rojas Morales v. Italy, no. 39676/98, § 33, 16 November 2000)."

In more recent cases the Court has clarified its position and held that the mere fact that a judge had already tried a co-accused was not, in itself, sufficient to cast doubt on that judge’s impartiality in that applicant’s case (see Schwarzenberger v. Germany, no. 75737/01, §§ 37 et seq., 10 August 2006, and Poppe v. the Netherlands, no. 32271/04, § 22 et seq., 24 March 2009). As a matter of practice, criminal adjudication frequently involves judges presiding over various trials in which a number of co-accused persons stand charged. The Court considers that the work of criminal courts would be rendered impossible if, by that fact alone, a judge’s impartiality could be called into question. An examination is needed, however, to determine whether the earlier judgments contained findings that actually prejudged the question of the applicant’s guilt."

In Schwarzenberger, cited above, the Court emphasised that the assessment of facts in the judgment given against the applicant clearly differed from that in the judgment against the co-accused and that the judgment convicting the applicant did not contain any references to the judgment against the co-accused, showing that the judges had given fresh consideration to the applicant’s case. Further, in the judgment against the co-accused, the established facts about the applicant’s involvement in the crimes were essentially based on the co-accused’s submissions, and thus did not constitute the Regional Court’s assessment of the applicant’s guilt. In Poppe, cited above, the Court found it decisive that the applicant’s name had been mentioned only in passing in the judgments against the co ‑ accused and that the trial judges had not determined whether the applicant was guilty of having committed an offence."

In that case the judgment in the applicant’s case contained a reference to a judgment rendered earlier in the case of his brother, who was a member of the same gang, but only in passing. There was no direct evidence that the findings of the previous judgment were relied on by the judge in the proceedings against the applicant. What is more, Article 90 of the CCrP clearly stipulated that those findings could not have the force of res judicata in the applicant’s case. The judge sitting in the applicant’s case was required to conduct a fresh examination of the charges against him, relying only on the evidence examined at his trial."

In Miminoshvili the Court also analysed the judgment in the case concerning the applicant’s brother, Mr M., and stressed that the applicant’s name was never mentioned there in any incriminating context: the domestic court did not refer to the applicant as a “perpetrator” or “co-offender”, in contrast to the situation in Ferrantelli and Santangelo, cited above. The court in the case of the applicant’s brother did not determine whether the applicant was guilty, and there was no specific qualification of the acts committed by him. The Court further held as follows:",
                "“Indeed, several witnesses named the applicant as the leader of the gang and described his role in some of the episodes imputed to [his brother]. That information was reproduced in the judgment; however, it was presented in the judgment as reported speech, and not as the court’s own findings. It can be seen from the judgment that the information about the applicant’s involvement in the gang was not a condition sine qua non for the conviction of [the applicant’s brother]. At least, there is no indication that the Nikulinskiy District Court would not have come to the same conclusions in [the applicant’s brother’s] case if all references to the applicant’s name had been removed. These circumstances lead the Court to conclude that the judgment in [the applicant’s brother’s] case did not contain findings that actually prejudged the question of the applicant’s guilt in subsequent proceedings”.",
                "The Court finally took note of the fact that Judge K. was a professional judge and, as such, she was a priori more prepared to disengage herself from her previous experience in Mr M.’s trial than, for instance, a lay judge or a juror.

                "548. Turning to the present case the Court finds it similar to Miminoshvili in many respects. Thus, in the applicants’ case Judge Kolesnikova, under the Russian law, had been in no way bound by her earlier findings in the case of Mr Shakhnovskiy (see paragraph 387 above). She had to reconsider the whole case with all the issues raised by the case remaining open. Further, the judgment in the applicants’ case did not refer to the case of Mr Shakhnovskiy."

The Shakhnovskiy judgment, in turn, did not contain any finding directly incriminating the applicants: they were not referred to as “perpetrators”, “offenders”, “co-authors” etc. The judgment did not analyse their involvement in the crime imputed to Mr Shakhnovskiy (personal tax evasion) and did not establish the constituent elements of the applicants’ criminal liability."

Although the Shakhnovskiy judgment did not establish the applicants’ guilt, their names were mentioned in a somewhat incriminating context. Thus, the central proposition of the Shakhnovskiy judgment was the fictitious character of his relations with Status Services. This was based on a number of other interim factual findings, including the fact that Mr Aleksanyan had given a legal opinion to the first applicant, describing the individual entrepreneur’s scheme, the fact that the second applicant had been a chief executive of Status Services, and the fact that an identical service contract had existed between the second applicant and Status Services (see paragraph 142 above)."

It appears that at least the first two items of evidence were discovered by the prosecution during the searches in the Yukos premises in Zhukovka in October 2003 (see paragraphs 69 et seq. above). The Court notes that the defence in the case at hand tried to obtain the exclusion of materials obtained during those searches (see paragraph 173 above). By admitting that evidence in Mr Shakhnovskiy’s proceedings the judge implicitly acknowledged the lawfulness of the searches and seizures which led to the discovery of that evidence."

At the trial, after the two cases had been joined, the first applicant received 22 working days to study 165 volumes of case materials from the second applicant’s case, whereas the second applicant had to study 228 additional volumes within that period. The bill of indictment had covered a period of over ten years, and the case was extremely complex, both legally and factually. Although there was a commonality in the charges faced by the applicants there were also significant differences.

The first applicant obtained access on 25 November 2003 (see paragraph 120 above). The case files were withdrawn from the defence on 13 May 2004 (see paragraph 132 above). It follows that the second applicant had eight months and twenty days to study over 41,000 pages, whereas the first applicant had five months and eighteen days to study over 55,000 pages (see paragraphs 120 and 127 above). In order to go through the case file at least once the second applicant would have to read at a rate of over 200 pages per working day. The first applicant would have needed to read more than 320 pages per working day in order to study the prosecution case. Those figures might be higher if one excludes public holidays, days when the applicants were brought to the court or when they were considering defence evidence."

Thus, in order to prepare for the trial it was not enough simply to read all of the documents; the applicants had to keep notes and, most probably, re-read some of the documents many times, compare them with other documents and discuss them with the lawyers."

                "577. The Court also takes note of the conditions in which the applicants had to work with their case files. In the Court’s opinion those conditions were uncomfortable at best (see paragraphs 121 et seq. above). Thus, only one copy of each case file was made available to the defence. If one of the lawyers was studying a particular volume of the case-file in the premises of the GPO, the applicants were unable to study that volume at the remand prison. Although the applicants were allowed to take handwritten notes, it was impossible for them to make photocopies. The lawyers, by contrast, were allowed to make photocopies, but mostly for their own use. If they needed to give a copy of a document to the applicants, this was possible only through the remand prison administration and, in any event, the applicants could keep only a limited amount of printed materials in their cells. The second applicant was not allowed to use a magnifying glass and a calculator for some time, which must have slowed down his work. The case file was made available to the defence only in special rooms. The applicants and their lawyers were unable to discuss the case confidentially and, simultaneously, to work with the case file: if they needed to have the case file before them, the presence of an investigator was obligatory. In 2004 the case files were transferred to the remand prison, and, as follows from the applicants’ lawyers’ complaints to the investigative authorities, this made photocopying of documents impossible. All this made the work of the defence team very difficult."

After the joinder of the two cases in June 2004 (see paragraph 143 above) each applicant was given twenty-two days to familiarise himself with the materials related to the co-defendants; this meant that the second applicant, for instance, had to go through 2,500 pages per day related to the first applicant’s case, without rest days and without spending time on other tasks."

That being said, the Court reiterates that “the issue of adequacy of time and facilities afforded to an accused must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of each particular case” (see Leas v. Estonia, no. 59577/08, § 80, 6 March 2012). First and foremost, the Court observes that in the present case each applicant was assisted by a team of highly professional lawyers, many of them of great renown. All of them were privately retained and all had spent a considerable amount of time working with the applicants’ cases. The Court reiterates that in Kamasinski v. Austria (19 December 1989, § 87, Series A no. 168), which concerned the rights of the accused under Article 6 § 3 (e), the Court held that the system provided for under section 45 § 2 of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure which stipulated that the right to inspect and make copies of the court file is restricted to the defendant’s lawyer, the defendant himself only having such access if he is legally unrepresented, was not in itself incompatible with the right of the defence safeguarded under Article 6 § 3 (b); see also Kremzow v. Austria, 21 September 1993, § 52, Series A no. 268 ‑ B)."

                "580. The Court stresses that even where the lawyer has access to the materials of the case, this cannot fully replace personal examination of the case-file by the defendant. The Court reiterates that in Öcalan, cited above, §§ 141 et seq.,) it found a violation of Article 6 § 3 (b) because before the start of the trial the applicant had not been permitted to inspect the prosecution case file personally, even though the applicant’s lawyers had had access to it. However, the present case must be distinguished from Öcalan. In the latter the applicant had no access to the case file whatsoever prior to the start of the trial, whereas in the present case both applicants had the case files at their disposal for several months. When in Öcalan the applicant was finally given direct access to the materials of the prosecution case, he had only twenty days to read 17,000 pages. The time given to the applicants in the present case was much longer. Finally, in Öcalan v. Turkey (no. 46221/99, § 162, 12 March 2003) “the applicant’s lawyers may have been prevented from giving the applicant an assessment of the importance of all these items of evidence by the sheer number and volume of documents and the restriction imposed on the number and length of their visits”. No such drastic restrictions were imposed on the applicants in the present case (compare with the description of the conditions in which the applicant had to meet his lawyers in Öcalan, cited above, § 26 et seq.)."

                "581. The Court concludes that even if the applicants were unable to study each and every document in the case file personally, that task might have been entrusted to their lawyers. Importantly, the applicants were not limited in the number and duration of their meetings with the lawyers. The defence lawyers had at their disposal portable copying and scanning devices and were thus able to make and keep copies of the most important documents in the case file. The Court is aware that certain restrictions applied to the meetings between the applicants and their respective defence teams, in particular as regards the exchange of notes and documents. Those restrictions will be analysed separately under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention. However, they were not such as to make it impossible for the applicants to obtain the assistance of their lawyers in examining the case file and ascertaining the position of the prosecution before the start of the trial."

Furthermore, at least until the end of 2003 – beginning of 2004 there was a possibility for the defence lawyers to make copies of the materials. The Court previously held that unrestricted use of any notes and the possibility of obtaining copies of relevant documents were important guarantees of a fair trial. The failure to afford such access weighed, in the Court’s assessment, in favour of the finding that the principle of equality of arms had been breached (see Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, §§ 59 and 63, 24 April 2007; Luboch v. Poland, no. 37469/05, §§ 64 and 68, 15 January 2008; and Moiseyev, cited above, § 217). However, the applicants in the present case, unlike in Matyjek or Moiseyev, were not bound by any rules on State secrets; they could make notes and keep their notebooks with them, and their lawyers were allowed to make copies of pages from the case file, at least until the end of 2003 – beginning of 2004."

Their ability to absorb and analyse information was necessarily above average; they knew the business processes at the heart of the case and were, arguably, more competent in those matters than any other participants in the proceedings. Their professional status is also an additional factor in favour of the Court’s finding that the applicants’ inability to study every document personally was somehow compensated by their lawyers’ participation in examination of the case file: it must have been natural for the applicants, as senior managers, to delegate certain tasks to their lawyers."

For example, contracts between Yukos and its affiliates were important only in so far as they contained information about the price of oil and about the parties involved. It follows that the applicants did not need to read every page of such contracts in order to counter the prosecution’s arguments. As transpires from the judgment in the applicants’ case, a large part of the materials in both cases must have been identical. This means that in reality the number of pages which the applicants needed to scrutinise after the joinder of the two cases was less than the overall number of pages in each co-defendant’s case."

As to the “time and facilities” allocated to the defence during the trial, the Court observes that the timing of the hearings during the first stage of the trial proceedings, when the prosecution was presenting their case, was indeed more relaxed and made greater allowance for the preparation of arguments by the parties. However, the timing changed and the hearings became more intensive as soon as the court began examining evidence by the defence. Thus, without any apparent reason the court started hearings much earlier in the day (see paragraph 157 above) and discontinued the practice of Wednesday recesses (see paragraph 158 above)."

The Court observes that the appeal proceedings lasted from 31 May 2005 (the date when the Meshchanskiy District Court finished reading out its judgment) to 22 September 2005 (the date when the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment in the main part). The defence obtained a copy of the first-instance court judgment on 7 June 2005; the fifteen volumes containing the hearing record (which ran to over five thousand pages) were made available to the defence on 28 July 2005. The appeal hearing took place on 22 September 2005 (see paragraphs 278, 279 and 306 above). After lodging a preliminary brief of appeal the defence had the opportunity to supplement it (see paragraph 293 above). Thus, the defence team had three months and sixteen days to prepare written pleadings and to prepare for an oral argument, which appears to be a sufficient time, at least on the face of it. The Court’s analysis, however, cannot stop here: it must ascertain whether that time was sufficient in view of the specific conditions in which the defence had to prepare their appeal and whether the defence had all necessary facilities for that purpose."

Russia, no. 63378/00, § 81, 20 January 2005; Trepashkin, cited above, § 167). The Court notes that from 8 August 2005 the first applicant was detained in a “common” cell. In Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) the Court found that the conditions of detention in that cell amounted to “inhuman and degrading treatment” within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention (§§ 117 et seq.). On 18 August 2005 the second applicant was placed for one week in an isolation cell where it was impossible to work with the case (see paragraph 473 above). On 15 September 2005 both cells in which the applicants were detained were placed under the quarantine regime (see paragraph 301 above); as a result, the applicants were unable to meet with their lawyers for some time.

The applicants further claimed that before finalising their submissions to the court of appeal the defence had to verify the accuracy of the trial record and read materials added in the course of the trial. The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 3 (b) guarantees “adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence” and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on the accused’s behalf may comprise everything which is “necessary” to prepare the trial (see Yukos, cited above, § 538). The Court accepts that studying a trial record and other trial materials may be a necessary phase in the preparation of a brief of appeal, especially where, as in the case at hand, the defence questions the lower courts’ findings of fact and challenges procedural decisions made during the trial, and where the court of appeal does not conduct a full rehearing of the case but bases its conclusions on written materials contained in the case file (see, mutatis mutandis, Klimentyev v. Russia, no. 46503/99, § 107, 16 November 2006). The Court will therefore examine whether the defence was given sufficient time to study the trial materials."

The remaining volumes were not available to the defence, apparently because GPO was using them. Those volumes contained a number of the court’s procedural rulings and some documentary evidence added during the trial. The remaining volumes were given to the defence some time later, but the applicants were silent on that point and the Government did not comment either. The Court is prepared to admit that the defence had to prepare their appeal initially without having the entirety of the trial materials before them.

The Court is not in a position to say whether this was really so. It is, however, worrying that the defence’s written submissions on the trial record were dismissed by the domestic judge in a summary manner. The judge refused to consider the audiotapes made by the defence throughout the trial (see paragraph 287 above) and held in essence that she trusted her secretaries and her own memory better than the audiotapes (see paragraph 291 above). The Court accepts that audio-recording is not the only possible method of keeping track of proceedings. However, the case at hand was extremely complex, the trial lasted for nearly a year, seven secretaries were employed to keep the summary record, and hearings were held almost every day. In such circumstances it is difficult to believe that in all 126 pages of the defence’s written submissions, based on the audiotapes they had made, there was not a single accurate remark worthy of attention and that the secretaries’ diligence and the judge’s memory were infallible. In addition, the date of the appellate hearing was set by the Chairman of the Meshchanskiy District Court before Judge Kolesnikova had ruled on the defence’s objections to the trial record (see paragraph 290 above). This all leads the Court to the conclusion that the objections to the trial record were not considered seriously, and that the accuracy of the trial record is, therefore, open to doubt."

That “disadvantaged position” need not necessarily be analysed in terms of the equality-of-arms guarantee, primarily because the Court does not know whether the prosecution had any problems with access to and the accuracy of the trial materials. The situation may, however, be assessed alone, in the light of the principle of adversarial proceedings, which means, inter alia, that the defence must have a possibility to put arguments on all pertinent points, including “the elements ... which relate to procedure” (see Dowsett, cited above)."

In the circumstances the Court considers that possible inaccuracies in the trial record and the defence’s temporary inability to obtain access to part of the trial materials did not make it impossible for the defence to formulate their arguments and did not, therefore, influence the outcome of the appeal proceedings. The applicants’ conviction was based on various items of evidence, including a large amount of documentary evidence and statements from dozens of witnesses. Even acknowledging that the trial record may have contained some inaccuracies, the Court is not persuaded that they were such as to render the conviction unsafe.

The Government referred to the record of an interview with the second applicant: according to the record, when the applicant was asked whether he had had an opportunity to consult his lawyers in private, he had replied: “Not always, but, in general, yes”.

The court even sent a letter to the administration of the remand prison inquiring about the meetings between the second applicant and his lawyers. This showed that the court did not ignore the defence lawyers’ motions concerning meetings with their client. The defence lawyers were capable of communicating with their clients orally during the breaks in the court hearings. Originally the court allocated one day per week for meetings between the applicants and their lawyers. Later that arrangement was changed; however, when needed, the court allowed short breaks and even adjourned proceedings until the following day. The applicants’ defence lawyers did not object to such arrangements."

The applicants were not separated from the lawyers by a screen during the meetings in the remand prison. As to the exchange of documents in the courtroom, the head escort officer informed the defence that the applicants were entitled to use their notes, show them to the defence and transmit documents. Pursuant to the law the exchange of objects and documents between the defence lawyers and the defendant had to remain under the supervision of the investigators and the court, in order to exclude collusion. Under Article 275 § 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code the applicants were entitled to use notes, which had to be shown to the presiding judge if he or she so requested. The presiding judge had explained to the defence that all transmitted documents should first be shown to her for inspection, to which Mr Padva, one of the first applicant’s lawyers, replied “Sure, by all means”. The judge needed to inspect notes transmitted from the applicants to their lawyers in order to decide whether they were related to the criminal proceedings, and in order to prevent the applicants giving their lawyers personal letters and similar documents that were not relevant to the case. The judge did not object to the contacts between the applicants and the lawyers during the breaks and even in the course of the hearing (to the extent that these did not pose a problem for the normal course of the hearing), but insisted on inspecting written documents passed between them. That measure was accepted by Mr Padva, who had said: “I will print out [those documents and notes] and show them to you”. The second applicant said to the judge that he did not always need to pass documents to his lawyers but at least needed to read them or let them be read. In sum, the procedure for inspection of materials had been decided with the participation of the defence lawyers. The Government concluded that the existing arrangement was accepted by the defendants and did not raise any objections."

That rule did not cover oral communications, which were limited only to the extent required in order to comply with the detention rules. As to the distance between the applicant and his lawyers, which allegedly had not permitted them to communicate in private, the court had refused to examine that issue since it was outside the court’s competence."

Under Articles 62 and 72 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the official in charge of the criminal case (an investigator or a judge) must confirm the participation of a lawyer in the case. However, on 15 August 2005 Ms Khrunova did not have the status of the applicant’s legal representative in the proceedings and had not therefore been allowed to visit him. On 23 August 2005, when he obtained confirmation of her status from the Meshchanskiy District Court, she had been allowed to visit the applicant. On 15 and 21 September 2005 the applicant’s lawyers Mr Mkrtychev, Mr Drel and Mr Padva were unable to meet the applicant because on those dates the applicant’s cell had been closed for quarantine because one of his cellmates had fallen ill.

That search was instigated on the basis of an order from the GPO, and not by a judge, as required by the Advocacy Act. In the course of the search, the investigators seized, and later added to the criminal case file as evidence, documents constituting lawyer’s case files for a number of different clients. Those documents were subsequently widely used by the investigators. The files were labelled as containing lawyers’ notes relating to the defence of the second applicant, and Mr Drel’s role in the case was very well known to the GPO and the investigators. It was indisputably established before the Meshchanskiy District Court that a number of documents were seized directly from Mr Drel, a defence lawyer in the criminal case, shortly before the second applicant’s arrest on 25 October 2003; these concerned the first applicant’s tax affairs and advice given to the applicant in connection with the case being conducted at that time against the second applicant, who by that time had already been in detention for more than three months. Since the first applicant’s name was mentioned in the charges against the second applicant – and the charges subsequently brought against them were virtually identical – Mr Drel, at the first applicant’s request, had formulated the applicant’s defence position in the event of identical charges being brought against him. Thus, by dint of the search the prosecution knew about the first applicant’s likely legal defence strategy in advance of the charges being brought against him."

The search of Ms Artyukhova had been unlawful and a blatant violation of lawyer/client privilege. The record of the search of Ms Artyukhova indicates that the search was conducted under section 34 (6) of the Detention on Remand Act. According to this section, a search can only be conducted if there are sufficient grounds for suspecting individuals of attempting to smuggle in prohibited items, substances or food. It was claimed in the report following Ms Artyukhova’s search that the duty officer saw that “the lawyer and the defendant were repeatedly passing to each other notepads with some notes, making notes therein from time to time”. There were thus no legal grounds for conducting a search of Ms Artyukhova, because there was no indication in the report that the officer witnessed any attempt to pass any prohibited items, substances or food."

However, the search of and subsequent seizure from Mr Shmidt occurred when he was leaving the remand prison, and it could not therefore be alleged that the measures were designed to prevent prohibited items being brought into it. The applicants noted that that as a consequence of the search the Ministry of Justice demanded that disbarment proceedings be instigated against Mr Shmidt. The St Petersburg Bar Association subsequently exonerated Mr Shmidt at the disciplinary proceedings and determined that Mr Shmidt was entitled to take the document in and out of the remand prison and that the document was legally privileged."

The court declined to intervene, notwithstanding its overriding duty under the CCrP to ensure the fairness of its proceedings. However, the applicants were not violent. They had never attempted to escape. It was difficult to see what possible reason that there could have been for such a restriction, save to ensure that their discussions could be overheard. At a key phase in the trial (when the applicants’ defence was being presented) the court eliminated the Wednesday recess, which had been the primary opportunity for the applicants and their lawyers to communicate. The defence complained to the Meshchanskiy District Court about the inability to discuss matters confidentially in the court room on a significant number of occasions. The trial court refused to alter the arrangements in any way, simply stating that the defence were able to discuss matters confidentially during the adjournments. The District Court took the view that the requirement that the defence lawyers stood at least one metre from the applicants in the cage “does not really have anything to do with the case”. The defence raised those issues in the brief of appeal, but the Moscow City Court did not even address this aspect of the appeal in its decision."

As to Ms Khrunova and Ms Mikhailova, they were both authorised by the first applicant to act for him, in relation to the criminal proceedings as well as the applicant’s case before the Court. The Government’s reliance on Articles 62 and 72 of the CCrP was misconceived. Those provisions related to a lawyer’s participation in the trial, and did not govern the right of a lawyer to see his client. Section 18 of the Detention on Remand Act contained the applicable law in relation to access to a lawyer and provided that an accused was permitted to receive visits from his lawyer “with no limitation of their number or duration”. Moreover, Section 18 expressly stated that “visits shall be granted to a defence lawyer upon presentation of a lawyer’s ID and an authorisation. Demanding other documents from a lawyer is prohibited”. There was no requirement under domestic law for the trial court to “validate” a lawyer before he or she was permitted access to a client who had already authorised that lawyer to represent him or her in the proceedings. The remand prison officials’ insistence that the applicant’s lawyers had to be authorised by the trial court before they were permitted to see the first applicant was particular to his case and was unlawful."

In order to decide whether Article 6 § 3 (c) was complied with the Court does not need to know what happened after those proceedings were over, i.e. after the judgment of the Moscow City Court of 22 September 2005.

Switzerland, 28 November 1991, § 48, Series A no. 220).

From the search record itself it is clear that the investigators knew that they were entering a law firm’s office and were seizing the working files of a lawyer who represented the applicants (see, in particular, paragraph 71 above). Thus, by searching in Mr Drel’s office and seizing his working files the authorities deliberately interfered with the secrecy of the lawyer-client contacts protected under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention (see André and Other v.

At the relevant time Mr Drel was not under suspicion of any kind. Most significantly, the search in Mr Drel’s office was not accompanied by appropriate procedural safeguards, for example a court warrant, as required by the Advocacy Act and confirmed by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 398 and 399 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, Aleksanyan, cited above, § 214; Golovan v.

The Court observes that not only the applicants’ letters to their relatives or friends were subject to perusal; also the notes and drafts prepared by the applicants’ lawyers and brought to the meetings with their clients were regarded by the prison administration as “prohibited objects” (see, in particular, paragraphs 136 and 137 above) and seized. Such limitations, however, had no firm basis in domestic law. Thus, the legislation referred to by the Government regulated the correspondence of detainees with the outside world (“telegrams [and] letters” or “proposals, declarations and complaints” - see section 20 of the Detention on Remand Act, sections 84, 86, 91 and 99 of the Internal Regulations). It also mentioned “objects, substances and foodstuff” which the detainees were not allowed to have or to use (see sections 18 and 34 of the Detention on Remand Act, and, in particular, section 27 of the Internal Regulations, which associates “objects” with physical objects rather than documents, or Article 19.12 of the Code of Administrative Offences). The Court has doubts as to whether the drafts or notes made by a lawyer during a meeting with his or her client could be qualified as “correspondence” or “prohibited objects” within the meaning of the Detention on Remand Act or the Internal Regulations. The Government did not specify what set of rules applied to the notes and to other written materials which the applicants might have exchanged with their lawyers during the meetings, and the Court cannot accept that the law was applied by extension in such a sensitive area as intereference with privileged materials of the defence. The Court reiterates in this respect that any limitations imposed on a detainee concerning his contacts with lawyers should have a lawful basis and that the law should be sufficiently precise (see, mutatis mutandis, Nolan and K. v.

Furthermore, even assuming that the Russian law at the time prevented the defence from keeping and exchanging notes during the meetings, the Court is not persuaded that such a measure was necessary in the applicants’ case. Secrecy of written communications is no less important than the secrecy of oral exchanges, especially where the case is factually and legally complex. As follows from the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 29 November 2010 (see paragraph 396 above), notes, drafts, outlines, action plans, etc. prepared by the lawyer for or during a meeting with his detained client are to all intents and purposes privileged material. In addition, as noted by the Constitutional Court, certain exceptions from the general principle of confidentiality are permissible, but only if the authorities have a reasonable cause to believe that the professional privilege is being abused. The Court fully subscribes to this position. The Court reiterates that in Campbell, cited above, it stressed that the prisoner’s correspondence with a lawyer should not be “susceptible to routine scrutiny”. Such correspondence can be opened only when the prison authorities have “reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure”. The letter should, however, only be opened and should not be read. The reading of a prisoner’s mail to and from a lawyer should only be permitted “in exceptional circumstances when the authorities have reasonable cause to believe that the privilege is being abused in that the contents of the letter endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature” (§ 48)."

                "639. In the present case the authorities took as their starting point the opposite presumption, namely that all written communications between any detained person and his lawyer were suspect. This went so far as to assimilate “correspondence” with written notes made by the lawyers in preparation for the meetings with the client or during them. The only way for the defence to overcome that presumption was to submit their working papers to the prison authorities for inspection, i.e. to reveal their arguments to a body which could hardly be regarded as independent, and which was required by law to communicate all suspicious correspondence to the investigative authorities (see paragraph 392 above)."

                "640. Again, the principle of confidentiality of lawyer-client contacts is not absolute. However, the fact that a criminal defendant is detained is not sufficient to subject all of his written communications with his lawyers to perusal, and that for an indefinite period of time and without any justification specific for that particular case. The Court has repeatedly condemned the practice of “indiscriminate, routine checking of all of the applicant’s correspondence” with his lawyer (see Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, § 22, 24 February 2005; see also Kepeneklioğlu v. Turkey, no. 73520/01, § 31, 23 January 2007). This is a fortiori true in respect of papers brought by the lawyer to a meeting with his client or prepared during the meeting. To have a reasonable cause for interfering with the confidentiality of lawyer-client written communications the authorities must have something more than a sweeping presumption that lawyers always conspire with their clients in disregard of the rules of professional ethics and despite the serious sanctions which such behaviour entails."

Switzerland, cited above, § 47, see also Kröcher and Möller v. Switzerland, no. 8463/78, Commission decision of 10 July 1981, DR 26, p. 40). The applicants were accused of non-violent economic crimes and had no criminal record (compare with Castravet v. Moldova, no. 23393/05, § 58, 13 March 2007). There were no ascertainable facts showing that the applicants’ lawyers might abuse their professional privilege. The Court stresses that the measures complained of were not limited to the first days or weeks after the applicants’ arrest, when the risk of tampering with evidence, collision or re-offending was arguably higher, but lasted for over two years. In the circumstances the Court concludes that the rule whereby working documents of the defence, drafts, notes etc. were subject to perusal and could have been confiscated if not checked by the prison authorities beforehand was unjustified. Accordingly, the searches of the applicants’ lawyers were also unjustified.",

                "644. The Court takes note of the Government’s argument that the defence agreed to such security arrangements (see paragraph 152 above). However, the Court cannot regard this as a valid waiver of the defence’s rights under Article 6 § 3 (c). It reiterates that a waiver of a right must be, amongst other things, voluntary, and must be established in an unequivocal manner (see Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 73, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII, with further references; and, more recently, Vozhigov v. Russia, no. 5953/02, § 57, 26 April 2007; Pishchalnikov v. Russia, no. 7025/04, § 77, 24 September 2009; and Damir Sibgatullin v. Russia, no. 1413/05, § 48, 24 April 2012). The “waiver” in the present case satisfied neither of these two criteria. At the trial the defence expressed their concerns about the “security plan” implemented by the escort service in the courtroom. From the judge’s reaction it was clear that she did not consider herself competent to deal with that issue (see paragraph 151 above), and that the judge deferred to the prison authorities in a matter clearly related to legal assistance. Be that as it may, having consulted with the prosecution and the escort service the judge proposed an alternative solution, namely that all defence documents would be passed through her. The defence seemingly had no other choice but to accept that new rule. Therefore, Mr Padva’s remark that he would comply with the new rule cannot be interpreted as an unequivocal and voluntary acceptance of it."

            [
                "645. The Court accepts that a judge offers better guarantees of independence and impartiality than an escort officer. Nevertheless, in the circumstances the new rule still fell short of the requirements of Article 6 § 3 (c). The Court reiterates in this respect that, first, the applicants’ case was not such as to give reason to stringent restrictions on confidential exchanges, and that the authorities did not refer to specific facts which would justify the departure from the general rule of confidentiality of the lawyer-client contacts, including written communications. Second, the Court observes that Judge Kolesnikova, who requested the defence lawyers to show her all written communications, was also a judge of fact and law in the trial. While checking drafts and notes prepared by the defence lawyers or the applicants the judge might have come across information or arguments which the defence would not wish to reveal (see, for example, paragraph 155 above). Consequently, her role in checking the defence papers might have affected her opinion about the factual and legal issues involved in the case (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Erdem, cited above, § 67) where the Court examined a similar procedure of checking prisoners’ correspondence). In the Court’s opinion, it would be contrary to the principle of adversarial proceedings if the judge’s decision was influenced by arguments and information which the parties did not present and did not discuss at an open trial."

The Government did not challenge the applicants’ description of the conditions in which they had had to speak to their lawyers in the courtroom. In the light of the materials of the case, the Court has no reason to doubt the accuracy of the applicants’ account in this respect (see, in particular, paragraphs 151 and 154 above). In particular, the Court notes that the lawyers were not allowed to come closer than 50 cm to their clients when they wished to speak to them, and that escort officers were always standing in close proximity. The Court concludes that their oral exchanges might have been overheard by the convoy officers, at least occasionally."

                "647. The Court reiterates that not every measure hindering communication between the defendant and his lawyer must necessarily lead to a violation to Article 6 § 3 (c). Thus, for example, in assessing limitations imposed on the defence in the case of Titarenko v. Ukraine (no. 31720/02, 20 September 2012), the Court applied a quantitative approach and held as follows (§ 92):",
                "“The security arrangements [i.e. placement of the accused in a metal cage] undeniably limited communication between the applicant and his lawyer during the hearing. These limitations did not, however, amount to a complete lack of communication between the applicant and his lawyer; the applicant did not demonstrate that it was impossible to request that the lawyer’s seat be brought closer to his “cage”, or that they had been denied an opportunity for private communication when necessary.”",
                "In contrast with Titarenko, in the present case the applicants did not have “an opportunity for private communication” with their lawyers, due to the permanent presence of escort officers near the metal cage and the minimal distance the lawyers had to respect. The fact that the defence was able to request adjournments during the hearings is irrelevant: it appears that even during those adjournments the lawyers were unable to discuss the case with their clients anywhere but in the hearing room, i.e. in the close vicinity of the prison guards. The Court concludes that even though the applicants benefited from legal assistance by several lawyers, the secrecy of their exchanges, both oral and written, was seriously impaired during the hearings."

The judgment contained the court’s reasoning on that point. The Government further noted that the question of admissibility of evidence had been discussed in the subsequent proceedings on appeal and during the supervisory review appeal. The defence had been able to present their view on the issue of the admissibility of various pieces of evidence. Occasionally, the requests and motions of the defence were satisfied; in other instances the court took the side of the prosecution. The District Court was acting in compliance with the provisions of Article 50 (2) of the Russian Constitution, which provides that unlawfully obtained evidence cannot be used in criminal proceedings.

In the circumstances the presence of an expert in those matters had not been necessary. Further, questioning of an expert was always preceded by the preparation of a report by that expert. An expert could not be questioned if he had not earlier produced a written expert opinion. At the same time, the law allowed a written expert opinion (report) to be admitted to the materials of the case file without subsequent questioning of the expert who had prepared it. The judge in this case decided that there had been no grounds for calling the experts for questioning. It was the court’s task to establish the amount of damage, and the court had all the necessary information for that purpose. The District Court noted that the final assessment of the conclusions of the report by Mr Yeloyan and Mr Kupriyanov could be made only at the conclusive stage of the proceedings, when the court had deliberated and developed its position.

The defence had submitted to the District Court expert reports by Mr Shchekin, Ms Petrova, Mr Semenov, and Mr Lubenchenko. Those reports contained analysis of tax and banking legislation and accounting procedures and practices, criticism of the conclusions of the prosecution authorities, analysis of the lawfulness of audit reports issued by the tax authorities in the case in respect of the companies allegedly affiliated with the applicants, etc. The reports of those “expert witnesses” contained conclusions of a legal nature about the applicants’ guilt, analysis of the arguments of the prosecution, of evidence, interpretation of the applicable law etc., which was not an expert’s task under Russian law.

Furthermore, an “expert witness” had to receive a formal warning about his rights and obligations in the procedure; a defence lawyer could not, by virtue of his status, give such a formal warning, this being the prerogative of an investigator or a judge. Mr Grechishkin, Mr Shchekin and Mr Semenov made their conclusions on the basis of photocopies of documents which had not been “properly certified” as true copies.

Mr Shchekin gave his interpretation of the tax law. On 25 January 2005 Mr Rivkin requested the court to admit in evidence an “expert report” by Mr Semenov.

Mr Semenov testified about the conditions in which he had prepared his written report. The court, having examined their evidence, concluded in the judgment that those two persons could not be considered as “expert witnesses”, since they did not have the necessary specialist knowledge. Thus, they had never worked in any State tax authority or in an audit firm, with the exception of Mr Shchekin, who had worked as a lawyer for four months in 1996 in a State tax service.

Mr Shulgin’s written evidence was relied upon by the Meshchanskiy District Court when it ruled that the evidence of Mr Shchekin was unreliable. Furthermore, Mr Shulgin had previously revoked a tax audit because it had failed to take into account a directive from the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Taxes stating that promissory notes could be accepted in 1999.

As to the reading of a witness’s written testimony at the trial, it may sometimes be necessary – for example, to reveal discrepancies in his submissions, to undermine his credibility, to obtain clarifications, etc. Finally, the fact of being a witness does not grant immunity against prosecution or arrest.

The Court reiterates that it belongs primarily to the national courts to decide whether, on the facts of the case, a particular item of evidence could be considered as a reliable source of information. Nevertheless, where the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy, reliance on such evidence may undermine the overall fairness of the proceedings (see Jalloh v.

However, as indicated above, as a general rule admission of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and remains within the discretion of the domestic courts.

The Court agrees that the role of an expert witness in the proceedings can be distinguished from that of an eye-witness who must give to the court his personal recollection of a particular event. That does not mean, however, that testing of expert evidence is not covered by Article 6 § 3 (d) taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 1. There is an extensive case-law of the Court which guarantees to the defence a right to study and challenge not only an expert report as such but also the credibility of those who have prepared it, through their direct questioning (see, amongst other authorities, Brandstetter v.

Both Mr Yeloyan and Mr Kupriyanov were hired as experts by the prosecution at the investigation stage and conducted their expert examination at the premises of the GPO, without any involvement of the defence (compare with Zarb v.

Consequently, their position was closer to that of a “prosecution witness”. Contrary to the situation with defence witnesses, the accused is not required to demonstrate the importance of a prosecution witness. If the prosecution decides that a particular person is a relevant source of information and relies on his or her testimony at the trial (see paragraph 165 above), and if the testimony of that witness is used by the court to support a guilty verdict (which was the case – see paragraph 271 above), it must be presumed that his or her personal appearance and questioning are necessary, unless the testimony of that witness is manifestly irrelevant or redundant."

There is nothing in the judgment of the District Court to counter that assumption. The defence explained to the District Court why they had doubts about the reliability of the expert reports and the methods employed by the experts (see paragraph 169 above).

                "(i) Expert evidence deemed irrelevant or useless"
            ],
            [
                "721. As regards the first group, the Court reiterates that the requirement of a fair trial does not impose an obligation on a trial court to order an expert opinion or any other investigative measure merely because a party has sought it. In the present case, the District Court held that opinions by several “experts” for the defence touched upon legal matters, namely on the interpretation of the Russian legislation and were therefore useless for the court. In the Court’s opinion, and in the light of the nature of the submissions by those “experts”, the irrelevance/uselessness for the court was the central argument for rejecting them. This concerned oral and written submissions by Mr Shchekin, Mr Semenov, Mr Grechishkin, Mr Lubenchenko, Mr Gulyaev, and, to a certain extent, by Ms Petrova, Mr Bochko and Mr Pleshkov (see paragraphs 199 et seq., 214, 222 and 225 et seq.)."

            [
                "722. The Court takes note of the applicants’ argument that the CCrP did not prevent a court from seeking an expert opinion on legal matters. However, the Court is prepared to admit that legal matters are normally within the judge’s competence and experience ( iura novit curia ), and it is for the judge to decide whether or not he needs assistance in a particular field of law. In the Court’s opinion, in this part the rejection by a national court of the “expert evidence” produced by the defense remained within the former’s margin of appreciation."
            ],
            [
                "723. Some other reports and studies produced by the defence also touched, at least to some extent, upon other fields of knowledge, such as economic analysis or accounting. It was the case of Ms Petrova’s submissions and her written report (see paragraph 202), which concerned inter alia certain accounting practices, Mr Bochko’s submissions and the UBRAS report (see paragraph 214 above), which evaluated the economic impact of the operation of “trading companies” in the low-tax zones, and Mr Pleshkov’s report concerning, amongst other things, the economic feasibility of the investment programme of Apatit (see paragraph 222 above). The court rejected those reports in bulk, without distinguishing between various issues touched in those reports. Whereas such an indiscriminate approach is pregnant with dangers, the Court is prepared to admit that the primary reason for not admitting those reports was, again, their irrelevance or uselessness, and that it was within the trial court’s discretion to so conclude.",

            [
                "725. The Court notes that the defence produced to the court the audit reports by Ernst and Young and Price Waterhouse Coopers (see paragraphs 215 and 216 above), but the District Court refused to admit them. The Court reiterates that it belongs primarily to the national court to judge whether adding an item of evidence at the request of the defence would serve any useful purpose (see H. v. France, 24 October 1989, §§ 60 ‑ 61, Series A no. 162-A, and Fruni, cited above, § 126). However, it remains the Court’s task to ascertain whether the way in which evidence was taken was fair. For example, in exceptional circumstances the need to obtain a second expert opinion on an important aspect of the case may be self-evident and the failure of the court to obtain expert evidence sought by the defence may make the trial unfair (see, for example, G.B. v. France, no. 44069/98, § 69, ECHR 2001 ‑ X)."

            [
                "726. The Court notes that, unlike the “expert evidence” analysed above, the reports by Ernst and Young and Price Waterhouse Coopers were essentially non-legal. The first evaluated Apatit shares at different periods of time, whereas the second analysed the price of the apatite concentrate. The Court further stresses that these two reports concerned essentially the same matters as the reports produced by the prosecution (see paragraphs 165 and 166 above), which were accepted by the District Court in evidence. In the circumstances the applicants’ attempts to obtain opinions of professionals in the fields of accounting, evaluation of assets and market prices were justified. Therefore, the “irrelevance” of those reports could not and should not play any major role in dismissing them."

            [
                "727. As transpires from the procedural rulings of the Meshchanskiy District Court, those reports were rejected, inter alia, due to some defects related to their form (see in particular paragraphs 219 and 220 above). There was, however, no doubt that the reports emanated from the audit firms in question. Those firms were well known; they had their offices in Moscow and followed established practices and procedures. The District Court heard Mr Gage, a partner with Ernst and Young, who testified amongst other things about the preparation of the report by his firm. If the court needed any further information about the names or qualifications of experts involved in the preparation of the reports, it was easy to obtain it. The Court considers that defects as to the form were not a decisive argument for their rejection. The Court has therefore to examine the last argument, namely the inadmissibility of the reports from the standpoint of Russian law."
            ],
            [
                "728. The District Court decided that those audit reports did not correspond to any type of “evidence” which is admissible under domestic law. For the purposes of the present case the Court is prepared to accept the reading of the CCrP proposed by the Meshchanskiy District Court as reasonable (see Perić v. Croatia, no. 34499/06, § 17, 27 March 2008). That being said, the Court stresses that the rules on admissibility of evidence may sometimes run counter to the principles of equality of arms and adversarial proceedings, or affect the fairness of the proceedings otherwise (see, for example, Tamminen v. Finland, no. 40847/98, §§ 40-41, 15 June 2004). Although “Article 6 does not go as far as requiring that the defence be given the same rights as the prosecution in taking evidence” (see Mirilashvili, cited above, § 225), the accused should be entitled to seek and produce evidence “under the same conditions” as the prosecution (see, mutatis mutandis, Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, § 33, Series A no. 274; see also Perić, cited above, § 19). Clearly, those “conditions” cannot be exactly the same in all respects; thus, for example, the defence cannot have the same search and seizure powers as the prosecution. However, as follows from the text of Article 6 § 3 (d) the defence must have an opportunity to conduct an active defence – for example, by calling witnesses on its behalf or adducing other evidence."
            ],
            [
                "729. The prosecution in the present case tried to prove a particular point by obtaining expert reports and submitting them to the court. The reports were obtained within the preliminary investigation, i.e. not in adversarial proceedings, and, in this case, without any participation of the defence. Thus, the defence was unable to formulate questions to the experts, challenge the experts or propose their own experts for inclusion in the team, etc. The trial court admitted those reports in evidence because under the CCrP the prosecution had a right to collect them."
            ],
            [
                "730. The defence, on the other hand, had no such right. Under the CCrP, interpreted narrowly, only the prosecution or the courts were entitled to obtain “expert reports” (see paragraph 401 and 409). Indeed, in theory the defence could challenge an expert report produced by the prosecution and ask the court to commission a fresh expert examination. However, to obtain such a fresh examination it was incumbent on the defence to persuade the court that the report produced by the prosecution was incomplete or deficient. The Court notes that the defence was unable to call some of the experts who had prepared the reports at the request of the prosecution, and to cast doubt on their credibility. That fact gave rise to a separate finding of a violation under Article 6 § 3 (d) (see paragraph 716 above) and it undoubtedly made the defence’s task of proving the usefulness of the counter-reports more difficult."
            ],
            [
                "731. Furthermore, the Court stresses that it may be hard to challenge a report by an expert without the assistance of another expert in the relevant field. Thus, the mere right of the defence to ask the court to commission another expert examination does not suffice. To realise that right effectively the defence must have the same opportunity to introduce their own “expert evidence”."

            [
                "732. That right is not absolute and the forms in which the defence may seek the assistance of experts may vary. In the present case the defence tried to introduce their own “expert evidence” by proposing to the court two reports which it had obtained from third parties. Those reports were relevant, but the court refused to admit them. In the District Court’s opinion, those reports were not admissible either as “specialist reports” or as “other documents” (see paragraphs 221 and 250 above)."

            [
                "733. The Government did not explain what other options were available for the defence to introduce their expert evidence. The CCrP, as interpreted by the District Court, did not allow the defence to collect written reports by “experts” or “specialists”. The defence lawyers were indeed able to obtain consultations from relevant specialists outside the trial, but this does not suffice to equalise the positions of the prosecution and the defence. Furthermore, in adversarial proceedings evidence must normally be produced directly at the trial."
            ],
            [
                "734. The last option available for the defence was to obtain oral questioning of “specialists” at the trial (see paragraph 411 above). However, it is clear that the status of “specialist” in Russian law is different from that of an “expert”. Although a specialist may “explain to the parties and to the court matters which come within his or her professional competence”, his primary role is to assist the court and the parties in conducting investigative actions which require special skills or knowledge (see paragraph 402 above). In any event, the defence would only be able to rely on oral questioning of the “specialists” at the trial, whereas the prosecution was able to produce written reports prepared beforehand by “experts”. Finally, as transpires from the Meshchanskiy District Court’s reasoning, “specialists” invited by the defence, unlike “experts” for the prosecution, did not have direct access to the original copy of the case file, and the court was not prepared to admit their conclusions based on the copies of materials of the case provided to them by the defence (see paragraph 252 above)."

In the circumstances the Court concludes that the CCrP, as interpreted by the Meshchanskiy District Court, created a disbalance between the defence and the prosecution in the area of collecting and adducing “expert evidence”, thus breaching the equality of arms between the parties. There was, therefore, a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) on that account.",

The applicants were displayed in the iron cage and, as could be seen in the photographs, they were televised and photographed by the media whilst in that iron cage.

The Court notes that in some previous cases concerning the appearance of an accused before a criminal court in a glass or metal cage no violation of the presumption of innocence was found. Thus, in Ashot Harutyunyan, cited above, §§ 138 et seq., which concerned the applicant’s placement in a metal cage akin to that in the case at hand, the Court held, in particular, that “the applicant’s placement in a metal cage [had not made] it impossible for him to communicate confidentially and freely with his lawyers or to communicate freely with the court. ... The applicant [had therefore been] able to defend his case effectively ... “."

In that case the Court examined the applicants’ complaint under Article 6 § 2 in the light of the more general guarantee of a fair trial and put emphasis on the applicant’s ability to enjoy his other procedural rights guaranteed by Article 6 §§ 1 and 3. By contrast, in the case of Titarenko, cited above, §§ 58- 64 and 90-93, a similar complaint was examined by the Court solely under Article 6 § 3."

In the present case the Court has already found that conditions in which the second applicant had been detained throughout the trial had been humiliating (see paragraphs 485 et seq. above). A similar finding in respect of the first applicant was made in the Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) case, §§ 123 et seq. In the Court’s opinion, by holding that such “harsh appearance of judicial proceedings could lead an average observer to believe that an extremely dangerous criminal was on trial” (see paragraph 484 above, with further references) the Court has already addressed the essence of the applicants’ complaint under Article 6 § 2. Other aspects of the “metal cage issue”, namely the question whether such security arrangements encroached on the applicants’ rights under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b) and (c) have already been addressed separately above, in Section VI."

In their opinion, the applicants were convicted for actions which had been regarded as criminal at the moment when they were committed, and the applicants had been well aware of that fact. Russian criminal law was sufficiently clear on the matter; the relevant legislation had been published in the official mass media and was thus available to the applicants or their legal consultants. The Government stressed that the applicants, as businessmen, could have solicited the opinion of the most experienced lawyers. In addition, the first applicant held two university degrees. It was hard to believe that the applicants had never assessed the risks related to their business activities in Russia, including the risks in the sphere of criminal law. The complexity of the tax-avoidance scheme suggested that it had been designed after a careful analysis of the applicable legislation in order to preserve unlawfully obtained money."

Tax evasion, a crime proscribed by Articles 198 and 199 of the Code, was a deliberate act, aimed at the default in payment of taxes and dues in large or very large amounts which led to the partial or complete non-receipt of those taxes and dues by the treasury. There could be different methods of tax evasion. For example, it could occur in the form of a deliberate and knowing indication of false information in the tax declaration or in other documents which the taxpayer must submit to the tax authority in accordance with the law. “Other documents” in this context meant any documents necessary for the calculation of the taxes due. “Deliberate” meant the existence of a direct intent to give false information. “False information” was understood as any incorrect data about the object of the tax (i.e. property, revenue or other operations and status), about the right to tax deductions, credits etc., which could affect the correctness of the calculation of the amount due by the taxpayer. “Indication of the false information” could take the form of the taxpayer’s failure to indicate the true amount of his revenues; artificial minimisation of revenues or increase of deductible costs; falsification of data on the time period when certain revenues were received or losses suffered; distortion of physical characteristics of a particular type of business activity, etc."

The Government further referred to the opinion of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), which noted that tax-evasion schemes were quite widespread and were constantly developing, becoming more and more complex and sophisticated, which called for the enactment of new laws penalising particular types of conduct. Their report on money laundering in 1999-98 mentioned the use of offshore companies as a common tax-evasion technique. The Financial Action Task Force continued to discover new forms of tax evasion every year; however, this could not preclude the States from bringing the persons responsible for tax evasion to criminal liability.

The central question was therefore whether such schemes had been discovered and penalised in any other case before the applicants were brought to trial. The Government asserted that the tax-evasion schemes used by the applicants were “relatively new” and were discovered only in the course of the investigation into the applicants’ case. Thus, the sham companies were registered and functioned on the territories enjoying a special taxation regime. However, the ZATO Act clearly established criteria which permitted companies incorporated and registered in those locations to use that special regime. In order to benefit from tax cuts the companies had to have up to 90 per cent of their fixed assets and 70 per cent of their human resources concentrated in those territories. Seventy per cent of the wage-fund was supposed to be paid to locally-hired employees. The companies which were buying oil from Yukos did not correspond to those requirements; consequently, they obtained tax cuts unlawfully and caused damage to the State. The provisions of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation which applied to the applicants’ case were clear and did not change.

The Meshchanskiy District Court contended that Business Oil’s tax declarations had been knowingly false because Business Oil “had not carried out any actual activity on the territory of the [town of Lesnoy], as a taxpayer entitled to preferential tax treatment”. The actual word used in relation to Business Oil and other trading companies in the criminal judgment was “ podstavnye ” (“sham [legal entities]”). However, that was not a legal term, and was legally undefined. Such a characterisation of trading companies because they were controlled by others, were passive and/or did not own production or transportation assets or the property was without precedent or foundation in Russian law."

Not only was the general use of “letter-box companies” absolute commonplace in the Russian Federation, but the acquisition of Yukos’ principal subsidiary in the auction by means of which the Russian Government enforced the tax liabilities, was by a company having just such characteristics: Baikal Finance Group, a company with no economic presence whatsoever and purely a “letter-box” function, successfully bought Yugansneftegaz for EUR 7 billion."

As from 2 April 1999, the law required that as a condition of any grant of tax preferences Lesnoy registered taxpayers had to have at least 90 per cent of their fixed assets in the region of the ZATO, and at least 70 per cent of their operations and payroll employees permanently resident in the region of the ZATO. The only requirement for eligibility to tax cuts was the literal formal compliance with those conditions. Compliance by Business Oil with the requirements of Article 5 of the ZATO Act (including as amended) had been confirmed by an on-site tax audit conducted from 17 to 29 December 1999 as well as by several desk audits."

The applicants considered that in view of those decisions by the court of cassation, taxpayers could properly have reached the conclusion that they were entitled to tax cuts on the basis of tax agreements entered into in accordance with Article 5 of the ZATO Act literally construed (see the Siblekon judgment by the Eastern Siberian District Commercial Court)"

Then they entered into the consulting agreements with an intermediary company. Those agreements were related to a separate arrangement with a non-Russian end-user, tapping into the applicants’ expertise as regards the conducting of business in the Russian Federation.

It follows that the offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied when the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it or by way of appropriate legal advice, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see Liivik v.

Foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the law concerned, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed.

The Court also reiterates that “the wording of statutes is not always precise. One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. That means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent are vague, and their interpretation and application depend on practice” (see Scoppola (no. 2) [GC], cited above, § 100). Furthermore, in most of the member States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

The company’s “tax optimisation techniques” applied with slight variations throughout 2000-2003 consisted of switching the tax burden from the applicant company and its production and service units to letter-box companies in domestic tax havens in Russia. These companies, with no assets, employees or operations of their own, were nominally owned and managed by third parties, although in reality they were set up and run by the applicant company itself. In essence, the applicant company’s oil-producing subsidiaries sold the extracted oil to the letter-box companies at a fraction of the market price. The letter-box companies, acting in cascade, then sold the oil either abroad, this time at market price or to the applicant company’s refineries and subsequently re-bought it at a reduced price and re-sold it at the market price. Thus, the letter-box companies accumulated most of the applicant company’s profits. Since they were registered in domestic low-tax areas, they enabled the applicant company to pay substantially lower taxes in respect of these profits. Subsequently, the letter-box companies transferred the accumulated profits unilaterally to the applicant company as gifts ...",

This was made clear not only by Article 10 (3) of the Civil Code relied on by the domestic courts in the Tax Assessment proceedings, but also by other relevant and applicable statutory provisions which were available to the applicant company and other taxpayers at the time ....

Belgium (nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 149, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII) it faced a somewhat similar claim by the applicants, who argued that Article 7 guaranteed not only the foreseeability of the punishment, but also the foreseeability of the prosecution. In that case the new law had extended the limitation period and thus prolonged the period of time during which prosecutions could be brought in respect of the offences imputed to the applicants. The Court admitted that the application of the new law “detrimentally affected the applicants’ situation, in particular by frustrating their expectations”, but that it did not “entail an infringement of the rights guaranteed by Article 7, since that provision cannot be interpreted as prohibiting an extension of limitation periods through the immediate application of a procedural law where the relevant offences have never become subject to limitation”."

The applicants may have expected that the authorities would be unable to prosecute them in a criminal court without going first through separate court proceedings, tax or civil. The Court reiterates that it is not persuaded that this was the only possible scenario for their prosecution. In any event, the alleged “procedural obstacles” did not mean that the acts imputed to the applicants were not defined as “criminal offences” at the moment when they were committed. It follows that there was no violation of Article 7 on this account.",

                "791. The Court will now turn to the applicants’ conviction under Article 198 and 199 for the use of various tax-minimisation techniques in respect of both company taxes and personal income taxes. The Court observes that “tax evasion” is defined in Articles 198 and 199 of the Criminal Code in very general terms (see paragraph 429 above). The Code describes tax evasion as “knowing” inclusion of “false data” in the fiscal declarations. By itself such a broad definition does not raise any issue under Article 7 of the Convention. Forms of economic activity are in constant development, and so are the methods of tax evasion. In order to define whether a particular behaviour amounts to “tax evasion” in the criminal-law sense the domestic courts may invoke legal concepts from other areas of law, in particular the tax law. The law in this area may be sufficiently flexible to adapt to new situations, without, however, becoming unpredictable."

The applicants had every reason to believe that those declarations faithfully reflected all the transactions of the trading companies and were thus accurate for the purposes of the ZATO Act. Similarly, the applicants duly reported on the amounts they had been receiving from the Isle of Man companies, in accordance with the Small Business Act. Both acts were formulated very precisely and did not use such concepts as “business purpose”, “sham” or “bad faith”. The Government argued that the then existing case-law developed the concept of “tax evasion” in sufficient detail to make the applicants’ conviction foreseeable."

It observes that the Supreme Court’s Ruling no. 8 of 4 July 1997, referred to by the Government (see paragraph 753 above), explained some of the concepts related to the concept of “tax evasion” and of the constituent elements thereof. However, it did not describe such phenomena as “transfer pricing”, “sham” companies or transactions, which were at the heart of the applicants’ criminal case. The use of “frontman” companies as a method of tax evasion was first mentioned explicitly in the Supreme Court’s Ruling no. 64 of 28 December 2006 (see paragraph 434 above). That Ruling cannot support the Government’s case, because the acts imputed to the applicants related to 1998-2000."

                "794. Other case-law referred to by the Government is, for the most part, irrelevant, since it concerned other forms of tax evasion, such as, for example, the straightforward failure to declare revenues. There were few cases which concerned the use of “front” or “sham” companies, but they were decided in 2002 or even later (see, in particular, the cases of Mironov and Selivanov summarised in paragraph 754 above). The Court is not aware of any other case-law on the matter contemporary to the relevant period of time. Writings of legal scholars referred to by the Government were scarce and inconclusive. The Court concludes that in the criminal law sphere there was no case-law directly applicable to the transfer pricing arrangements and allegedly sham transactions as those in the heart of the applicants’ case."

The Government’s next argument was that the illegal character of such arrangements might have been established with reference to general principles derived from other areas of law, in particular the tax and civil law. This argument is not devoid of merit. The Court observes that the position of the authorities in the tax proceedings against Yukos was centred on the concept of “sham transaction”. The prosecution in the applicants’ case alleged that the applicants were submitting “false” information to the authorities. For many purposes “sham” is a synonym of “false”, so the logic of the State authorities in the two cases was broadly similar. A person cannot enter into a “sham” transaction by inadvertence; it is always a deliberate act. In other words, submitting tax declarations based on sham operations can be construed as “knowingly” submitting “false information” to the tax authorities, a situation falling within the ambit of Articles 198 and 199 of the Criminal Code."

The courts had always the power to apply the “substance-over-form” rule and invalidate a transaction as “sham” under Articles 167 and 170 of the Civil Code (see the case-law in paragraphs 422 et seq.). A similar (albeit not identical) legal construction existed in the Tax Code: for example, in certain situations the Code allowed tax authorities to disregard a contract and calculate taxes due by the parties to it on the basis of imputed “market prices” (see paragraph 414 above). Thus, the “substance-over-form” approach also existed in the field of the tax law. The Court emphasises that such an approach exists in many European countries and that the Court does not see anything unreasonable or unusual in it."

OOO Pribrezhnoe (see paragraph 439 above), analysed in §§ 593-594 of the Yukos judgment. In that case a commercial court refused to recalculate taxes due by a company registered in the low-tax zone despite several factual elements indicative of the “sham” character of the operations of that company. Factual elements relied on by the Tax Service in the Pribrezhnoye case were very close to those relied on by the prosecution in the criminal case against the applicants. The domestic court accepted the documents submitted by the defendant (contracts, lists of personnel, payrolls, bills, etc.) at face value and rejected the prosecution’s arguments about the fictitious character of the impugned operations as unconvincing."

The court found those arguments irrelevant."

The Court notes that the cases of Pribrezhnoye and Energosintez may create an impression that the courts at the time were reluctant to apply the “substance-over-form” approach to transfer pricing arrangements. However, in the Court’s opinion, those cases were mostly decided on the facts. They cannot be construed as negating the power of the courts to invalidate a particular transaction as “sham”. Rather, the courts in those cases found that evidence produced by the Tax Service was insufficient to reach such a conclusion. The fact that in one or two cases the Tax Service failed to produce sufficient evidence and prove the fictitious character of a taxpayer’s operations does not mean that it would fail in all subsequent cases in respect of other taxpayers."

The existence of such an agreement with the ZATO administration is a powerful argument strengthening the presumption that the taxpayer acted bona fide, but it does not give absolute immunity from possible re-characterisation of operations based on that agreement as “sham”."

                "805. The Court acknowledges that there are legitimate methods of tax minimisation: a company may organise its business processes in such a way as to benefit from special tax regimes. However, the tax-minimisation scheme deployed by Yukos was not fully transparent; some of the elements of the scheme were concealed from the authorities. Such behaviour by the taxpayer might have reasonably been construed as amounting to the submission of “false data” to the tax authorities within the meaning of the Criminal Code, which constitutes the actus reus of tax evasion."
            ],
            [
                "806. First, the Court observes that tax minimisation was the sole reason for the creation of the network of the trading companies in Lesnoy. It was not claimed by the applicants, neither in the domestic proceedings nor before this Court, that the trading companies were registered in Lesnoy in order to facilitate logistics, save on production costs, hire qualified staff, etc. As the Court put it in the Yukos case (§ 593), “the arrangement [i.e. the tax minimisation scheme] was obviously aimed at evading the general requirements of the Tax Code, which expected taxpayers to trade at market prices”."

                "807. Second, the Court observes that despite the formal domiciliation of the trading companies in Lesnoy, all business activities which generated profit were in fact carried out in Moscow. The trading companies presented themselves as real companies having assets and personnel in the low-tax zone; however, as was established in the domestic proceedings and later confirmed by the Court in the Yukos case (see § 591), all of the trading companies had virtually no assets or personnel in the ZATO, and had enjoyed no operational independence whatsoever from the Moscow headquarters. Thus, the trading companies claimed tax cuts as if they were really operating in the low-tax zone, but in reality they were merely registered there for form’s sake, and all the operations were conducted in Moscow."

                "808. Third, the Court does not find any proof that the applicants ever informed the tax authorities about their true relation to the trading companies. Quite the contrary: the system of oil sales set by Yukos was deliberately opaque. The trading companies were registered in the names of third persons not formally connected to Yukos or its managers, and had been managed by fictional directors. Benefits of the trading companies were returned to Yukos indirectly, through a special fund which received “gifts” from the trading companies. The fact that the Lesnoy town trading companies were wound up in 2001 following audits by the Tax Service, and that immediately afterwards similar entities were registered in other low-tax zones demonstrates that Yukos was not prepared to defend the lawfulness of the tax optimisation technique in courts. Such a coordinated reorganisation implies that it was done in order to render it more difficult for the authorities to scrutinize the business operations of those companies, to trace their assets and their affiliation with other companies and persons. In sum, by organising its sales in this way the applicants evaded application of the provisions of the Tax Code which permitted recalculation of taxes on the basis of “market prices” in the relations between affiliated companies."

The Court concludes that the applicants’ behaviour cannot be compared to that of a bona fide taxpayer who fails to declare his revenues or submit other relevant information due to some unintended omission or a genuine misinterpretation of the tax law. In the present case, whereas a part of the tax-minimisation scheme was visible to the authorities, the applicants misrepresented or concealed some important aspects of that scheme which arguably might have been crucial for defining eligibility of the trading companies to tax cuts."

The applicants also challenged the finding of the domestic courts to the effect that they (the applicants) had played a leading role in mounting and managing the impugned tax-optimisation scheme. In the opinion of the Court it is difficult to imagine that the applicants, as senior executives and co-owners of Yukos, were not aware of the entire transfer pricing arrangement and did not know that the information included in the fiscal reporting of the trading companies did not reflect the true nature of their operations (see, mutatis mutandis, Soros, cited above, § 59).

Similarly, it is impossible to set an exhaustive list of criteria for defining a particular operation or a company as “sham”. However, the cumulative effect of the elements discussed was sufficient to demonstrate that the operations of the trading companies were likely to be “sham”, that the reporting based thereon did not reflect the realities of the business operations, and that the applicants therefore “knowingly” submitted “false data” in order to reduce the overall tax burden of the company.

Again, this is a question of fact which was disputed in the domestic proceedings. If the “consultancy agreements” between the applicants and the Isle of Man companies were indeed “sham” or “fictitious” – and that was the finding of the domestic courts – one can reasonably consider that the applicants had knowingly submitted false data in their declarations, thus committing an offence under Article 198 of the Criminal Code."

The applicants’ own explanations concerning their relations with the unnamed “end-users” were quite vague. Even though the applicants were allowed to remain silent, the overall picture of their relations with the two Isle of Man companies and/or “end-users” required some explanation, especially in the light of their parallel work as senior executives of Yukos, work for which they received only a symbolic compensation, and in view of other evidence discovered by the prosecution which showed the links between the applicants and the two Isle of Man companies. The provenance of the money paid by the Isle of Man companies under the “service agreements” – an element which the applicant considered as important – in the eyes of the domestic courts was not important for establishing the true purpose of those transfers, and the Court does not see any reason to disagree with this.

Equally, the Court is unable to accept the applicants’ alternative argument, namely that by opting for a licence the applicants simply used a legitimate tax-minimisation technique falling short of tax evasion. The right to choose a particular mode of operation with a view to minimising taxes does not relieve the taxpayer from the obligation to submit true information to the tax authorities. In the domestic proceedings (as well as before this Court) the applicants claimed that they had provided consulting services to various clients, including those not related to Yukos. Apparently, their tax declarations were formulated in similar terms. However, the Russian courts did not accept that assertion, holding that the sums received by the applicants had nothing to do with any consulting services but solely related to their work as senior executives in Yukos. In other words, the applicants did not inform the tax authorities of the true nature of their activities. This was clearly not an unintended or minor omission, or a simple misinterpretation of the tax law.

However, where this is impossible, the convict was sent to serve his sentence in a penal colony situated in the next closest federal constituency. Several regions of Russia (Moscow, St Petersburg and some republics of the Northern Caucasus) have no general-regime penal colonies. In order to avoid prison overcrowding and comply with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention, as interpreted in the Court’s case-law in respect to prison conditions in Russia, convicts from those regions were sent to colonies situated in other regions. For example, convicts from Moscow often served their sentences even further from Moscow than the town of Krasnokamensk, where the first applicant had been sent. According to the Government, Article 73 of the CES “was complied with in the majority of the federal constituencies of the Russian Federation”. In many regions new penal colonies were being built. The applicants were treated in this respect in the same manner as any other convict in a similar situation.

As a direct consequence of his transfer to Krasnokamensk, his family had only been able to make use of the “short” visits on one occasion since 2005. Of course, had the applicant been serving his sentence closer to his family, he would have been able to make far greater use of the facility for short visits. On account of the exhausting and demanding nature of the journey, his young twin sons were unable to visit him in Krasnokamensk at all. The children were able to visit the first applicant whilst he was detained in Moscow. The first applicant’s elderly father had been able to visit him only once. The fact that the first applicant’s family did not use up his full allowance of visits – he had five long visits and only one short visit over 14 months at IK-10 penal colony – clearly suggested that the enormous distance prevented visits taking place."

The Government provided no evidence in support of their assertion that overcrowding in Moscow prisons was such that the applicants could not be sent to a penal colony in the Moscow region. Further, the Government did not challenge the first applicant’s assertion that in September 2005 there had been 149,674 available places in penal colonies in the Russian Federation out of a total capacity of 786,753 places.

Second, the Government did not explain why the risk allegedly posed by the other inmates would be lower in Krasnokamensk or Kharp than in Moscow. In fact, for more than two years the applicants had been held in remand prisons in the city of Moscow, and there had not been a single incident involving them during that time concerning relations with their cellmates.

First, the domestic courts wrongly accepted the arguments of the representatives of the FSIN that that there was no requirement upon them to consider the individual circumstances of the convict. Such a contention was clearly incompatible with Article 8. Second, the domestic courts were similarly wrong in failing to require an explanation as to why it was that the applicants was sent to Krasnokamensk and Kharp, thousands of kilometres from Moscow, despite the fact that there were 149,674 available places in penal colonies in the Russian Federation as at September 2005.

The domestic courts failed to enquire why it was that both applicants had also been sent to a very remote region of the Russian Federation in apparent disregard of the provisions of the law. The fact that both men had been sent thousands of miles from Moscow was strongly suggestive of improper motives on the part of the State authorities.",

The Court reiterates in this respect that any detention which is lawful for the purposes of Article 5 of the Convention (and there is no doubt that the applicants’ detention following their conviction complied with Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention) entails by its nature various limitations on private and family life (see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, § 98, Series A, no. 161). It would be fundamentally wrong to analyse each and every case of detention following conviction from the standpoint of Article 8, and to consider the “lawfulness” and “proportionality” of the prison sentence as such."

Poland, no. 26761/95, 12 November 2002). The Court will not turn a blind eye to such limitations which go beyond what would normally be accepted in the case of an ordinary detainee. Thus, for example, it is an essential part of a prisoner’s right to respect for family life that the prison authorities assist him in maintaining contact with his close family (see Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, § 61, ECHR 2000-X). Limitations on contacts with other prisoners and with family members, imposed by prison rules, have been regarded by the Court as an “interference” with the rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention (see Van der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, § 69, ECHR 2003-II)."

Thus, placing a convict in a particular prison may potentially raise an issue under Article 8 if its effects for the applicant’s private and family life go beyond “normal” hardships and restrictions inherent to the very concept of imprisonment. As the Commission already observed in Wakefield v. the United Kingdom (no. 15817/89, decision of 1 October 1990, DR 66, p. 251): “Article 8 requires the State to assist prisoners as far as possible to create and sustain ties with people outside prison in order to promote prisoners’ social rehabilitation. In this context the location of the place where a prisoner is detained is relevant”. Furthermore, the right to respect for family life imposes upon states a positive obligation to assist prisoners in maintaining effective contact with their close family members (see X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 9054/80, Commission decision of 8 October 1982, DR 30, p. 115). In the context of imprisonment the Commission recognised that the possibility for close family members to visit a detainee constitutes an essential factor in the maintenance of family life (see Hacisuleymanoglou v. Italy no. 23241/94, decision of 20 October 1994, DR no. 79-B, p. 121)."

In the present case the distances involved were much longer than those in Wakefield. Given the geographical situation of the colonies concerned, and the realities of the Russian transport system the Court has no difficulty in accepting that a trip from Moscow to the Krasnokamensk colony or the Kharp colony was a long and exhaustive endeavour, especially for the applicants’ young children. Indeed, it was not the applicants themselves but the members of their respective families who suffered from the remoteness of the colonies. Still, the applicants were affected by this measure, albeit indirectly, because they probably received fewer visits than they would have received had they been located closer to Moscow.

The Court is aware that the FSIN was the main regulatory body in the penitentiary system and, as such, was competent to decide matters related to transferrals of detainees. In such circumstances, the Court does not consider it necessary to review the findings of the Russian courts as to the lawfulness of the measure complained of.

Furthermore, it is evident that the exception to the “geographical rule” applied to the applicants was aimed at combating prison overcrowding in certain regions. Those aims (guaranteeing safety of the convict and avoiding general overcrowding) are, in the opinion of the Court, “legitimate” under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention since they contribute to preventing “disorder and crime” and securing the “rights and freedoms” of others.

Furthermore, the Court cannot accept the general assumption that inmates in the Kharp or Krasnokamensk colonies were less dangerous for the applicants since these other inmates did not know who the applicants were: the applicants’ trial was the most mediatised trial of the recent decade and the first applicant’s wealth was well-known from many sources open to the general public. Finally, the Government’s assertion that unnamed “victims” of the applicants’ crimes would try to take vengeance on them did not have any factual basis - the principal victim of the crimes imputed to the applicants was the State itself.

It appears that in order to address that problem the FSIN came up with a general plan establishing quotas for the distribution of convicts amongst penitentiary colonies in different Russian regions (“federal constituencies”). The Government submitted to the Court a copy of that plan. However, the Government did not explain how that plan was prepared, and did not describe a method or algorithm of distribution of convicts used by the FSIN to draw that plan.

Data referred to by the applicants and not contested by the Government suggested that at the time when the applicants were sent to Siberia and the Far North there were free places in the Russian penitentiary system, including in colonies situated in Central Russia (see paragraphs 328 and 347 above). Over thirty-five regions in Russia are closer to Moscow than the Yamalo-Nenetskiy region, and over fifty-five regions are closer than the Chita region. Therefore, it was likely that the FSIN plan did not adhere strictly to the “geographical rule” fixed in Article 73.

There are other arguments speaking in favour of giving the authorities a large margin of appreciation in this sphere. However, that margin of appreciation is not unlimited. The distribution of the prison population must not remain entirely at the discretion of the administrative bodies, such as FSIN. The interests of the convicts in maintaining at least some family and social ties must somehow be taken into account. The Russian law is based on a similar assumption, as the spirit and the goal of Article 73 of the CES was to preserve the applicants’ social and family ties to the place where they used to live before the conviction. However, practical implementation of that law in Russia could lead to a disproportionate result, as the applicants’ case demonstrates. In absence of a clear and foreseeable method of distribution of convicts amongst penal colonies, the system failed to “provide a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities” (see Telegraaf Nederland Landelijke Media B.V. and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 39315/06, § 90, 22 November 2012).

As a general rule, tax claims concerning unpaid corporate taxes are brought against the corporate taxpayer. However, there are a few exceptions from this rule. Thus, if at the moment when the claim is introduced, the corporate entity still exists but it does not have sufficient assets to satisfy the claim, this triggers the subsidiary liability of the person who was responsible for the tax debt.

Thus in the I. and K. case the Russian Supreme Court stated that there was no legal justification for upholding a civil claim filed by the tax authorities for the evasion of taxes that were not paid by a joint-stock company implicated in a criminal case to the private individuals convicted in the relevant case.

But as a company’s head or chief accountant, an individual cannot incur tax liability for the company, because the latter, being a separate object of taxation, has its own collection of rights and responsibilities as a taxpayer, particularly as the payer of tax on legal entities or companies, including tax on profit (income), VAT, transactions with securities, tax on profit from stock exchange and insurance operations. Therefore, in this example the company/taxpayer itself must be regarded as the civil respondent in respect of the unpaid taxes and duties. In granting the civil claim submitted by the prosecutor, the court actually shifted the obligation to pay tax arrears to the wrong taxpayer. Granting a civil claim for the collection of tax in a criminal case instigated on the indications specified under Article 199 of the Criminal Code (company tax evasion), from the personal funds of a private individual convicted under this article, has no basis in law”."

The provisions of the new Code had not altered the basis for the Supreme Court’s findings. In any event, it was impossible to understand how, even if the new Criminal Procedure Code were relevant, it could, consistent with the principle of fair balance, have retrospective effect."

As to the second of the issues, namely the possibility for “double recovery” of the same amounts of unpaid taxes from a company and its top-executive, the first applicant claimed that the Government had not addressed this question. In the applicant’s view, the civil damages award was manifestly arbitrary as: (a) the alleged tax arrears had already been collected from Yukos; (b) the promissory notes had all been redeemed in full and there was therefore no loss to the state. Subsequent domestic decisions in related cases had concluded that the promissory notes were redeemed in full: see the judgments of the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in the Ivannikov case and the judgment of the Miass City Court of Chelyabinsk Oblast in the Lubenets case."

The amounts recovered from him by virtue of the judgment of 16 May 2005 were the same as the amounts recovered from the companies affiliated with the first applicant - in particular, Yukos. The Meshchanskiy District Court ordered the first applicant to pay the Federal Tax Service RUB 17,395,449,282 in relation to the latter’s claim for damages arising from the alleged non-payment of taxes by the ZATO trading companies. The total award for damages related to the crime committed under Article 199 of the Criminal Code comprised: (a) damages related to the tax evasion for 1999 in the amount of RUB 5,447,501,388; and (b) damages relating to the alleged tax evasion for 2000 in the amount of RUB 11,947,947,894. On appeal, the Moscow City Court excluded from the total amount of unpaid taxes for 1999 and 2000 the amount of taxes which were paid by the four trading companies in promissory notes. The basis of the Moscow City Court’s decision on this point was that even if one assumed that payment of tax by the Lesnoy companies by using promissory notes had been unlawful in 1999 and 2000, by the time that the first applicant’s case came to trial the wording of Article 199 of the Criminal Code had been amended so as to exclude the possibility of his being convicted under that (or any other) provision of the Criminal Code in respect of such conduct, and the applicant was therefore entitled to invoke the benefit of that change. As a result, the total amount of unpaid taxes was reduced by the Moscow City Court to RUB 1,217,622,799 for 1999 and to RUB 1,566,046,683 for 2000. Despite this change, the court of appeal refused to reduce the amount of the civil claim."

Further, according to the Court’s well-established case-law, an instance of interference, including one resulting from a measure to secure payment of taxes, must strike a “fair balance” between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. The States, when framing and implementing policies in the area of taxation, enjoys a wide margin of appreciation, since decisions in this area will commonly involve the appreciation of political, economic and social questions which the Convention leaves within the competence of the States parties. The second paragraph of Article 1 explicitly reserves the right of Contracting States to enact such laws as they may deem necessary to secure the payment of taxes. In the case of Gasus Dosier- und Fördertechnik GmbH v. the Netherlands (23 February 1995, § 59, Series A no. 306 ‑ B), the Court stated that “the importance which the drafters of the Convention attached to this aspect of the second paragraph of Article 1 may be gauged from the fact that at a stage when the proposed text did not contain such explicit reference to taxes, it was already understood to reserve the States’ power to pass whatever fiscal laws they considered desirable, provided always that measures in this field did not amount to arbitrary confiscation (see Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, Rapporteur of the Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, Second Session of the Consultative Assembly, Sixteenth Sitting (25 August 1950), Collected Edition of the Travaux préparatoires, vol. VI, p. 140, commenting on the text of the proposed Article 10A, ibid., p. 68)”. The power of appreciation of the States parties in such matters is therefore a wide one (see Gasus Dosier- und Fördertechnik GmbH, cited above, § 60; see also Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, § 69, Series A no. 52; National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society, 23 October 1997, § 80, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VII; and M.A. and 34 Others v.

The Government claimed, referring to Ferrazzini, cited above, that the recovery of unpaid company taxes from the first applicant cannot be analysed in terms of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 since it was not an “interference” with the applicant’s rights guaranteed by this provision. The Court considers, however, that the Government’s reading of Ferrazzini is misconceived. The question for the Court in the present case is not to define whether the “tax proceedings” are “civil proceedings” for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, but to define whether Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is applicable to the court order recovering a certain amount of unpaid taxes from a taxpayer. Even if tax proceedings are not civil (cf. Yukos judgment, §§ 527 and 528), a pecuniary award made against a taxpayer within such proceedings may still constitute an “interference” with his possessions. As the Court held in Burden, cited above, “taxation is in principle an interference with the right guaranteed by the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, since it deprives the person concerned of a possession, namely the amount of money which must be paid” (§ 59). The fact that the State enjoys a large margin of appreciation in this sphere does not affect that conclusion."

The Government further argued that the amount of unpaid taxes did not constitute the applicant’s “possessions” in the Convention meaning since the applicant withheld it unlawfully. The Court cannot agree with that argument either. The parties disagreed on the meaning of the applicable legal provisions, eligibility of the first applicant and trading companies to tax cuts, and, consequently, on the exact amount of taxes due. Eventually, the courts ruled in favour of the authorities and concluded that Yukos and the first applicant had an outstanding tax debt, but that fact alone cannot remove from the amounts recovered from Yukos and/or from the first applicant the protection guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, “Bulves” AD v.

Thus, he claimed that, as a matter of principle, Russian law did not provide for the recovery of unpaid company taxes from the managers of that company who had been found guilty of tax evasion under Article 199. In his submissions, only a company which had failed to pay taxes might be a defendant in such circumstances. The interference at issue, therefore, did not have a lawful basis.

The phrase “subject to the conditions provided for by law” requires in the first place the existence of and compliance with adequately accessible and sufficiently precise domestic legal provisions (see the Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 July 1986, § 110, Series A no. 102). The Court’s power to review compliance with domestic law is limited (see, inter alia, the Fredin v.

First, it is questionnable whether the Meshchanskiy District Court had the power to grant the claims of the Tax Service against the applicant while the corporate taxpayer still existed (see paragraph 350 above; see also paragraph 18 above). Second, Article 56 of the Civil Code provides for subsidiary liability of managers of the insolvent company, whereas the judgment of the Meshchanskiy District Court seemed to order the recovery of the outstanding amount of company taxes from both applicants on the solidarity basis with the company.

The Court notes that the underlying rules of civil, tax and criminal liability, applied in the case of I. and K., were the same as in the applicants’ case.

There was now a clear global consensus, including judgments from the highest courts in Switzerland and Cyprus, that the applicants’ prosecution was politically motivated. Finally, the Court’s approach to Article 18 in Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) was inconsistent with the Convention case-law. The travaux préparatoires for Article 18 indicated that the drafters of this provision were concerned to ensure thereby that an individual was protected from the imposition of restrictions arising from a desire of the State to protect itself according “to the political tendency which it represents” and the desire of the State to act “against an opposition which it considers dangerous”."

That assumption is rebuttable in theory, but it is difficult to overcome in practice: the applicant alleging that his rights and freedoms were limited for an improper reason must convincingly show that the real aim of the authorities was not the same as that proclaimed (or as can be reasonably inferred from the context). Thus, the Court has to apply a very exacting standard of proof to such allegations. The Court was satisfied that such standard was met only in few cases, such as Gusinskiy v. Russia (no. 70276/01, § 73–78, ECHR 2004); Cebotari v. Moldova (no. 35615/06, §§ 46 et seq., 13 November 2007); or Lutsenko v.

It considers that even where the appearances speak in favour of the applicant’s claim of improper motives, the burden of proof must remain with him or her. It confirms its position in Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) that the applicant alleging bad faith of the authorities must “convincingly show” that their actions were driven by improper motives. Thus, the standard of proof in such cases is high. Otherwise the Court would have to find violations in every high-profile case where the applicant’s status, wealth, reputation, etc. gives rise to a suspicion that the driving force behind his or her prosecution was improper. Such prosecutions as those, for example, at the heart of the case of Streletz, Kessler and Krenz, cited above, would then become impossible. This is definitely not the result which the drafters of that provision sought to achieve. The Court reiterates its dictum in Khodorkovskiy (no. 1) that “high political status does not grant immunity.”"

Indeed, in some cases applicants have been successful in convincing the Court that a particular action of the authorities (such as arrest or detention, for instance) was driven by improper motives. Examples of such situations can be found in Khodorskovkiy (no.1), § 142, and in Gusinskiy, cited above, §§ 76-77 (see also the Court’s findings under Article 34 of the Convention below). In Lutsenko, also cited above, § 108, the Court held as follows:",
                "“The circumstances of the present case suggest ... that the applicant’s arrest and detention, which were ordered after the investigation against the applicant had been completed, had their own distinguishable features which allow the Court to look into the matter separately from the more general context of politically motivated prosecution of the opposition leader. In the present case, the Court has already established that the grounds advanced by the authorities for the deprivation of the applicant’s liberty were not only incompatible with the requirements of Article 5 § 1 but were also against the spirit of the Convention ...”"

[had been] ab initio misused, that from the beginning to the end the authorities [had been] acting with bad faith and in blatant disregard of the Convention” ( Khodorkovskiy (no. 1), § 260). In essence, the applicants tried to persuade the Court that everything in their case was contrary to the Convention, and that their conviction was therefore invalid. That allegation is a very serious one; it assails the general presumption of good faith on the part of the public authorities and consequently requires particularly weighty evidence in support."

On the other hand, the Court cannot agree with the applicants’ sweeping claim that their whole case was a travesty of justice. In the final reckoning, none of the accusations against them concerned their political activities stricto sensu, even remotely. The applicants were not opposition leaders or public officials. The acts imputed to them were not related to their participation in the political life, real or imaginary – they were prosecuted for common criminal offences, such as tax evasion, fraud, etc."

However, it is insufficient to conclude that the applicants would not have been convicted otherwise. Elements of “improper motivation” which may exist in the present case do not make the applicants’ prosecution illegitimate “from the beginning to the end”: the fact remains that the accusations against the applicants were serious, that the case against them had a “healthy core”, and that even if there was a mixed intent behind their prosecution, this did not grant them immunity from answering the accusations. Having said that, the Court observes that the present case, which concerned the events of 2003-2005, does not cover everything which has happened to the applicants ever since, in particular their second trial."

Article 53 of the CCrP provided that an advocate must be formally admitted to act in the proceedings by the official in charge of the case. Although Ms Mikhaylova had the status of an advocate, she was not on the list of lawyers admitted to participate in that particular criminal case. As a result, she was not allowed to see the applicant in the capacity of his advocate. She could have visited him in her private capacity, but she failed to obtain written permission for such a visit from the investigator. The Russian law distinguishes between the notions of “defence counsel” ( защитник ) and “advocate” ( адвокат, i.e. a barrister). In order to become a “defence counsel” the advocate must have been admitted to participate in the case in this capacity. Ms Mikhaylova was an “advocate”, but she had not obtained authorisation to participate in the case as the applicant’s “counsel”.

                "92. The Court considers it important to take into account when dealing with the present case that the case seems, from the observations of the parties and the accompanying documentation, to have been the first of its kind brought before the Supreme Court on appeal due to the in absentia imposition by a District Court of fines under the CPA on defence counsel who had resigned from their positions in disregard of the orders of the trial court. In this regard the Court recalls its case-law to the effect that where the domestic courts are called upon to interpret a provision of criminal law to a particular set of facts for the first time, an interpretation of the scope of the offence which is consistent with the essence of the offence must, as a rule, be considered foreseeable ( Jorgic v. Germany, no. 74613/01, § 109, ECHR 2007-III)."
            ],
            [
                "94. As to the applicants ’ second argument concerning the lack of a specific stipulation of the maximum amount of fines under domestic law, the Court notes at the outset that Section 223 of the CPA clearly provided, as such, for the imposition of fines on defence counsel for the acts described in the provision. Moreover, the Court recalls its consistent case-law to the effect that Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see paragraph 89 above). It follows that the mere fact that a provision of domestic law does not stipulate the maximum amount which may be imposed in the form of a fine does not, as such, run counter to the requirements of Article 7 of the Convention. Moreover, although it is undisputed that the fines imposed on the applicants were substantially higher than previously imposed fines under Section 223, the Court recalls that it is also clear from the observations of the parties, as described above, that the present case was the first of its kind and one in which the Supreme Court considered that the nature and gravity of the applicants ’ actions warranted the imposition of fines which were higher than imposed in other prior cases with different facts. Therefore, the Court finds that, in the light of the conclusions of the Supreme Court, the amount of the fines in question was consistent with the essence of the offence and could have been reasonably foreseen by the applicants."

Their decision not to attend the trial in spite of the District Court rejecting their request to relieve them of their duties as defence counsel was not in accordance with the law or in the interest of their clients or the other defendants.

According to general rules the defendants in question must then be provided with the opportunity to defend themselves. Such a case was not instigated. On the other hand it was, as previously stated, also possible for the judge in the criminal case, of his own accord, to impose fines in accordance with the first sentence of [ Section 222 (1) ]. Under those circumstances a special claim on behalf of the prosecution was not required. There are no grounds to hold that [the applicants] should have enjoyed lesser protection under the law, depending on which of the above - mentioned options were chosen when assessing whether they should be subject to the imposition of fines, which amounted to penalties, cf. Article 70 of the Icelandic Constitution and Article 6 (1) and (3) of [ the Convention ], cf. Act No. 62/1994.",

However, this was not done. Instead [the applicants] were relieved of their duties at the hearing on 11 April 2013 and a decision to impose fines on them was taken in the judgment delivered on 12 December 2013.",

That was done at the request of [the applicants] who, according to law, had the right to have the fines imposed on them by the District Court reviewed by a higher court following an oral hearing. [The applicants ’ ] right to defend themselves on appeal is therefore not subject to any limitations by law and they were provided with the opportunity to raise any views in the oral hearing of the case, and as appropriate by giving statements themselves and presenting witnesses, cf. Article 205 (3) of [ the CPA ], or by instigating special witness proceedings, cf. Article 141 (1) of the same Act. In the light of this, the applicants ’ rights have not been impaired due to the lack of an oral hearing by the District Court before the decision was taken to impose fines on them. Accordingly, the procedure which has taken place is in accordance with the law and does not violate their rights to a fair trial under Article 70 (1) of the Icelandic Constitution and Article 6 (1) and (3) of [the Convention], cf. Act No. 62/1994. For reference see the judgment of [the Court] in the case of Weber v. Switzerland from 22 May 1990 and the judgment in the case of T v. Austria from 14 November 2000.

The requirement of fairness in Article 6 of the Convention had been interpreted to mean that it covered the proceedings as a whole, and as a result flaws at one level might be put right at a later stage. Article 6 of the Convention did not require an appeal court to order a retrial at first instance if new evidence were submitted on appeal and the right to retrial was not, as such, included among the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention.

A defendant could appeal against a judgment in order to obtain a revision of the District Court ’ s assessment of points of law and re-evaluation of evidence. The only limitation on the Supreme Court ’ s review had been that it could not re-evaluate the evidentiary value of oral statements made before the District Court.

As to the application of Article 6 of the Convention in the present case, the Court notes that the applicants were each fined approximately EUR 6,200 under Section 223(1) (a) and (d) of the CPA for offending the court and causing unnecessary delay in the case by not attending the trial and thereby damaging their clients’ and the other defendants’ interests. In assessing whether or not there was a “criminal charge”, the Court uses three criteria, commonly known as the “Engel criteria”. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Sergey Zolotukhin v Russia, [GC], no. 14939/03, § 53, ECHR 2009 ). The Court has in a number of cases reached the conclusion that fines for contempt of a court in the context of processing of cases before domestic courts did not amount a “criminal charge” (see, for example, Ravnsborg v. Sweden, 23 March 1994, §§ 30-36, Series A no. 283 ‑ B; Putz v Austria, 22 February 1996, § 33, Reports 1996 ‑ I; Schreiber and Boetsch v. France ( dec. ), no. 58751/00, ECHR 2003 ‑ XII; Toyaksi and Others v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 43569/08, 20 October 2010; Zugic v. Croatia, no. 3699/08, 31 May 2011, §§ 63-71). The fact that a fine imposed is significant does not in itself imply that an offence can be qualified as a “criminal offence” (see Brown v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 38644/97, 24 November 1998). However, in a case where a short prison sentence was imposed for contempt of court, the Court has reached the conclusion that the offence amounted to a “criminal offence” (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 64, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII; Zaicevs v. Latvia, no. 65022/01, §§ 31-36, 31 July 2007). Likewise, in a case where a substantial fine was imposed and the applicant risked imprisonment in default without a guarantee of a hearing, the Court also concluded that the offence amounted to a “criminal offence” (see T. v. Austria, cited above, §§ 61-67). Turning to the present case, the Court notes that the Criminal Procedures Act sets out the rules on the imposition of fines and no maximum amount for court fines is stipulated in the Act. The Court also notes that the fines imposed were substantial. Furthermore, the Supreme Court concluded that the fine imposed on the applicants had amounted to a criminal penalty (see paragraph 27 above). This finding by the Supreme Court was not disputed between the parties, who agreed that the fines imposed amounted to a “criminal offence”. Therefore, and in particular having regard to the first Engel criterion, the legal classification of the offence under national law, the Court sees no reason to disagree with the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the applicants’ offence should be considered to have been based on a “criminal charge” within the meaning of the criminal limb of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which is therefore applicable in the present case."

Albania, no. 26866/05, § 67, 10 May 2011). The Court considers that the same applies to the applicants ’ complaint based on Article 6 § 2 of the Convention (see paragraphs 43 and 46 above) as it, in substance, is also directed at the lack of fairness encompassed by their conviction in absentia by the District Court and the subsequent alleged failure by the Supreme Court to remedy the procedural flaws at first instance.

It is undisputed, as also stated by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 28 above), that they were neither summoned to appear before the District Court nor made aware of the District Court ’ s intention to impose fines on them on the basis of the CPA.

Before proceeding with its examination, the Court finally considers it necessary to observe that in the judgment in De Cubber v Belgium (cited above, § 33), relied on by the applicants (see paragraph 41 above), the Court found that a fundamental defect involving the actual composition of the national court, a matter relating to the internal organisation of the judicial system, was such that the court of appeal was not in a position to cure such a defect in the proceedings on appeal.

It follows from these principles that an offence must be clearly defined in the law, be it national or international. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see Vasiliauskas v.

As regards the amount of the fines, the court acknowledged that the law did not stipulate a maximum amount for court fines and that the fines imposed on the applicants had been high, and therefore concluded that the fines had been penalties in the light of Article 6 of the Convention (see paragraph 27 above )."

In this regard the Court recalls its case-law to the effect that where the domestic courts are called upon to interpret a provision of criminal law to a particular set of facts for the first time, an interpretation of the scope of the offence which is consistent with the essence of the offence must, as a rule, be considered foreseeable ( Jorgic v.

As regards the applicants ’ argument concerning the interpretation of Section 223 of the CPA, the Court considers it sufficient to note that it does indeed provide a basis for imposing fines on “defence counsel” for particular acts. Although it would be the normal sequence of events that a defence counsel would be performing his or her function at the point in time when the fine would be imposed, the wording of the provision does not exclude the imposition of a fine on a defence counsel who has been replaced, resigned or been relieved of his or her duties. Hence, the Court does not consider that the interpretation given to the provision by the national courts contravened the very essence of the offence in question. Therefore, and taking account of the wording of the provision in question (Section 223 (1) (a) and (b) of the CPA), the Court does not find there to be adequate grounds to call into question the Supreme Court ’ s finding that the provisions in question constituted an adequate legal basis for the imposition of the fines. It follows that the Court does not accept the applicants ’ claim that the provisions, as applied by the Supreme Court to the particular facts of the case which were elaborated in detail in the judgment of the court, lacked foreseeability within the meaning of Article 7 of the Convention. In this light, the lack of an explicit answer in the Supreme Court ’ s judgment to the applicants ’ arguments based on the principle of legality in criminal cases does not suffice for the Court to come to a different conclusion."

As to the applicants ’ second argument concerning the lack of a specific stipulation of the maximum amount of fines under domestic law, the Court notes at the outset that Section 223 of the CPA clearly provided, as such, for the imposition of fines on defence counsel for the acts described in the provision. Moreover, the Court recalls its consistent case-law to the effect that Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see paragraph 89 above). It follows that the mere fact that a provision of domestic law does not stipulate the maximum amount which may be imposed in the form of a fine does not, as such, run counter to the requirements of Article 7 of the Convention. Moreover, although it is undisputed that the fines imposed on the applicants were substantially higher than previously imposed fines under Section 223, the Court recalls that it is also clear from the observations of the parties, as described above, that the present case was the first of its kind and one in which the Supreme Court considered that the nature and gravity of the applicants ’ actions warranted the imposition of fines which were higher than imposed in other prior cases with different facts.

Furthermore, after the accused was reported as having committed the administrative offence, he de - registered his domicile in Zagreb – in this authority ’ s view – merely to avoid liability for the offence. At the time of the commission of the offence the accused did not satisfy the conditions for temporary importation with total relief and [was thus not entitled to] operate a vehicle with foreign licence plates.

However, having [health] insurance is itself not relevant for the adoption of a different decision because the fact of [possessing] insurance, which according to the accused ’ s own statement is voluntary, does not give [him] the right to temporary admission of the vehicle in question with total relief.",
                "On the basis of these findings of fact, and in accordance with the foregoing provisions, this authority has established beyond doubt that the accused did not satisfy the conditions for temporary admission, and that, by handling the vehicle in question contrary to [those] conditions, he committed the administrative offence defined in section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act.",

After examining that evidence, this authority considers that it was obtained with a view to proving that the accused had rented accommodation to live in abroad.",

The accused could not pose in Croatia as a person having domicile abroad and enjoy the rights of [such] a person in [his own] country, where until 17 June 2008 he had his domicile.

Since that conduct was contrary to the conditions for temporary admission of goods set forth in the Customs Act and the [Istanbul] Convention, he committed the administrative offence defined in section 210(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act.",

However, once established, domicile is not lost by the mere loss of one of its constituent elements. For example, a person who is (temporarily) absent from the town where he or she has established his or her domicile will not lose that status if he or she wishes to live there permanently, that is, as long as he or she intends to return to it. Likewise, a person who has established his or her domicile in a particular town but no longer intends to (permanently) live there will not lose his or her domicile in that town while he or she still lives there, that is, as long as he or she does not actually move elsewhere."

Yet, he had been convicted of the customs-related administrative offence specified in section 241( 1 ) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act (see paragraphs 22-23 and 29 above).

The Government further explained that temporary admission as provided for in Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention (see paragraph 45 above), that is, the privilege of not having to pay customs duties, applied only to those who temporarily brought a car into the State for their personal use, while having their domicile or seat in a State different from the State into which the car was being brought and having the car registered in that State. Furthermore, section 241( 1 ) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act prescribed that treating goods which did not meet the conditions for temporary admission set forth in the Istanbul Convention as if they did was an administrative offence punishable by a fine (see paragraph 29 above). Given that at the time of the commission of the offence, that is, when the applicant had entered Croatia in his car with foreign licence plates without paying the relevant taxes, he had been a Croatian citizen and had his domicile in Croatia (see paragraph 6 above), he had not satisfied the conditions for temporary admission set forth in Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention. By the same token, his failure to pay the taxes due on the importation of his car had also made him liable for the administrative offence specified in section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act (see paragraph 29 above) of which he had eventually been convicted."

In particular, the applicant ’ s statement that he had entered Croatia with the intention of de - registering his domicile was (see paragraph 8 above), in the Government ’ s view, crucial evidence that he had known that having his domicile in Croatia made him ineligible for temporary admission and that by bringing his car to Croatia he had breached customs regulations. In fact, the Government argued, the applicant had never had the intention of de - registering his domicile. Rather, his real intention had been to continue living in Croatia, where he had accommodation and where his family lived, and to go only occasionally to the Czech Republic. He had de - registered his domicile in Croatia only to avoid paying the customs debt and escape liability for it. Thus, even though he had allegedly entered Croatia in order to de - register his domicile, he had not done so until 17 June 2008 (see paragraph 10 above), that is, six days after entering (see paragraph 8 above), and one day after the police had impounded his vehicle and the customs proceedings against him had commenced (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above).

In order to determine whether Article 7 is applicable, the Court has to determine whether the offence for which the applicant was fined was “criminal” within the meaning of that Article. In so doing the Court will have regard to the three alternative criteria laid down in the Engel case (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 82, Series A no. 22, and Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, §§ 30-31, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIV ): (a) the classification of the offence under the domestic law, (b) the nature of the offence, and (c) the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The first criterion is of relative weight and serves only as a starting-point. If domestic law classifies an offence as criminal, then this will be decisive. Otherwise the Court will look behind the national classification and examine the offence in the light of the second and/or third criteria. Even though these criteria were initially developed for the purposes of determining the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention under its “criminal head”, they are equally pertinent to the issue of the applicability of Article 7 (see Nadtochiy, cited above, § 32)."

As to the legal classification of the offence under the domestic law, the Court notes that the behaviour for which the fine was imposed on the applicant is formally classified as an administrative rather than a criminal offence under Croatian law. This follows from the fact that the fine imposed on the applicant was based on section 241(1) of the Customs Act (see paragraph 29 above) and not on provisions of the Criminal Code; that such a fine is not entered in a person ’ s criminal record; and that its amount does not depend on income, as in criminal law.

What is more, the fine imposed on the applicant was punitive in nature as it was not intended to serve as pecuniary compensation for unpaid customs duties but as a penalty to deter reoffending. The Court finds these elements sufficient for a conclusion that the purported customs-related administrative offence was of a criminal character and thus attracted the guarantees of Article 7 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Nadtochiy, cited above, §§ 21-22, and Jussila, cited above, § 38)."

                "“153. ... the guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment ( ... ).",
                "154. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows from these principles that an offence must be clearly defined in the law, be it national or international. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. The Court has thus indicated that when speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability ( ... ).",
                "155. The Court reiterates that however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial interpretation is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen ( ... ). ”"

The Court further reiterates that its task is not to review the relevant law and practice in abstracto, but to determine whether the manner in which they were applied to, or affected, the applicant gave rise to a violation of the Convention (see, for example, Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others v. Austria, no. 40825/98, § 90, 31 July 2008 ). In this connection it refers to the view of the former Commission, best summarised in the case of J.J.M. v. the United Kingdom (no. 4681/ 70, Commission decision of 3 October 1972, Collection 43, p. 1; see also X. v.

Under Article 7 the application of the provision of municipal penal law to an act not covered by the provision in question directly results in a conflict with the Convention, so that the Commission can and must take cognisance of allegations of such false interpretation of municipal law. The Commission ’ s supervisory function, therefore, consists in making sure that, at the moment when the accused person performed the act which led to his being prosecuted, there was in force a legal provision which made that act punishable and that the punishment imposed does not exceed the limits fixed by that provision. ... [T]his supervisory function further consists in considering whether the national court, in reaching its decision, has not unreasonably interpreted, and applied to the applicant, the municipal law concerned.”"

                "92. This view was reaffirmed by the Court in the case of Kononov v. Latvia, where it held that while it was primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation, so that the Court ’ s role was confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation were compatible with the Convention, the position was different and the Court ’ s powers of review greater when it was not the domestic legislation but the Convention itself, in particular Article 7, which expressly referred to the domestic law, that is, required that there should be a legal basis for a conviction and sentence. In such cases, a failure to comply with the domestic legislation could in itself entail a violation of the Convention. Accordingly, in such circumstances the Court had to have jurisdiction to decide whether the relevant provision of criminal law had been complied with as its application to an act not covered by that provision would directly result in a conflict with Article 7 of the Convention. In the Court ’ s view, to accord it a lesser power of review would render Article 7 devoid of purpose. The Court also held that the same principle applied to situations where the domestic courts had applied international law (see Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, § 198, ECHR 2010, with further reference to Kononov v. Latvia, no. 36376/04, § 110, 24 July 2008, that is, to the Chamber judgment in the same case).",

In the light of the above principles concerning the scope of its supervision, the Court considers that its task in the present case is to examine whether the relevant law was foreseeable, that is, whether the applicant ’ s act, at the time when it was committed, constituted an administrative offence defined with sufficient precision by domestic and/or international law (see, mutatis mutandis, Korbely, cited above, § 73 ) to be able to guide the applicant ’ s behaviour and prevent arbitrariness. In so doing the Court must ascertain whether the applicant could have known from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the domestic authorities ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts or omissions would make him liable for the offence (see, mutatis mutandis, Vasiliauskas, cited above, § 154 ).

Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 143, ECHR 2012 ), the Court must also ascertain whether the relevant law was sufficiently clear to provide, in accordance with the object and purpose of Article 7 of the Convention, effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment (see Vasiliauskas, cited above, § 153)."

In this regard, it is first to be noted that the term “persons resident” appears twice in the text of Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention and that in the Croatian version of that Convention, published in the Official Gazette – International Agreements, the same term is translated on its first occurrence as “ osobe s prebivalištem ” (“persons having domicile”) and on its second occurrence as “ osobe koje žive ” (“persons living” or “persons who live”) (see paragraphs 45-46 above). This inconsistency in translation indeed makes the meaning of the term in question ambiguous as it could mean either domicile or residence, it being understood that those terms legally do not have the same meaning not only under Croatian law (see paragraphs 31-32 above ) but also in a number of countries (see the relevant Council of Europe instrument in paragraph 60 above). This ambiguity is further compounded by the fact that, from a strictly linguistic point of view, the more accurate translation into Croatian of the English term “persons resident” or the French term “ personnes résidant ” appearing in the original versions of the Istanbul Convention is “ osobe s boravištem ” ( “ persons having residence ” ) rather than “ osobe s prebivalištem ” ( “ persons having domicile ” ). Croatian versions or translations of international or European law instruments that refer to the same or similar terms do not provide any assistance in this matter (see paragraphs 59 and 6 1 above). Therefore, in the Court ’ s view, the wording of the relevant provision, and particularly its official translation into Croatian, gives rise to uncertainty and ambiguity as to who may benefit from the exemption, more specifically whether the decisive element is domicile or residence."

In their view any ambiguity as to the meaning of the term “persons resident” had been dispelled by the fact that those authorities had uniformly and consistently interpreted it as “persons having domicile”, where the notion of domicile was construed in the light of the relevant domestic legislation, in particular with regard to the definition of domicile in the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act (see paragraphs 8 0 -8 1 above)."

However, the decision of the Customs Administration of 23 May 2006, the decisions of the Ministry of Finance of 6 July 2006 and 9 January 2008 and the judgments of the Administrative Court of 31 July 2008 and 9 September 2009 (see paragraphs 55-57 above) appear to suggest that the same term is to be interpreted in accordance with the notions of fiscal domicile and habitual residence as defined in the General Tax Act (see paragraph 31 above). Moreover, the opinions of the Customs Administration issued in the period between 19 December 2006 and 10 January 2013 (see paragraphs 51-52 above), as well as its press release of 4 April 2011 (see paragraph 53 above) and instruction of 1 June 2011 (see paragraph 54 above) indicate that the term in question is to be understood as meaning “persons having habitual residence” and that vehicles with foreign licence plates driven in the territory of Croatia by Croatian nationals who have their habitual residence abroad are to be exempted from import duties (see paragraphs 51-54 above). What is more, the Instruction of 1 June 2011 states in its introductory part that it was issued with a view to removing doubts and uncertainties and in order to harmonise procedures relating to the application of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention in the context of the use of cars with foreign licence plates in the customs territory of Croatia (see paragraph 54 above)."

That is so because in the proceedings the applicant complained of the domestic authorities had established that he did not at the relevant time pay income tax or have health insurance in Croatia, and that he was in possession of a valid residence permit issued by the Czech authorities (see paragraphs 20 and 22-23 above). Under the Czech law (see paragraph 42 above) that permit could not have been granted if in the five years before obtaining it (18 February 2008 – see paragraph 6 above) the applicant had been absent from the Czech Republic for more than six consecutive months, or for more than ten months altogether.

Thus the refusal of the domestic courts to consider the 1960 Criminal Code in its wording of 29 December 1999 as the most lenient law enacted before the final verdict and applying instead the wording of the law adopted by the Parliament which came into effect on 29 March 2000, that is long before the applicant ’ s conviction, and which has been in place ever since, did not upset the applicant ’ s rights as guaranteed by Article 7 of the Convention. As the Court has found previously, the sentence of life imprisonment is not a heavier sentence than the death penalty (see, among many other authorities, Hummatov v. Azerbaijan (dec.), nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, 18 May 2006; and Stepanenko and Ososkalo v. Ukraine (dec.), nos. 31430/09 and 29104/11, 14 January 2014). Therefore, the domestic courts, having sentenced the applicant to the life imprisonment, which was an applicable penalty at the time of conviction, and not to the death penalty, which was a relevant penalty at the time he had committed the crime, did apply the more lenient punishment. It follows that there was no violation of Article 7 of the Convention."

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, so as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy ( Kononov v.

Article 7 § 1 guarantees not only the principle of non-retrospectiveness of more stringent criminal laws but also, implicitly, the principle of retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law; in other words, where there are differences between the criminal law in force at the time of the commission of an offence and subsequent criminal laws enacted before a final judgment is rendered, the courts must apply the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 109, 17 September 2009)."

Inflicting a heavier penalty ... would amount to disregarding any legislative change favourable to the accused which might have come in before the conviction and continuing to impose penalties which the State – and the community it represents – now consider excessive.”"

In coming to such conclusion, the Court relied on the choice of the legislator in introducing retrospectiveness of more lenient punishments ( Gouarré Patte v.

During this fourteen year period Ukrainian criminal law was modified on several occasions. The 1960 Criminal Code, inherited from Soviet times, provided for the death penalty as an alternative to imprisonment for the crime of aggravated murder. This was the situation in 1996, when the applicant committed the crimes he was eventually convicted of in the domestic courts. On 29 December 1999 the Constitutional Court declared the death penalty as a punishment unconstitutional and instructed the Verkhovna Rada to bring the Criminal Code of Ukraine into line with this decision. The unconstitutional provisions lost their force. Three months later the amendments adopted by the Verkhovna Rada replaced the abolished death penalty with life imprisonment as the maximum punishment for certain crimes, including aggravated murder. From 2 9 March 2000 and until the entry into force of the new Criminal Code on 1 September 2001 the maximum penalty for aggravated murder was life imprisonment. This punishment is also provided for in the new 2001 Criminal Code in force today."

The Court notes that there is no dispute between the parties as to the principle of retroactivity of the most lenient wording of a criminal law as such, but rather of interpretation of the version of the Criminal Code which existed between 29 December 1999 and 29 March 2000. The Government suggested that the 1960 Criminal Code had not changed immediately after the decision of the Constitutional Court, but only from when the Verkhovna Rada had complied with that decision and had replaced the death penalty with life imprisonment. The applicant, on the basis of the decision of the Constitutional Court of 29 December 1999 concluded that all provisions which had foreseen the death penalty had lost their force immediately and as the Verkhovna Rada had taken some time to replace the abolished death penalty with life imprisonment, there had been no provision in the 1960 Criminal Code which had provided for a heavier penalty than fifteen years ’ imprisonment."

Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ I; Korbely v. Hungary [GC], no. 9174/02, §§ 72-73, ECHR 2008; and Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, § 197, ECHR 2010)."

From the relevant provisions of the Constitution, it appears that once the Constitutional Court declares a legal provision unconstitutional, such provision loses its validity immediately (see paragraph 19 above). Moreover, it does not appear that any other option, such as for example suspension of the relevant legal provision, exists under the relevant provision of Article 152 of the Constitution. The operative part of the Constitutional Court decision of 29 December 1999 – “[ T ]he provisions ... of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which provide for the death penalty as a form of punishment, are declared to be ... unconstitutional” followed by “[t]he provisions of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which have been declared unconstitutional, shall be null and void from the date of adoption of this Decision by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine” – does not seem to allow any other interpretation either. Contrary to the Government ’ s view, this was also admitted as a matter of fact by the Constitutional Court itself in its decision of 26 January 2011, in which it referred to “non-simultaneous loss of force of the provisions of the Code of 1960 on the death penalty and the entry into force of Law no. 1483 introducing of a new type of punishment”."

The arguments of the Constitutional Court in its decision of 26 January 2011 and their reiteration by the Government in the present case cannot negate the fact that there was no death penalty after the relevant provisions of the 1960 Criminal Code had been declared unconstitutional and had lost their force. The Court takes notice of the specific context in which the abolition of the death penalty took place in Ukraine (see paragraphs 28-30 above) and accepts that the creation of the gap had been unintentional. Indeed, it would be difficult to argue that the wording of the 1960 Criminal Code, which existed between 29 December 1999 and 29 March 2000, contained a punishment for the type of crime committed by the applicant that the legislator considered proportionate. In the light of the Court ’ s case law under Article 7, the intention of the legislator to humanize the criminal law and to give retrospective effect to more lenient law is an important factor ( Gouarré Patte v. Andorra, cited above, § 35 ). From the cited domestic law and practice, the Court cannot detect any intention of the legislator in particular, and of the State in general, to mitigate the law to the extent claimed by the applicant. At the time when the applicant committed his crime in 1996, it was punishable by the death penalty. The Parliament then replaced that penalty with the life sentence, which it considered proportionate."

Thus the refusal of the domestic courts to consider the 1960 Criminal Code in its wording of 29 December 1999 as the most lenient law enacted before the final verdict and applying instead the wording of the law adopted by the Parliament which came into effect on 29 March 2000, that is long before the applicant ’ s conviction, and which has been in place ever since, did not upset the applicant ’ s rights as guaranteed by Article 7 of the Convention. As the Court has found previously, the sentence of life imprisonment is not a heavier sentence than the death penalty (see, among many other authorities, Hummatov v. Azerbaijan (dec.), nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, 18 May 2006; and Stepanenko and Ososkalo v. Ukraine (dec.), nos. 31430/09 and 29104/11, 14 January 2014). Therefore, the domestic courts, having sentenced the applicant to the life imprisonment, which was an applicable penalty at the time of conviction, and not to the death penalty, which was a relevant penalty at the time he had committed the crime, did apply the more lenient punishment. It follows that there was no violation of Article 7 of the Convention."

            [
                "37. The Court first reiterates that the guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, so as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy ( Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, § 185, ECHR 2010; Maktouf and Damjanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC ], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 66, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). Article 7 § 1 guarantees not only the principle of non-retrospectiveness of more stringent criminal laws but also, implicitly, the principle of retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law; in other words, where there are differences between the criminal law in force at the time of the commission of an offence and subsequent criminal laws enacted before a final judgment is rendered, the courts must apply the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 109, 17 September 2009)."

Inflicting a heavier penalty ... would amount to disregarding any legislative change favourable to the accused which might have come in before the conviction and continuing to impose penalties which the State – and the community it represents – now consider excessive.”"

Andorra the Court extended the guarantees of Article 7 to the possibility of retrospective revision of the final sentence if the domestic law provided for such a possibility. In coming to such conclusion, the Court relied on the choice of the legislator in introducing retrospectiveness of more lenient punishments ( Gouarré Patte v. Andorra, no. 33427/10, §§ 33 to 36, 12 January 2016)."

In that case, the Court examined the existence of the legislative gap and answered in negative, thus leaving the question open as to whether existence of such gap might necessarily lead to a violation of Article 7.",

During this fourteen year period Ukrainian criminal law was modified on several occasions. The 1960 Criminal Code, inherited from Soviet times, provided for the death penalty as an alternative to imprisonment for the crime of aggravated murder. This was the situation in 1996, when the applicant committed the crimes he was eventually convicted of in the domestic courts. On 29 December 1999 the Constitutional Court declared the death penalty as a punishment unconstitutional and instructed the Verkhovna Rada to bring the Criminal Code of Ukraine into line with this decision. The unconstitutional provisions lost their force. Three months later the amendments adopted by the Verkhovna Rada replaced the abolished death penalty with life imprisonment as the maximum punishment for certain crimes, including aggravated murder. From 2 9 March 2000 and until the entry into force of the new Criminal Code on 1 September 2001 the maximum penalty for aggravated murder was life imprisonment. This punishment is also provided for in the new 2001 Criminal Code in force today."

The Court notes that there is no dispute between the parties as to the principle of retroactivity of the most lenient wording of a criminal law as such, but rather of interpretation of the version of the Criminal Code which existed between 29 December 1999 and 29 March 2000. The Government suggested that the 1960 Criminal Code had not changed immediately after the decision of the Constitutional Court, but only from when the Verkhovna Rada had complied with that decision and had replaced the death penalty with life imprisonment. The applicant, on the basis of the decision of the Constitutional Court of 29 December 1999 concluded that all provisions which had foreseen the death penalty had lost their force immediately and as the Verkhovna Rada had taken some time to replace the abolished death penalty with life imprisonment, there had been no provision in the 1960 Criminal Code which had provided for a heavier penalty than fifteen years ’ imprisonment."

Its role is thus confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ I; Korbely v. Hungary [GC], no. 9174/02, §§ 72-73, ECHR 2008; and Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, § 197, ECHR 2010)."

                "44. From the relevant provisions of the Constitution, it appears that once the Constitutional Court declares a legal provision unconstitutional, such provision loses its validity immediately (see paragraph 19 above). Moreover, it does not appear that any other option, such as for example suspension of the relevant legal provision, exists under the relevant provision of Article 152 of the Constitution. The operative part of the Constitutional Court decision of 29 December 1999 – “[ T ]he provisions ... of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which provide for the death penalty as a form of punishment, are declared to be ... unconstitutional” followed by “[t]he provisions of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which have been declared unconstitutional, shall be null and void from the date of adoption of this Decision by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine” – does not seem to allow any other interpretation either. Contrary to the Government ’ s view, this was also admitted as a matter of fact by the Constitutional Court itself in its decision of 26 January 2011, in which it referred to “non-simultaneous loss of force of the provisions of the Code of 1960 on the death penalty and the entry into force of Law no. 1483 introducing of a new type of punishment”."
            ],
            [
                "45. The arguments of the Constitutional Court in its decision of 26 January 2011 and their reiteration by the Government in the present case cannot negate the fact that there was no death penalty after the relevant provisions of the 1960 Criminal Code had been declared unconstitutional and had lost their force. The Court takes notice of the specific context in which the abolition of the death penalty took place in Ukraine (see paragraphs 28-30 above) and accepts that the creation of the gap had been unintentional. Indeed, it would be difficult to argue that the wording of the 1960 Criminal Code, which existed between 29 December 1999 and 29 March 2000, contained a punishment for the type of crime committed by the applicant that the legislator considered proportionate. In the light of the Court ’ s case law under Article 7, the intention of the legislator to humanize the criminal law and to give retrospective effect to more lenient law is an important factor ( Gouarré Patte v. Andorra, cited above, § 35 ). From the cited domestic law and practice, the Court cannot detect any intention of the legislator in particular, and of the State in general, to mitigate the law to the extent claimed by the applicant. At the time when the applicant committed his crime in 1996, it was punishable by the death penalty. The Parliament then replaced that penalty with the life sentence, which it considered proportionate."
            ],
            [
                "46. Thus the refusal of the domestic courts to consider the 1960 Criminal Code in its wording of 29 December 1999 as the most lenient law enacted before the final verdict and applying instead the wording of the law adopted by the Parliament which came into effect on 29 March 2000, that is long before the applicant ’ s conviction, and which has been in place ever since, did not upset the applicant ’ s rights as guaranteed by Article 7 of the Convention. As the Court has found previously, the sentence of life imprisonment is not a heavier sentence than the death penalty (see, among many other authorities, Hummatov v. Azerbaijan (dec.), nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, 18 May 2006; and Stepanenko and Ososkalo v. Ukraine (dec.), nos. 31430/09 and 29104/11, 14 January 2014). Therefore, the domestic courts, having sentenced the applicant to the life imprisonment, which was an applicable penalty at the time of conviction, and not to the death penalty, which was a relevant penalty at the time he had committed the crime, did apply the more lenient punishment. It follows that there was no violation of Article 7 of the Convention."

The Court is unable to agree with that argument on the basis of the following observations. First, the principle that more lenient provisions of criminal law must be applied retrospectively is implicitly guaranteed by Article 7 of the Convention. That principle is embodied in the rule that where there are differences between the criminal law in force at the time of the commission of the offence and subsequent criminal laws enacted before a final judgment is rendered, the courts must apply the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant (see, mutatis mutandis, Scoppola v.

The Court also notes in that connection that in Turkish criminal law, courts are required to comply with Article 7 § 2 of the Criminal Code, in accordance with which the provisions most favourable to the offender shall be applied (see also Başkaya and Okçuoğlu v.

After briefly describing the genesis of the organisation and its separation from the Marxist-Leninist Turkish Communist Party (hereinafter “ the TKP/ML”) in 1981, the General Security Directorate noted, without referring to a source or an event, that the illegal organisation had adopted armed revolution as its method of resistance. It also identified certain legal and illegal periodicals such as Çağrı and Güney as the organisation ’ s publications. Under the heading “Acts committed by the BPKK/T ”, eight acts were listed, all of which were indicated as having taken place on various dates between January 2002 and July 2002.

On 16 March 2006 the İzmir Assize Court convicted the applicants of being members of a terrorist organisation and sentenced them to two years and six months ’ imprisonment under the second sentence of section 7 ( 1 ) of Law no. 3713. The court firstly gave a summary of the applicants ’ defence submissions, the public prosecutor ’ s observations on the merits of the case, and the evidence in the case file. That evidence included the flyers that had been found in İzmir, as well as the documents, books and periodicals found in the apartments of the first applicant and the other co-accused. The court also listed as evidence the organisation ’ s alleged manifesto ( tüzük ), which had been discovered in the apartment of a co-accused. Having considered the structure, methods, purpose and activities of the organisation in question, the court concluded that it was a terrorist organisation, contrary to the submissions of the accused and the public prosecutor in charge of the investigation. The court found that the amendments made to section 1 of Law no. 3713, namely the inclusion of the term “ using violence and coercion ” in the definition of a terrorist organisation, did not exclude situations where an unarmed organisation adopted violence and coercion as its aim, even when its acts only amounted to “ moral coercion” ( manevi cebir ). A contrary interpretation of the provision would render its application to unarmed terrorist organisations impossible. The court noted that even though the members of the organisation had not resorted to physical violence, they had used “ moral coercion” – such as issuing threats, as was apparent from the confiscated documents – in order to achieve their aims. The court stressed that the organisation ’ s manifesto and some of the flyers contained statements which were of sufficient gravity to coerce people morally. The relevant parts of the judgment read:",
                "“It was understood that after the year 1980 the illegal organisation, TKP/ML, started to experience clashes of opinion among its members, as a result of which a new organisation identifying itself as the Bolsheviks came into existence by having its first congress in 1981 in Germany. After convening in five other congresses, namely in 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, [and] in their final and last congress of 1996, they named themselves the Bolshevik Party of North Kurdistan/Turkey and declared that their aim was to bring about an armed revolution in Turkey for the leadership of the working class, and for this reason they have engaged in the acts of distributing leaflets and declarations.",
                "The accused have participated in realising the organisation ’ s aims by holding meetings at the organisation ’ s base and preparing documents to be distributed in İzmir. Moreover, they have distributed and sold the publications Çağrı and Güney – which can be considered the organisation ’ s legal publications – in order to support the organisation financially.",
                "The accused have denied the accusations, in particular the existence of the organisation, and in any event have stated that their acts could not be considered crimes ... since no armed acts had been committed on behalf of the organisation ... The public prosecutor submitted that the organisation in question no longer corresponded to the definition provided for by law, in the light of the recent amendments made to Law no. 3713, and requested that the accused be acquitted.",
                "Therefore, what is at issue in the present case is whether the acts of the accused correspond to the amended definition of membership of a terrorist organisation ... In considering whether an organisation qualifies as a terrorist organisation, its structure, working methods, purpose and acts must be taken into account. The amended section 1 of Law no. 3713 requires [the use of] force and violence as an element of terror. It is sufficient for an organisation to adopt force and violence as its purpose to bring [the organisation] within the scope of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Coercion may just as well present itself as moral coercion. Terror is any criminal act committed for the purpose of achieving the ultimate goals listed in section 1 of Law no. 3713. ‘ Purpose ’ as worded in this section subsumes the purpose of using violence and force, and therefore envisages [the provision being applied] to unarmed organisations. Any conclusion that is contrary to this reasoning will render the application of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to unarmed organisations impossible, which will pave the way for them to work freely towards their goal of overthrowing democracy and the Turkish Republic. In democracies, people may be given all freedoms except for the freedom to destroy democracy. Since the legislature cannot be presumed to have given licence to organisations whose purpose is to ruin and divide the State, it necessarily follows that unarmed organisations fall within the scope of the law in question.",
                "Everyone has a right to freely declare their thoughts and opinions in the public sphere. However, when people establish an organisation to impose their ideas on others with the aim of changing the Constitution and bringing about the cessation of the State through violence and coercion, it can be considered that the constituent element of the crime, namely moral coercion, is presumed. In the light of this general overview, it can be considered that the acts of the accused are those of disseminating propaganda for an already existing organisation by means of distributing leaflets and thereby encouraging membership. [This] evidence obtained during the investigation has clearly revealed the aim which the accused have pursued. The ultimate purpose of the accused is to change the regime of the country by overthrowing the democracy and the Republic through a popular revolution [ ... ] thereby introducing a totalitarian regime based on Marxist and Leninist ideology. [ ... ] On pages 19, 20 and 21 of the organisation ’ s manifesto ... the Turkish Republic was insulted. [The manifesto] states that Turkey occupies lands that belong to Kurdistan and Armenia, and that the Kurdish people lead a justified resistance movement in North Kurdistan against the unjust and dirty war led by the fascist Turkish Republic. The dead terrorist İbrahim Kaypakkaya is mentioned ... On the following pages, Marxist and Leninist practices are praised and the quasi-feudal capitalist system is mentioned. The last chapter contains the party ’ s disciplinary procedures ... In a declaration which carries the emblem of the Bolshevik Party of North Kurdistan /Turkey, it is stated ‘ the history of the Ottoman Empire reeks of massacres and crimes ... 1.5 million Armenians were massacred ... and the fascist Turkish army is merely a continuation of the Ottoman Empire ... the real enemy is the fascist Turkish Republic ... unite under the red flag of the Bolshevik party in order to overthrow the fascist Turkish Republic with a democratic people ’ s revolution, and wave the red flag of Bolshevism in cities, castles, farms and mountains so that we can finally throw the fascist Turkish State into the gutters of history ... ’",
                "There are many more statements like the ones quoted above. There are many documents which incite people to revolt against the regime and the State and wage war on the Government by taking to the mountains. However, it is not possible to quote all of them in the judgment. They have been identified individually in the present judgment under the category of written evidence. In the light of this examination, it appears that the aim of the Bolshevik Party is to change the regime and bring about the secession of part of the national territory of Northern Kurdistan. It is considered that the organisation has started working towards these aims but has not yet engaged in armed attacks. [However,] the mere existence of such discourse in the organisation ’ s manifesto and declaration is sufficient to coerce people morally .”"

Having regard to the evidence in question, consisting of CDs, audio cassettes and documents which demonstrated the organisation ’ s intention to orchestrate attacks and bombings in order to foment unrest in the country and raise tensions with a neighbouring country, the Court of Cassation held that the accused in question had formed a conspiracy in order to carry out a military “ coup d ’ état”, and had come up with an elaborate action plan setting out the steps in detail, and a comprehensive membership structure to facilitate its ultimate purpose of overthrowing the government.",

In a case brought against the owner and the editor of a publication in respect of an allegation that they had published the declarations of a terrorist organisation, namely the Kurdistan Socialist Party, within the meaning of section 6 ( 2 ) of Law no. 3713, the Court of Cassation, sitting in plenary, quashed the first-instance criminal court ’ s judgment. In doing so, the court held that the impugned judgment ’ s sole basis for qualifying the organisation as a terrorist organisation had been an information note prepared by the Security Directorate which had loosely categorised the organisation as another Marxist-Leninist organisation seeking to bring about an armed revolution with respect to the Kurdish situation, and the judgment did not point to specific actions committed by the organisation for the purposes alleged. The Court of Cassation further noted in that connection that there was no judicial precedent assessing whether the organisation could be qualified as a terrorist organisation within the meaning of sections 1 and 7 of Law no. 3713. It therefore held that the first-instance court should have expanded the scope of the investigation in order to assess whether the organisation in question had adopted terrorism as its modus operandi or committed acts that could be qualified as terror acts in the light of the purposes and methods listed in section 1 of Law no. 3713.",

The offences are often vaguely and/or broadly defined such as “being concerned with terrorism” or “belonging to a proscribed organisation”. In other countries, the definition of terrorism in national laws may be so broad that it encompasses a wide range of acts of differing gravity.

As it operates to criminalize activities in support of a given violent (terrorist) political movement, there is a considerable risk that it may have an overspill effect on non-violent movements which have the same political goals as the target group, but which do not advocate (terrorist) violence in obtaining these goals.

Article 7 ECHR links the principle of legality to the commission of an act or an omission; a crime should thus consist in a material behaviour. The rights of the accused, notably the right of defence, would be nullified if the suspected person could be charged on the basis of mere expressions of terrorist ideology or support for terrorism and terrorist criminal acts: no defence is possible if the charge does not relate to facts, actions or behaviour. ”"

While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law.

In that connection, the parties disagree as to whether moral coercion – a concept which does not exist in the text of the applicable law – can nevertheless be regarded as subsumed by the requirement of “violence and force”, which is a constituent element of a terrorist offence under the amended versions of sections 1 and 7 of Law no. 3713."

The Court observes that at the relevant time Law no. 3713 did not contain a separate definition of a terrorist organisation. Rather, the definitions of terrorism and terrorist organisation were intertwined as formulated in section 1 of the same law. In its original version, terrorism was described as any act committed by means of pressure, force and violence, terror, intimidation, oppression or threat, with one or more of the political or ideological aims listed under that section, while an organisation was simply defined as any type of association of two or more people to pursue a common goal. In the amended 2003 version of section 1, it appears that the term “using force and violence” is referred separately from the methods of terrorism. The emphasis is put on the commission of an act through the use of force and violence and a further element – namely the impugned acts committed by members of such an organisation being criminal in nature – has been introduced. Moreover, it is no longer possible to call an association of two or more people a terrorist organisation unless their purpose of coming together is to pursue the commission of a terrorist offence."

The Court is unable to agree with that argument on the basis of the following observations. First, the principle that more lenient provisions of criminal law must be applied retrospectively is implicitly guaranteed by Article 7 of the Convention. That principle is embodied in the rule that where there are differences between the criminal law in force at the time of the commission of the offence and subsequent criminal laws enacted before a final judgment is rendered, the courts must apply the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant (see, mutatis mutandis, Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 109, 17 September 2009, and Koprivnikar v. Slovenia, no. 67503/13, § 49, 24 January 2017). The Court also notes in that connection that in Turkish criminal law, courts are required to comply with Article 7 § 2 of the Criminal Code, in accordance with which the provisions most favourable to the offender shall be applied (see also Başkaya and Okçuoğlu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 23536/94 and 24408/94, § 51, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV)."

                "65. Secondly, although the applicants were convicted under section 7(1) of Law no. 3713 before its amendment by Law no. 5532, the domestic court ’ s final decision convicting the applicants under that provision took into account the amended 2003 version of section 1 of Law no. 3713 with respect to the definition of terrorism. Accordingly, the domestic courts reached the conclusion that the element of “force and violence” had been satisfied in the light of the finding that the applicants ’ activities had constituted moral coercion since they had adopted force and violence as their goal. Furthermore, the Court notes that the domestic courts in convicting the applicants discussed at length whether the amendments made to Law no. 3713 had restricted or broadened the term “force and violence” by limiting it to armed or physical acts of violence and force. Having concluded that a restrictive interpretation would run contrary to the purpose of the law, the domestic courts held that the term “force and violence” should be interpreted broadly and include situations where violence, although not used in the ordinary physical sense, was nevertheless adopted as a goal of an organisation. Since the domestic courts themselves applied the amended version of section 1 in conjunction with the original version of section 7 to the applicants, the Court will confine its examination of the lawfulness of the applicants ’ conviction to those versions and not to those in force at the time of commission of the offence. In that respect, the Court will examine whether the domestic courts ’ broad interpretation of the text of the law in convicting the applicants was reasonably foreseeable for the purposes of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention. In so doing, the Court will have regard to whether the interpretation in question was the resultant development of a perceptible line of case-law or its application in broader circumstances was nevertheless consistent with the essence of the offence (see, inter alia, S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, §§ 36, Series A no. 335-B, and Jorgic v.

It further notes that the Government did not present the Court with examples of domestic case-law that made use of the concept of “ moral coercion ” in the context of terrorist offences. The only example that mentions moral coercion in the context of offences against the integrity of the State post-dates the applicants ’ conviction and in any event cannot be deemed authoritative since it was struck down by the Constitutional Court of Turkey for being incompatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on fact-specific grounds (see paragraph 46 above)."

In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the impugned concept is compatible with the essence of the offence, that is to say, invoking it in the circumstances of the case could be considered as reasonable irrespective of whether it was invoked by the domestic courts the first time."

The Court notes in that connection that the July 2003 legislative amendments to the provisions of Law no. 3713 narrowed down the definition of “terrorism” and “terrorist organisation”. Accordingly, the domestic law included several cumulative conditions for an association to be treated as a terrorist organisation. Those conditions are, inter alia : the intent to commit criminal acts; through the use of force and violence; and additional methods of pressure, terror, intimidation, oppression or threat; for one of the listed ideological or political motives. The wording of the relevant provisions of Law no. 3713 suggests that the essence of the offence of membership of a terrorist organisation is to join an association whose goal and mode of operation is to resort to the criminal use of force, violence and mass intimidation in order to advance certain political or ideological causes. The fact that the law-makers chose to single out the use of violence as a necessary means to commit terrorism in the 2003 version of section 1 of Law no. 3713 lends support to the conclusion that actual violence or the intent to use such violence is central to the definition of the offence."

The Court must next ascertain whether the violence component of the offence as described above can be said to reasonably imply “moral coercion”; in deciding that question the Court must consider whether invoking this concept in the circumstances of the case could be considered as reasonable. The Court ’ s inquiry should focus on the facts of the case as they have been established by the domestic courts and how the latter have applied the concept of “ moral coercion ” to the applicants ’ conduct and whether this interpretation fulfilled the requirements of foreseeability and clarity of the law."

In that connection, the Court notes that the applicants were convicted for membership of a terrorist organisation for having meetings with each other, disseminating flyers, possessing legal and illegal periodicals and a manifesto – the contents of which were found by the trial court to amount to moral coercion (namely, intimidation) of the public. It is also undisputed that there was no evidence that the organisation in question had engaged in any violent acts or that it had intended to pursue its aims through the use of force and violence or other terrorist methods. Finally, it was the first time that the domestic courts were called to determine whether the organisation could be proscribed as a terrorist organisation since there existed no judicial precedents concerning the same organisation. The Court therefore has to assess against this background whether the invocation of the concept of “ moral coercion ” was compatible with the essence of the offence of membership of a terrorist organisation."

More generally, there appear to be no clear rules or administrative practices for designating an organisation as a terrorist organisation (see paragraph 50 above). Nevertheless, the Court finds relevant the case-law of the Court of Cassation that, where domestic courts are confronted with the task of assessing for the first time whether an organisation can be classified as terrorist, they must carry out a thorough investigation and examine the nature of the organisation by scrutinising its purpose, whether it has adopted an action plan or similar operational measures, and whether it has resorted to violence or a credible threat to use violence in pursuing that action plan (see paragraphs 42 and 45 above)."

It follows that the domestic courts had to establish first and foremost whether the organisation in question possessed all the characteristics of a terrorist organisation as defined by Law no. 3713. In that respect, the domestic courts relied on the information note prepared by the Security Directorate, which considered the organisation in question a Marxist-Leninist illegal organisation whose ultimate aim was to bring about an armed revolution in Turkey. The domestic courts also relied on the flyers distributed in the streets of İzmir, as well as the organisation ’ s manifesto discovered in a co-accused ’ s apartment, and found that the views expressed therein, because of their objectionable character, amounted to moral coercion of the public, therefore fulfilling the requirement of force and violence for the purposes of sections 1 and 7 of Law no. 3713."

In that respect, while the domestic courts held that the organisation in question had not engaged in any armed attacks, they did not address the question whether the organisation had adopted an action plan or similar operational measures for such a purpose. In this connection, the Court notes that there is no indication in the case-file that the organisation in question, beyond the mere proclamation of certain goals, had adopted any concrete preparatory steps or indeed any form of action with a view to carrying out violent acts. Neither can the information note provided by the Security Directorate to the domestic courts be regarded as relevant in this respect since the acts attributed to the organisation in that note consisted only of the distribution of flyers and texts and the possession of books by the suspects."

It is necessary for the organisation to intend to commit crimes by the use of force and violence, which ultimately implies a degree of material coercion. The Court notes that the domestic courts did not explain how the concept of moral coercion relates to the constitutive elements of the offence, including with respect to the degree of coercion and the severity it must attain to warrant the conclusion that it amounts to terrorism."

Austria, 23 April 1987, § 66, Series A no. 117 ). Moreover, the Court has examined similar complaints under Article 8 of the Convention by having regard to the fact that freedom of movement, particularly across borders, is considered essential to the full development of a person ’ s private life, especially when he or she has family, professional and economic ties in several countries ( see İletmiş v.

In that connection, submitting the necessary documents to that effect, the second applicant has substantiated before the domestic authorities as well as the Court that he was a lawful resident of Germany, and that he worked as a freelance journalist. Lastly, with regard to the Government ’ s objection concerning the alleged lack of a significant disadvantage, the Court notes that the parties do not dispute the fact that the applicant was a non-resident at the material time and that his life prior to his arrest in Turkey was based in Germany. In that respect the Court considers that the effects of the travel ban on the applicant ’ s private life in so far as it prevented him from returning to his place of residence cannot be underestimated.

In that respect, the Court reiterates that it is not in itself questionable that the State may apply various preventive measures restricting the liberty of an accused in order to ensure the efficient conduct of a criminal prosecution; such measures may include deprivation of liberty (see, for example, Makedonski v. Bulgaria, no. 36036/04, § 39, 20 January 2011 ). In principle, a ban on leaving the country is a minimally intrusive measure involving a restriction of one ’ s liberty. However, it is evident that a travel ban imposed on a non-resident of the country where the proceedings take place has more serious consequences on the effective enjoyment of the right to respect for private and family life than that imposed on a resident. While a resident can go on about his daily life and resume social and professional activities without significant difficulties during the period the travel ban is enforced, a non - resident whose life has been established elsewhere will suffer a major disruption in their private and professional lives. Therefore, it is all the more necessary for such measure to be justified on the basis of an individualised approach from the outset and throughout its duration. Accordingly, the domestic authorities reviewing the measure should take account of all the factors involved by means of a periodic and individual assessment (see, mutatis mutandis, Riener, cited above, § 124). An automatic blanket ban imposed on an individual without an assessment of the fair balance test falls foul of the procedural obligations of the State inherent in Article 8 of the Convention."

In the present case, the Court notes that the travel ban was imposed on the second applicant after he was released from pre-trial detention, that is on 21 January 2003, as a preventive measure in lieu of detention. On that date he was prohibited from leaving Turkey until 25 December 2006, when his conviction for membership of a terrorist organisation became final. The travel ban was lifted on 24 June 2009 on his request, after he had served his sentence. During the proceedings, the second applicant made seven applications to the domestic courts requesting that the ban be lifted, explaining each time that the measure in question prevented him from maintaining his personal and professional ties to Germany, where he resided, and asking the courts to put in place a more appropriate measure, such as bail. The courts either failed to examine them or replied to those applications each time by merely referring to the stage the proceedings were at, without making any assessment as to whether the continuing restriction, after a certain lapse of time, was still a proportionate measure in the individual circumstances of the case (see paragraph 31 above). Since the domestic courts ’ decisions contain no consideration in relation to the applicant ’ s non-resident status and the profound implications of the travel ban on his private and professional life, it cannot be said that they weighed up the competing interests at stake. They therefore failed to provide sufficient justification for the continued ban on the applicant ’ s travelling abroad which, the Court recalls, lasted almost four years."

On 13 January 2012 the Ljubljana District Court, by means of a judgment, joined the three above-mentioned prison sentences, including the one for robbery which the applicant had already completed, in an overall sentence. Applying the 2008 Criminal Code as applicable before the introduction of the 2011 Amendment (see paragraphs 22 and 23 below), the court noted that the applicant should have had an overall sentence imposed on him as the conditions under Article 53 of the 2008 Criminal Code (see paragraph 22 below) had been met but the provision had not been applied in his case. While acknowledging that Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code applied to the case (see paragraph 22 below), the District Court sentenced the applicant to an overall term of thirty years ’ imprisonment. In its reasoning, it noted that the principle of the rule of law required, inter alia, that criminal-law provisions be drafted in a clear and precise manner in order to avoid sentences being imposed arbitrarily. It went on to note that the legislation applicable to the present case was unclear, ambiguous and deficient for the following reasons. Although the maximum sentence applicable under the 2008 Criminal Code had been thirty years ’ imprisonment and the rules on combining multiple sentences in an overall sentence, enshrined in Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, provided that the overall sentence must exceed each of the individual sentences, these same rules prescribed a maximum sentence of twenty years. The court took the view that the legislature had not intended to enact legislation enabling those offenders who had been sentenced to thirty years ’ imprisonment for one of the offences for which they subsequently had had their sentences joined to benefit from an overall sentence that would have been ten years lower than the highest individual sentence to which the offender had been sentenced. In support of its view, the District Court pointed out that the 1994 Criminal Code (see paragraph 21 below) had provided that in cases where an offender had been due to serve thirty years ’ imprisonment along with sentences for other offences, the overall sentence would have consisted only of that term. Therefore, the District Court considered that the legislature had made an obvious error in Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, which had, however, been rectified in the meantime by the 2011 Amendment. The court found that the latter made the rules on the determination of an overall sentence certain, clear and complete and that “[o]nly the so amended provisions therefore prevent [ed] arbitrary sanctioning of criminal offenders for multiple criminal offences as required by the principle of legality”."

The applicant appealed against the judgment, arguing that the District Court ’ s decision lacked a legal basis and was in breach of the principle of the rule of law and the principle nullum crimen et nulla poena sine lege. He also claimed that the primary method of interpreting legal texts should be semantic interpretation. It was only where that method proved unsatisfactory in determining how a certain rule should be applied that other methods of interpretation should be applied. Lastly, the applicant agreed with the District Court that the provision in question could be regarded as unclear, ambiguous and deficient, but pointed out that any possible ambiguities or deficiencies should not be interpreted to his detriment."

                "14. On 29 May 2 012 the Ljubljana Higher Court rejected the appeal lodged by the applicant and upheld the first-instance judgment, reiterating the lower court ’ s reasoning. In the Higher Court ’ s opinion, the District Court had correctly assessed that the legislature had not intended to permit individuals convicted of several offences from benefiting from a lower maximum term of imprisonment than they would have had to serve if they had been convicted of only one of those offences. According to the Higher Court, such an interpretation would lead to a situation “defying the law as well as common sense”."

On 6 December 2012 the Supreme Court by its judgment I Ips 58203/2011 rejected the application for the protection of legality, disagreeing with the applicant that semantic interpretation should take precedence over all other methods of legal interpretation. The Supreme Court referred to the Higher Court ’ s judgment, pointing out that the latter court ’ s reasoning evidently showed that the historical interpretation of the rule on combining multiple sentences also had to be taken into account in assessing the aim of the legislature in enacting the provision at issue. That method of interpretation entailed the examination of not only the provision in its original form, as relied on by the applicant, but also the subsequent amendment, which showed the true aim of the provision. In addition, the Supreme Court relied on the systematic interpretation of the rule in question, emphasising that it could not be interpreted entirely separately from the provisions prescribing that individual prison sentences for various criminal offences must be combined to form an overall sentence. Since under the un - amended 2008 Criminal Code a prison sentence could be imposed for a term not shorter than fifteen days and not longer than thirty years, it was not logical that an overall sentence combining several prison terms, one of which was for thirty years, could be ten years lower than the highest individual prison sentence imposed. According to the Supreme Court, the rules on multiple offences were aimed not at reducing the general maximum prison sentence, but at ensuring that the overall length of several sentences did not exceed the general maximum prison sentence, which in the applicant ’ s case was thirty years."

In particular, the literal reading of Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code would have led to a result inconsistent with the purpose of the provisions concerning the determination of an overall penalty, specifically to limit the sentence to a level below the maximum term of imprisonment. As Article 53 § 2 (2) was clearly meant to regulate only instances where neither of the individual penalties exceeded twenty years ’ imprisonment, the Supreme Court was justified in considering that in cases where one of the individual penalties amounted to thirty years ’ imprisonment, the overall penalty should be likewise set at thirty years ’ imprisonment."

The court ’ s interpretation in the present case was also in line with the Supreme Court ’ s case-law in cases where neither of the individual penalties had exceeded twenty years ’ imprisonment and in which the Supreme Court had found that the overall penalty could not therefore exceed twenty years ’ imprisonment (see paragraph 26 above).",

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see Del Río Prada v. Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, § 77, ECHR 2013, and Vasiliauskas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 35343/05, § 153, 20 October 2015)."

It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy (see Del Río Prada, cited above, § 78 )."

Lastly, the Court reiterates that Article 7 guarantees not only the principle of non-retrospectiveness of more stringent criminal laws but also, implicitly, the principle of retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal laws; in other words, where there are differences between the criminal law in force at the time of the commission of an offence and subsequent criminal laws enacted before a final judgment is rendered, the courts must apply the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 109, 17 September 2009). In its judgment in the case of Gouarré Patte v. Andorra the Court extended the guarantees of Article 7 concerning the retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law to the possibility of retrospective revision of the final sentence if domestic law provided for such a possibility ( see Gouarré Patte v.

He was sentenced to prison terms of four years, thirty years and five months respectively (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above). The second and the third judgment concerned offences committed before the applicant had started serving the term of imprisonment of four years imposed by the first judgment and the courts were therefore required under domestic law to determine one overall sentence for all three criminal offences (see paragraphs 13 and 22 above ). As they had not done so, the applicant, on 28 November 2011, applied to have an overall sentence determined under the provisions concerning the so - called irregular reopening of proceedings (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above). On the basis of his application the court, on 13 January 2012, delivered a new judgment which modified the previously imposed sentences by determining one overall sentence of thirty years (see paragraph 13 above)."

The Court, referring to the principles set out in Del Río Prada (§§ 81-90, cited above ) and noting that the new judgment modified the scope of the “penalty” imposed previously by the trial courts (see paragraphs 13 and 24 above), finds that Article 7 of the Convention applies to the present case."

The Court further observes that at the time of the commission of the offence of murder, which carried a thirty - year prison sentence, the rules on the determination of an overall sentence set the maximum term at thirty years ’ imprisonment (see paragraphs 10 and 21 above ). However, the law under which the overall sentence was later determined in the applicant ’ s case, that is to say the 2008 Criminal Code, provided a maximum limit for the overall sentence of twenty years ’ imprisonment, save for the situation where two or more sentences of thirty years had been imposed (see paragraph 22 above). There is no dispute between the parties that the applicant was entitled to the determination of the overall sentence under the 2008 Criminal Code, which had been in force when his last conviction had become final as well as when the judgment imposing the overall sentence had been given (see paragraphs 13, 22 and 25 above). The dispute in the present case rather relates to the question whether the 2008 Criminal Code could be interpreted as setting the maximum overall sentence for the applicant ’ s multiple offences at thirty years, instead of the explicitly provided limit of twenty years."

The Court however notes that the present case does not concern such an inevitable element of judicial interpretation but a situation where the legal provision relied on by the courts provided a deficient legal basis for the determination of the sentence. In particular, the application of the wording of Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code to the applicant ’ s situation led to contradictory results. While, according to the terms of this provision, the applicant should not have had an overall sentence of more than twenty years imposed on him, the overall sentence should exceed each individual sentence, which in the applicant ’ s case included a term of imprisonment of thirty years (see paragraph 22 above). The Court notes that this deficiency resulted from the legislature ’ s failure to regulate an overall sentence for a situation such as the applicant ’ s in the 2008 Criminal Code. It moreover notes that the resultant lacuna in the legislation pertained for three years (see paragraphs 22, 23 and 39 ) and that no special reasons have been adduced by the Government to justify it (see, by contrast, Ruban v. Ukraine, no. 8927/11, § 45, 12 July 2016 )."

The Court considers that the above situation, which was acknowledged by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 13, 16 and 26 above ) as well as the Government (see paragraph 42 above), contravened the principle of legality, by which the requirement that a penalty must be clearly defined in law is an essential part (see paragraphs 46 to 48 above). It further understands that the domestic courts were in a difficult position when called to apply an overall sentence in the applicant ’ s case while lacking a clear legal basis to do so. The Court notes in this connection that while the courts were certainly the best placed to interpret and apply domestic law, they were at the same time bound by the principle, embodied in Article 7 of the Convention, that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( see Del Río Prada, cited above, § 105). It finds that the only way for the courts to have ensured the observance of this principle and to mitigate the effects of the law ’ s unpredictability in the present case would have been to interpret the deficient provision restrictively, that is to say to the advantage of the applicant."

In this regard, the Court observes that Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code could be applied to the applicant by either disregarding the lower limit, pursuant to which the overall sentence should have exceeded each individual sentence, or by disregarding the upper limit, pursuant to which the overall prison sentence should not have exceeded the maximum ceiling of twenty years. It is clear from the foregoing that the more favourable to the applicant would have been the first option, which, most importantly, would have complied with the maximum limit on the overall sentence explicitly provided in the legislation (see paragraph 22 above) and thus avoided filling the legislative lacuna by way of extensive judicial interpretation."

In justifying their conclusion they had regard to, inter alia, other penalties set out in the 2008 Criminal Code; the overall sentence of thirty years ’ imprisonment set out in the ( then no longer valid ) 1994 Criminal Code; the purpose of the overall sentence; and the legislature ’ s intent which, in the Supreme Court ’ s view, had been later realised in the 2011 Amendment (see paragraphs 13, 14, 16 and 26. above)."

The Court therefore notes that the domestic courts interpreted the deficient legal provisions by resorting to different canons of interpretation and thereby coming to the conclusion that it should be understood as imposing a sentence of thirty years. They did so despite the fact that such a penalty was heavier than the maximum sentence explicitly provided for in the applied legal provision and that, having regard to the actual wording of that provision, it was clearly to the detriment of the applicant. Accordingly and having regard to the above considerations (see paragraphs 56. and 57 above ), the Court concludes that the domestic courts failed to ensure the observance of the principle of legality enshrined in Article 7 of the Convention. It further finds that the overall penalty imposed on the applicant was in violation of both the principle that only the law can prescribe a penalty and the principle of retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law."
