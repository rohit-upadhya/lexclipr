That said, the Court reiterates that, notwithstanding the terms of Article 13 read literally, the existence of an actual breach of another provision is not a prerequisite for the application of the Article ( Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, § 52 ). Accordingly, having regard to its findings in the admissibility decision and to its conclusion that the applicant ’ s allegations could not be discarded as being prima facie untenable (see paragraph 101 above), the Court considers that the applicant ’ s complaints raised arguable claims of violations of the Convention for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention ( see, mutatis mutandis, insofar as the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention was at stake, Mennitto v.

Moreover, the Court is unable to determine, on the basis of the photographs furnished by the applicant, whether the houses shown there had burned down or merely collapsed for other reasons, such as natural deterioration over time (see paragraph 68 above). Having regard to these pictures, it is not possible to tell whether the remains of houses show any trace of having been exposed to fire. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the applicant failed to submit any expert opinion as to the nature of such destruction. Accordingly, the suggestion that these houses had fallen into ruin because of natural forces cannot be excluded, owing to the fact that adobe was the main material used in their construction (see paragraph 74 above)."

He offered no explanation for his failure to remain totally passive after he had left the village. Furthermore, he did not provide any information or evidence to substantiate his allegation concerning the authorities ’ denial of access to his village.

The Court reiterates that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Dulaş and Yöyler, both cited above, § § 65 and 87 respectively )."

These complaints were not declared inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded and therefore necessitated an examination on the merits. Furthermore, in its admissibility decision of 12 June 2003, the Court had already concluded that the applicant had been absolved from pursuing any further remedy in domestic law given the lack of a thorough and effective investigation into his complaints."

Accordingly, having regard to its findings in the admissibility decision and to its conclusion that the applicant ’ s allegations could not be discarded as being prima facie untenable (see paragraph 101 above), the Court considers that the applicant ’ s complaints raised arguable claims of violations of the Convention for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention ( see, mutatis mutandis, insofar as the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention was at stake, Mennitto v.

Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court notes that subsequent to the applicant ’ s criminal complaint to the authorities, an investigation was carried out by a gendarme officer, who was appointed as an investigator by the Commission on the Prosecution of Civil Servants attached to the Kocaköy Administrative Council (see paragraph 35 above). The gendarme captain conducted an on-site inspection, took statements from a total of fourteen witnesses, including inhabitants of nearby villages, gendarmes and fire fighters, and concluded that the applicant ’ s allegations were unfounded (see paragraphs 70-78 above). Relying on the findings and conclusion of the gendarme captain, the Administrative Council decided that no proceedings should be brought against the security forces and village guards."

                "119. However, the Court notes that there were serious defects in the investigation conducted by the authorities. In this connection, it points out that the investigating authorities visited the scene of the incident one and a half years after they had received the applicant ’ s criminal complaint (see paragraphs 32 and 35 above). The gendarme officer in charge of the investigation did not attempt to take statements from the inhabitants of the applicant ’ s village. He was content to rely on the testimonies of gendarmes, firemen and persons from neighbouring villages who all seemed to be village guards. Moreover, some of the witnesses denied the content and accuracy of their statements taken by the gendarme captain, alleging that they had been asked to sign some documents without being aware of their content (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above). In this context, the Court recalls that in a similar Turkish case it had already established a practice by the gendarmerie authorities of making witnesses sign blank sheets and filling them in themselves afterwards (see Yöyler, cited above, § 57). On that account, the Court had observed that statements taken from those witnesses had been of a stereotyped nature – giving the impression that they had been prepared by the investigating authorities – and that therefore no weight could be attached to them ( ibid., §§ 57 and 91). Likewise, in the instant case, the Court has serious doubts about the credibility of the investigation carried out by the gendarme captain, given the denial of some of the witnesses that they made such statements. In particular, it considers this practice incompatible with the notion of the investigation required by Article 13 of the Convention."

In any event, the Court has already found in a number of cases that investigations carried out by local administrative councils could not be regarded as independent since they were composed of civil servants, who were hierarchically dependent on the governor, and an executive officer was linked to the security forces under investigation (see Güleç v. Turkey, no. 21593/93, § 80, Reports 1998-IV; Yöyler and İpek, both cited above, §§ 93 and 207 respectively). The appointment of a gendarme officer as the investigator in a case where gendarmes were alleged to have been the perpetrators of the destruction property, and serious doubts about the credibility of his investigation, does not permit the Court to reach a different conclusion in the present case."

At the mosque, the commander told them to remove their belongings from the houses and to evacuate the village in an hour. The houses were set on fire as persons attempted to remove their belongings.

The villagers obtained permission, from their local gendarme station, to stay in the village until the harvest, until which time they lived in shelters.

The witness, Hacı Mehmet and other villagers talked to them. The Orhans were upset saying that the soldiers had taken them. They asked for help and for their families to be told. Hacı Mehmet, an old man, enquired why the Orhans had been taken. They responded that they would take him instead. Having rested for 30 minutes approximately, the soldiers put the Orhans into a military vehicle and left. That evening, the applicant came to Gümüşsuyu and they told him what they had seen.

In addition, the document is rather summary, amounting as it does to a table of one page to describe 30 military operations in the Diyarbakır province between 2 and 31 May 1994. Apart from abbreviated references to the units involved, no details are given as to how many troops were involved, where they were billeted or about the purpose or result of the operations. Moreover, given the Court's findings in the above-cited Çiçek v. Turkey case (§ 132) that on 10 May 1994 military units had carried out an operation in Dernek village, Lice District and the fact that the records submitted make no reference to this operation, the Court finds it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the operations records are not complete."

Secondly, the Commission requested, in its letter of 10 May 1999, the identity and attendance before its Delegates, of the commander of military operations in the region, allegedly by the Bolu regiment. The Government's response of 9 August 1999 made no reference to the matter. The Commission reminded the Government in letters of 9 August and 13 September 1999. While on the first day of the taking of evidence by the Delegates (October 1999) the Government indicated that it had no information, on the following day they confirmed that “the responsible officer who carried out the operation in the area is General Yavuz Ertürk”. The Government added, during the oral hearing before the Court in May 2001, that General Ertürk was the commander of the Bolu regiment and that he had not been called before the Delegates because he had already given evidence to Delegates in another case ( Akdeniz and Others v. Turkey, no. 23954/94, judgment of 31 May 2000, unpublished) and had no further information so that there was no point in his repeating before the Delegates, in this case, his previous statements."

However, no explanation has been given as to why this officer could not be identified until October 1999 during the taking of evidence, which delay frustrated any possibility of hearing his evidence. Finally, it was for the Commission, as it is for this Court, to decide whether and to what extent a witness is relevant for its assessment of facts. In this latter respect, the Court notes that the case of Akdeniz concerned a military operation at a time (October 1993) and place (Alaca village) different to the operation at issue in the present case."

Since the Government's response of the 9 August 1999 omitted this information, further written reminders were sent by the Commission in August and September 1999. Having indicated to the Delegates in October 1999 that it had no information, the Government was reminded of this outstanding matter in the Commission's and Court's letters of 28 October 1999 and 13 March 2000. The Government's observations of June 2000 made no reference to the matter leading to three further written reminders from the Court in June and July 2000. The Government's letter of 2 August 2000 submitted certain other outstanding information without reference to this matter, leading to further written reminders from the Court in August, September and November 2000.

Furthermore, and referring to the importance of a respondent Government's co-operation in Convention proceedings (see paragraph 266 above) and mindful of the difficulties inevitably arising from an evidence-taking exercise of this nature (the above-cited Timurtas case, at § 70), the Court finds that the Government fell short of their obligations under Article 38 § 1(a) (formerly Article 28 § 1(a)) of the Convention to furnish all necessary facilities to the Commission and Court in its task of establishing the facts."

Again, while his earlier statements varied as to the precise persons with whom he spoke in Gümüşsuyu on the evening of 24 May 1994, his oral evidence as to the information he received on that date in Gümüşsuyu about the Orhans passing through with the soldiers was entirely consistent with the later oral and direct evidence of Mehmet Emre."

Secondly, he saw smoke coming from Deveboyu the day before Gümüşsuyu was also burned.

He was also the only witness capable of identifying the type of soldiers (infantry and commando units) who were still in the area (on the road between Çağlayan and Zeyrek) when he first arrived in Çağlayan in early May and he gave a detailed description of the relevant uniforms. His evidence as to the burning of the village can be considered direct since smoke was still rising from some houses when he arrived in early May.

Although Ahmet Potaş professed to remember little of the events in question, the Court finds it difficult to believe that he could recall absolutely nothing of relevance. On the one hand, he confirmed that he was the commander in a local gendarme station (Zeyrek) to which Çağlayan village was attached, that he knew Çağlayan village well, that he got on well with the villagers and that he knew the muhtar of each village personally. On the other hand, he said that he could not remember significant events or matters: whether there had been a PKK problem in Çağlayan, whether Çağlayan had been burnt down by the security forces, whether complaints had been made about its burning, whether complaints had been made directly to him by the muhtar about three villagers having been detained by the security forces or whether he had gone to Çağlayan after it had been burned down.

The Court further considers that the deficiencies established as regards the completion of gendarme custody records means that the absence of the Orhans' names therefrom is not conclusive proof that they did not pass through those stations. In the first place, the Court has, in previous cases, recorded deficiencies mainly relating to the “unsatisfactory and arbitrary distinction” drawn by gendarmes between being taken into custody, in which case an entry is made in the custody records, and being detained for observation and/or questioning, in which case there will not necessarily be a custody record entry ( Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 105, ECHR 1999-IV, and the above-cited Çiçek case, at §§ 137-138). This practice was confirmed by the evidence of three gendarme officers in the present case. The reliability of custody records is further undermined by the fact that those records will not show whether one was initially apprehended by military forces or not (paragraphs 204 and 309 above). Their accuracy is also reduced by the failure observed in the present case to note in the custody records the date on which a number of detainees were released from gendarme custody (see paragraph 304 above)."

It seems probable that, despite the denials of the gendarme witnesses and the absence of any custody record relating to the school, persons taken into detention by military units were, on occasion, detained at the school before being transferred to Lice Central Gendarme Station. This was established by the Court in the Çiçek case by direct evidence of villagers who had been detained there. Support for this view came also from the evidence of Adnan Orhan in the present case (paragraphs 38, 150 and 301 above). Ramazan Ayçiçek's statement during interrogation is not inconsistent with his being detained with the Orhans in the school.",

Indeed, Aziz Yıldız initially said, before he changed his evidence, that he would go to the school to pick up detainees and Hasan Çakır agreed that the military could detain persons there without the gendarmes necessarily knowing about it. Consistently, the gendarme witnesses were clear that they exercised no control whatsoever over the activities of the military at the school or elsewhere. The Court's impression from the evidence is that the military was largely unaccountable for what occurred in the school. Importantly, the Court must draw a negative inference from the unexplained failure by the Government to provide, pursuant to the numerous requests of the Commission and Court, the name of the officer in charge of the military establishment at Lice Boarding School."

This indirect evidence is, despite the strong suspicions to which the evidence gives rise, insufficient to enable the Court to conclude beyond all reasonable doubt that the Orhans were detained in the above-noted gendarme or military establishments.

In the same vein, Article 5 imposes an obligation on the State to account for the whereabouts of any person taken into detention and who has thus been placed under the control of the authorities (...). Whether the failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee's fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on concrete elements, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (...).",

The passage of time may therefore to some extent affect the weight to be attached to other elements of circumstantial evidence before it can be concluded that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. In this respect the Court considers that this situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere irregular detention in violation of Article 5.

Turkey (judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, § 108), in which the Court held that there were insufficient persuasive indications that the applicant's son had met his death in detention. Üzeyir Kurt was last seen surrounded by soldiers in his own village, whereas the Orhans were last seen being taken away to an unidentified place of detention by authorities for whom the State is responsible. There were, in addition, few elements identifying Üzeyir Kurt as a person under suspicion by the authorities: in the present case, there is some direct evidence (from Adnan Orhan, see paragraphs 41 and 154 above) that the Orhans were wanted by the authorities. In the general context of the situation in south-east Turkey in 1994, it can by no means be excluded that an unacknowledged detention of such persons would be life-threatening ( Timurtaş v. Turkey, cited above, § 85 and the Çiçek v. Turkey, cited above, § 146). It is to be recalled that the Court has held in earlier judgments that defects undermining the effectiveness of criminal law protection in the south-east during the period relevant also to this case, permitted or fostered a lack of accountability of members of the security forces for their actions ( Cemil Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 22492/93, § 75, ECHR 2000, and Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey, no. 22535/93, § 98, ECHR 2000).

Noting that the authorities have not provided any explanation as to what occurred following the Orhans' apprehension, and that they do not rely on any ground of justification in respect of any use of lethal force by their agents, it follows that liability for their death is attributable to the respondent Government ( Timurtas, § 86, and Çiçek, at § 147, both judgments cited above)."

The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention.

The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eye witness testimony (see, concerning witnesses, for example, Tanrıkulu v.

He confirmed in his oral evidence that he probably did not complete the investigation to which his letter referred but that it was likely his subordinates did so and that they drafted the letter on his behalf. He did not recall having further investigated. It is not surprising therefore that, when Ümit Şenocak moved on from Kulp in November 1994, Kulp District Gendarme station did not continue the investigation as undertaken in his letter of July 1994.

This insistence on the protection of the individual against any abuse of power is illustrated by the fact that Article 5 § 1 circumscribes the circumstances in which individuals may be lawfully deprived of their liberty, it being stressed that these circumstances must be given a narrow interpretation having regard to the fact that they constitute exceptions to a most basic guarantee of individual freedom (...)”."

While the Court accepts that it was the Orhans' disappearance rather than the burning of his village which was initially a priority for the applicant, in any event, by February 1995 his application including detailed allegations concerning the burning of Deveboyu had been communicated to the Government. There followed instructions from the Ministry of Justice to the Mustafa Atagün (of the office of Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor) who summoned the applicant (see paragraphs 65-72 above) and took his statement in which the applicant maintained his claim that the village had been destroyed by the security forces. Although Mustafa Atagün sent the statement to the Kulp Chief Public Prosecutor, that was the extent of his involvement and the response of the Kulp Chief Public Prosecutor (letter of 16 May 1995) referred to investigations concerning the Orhans' disappearance only. By July 1995 the Kulp Chief Public Prosecutor had relinquished jurisdiction to the District Administrative Council and there is no evidence that any investigations thereafter dealt with the destruction of Deveboyu by the security forces."

On the contrary, the oral evidence of the gendarmes in the present case only serves to affirm that reluctance: during his oral evidence before the Delegates, Ali Ergülmez put at 1,000 to 1 the chances that the security forces could destroy a village; Ümit Şenocak would not even accept those odds, as he considered that it was not possible that the security forces would do such a thing and Aziz Yıldız went so far as to suggest that it was wrong even to discuss such an inconceivable allegation."

In this context, “pressure” includes not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage applicants from pursuing a Convention remedy (the Kurt judgment, cited above, § 159). The fact that the individual actually managed to pursue his application does not prevent an issue arising under Article 34: should the Government's action make it more difficult for the individual to exercise is right of petition, this amounts to “hindering” his rights under Article 34 (the above-cited Akidivar and Others judgment, §§ 105 and 254)."

In previous cases, the Court had regard to the vulnerable position of applicant villagers and the reality that in south-east Turkey complaints against the authorities might well give rise to a legitimate fear of reprisals, and it has found that the questioning of applicants about their applications to the Commission amounted to a form of illicit and unacceptable pressure, which hindered the exercise of the right of individual petition in breach of former Article 25 of the Convention (Akdivar and Others and Kurt judgments, cited above, at § 105 and § 160, respectively)."

There is nothing to suggest that this provision was not sufficiently clear and precise or that it was not properly interpreted and applied in the majority of cases (see, however, Muminov v. Russia, no. 42502/06, § 102, 11 December 2008, where the removal had been unlawfully carried out before the appeal decision).

However, it appears that only a prosecutor can request a suspension under Article 31.6 of the CAO (see paragraph 28 above ) and that such suspension is not “automatic”.

The Government submitted that the applicant had been prosecuted for an offence that he had committed in 2012. It is true that the first-instance court stated that the penalty of administrative removal was optional. However, the appeal court corrected that view, finding that the penalty for the offence of which the applicant had been convicted was a fine with administrative removal (see paragraph 12 above). As clearly stated by the appeal court in the applicant ’ s CAO case (see paragraph 12 above), the applicant was convicted under Article 18.8 § 1.1 of the CAO that was introduced into the CAO in 2013 and provided for two mandatory penalties: a fine and administrative removal.

In other words, the Court has no reason to consider on the basis of the material made available to it in the present case that it was open to the court to dispense with the penalty of removal on the strength of arguments relating to Article 2 or 3 of the Convention. Therefore, at the time, as the applicant was found guilty of the offence, the court had no choice but to impose that penalty, irrespective of the validity of the arguments relating to Article 2 or 3 of the Convention (see, by way of comparison, Gablishvili v.

                "“2. Nearly all parts of Syria are embroiled in violence, which is playing out between different actors in partially overlapping conflicts and increasingly involves different regional and international actors. The country is deeply fractured as parties to the conflict, including Syrian military forces, the group “Islamic State of Iraq and Al ‑ Sham” (hereafter ISIS), anti-government armed groups, and Kurdish forces (People ’ s Protection Units, YPG), exercise control and influence in different parts of the country. As international efforts to end the conflict in Syria have yet to yield results, the conflict continues unabated with devastating consequences for the Syrian population, including rising civilian casualties, large-scale displacement inside and outside the country, and an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Tenuous local ceasefires have been brokered in some areas between government and anti ‑ government forces, resulting in temporary de-escalations of fighting at the local level. ...",
                "7. The number of persons killed as a result of the conflict since its start in 2011 is estimated to range between 145,000 and over 250,000. The greatest number of casualties has been recorded in the governorate of Rural Damascus, followed by Aleppo, Homs, Idlib, Dera ’ a and Hama governorates. While men (both fighters and civilians) account for the highest number of deaths, women and children are reported to account for one quarter of all civilian deaths. As a result of the conflict, the deterioration of Syria ’ s healthcare system has reportedly led to hundreds of thousands of ordinarily preventable deaths from chronic diseases, premature deaths due to normally nonfatal infectious diseases, neonatal problems and malnutrition. In addition, over one million people have reportedly been wounded as a direct result of the conflict, often leading to long-term disabilities, while many more are suffering from the psychological consequences of having been witness to violence, the loss of family members, displacement and deprivation. ...",

A particular and deepening feature of the conflict is that different parties to the conflict frequently impute a political opinion to larger groups of people, including families, tribes, religious or ethnic groups or whole towns, villages or neighbourhoods, by association. As such, members of a larger entity, without individually being singled out, become the targets for repercussions by different actors, including government forces, ISIS, and anti-government armed groups, for reason of real or perceived support to another party to the conflict. According to consistent reports, whole communities which are perceived to be holding a particular political opinion or affiliation in relation to the conflict are targeted by aerial bombardments, shelling, siege tactics, suicide attacks and car bombs, arbitrary arrest, hostage-taking, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and extra-judicial executions. The perception of sharing a political opinion or affiliation in relation to the conflict is often based on little more than an individual ’ s physical presence in a particular area (or the fact that he/she originates from a particular area), or his/her ethnic, religious or tribal background. The risk of being harmed is serious and real, and in no way diminished by the fact that the person concerned may not be targeted on an individual basis. ...",

He argued that there was no statutory provision specifically requiring that a pending application for temporary asylum should have automatic suspensive effect vis-à-vis a removal order. The applicant disagreed with the Government, arguing that section 10 of the Refugees Act only concerned a ban on removing a foreigner pending an application for refugee status. The bailiff service in charge of enforcing the removal order had not issued a decision suspending such enforcement, for instance on account of the pending application for temporary asylum.

The effect of this Article is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (see Jabari v. Turkey, no. 40035/98, § 48, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII).

However, it appears that only a prosecutor can request a suspension under Article 31.6 of the CAO (see paragraph 28 above ) and that such suspension is not “automatic”.

The Government submitted that the applicant had been prosecuted for an offence that he had committed in 2012. It is true that the first-instance court stated that the penalty of administrative removal was optional. However, the appeal court corrected that view, finding that the penalty for the offence of which the applicant had been convicted was a fine with administrative removal (see paragraph 12 above). As clearly stated by the appeal court in the applicant ’ s CAO case (see paragraph 12 above), the applicant was convicted under Article 18.8 § 1.1 of the CAO that was introduced into the CAO in 2013 and provided for two mandatory penalties: a fine and administrative removal.

Russia, no. 67474/11, § 153, 18 April 2013 ), it has found a violation of Article 5 § 4 in a number of cases against Russia on account of the absence of any domestic legal provision which could have allowed an applicant to bring proceedings for judicial review of his or her detention pending expulsion (see L.M. and Others v. Russia, § 141, and Kim, §§ 39-43, both cited above; Rakhimov v. Russia, no. 50552/13, §§ 148-50, 10 July 2014; and Akram Karimov v. Russia, no. 62892/12, §§ 199-204, 28 May 2014). In the Kim case, the Government acknowledged a violation of Article 5 § 4 and, having regard to the recurrent nature of the violation, the Court directed that the Russian authorities should “secure in [their] domestic legal order a mechanism which allows individuals to institute proceedings for the examination of the lawfulness of their detention pending removal in the light of the developments in the removal proceedings” (cited above, § 71)."

The Court also reiterates that deprivation of liberty under Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention must conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 § 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. The notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond a lack of conformity with national law, so that deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary, and therefore contrary to the Convention. To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article 5 § 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the grounds of detention relied on by the Government, the place and conditions of detention must be appropriate, and the length of the detention must not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 74, ECHR 2008; and Rustamov v.

A claim for appropriate just satisfaction from the State Treasury ... is only one of the reliefs that can be sought under [the 2004 Act]. From the point of view of the aims pursued by the act, the primary relief [for a complainant] is to seek a finding that the length of proceedings has been excessive (section 6(2)(1)) and to ask that the court dealing with the case be instructed to take appropriate actions within a fixed time-limit (section 6(2)(3)). First and foremost, the essential aim of [the 2004 Act] is to compel [the court] to conduct the case in an appropriate, efficient procedural manner. ...",
                "Accordingly, having regard to these public-law purposes of the Act, the scope of its temporal application should be established on the basis of the principles of a democratic State ruled by law laid down in Article 2 of the Constitution, rather than with reference to regulations pertaining to private law. Those principles include, among other things, the principle of a rational legislature encompassing the principle that laws may not be applied retroactively. However, it must be stressed that the principle of non-retroactivity is not absolute. It applies only to provisions that aggravate the situation of those concerned; there is no obstacle to introducing retroactively provisions that improve a citizen ’ s legal situation. ...",
                "[H]aving regard to the public interest pursued by ...[the 2004 Act], a partial departure from the principle of non-retroactivity is admissible, and even justified. It should be taken into account that the main rationale behind the enactment of [the 2004 Act] was the ECHR ’ s judgment of 26 October 2000 given in the case of Kudła v. Poland. The Court, considering the growing number of cases involving complaints about breaches of the reasonable-time requirement, changed its case-law and held that if the State ’ s legal order had not envisaged a possibility of having recourse to separate proceedings enabling [a person] to obtain redress for excessive length of proceedings, there was, in addition to a breach of Article 6 § 1, a violation of Article 13 of the Convention. ...",
                "[In consequence], ... [the 2004 Act] applies where a party ’ s right to a hearing within a reasonable time has been violated as a result of the actions or inactivity of a court occurring before its entry into force and where the delay caused by those actions or that inactivity still continues on the date of its entry into force. This solution, ...allows the public-law aim of [the 2004 Act] to be realised from the beginning of its operation; as from its entry into force, all those situations where, despite the fact that the proceedings could have been conducted in a proper manner, they have been protracted owing to the incorrect actions or omissions of the court and this state of affairs continues, can be dealt with without unnecessary delay. ...",

III SPP 14/05) the Supreme Court refused to examine a complaint alleging the excessive length of proceedings that had been conducted in the Warsaw Regional Court at first instance, in the Warsaw Court of Appeal at second instance and, following remittal, again in the Regional Court in so far as the complaint concerned delays before the Regional Court. It referred that part of the complaint to the Court of Appeal for consideration and rejected it in respect of the appellate proceedings since they had been terminated by the judgment remitting the case. It held, inter alia, as follows:",
                "“Pursuant to section 4(1) and (2) of [the 2004 Act], a complaint about the excessive length of proceedings shall be examined by the court immediately above the court before which the impugned proceedings are pending. If a complaint concerns the excessive length of proceedings before a court of appeal or the Supreme Court, it shall be examined by the Supreme Court. The [present] case is undoubtedly pending before the Warsaw Regional Court and, therefore, the competence of the Warsaw Court of Appeal to examine [the complaint] is obvious, at least in so far as the proceedings before the Warsaw Regional Court are concerned. The competence of the Supreme Court could – at most – have been justified in respect of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal but the case is no longer pending before that court. Certainly, there is no basis to consider that the Supreme Court has competence to deal with the complaint in so far as it concerns the proceedings currently pending before the Regional Court.",

                "101. On 10 January 2013 the Prosecutor General lodged a request with the Supreme Court, asking it to adopt a resolution by a bench of seven judges in order to resolve a legal issue that had given rise to divergent views on the interpretation of section 5 (1) of the 2004 Act (see also paragraph 79 above) in the case-law of the Supreme Court and courts of law. The Prosecutor General submitted that in the relevant case-law there existed two contradictory interpretations of the phrase “in the course of the proceedings in a case” referred to in that provision.",
                "In the light of the first interpretation, that wording meant that the court dealing with a length complaint was only competent to examine the stage of the proceedings at which that complaint had been filed. It could not examine the previous stages of the impugned proceedings, that is to say, stages that had been terminated by rulings on the merits in a given instance, even though those rulings had not yet been final. According to that interpretation, a length complaint served to discipline courts ’ actions at the current stage of pending proceedings, as its purpose was to eliminate the trial court ’ s dilatoriness by compelling it to act with the requisite efficiency and to ensure that the case followed its proper course.",
                "In the light of the second interpretation, the phrase “in the course of the proceedings in a case” related to the entirety of proceedings, which were to be assessed as a whole, from their beginning to the final conclusion, taking into account all court instances involved in dealing with the case. The fact that the proceedings at a given, previous instance ended with a ruling on the merits did not preclude the court dealing with a length complain from examining delays at previous instances.",
                "Relying on the Convention and the Court ’ s case-law, the Prosecutor General stated his preference for the second line of interpretation."

                "“When assessing a breach of a party ’ s right to have a case examined without undue delay, should the [relevant] court examine the entire course of judicial proceedings or, when examining a complaint in that respect, can it limit [its assessment] solely to the stage of the proceedings at which the party lodged the complaint under section 5(1) of [the 2004 Act]?”"

                "“In proceedings concerning a complaint about a breach of a party ’ s right to have a case examined without undue delay an assessment of the excessive length of proceedings should include the complainant ’ s arguments relating to the course of the proceedings from their beginning to the end, notwithstanding at which stage of those proceedings the complaint has been lodged (section 5(1) of [the 2004 Act]).”"

            [
                "104. The resolution contained an extensive reasoning, which can be summarised as follows.",
                "As regards the first line of interpretation regarding the scope of examination of a length complaint as defined in section 5(1) of the 2004 Act, the Supreme Court began by reiterating many examples from its previous case-law supporting that approach. However, bearing in mind the Court ’ s case-law in Polish cases dating back to 2005-2007, in particular judgments in the cases of Majewski v. Poland (no. 52690/99, 11 October 2005), Beller v. Poland (no. 51837/99, 1 February 2005) and Tur v. Poland (no. 21695/05, 23 October 2007), it found that the interpretation of the 2004 Act as given in its earlier rulings had to be reconsidered. It stated, among other things:",
                "“Pursuant to Article 13 of the Convention, everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority. In the judgment ... of Kudła v. Poland, the ECHR held that it was necessary to ensure an effective remedy within the meaning of this provision also for a breach of the right to have a case examined in judicial proceedings within a reasonable time,as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Finding a breach of Article 13 of the Convention, the ECHR held that the Polish legal order lacked an effective remedy against the excessive length of proceedings, since the remedies provided for by the national legislation did not guarantee any compensation for the prejudice caused by the excessive length of proceedings nor for any means of accelerating the proceedings. The Court left the choice of remedy to Poland ’ s discretion but at the same time required that any such remedy must be effective in both its procedural and practical aspects.",
                "This means that a[n effective] remedy must prevent a breach of the right to ‘ have a case examined within a reasonable time ’ from arising or continuing or afford appropriate compensation for the breach that has already occurred. ...",
                "In the Polish legal order, this purpose is served by [the 2004 Act]. According to the explanatory notes to the draft [2004 Act], the legislature ’ s main aim was to create a legal mechanism that would compel courts to examine cases. For that reason, pursuant to section 5(1) of [the 2004 Act], a [length] complaint must be lodged in the course of the proceedings in a case.",
                "In the majority of the Supreme Court ’ s current rulings, a complaint about the excessive length of proceedings is considered an ad hoc measure preventing the excessive length of proceedings from continuing [reference to the relevant ruling], as a measure ensuring a swift reaction to a delay in the court ’ s actions and serving to discipline actions performed at a given stage of proceedings still pending [references to further rulings]. According to the case-law, the purpose of the complaint is to eliminate the trial court ’ s delays through compelling it to act efficiently and to ensure that the case follows its proper course [references to numerous further rulings]. ...",
                "Pursuant to sections 15 and 16 of [the 2004 Act], after proceedings on the merits have ended, a party may seek compensation for the damage caused by their excessive length from the State Treasury ... and this applies to situations where a party has not lodged a length complaint during pending proceedings and also to situations where a party ’ s complaint during pending proceedings has been allowed.",
                "Accordingly, “appropriate just satisfaction”, which may be awarded if the complaint is granted, does not constitute full redress in respect of a party ’ s compensatory claims. It follows that the length complaint is a preliminary, ad hoc measure counteracting the current (continuing) excessive delay in proceedings. Its main purpose is first of all to compel [the trial court] to ensure that the case follows its due course. This is achieved, on the one hand, by finding that the excessive length of proceedings has occurred (section 12(2) of [the 2004 Act]), and, on the other hand, by instructing the trial court to take certain actions within a fixed time-limit (section 12(3)). It should also be noted that lodging a complaint about excessive length of proceedings does not prevent a party from asking [the president of the relevant court] for supervisory measures to be taken in respect of the administrative activity of the [trial] court. In consequence, supervisory measures, the length complaint and a claim for compensation after the termination of proceedings on the merits constitute a combination of remedies aimed at counteracting the excessive length of proceedings and, if the delay has already occurred, they ensure appropriate compensation.",
                "In the light of such an interpretation of the provisions of [the 2004 Act], it has been concluded that examination of a length complaint should be focused on the current stage of the impugned proceedings. It follows that arguments concerning prior (closed) stages of the proceedings are considered as being out of time, since they are not consistent with the purpose of [the 2004 Act] as defined by the legislature [references to the relevant rulings dating back to 2005]. Such opinions have also been reiterated in the most recent rulings of the Supreme Court [references to several rulings dating back to 2011-2012]. ...”"
            ],
            [
                "105. The Supreme Court, having assessed its previous interpretation in the light of the Court ’ s case-law, found that a complaint under the 2004 Act, if it were to be limited only to the current stage of proceedings, was not an “effective remedy” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention.",
                "The relevant passages read, in so far as relevant, as follows:",
                "“In the case of Majewski v. Poland (judgment of 11 October 2005, no. 52690/99), the ECHR negatively assessed the examination of length complaints in accordance with this line of interpretation, taking into account only the conduct of the lower court at the stage when the complaint had been lodged. The ECHR underlined that the [Polish] court ’ s assessment covering only the period from the date when the case had been remitted was incompatible with the standards laid down in its case-law, which required [domestic courts] to examine an alleged breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention taking into account the entirety of the impugned proceedings, from their beginning to the end and before all court instances. ...",
                "Given that the ECHR, when assessing an alleged breach of Article 6 of the Convention, takes into account the conduct of courts at all stages of the proceedings, the complaint ... under [the 2004 Act], if interpreted as a measure preventing the excessive length of proceedings only at the current stage of the proceedings, i.e. outside prior (closed) stages of the proceedings, is not an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention because it creates an obstacle to fully compensating [a party], in particular in respect of non-pecuniary damage arising from excessive length of proceedings.”"
            ],
            [
                "106. The Supreme Court further added that:",
                "“If a complaint about excessive length of proceedings is to be regarded as concerning solely the current stage of the proceedings, this in fact means that a party is afforded a right to have this particular stage of the proceedings terminated, rather than to have his case examined without undue delay, i.e. to have it terminated by a final court decision.",
                "In view of the foregoing, it is concluded that a complaint about a breach of a party ’ s right to have a case examined in judicial proceedings without undue delay, perceived as an ad hoc measure in respect of the excessive length of proceedings, is only a substitute for an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention and does not fulfil its role as a legal mechanism serving to exercise the constitutional right of access to a court. Indeed, [such a] complaint does not stop applications concerning the excessive length of proceedings being lodged with the Court but it merely delays them.”"

                "107. In its concluding remarks the Supreme Court referred to the meaning of the “termination of proceedings” and held that judicial proceedings ended on the date on which the second-instance judgment had become final. It stressed that the Supreme Court could not be regarded as a “further instance” as it was situated outside the structure of the courts of law. In consequence, cassation proceedings ( postępowanie kasacyjne ) before the Supreme Court were not, in its view, a continuation of the previous proceedings but constituted a new case for the purposes of a complaint under section 5(1) of the 2004 Act. “The course of the proceedings in the case” as referred to in that section (see also paragraph 79 above) could not, therefore, include proceedings before the Supreme Court, even in situations where the second-instance judgment had been quashed and the case remitted.",

A reform was adopted in 2009, introducing inter alia an increase in the level of compensation; a possibility of the use of supervisory measures by court presidents and superior prosecutors to accelerate pending cases; and, for criminal proceedings, a remedy against excessive length of investigations. Moreover, the authorities committed themselves, in the 2011 action plan, to closely monitor the functioning of the domestic remedy. Finally, in March 2013, the Polish Supreme Court adopted a resolution aimed at clarifying the need to take into account the overall length of proceedings when deciding whether the treatment of a case was excessively lengthy.",

                "172. The application of Article 13 of the Convention to complaints alleging a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time began with the Court ’ s judgment in the case of Kudła v. Poland. Having regard to the continuing accumulation of applications before it in which the only, or principal, allegation was that of excessive length of proceedings, the Court reviewed its previous case-law and held that that provision guaranteed an effective remedy before a national authority for an alleged breach of the “reasonable-time” requirement under Article 6 § 1 (see Kudła, cited above, §§146-56)."
            ],
            [

Italy (no. 1), cited above, § § 182-89, ECHR 2006 ‑ V ); Sürmeli v. Germany ([GC], no. 75529/01, §§ 97 ‑ 101, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII, with further references; Vassilios Athanasiou and Others v. Greece, no. 50973/08, § 55, 21 December 2010; Finger, cited above, § 83; and Ümmühan Kaplan v. Turkey, no. 24240/07, § 72, 20 March 2012 ).",
                "(a) By virtue of Article 1 of the Convention (which provides that “[t]he High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention”), the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention is laid on the national authorities. The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. This subsidiary character is articulated in Article 13 and Article 35 § 1 of the Convention;",
                "(b) Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so. It is therefore necessary to determine in each case whether the means available to litigants in domestic law are “effective” in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred;",
                "(c) Remedies available to a litigant at domestic level for raising a complaint about the length of proceedings are therefore “effective” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention if they can be used either to expedite the proceedings before national courts or to provide the party with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred;",
                "(d) The best solution in absolute terms is indisputably prevention. Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable ‑ time requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Some States have recognised that advantage by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation. However, States can also choose to introduce only a compensatory remedy, without that remedy being regarded as ineffective.",
                "(e) Where a domestic legal system has made provision for bringing an action against the State, such an action must remain an effective, sufficient and accessible remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings.

                "Where the legislature or the domestic courts have agreed to play their proper role by introducing a domestic remedy, the Court will clearly have to draw certain conclusions from this. In particular, where a State has introduced a compensatory remedy, the Court must leave a wider margin of appreciation to the State to allow it to organise the remedy in a manner consistent with its own legal system and traditions and consonant with the standard of living in the country concerned.",

Apart from the fact that the existence of a domestic remedy is fully in keeping with the subsidiarity principle embodied in the Convention, such a remedy is closer and more accessible than an application to the Court, is faster and is processed in the applicant ’ s own language; it thus offers advantages that need to be taken into consideration (ibid. § 268).",

There are instances where delays result from the State ’ s failure to place sufficient resources at the disposal of its judiciary (see Finger, cited above, § 96) or from deficiencies in domestic legislation pertaining to the organisation of its judicial system or the conduct of legal proceedings (see paragraph 128 above and paragraphs 207 and 210 below)."

As explicitly stated in the explanatory notes to the 2004 Act and the 2009 Amendment, the Polish legislature intended the compensation thereby granted to be adequate (see paragraphs 75 and 85 above). That being so, to expect the individuals concerned to have recourse to yet another remedy enabling recovery of compensation for non-pecuniary damage when the primary compensatory remedy has proved to be defective would entail imposing an unjustified and excessive burden on victims of unreasonable delay. It must also be noted that although the civil action relied on by the Government has been considered by the Court to have been effective, that was in a different factual and legal situation, namely where a complaint under 2004 Act had not been available to the applicant (see Krasuski, cited above, §§ 69-72).

This was not the situation in the present case. Complaints under the 2004 Act alleging excessive length of proceedings were not numerous, as demonstrated by the Ministry of Justice ’ s statistics, but constituted merely 0.04% of all cases examined by the Polish courts.

Recently, amendments had been proposed to the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure to accelerate judicial proceedings. Information on the Court ’ s case-law was disseminated among the judges, prosecutors and other employees of the judiciary.

Such measures must also be taken in respect of other persons in the applicant ’ s position, notably by resolving the problems that have led to the Court ’ s findings (see, among other examples, Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII; Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 192-193, ECHR 2004 ‑ V; Lukenda v. Slovenia, no. 23032/02, § 94, ECHR 2005 ‑ X; Burdov v.

Poland judgment, delivered on 11 October 2005, that the Court first reminded the Polish authorities that “as it ha[d] already indicated on a great number of occasions, the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings must be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case taken as a whole. The Court ’ s approach consist[ed] in examining the overall length of proceedings and in covering all stages of the proceedings” (see Majewski, cited above, § 35 ). In the light of that judgment it was therefore evident for the domestic authorities that a court dealing with a complaint under the 2004 Act must consider the entirety of the proceedings and all their stages."

                "214. Although that fundamental principle was repeatedly reiterated in the subsequent judgments disclosing the same defective interpretation of the “reasonable-time” requirement by the Polish courts, including the Supreme Court (see, for instance, Kęsiccy v. Poland, no. 13933/04, § 62, 16 June 2009), the authorities have not changed their approach. On the contrary, the Supreme Court, in its rulings of 2005-12, further endorsed the fragmentation of proceedings (see paragraphs 93-100)."

                "The Court finds it regrettable that that happened despite the fact that the 2004 Act, followed by the 2009 Amendment (see paragraphs 85-89 above), set up a mechanism which, at least in law, had all the features of an effective remedy in the light of the Kudła judgment and the Court ’ s subsequent case-law. That remedy was not only found to have been “effective” in Polish cases but it also served as a model for similar measures adopted in other Contracting States. In particular, in the Scordino (no. 1) judgment the Court held that Poland was among the States that “ha[d] understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation” (see Scordino (no. 1), cited above, § 186)."

                "216. It took some ten years before the Supreme Court decided, on 28 March 2013 that in the light of the Convention standards the principle of fragmentation of proceedings no longer had any basis. It happened only after the present applications had been communicated to the Polish Government and after the Prosecutor General, prompted by the Government Ministers ’ request, had asked the Supreme Court for an interpretative resolution determining the correct meaning of the period relevant for the assessment of reasonableness of proceedings in examination of a complaint under the 2004 Act (see paragraphs 101-107 and 186 above).",
                "The conclusions of the Supreme Court match the Court ’ s findings made in the context of the violation of Article 13 in the present case (see ‑ paragraphs 103-106 and 180-183 above).",
                "It was recognised, among other things, that “the complaint ... under [the 2004 Act], if interpreted as a measure preventing the excessive length of proceedings only at the current stage of the proceedings ... [wa]s not an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 because it create[d] an obstacle to fully compensating [a party], in particular in respect of non ‑ pecuniary damage arising from the excessive length of proceedings”. It was also concluded that if the remedy were perceived merely as an “ ad hoc measure in respect of the excessive length of proceedings”, it would be “only a substitute for an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13” and that, on that account, it did not “fulfil its role as a legal mechanism serving to exercise the constitutional right of access to a court”. Nor did it “stop applications concerning the excessive length of proceedings being lodged with the Court but merely delay[ed] them” (see paragraph 106 above)."
            ],
            [
                "217. The developments of the Court ’ s caseload have fully confirmed the latter conclusion. The main object of the present applications and [650] other similar cases pending before the Court is to seek just satisfaction before the Court for a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time because the applicants were unable to obtain it before the national courts. The direct cause for this situation is the insufficiency of compensation awarded for non-pecuniary damage for unreasonable delays at domestic level (see paragraph 7 above).",
                "As stated above, the second, interrelated cause behind the violation of Article 13 is in the Polish courts ’ non-compliance with the Court ’ s case-law setting out standards for “sufficient and appropriate” redress. The present case and numerous similar cases listed in the annex to the judgment demonstrate that the level of domestic awards is evidently below the threshold fixed by the Court for victim status in the Scordino (no. 1) judgment. The statistical information produced by the parties supports the applicants ’ opinion that progress in adjusting domestic awards is markedly slow. Moreover, it does not appear that the setting of the minimum award and increasing of the maximum award have encouraged the Polish courts to grant higher sums, reasonably related to the Court ’ s standards. The average amounts awarded are at the lower end of the scale set by the 2004 Act and oscillate around the minimum sum of PLN 2,000, in particular as regards complaints examined by the regional courts (see paragraphs 108-117 and 189 and 194 above)."

The reluctance on the part of the national courts to award more substantial amounts may be linked with many factors, which are not for the Court but for the State to identify so that it can ensure compliance with the Convention in the future. However, the Court cannot but note that in the present case each applicant ’ s claim for non-pecuniary damage could have been satisfied in accordance with the Scordino (no. 1) requirements at domestic level, without the need for any of them to address their complaints to the Court – if only the relevant courts had respected the Convention standards. The minimum domestic awards required in each case were all below the maximum ceiling set at PLN 20,000 (see paragraphs 27, 48 and 73 above). It cannot therefore be said that the relevant courts were bound by the statutory limitations on awards or that they did not enjoy a sufficient margin of appreciation in their assessment of the relevant circumstances (see paragraph 174 above)."

In consequence, despite the introduction of a domestic remedy by Poland – a complaint designed to provide “appropriate just satisfaction” for unreasonable length of judicial proceedings (see paragraphs 80 and 89 above), the Court is continually forced to act as a substitute for the national courts and handle hundreds of repetitive cases where its only task is to award compensation which should have been obtained by using a domestic remedy.",
                "This situation, subsisting for already several years in Poland, is not only incompatible with Article 13 but has also led to a practical reversal of the respective roles to be played by the Court and the national courts in the Convention system. It has upset the balance of responsibilities between the respondent State and the Court under Articles 1 and 19 of the Convention. In that regard, the Court would once again reiterate that, in accordance with Article 1, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention is laid on the national authorities and that the machinery of complaint to the Court is only subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see paragraph 170 above and Kudła, cited above, § 152). The Court ’ s task, as defined by Article 19, cannot be said to be best achieved by repeating the same findings of a Convention violation in a series of cases (see also paragraph 202 above)."

                "The Government maintained that that aim had already been achieved since the authorities had already identified the shortcomings in the application of the 2004 Act by the courts and the process of implementation of various legal reforms and other measures was under way. In that context, they stressed the importance of the 2013 Resolution, whereby the Supreme Court had put an end to the previous defective judicial practice of disregarding the Court ’ s case-law (see paragraphs 189-194).",
                "The Court is not persuaded by those arguments. It is true that Poland had intended to adopt, or had already adopted, various measures which were assessed by the Committee of Ministers as positive elements in execution of Polish judgments involving excessive length of judicial proceedings, including the implementation of a remedy under Article 13. Certainly, the Committee of Ministers is better placed than the Court to evaluate the steps taken by the State in the implementation of the general measures under final judgments. The Court will rely on that assessment. It would however note that in the 2013 CM Decision the Committee of Ministers also “expressed ... serious concern in relation to the continued problems with the application of the remedy against the excessive length of civil proceedings and considered that substantive measures [we]re still necessary to correct them” (see paragraph 123 above).",
                "The Court accepts that the 2013 Resolution can be regarded as an important measure aimed at correcting the defective judicial practice and ensuring the Polish courts ’ compliance with the relevant Convention standards. However, it cannot, by itself, suffice to put an end to the systemic situation identified in the present case, especially as it has not yet been established that the lower courts have put it into practice. In contrast, the developments of the Court ’ s caseload in 2013 and 2014 showed an increased inflow of repetitive cases involving length of proceedings and insufficient just satisfaction at domestic level (see paragraph 9 above). Nor can the 2013 Resolution resolve the problems of the past raised in the hundreds of cases already pending before the Court."

Thus, only a delay of approximately two months can be attributed to the applicant, resulting from the two requests for the extension of the time-limit set by the court more than one year after the action was lodged. As to the representation of the applicant the Court notes that only two lawyers were involved before the Administrative Court of Appeal, where the most substantial delay occurred. Furthermore, that court only asked for clarification of the applicant's representation nine months after the second lawyer had intervened. The Court thus cannot find that the additional appointment of legal counsel made the applicant responsible for any delay of the proceedings.

Turning to the conduct of the domestic courts, the Court observes in particular that before the Administrative Court of Appeal alone the proceedings were pending for almost eight years. The first substantial delay took place right at the beginning of the appeal proceedings when the court did not advance the proceedings for more than one and a half years. The next delay, from November 1998 to May 2001, was caused by the ( unsuccessful ) attempt to recover the missing files, which the Court considers to fall within the area of responsibility of the respondent State. The applicant's representative's offer to reassemble the files did not absolve the Administrative Court of Appeal of its duty to continue its efforts to recover the files and to advance the proceedings. But even after the Administrative Court of Appeal had informed the parties that it had been unsuccessful in locating the files it did not conduct the proceedings with due diligence. The hearing scheduled for July 2001 was cancelled; a new hearing was not set until April 2004. The fact that during this time the applicant lodged a motion for bias and applied for legal aid cannot justify the fact that no new hearing was set in almost three years.

Through the competent Commission ’ s decisions at issue, the State recognised that the applicants were entitled to receive compensation. Notwithstanding the fact that domestic law omitted to specify a time for their becoming final, the Court observes that, after more than twelve years, the merits of such decisions were not challenged before any court and, in law, nothing therefore prevented their immediate enforcement.

                "“( ... ) Article 13 guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of this Article is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (see Chahal v. United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, pp. 1869-70, § 145). The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint under the Convention (ibid., pp. 1870-71, §§ 150-51). Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \"effective\" in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see among other authorities Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2286, § 95 and Cobzaru v. Romania, no. 48254/99, § 80, 26 July 2007 ) ”."

Likewise, in cases concerning non-enforcement of judicial decisions, any domestic means to prevent a violation by ensuring timely enforcement is, in principle, of greatest value. However, where a judgment is delivered in favour of an individual against the State, the former should not, in principle, be compelled to use such means (see, mutatis mutandis, Metaxas, cited above, § 19): the burden to comply with such a judgment lies primarily with the State authorities, which should use all means available in the domestic legal system in order to speed up the enforcement, thus preventing violations of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Akashev, cited above, §§ 21-22).",

Where such a compensatory remedy is available in the domestic legal system, the Court must leave a wider margin of appreciation to the State to allow it to organise the remedy in a manner consistent with its own legal system and traditions and consonant with the standard of living in the country concerned. The Court is nonetheless required to verify whether the way in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the Convention principles, as interpreted in the light of the Court’s case-law (see Scordino, cited above, §§ 187-191). The Court has set key criteria for verification of the effectiveness of a compensatory remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings. These criteria, which also apply to non-enforcement cases (see Wasserman, cited above, §§ 49 and 51), are as follows:",

There exists a strong but rebuttable presumption that excessively long proceedings will occasion non-pecuniary damage (see Scordino, cited above, §§ 203 ‑ 204, and Wasserman, cited above, §50). The Court considers this presumption to be particularly strong in the event of excessive delay in enforcement by the State of a judgment delivered against it, given the inevitable frustration arising from the State’s disregard for its obligation to honour its debt and the fact that the applicant has already gone through judicial proceedings and obtained success...”",

In the present case, however, the debtor is a State body and the enforcement of judgments against it, as it appears from the case file, can only be carried out if the State foresees and makes provision for the appropriate expenditures in the State Budget of Ukraine by taking the appropriate legislative measures. The facts of the case show that, throughout the period under consideration, the enforcement of the judgment in question was prevented precisely because of the lack of legislative measures, rather then by a bailiff’s misconduct. The applicant cannot therefore be reproached for not having taken proceedings against the bailiff (see Shestakov v. Russia, decision, no. 48757/99, 18 June 2002).

The Court further reiterates its case-law according to which remedies available to a litigant at domestic level for raising a complaint about the length of proceedings are “effective” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention if they prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred. A remedy therefore fulfils these criteria if it can be used either to expedite a decision by the courts dealing with the case, or to provide the litigant with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (see Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, § 17, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII; and Sürmeli v. Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, § 99, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII ). However, in proceedings in which the length of the proceedings has a clear impact on the applicant ’ s family life (and which thus fall to be examined under Article 8 of the Convention) the Court has considered that a more rigid approach is called for, which obliges the States to put into place a remedy which is at the same time preventive and compensatory (see Macready, cited above, § 48; and Bergmann, cited above, §§ 45-46 ). The Court has observed in this respect that the State ’ s positive obligation to take appropriate measures to ensure the applicant ’ s right to respect for family life risked becoming illusory if the interested parties only had at their disposal a compensatory remedy, which could only lead to an a posteriori award for monetary compensation (see Macready, ibid. ).",

This was in line with the personal impression the judge rapporteur had gained from hearing both parties and the child. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the conflict between the parents, and their ensuing lack of communication, posed a risk to successful contact. However, the course of the proceedings had shown that both parents were unwilling to settle these conflicts by availing themselves of specialist help.

Based on an overall assessment of the circumstances, the District Court considered that only administrative fines within the lowest range could be envisaged. The District Court took into account that, according to a report submitted by an access custodian on 2 October 2010 (see paragraph 45, below) there were serious indications that it would not even have been possible for a professional counsellor to establish contact. Against this background, the mother ’ s personal responsibility appeared to be minor. This was even more so as the mother did not completely prevent contact, but took the child to four of the scheduled meetings. The demands on her educational capabilities had been high, as she had not only been obliged to reconsider her own stance on the problems within a period of a few weeks, but also to change the child ’ s established pattern of behaviour. It had further to be taken into account that comparable contraventions would not have to be sanctioned in the mid-term future, because a contact custodian had been appointed. Against this background, the administrative fine had primarily the character of a sanction for past behaviour, but not of a coercive measure."

Given the highly escalated conflict between the parents, it was already doubtful whether an administrative measure provided for by law could actually represent an appropriate means to enforce contact. The fact that his mother was exposed to administrative fine proceedings had rather intensified the child ’ s rejection of the applicant. Given the extremely complex and contentious situation, the District Court ’ s assessment of the degree of the mother ’ s accountability was comprehensible.

These contact meetings were to be followed by unsupervised visits. On 21 July 2010 the applicant asked the District Court to impose an administrative fine of at least EUR 3,000 on the mother, as none of the visits had taken place as scheduled. On 11 August 2010 the applicant lodged a further request for the remaining dates. On 12 November 2010 the District Court, jointly ruling on both requests, imposed an overall administrative fine of EUR 300 on the mother for having contravened six times the decision on contact rights. Even though the mother paid this sum in June 2011, none of the supervised visits took place as scheduled."

Under the general principles set out above, it is the Court ’ s task to determine whether the domestic authorities took all necessary steps to facilitate the execution of the contact order of 12 May 2010 as could reasonably be demanded in the special circumstances of this case. The Court notes, at the outset, that the District Court ’ s decision contains no information on the financial situation of the mother. Nevertheless, it cannot but observe that the overall administrative fine of EUR 300 appears to be rather low, given that the pertinent provisions allowed for the imposition of a fine of up to EUR 25,000 for each individual case of non-compliance. It is thus doubtful whether this sanction could reasonably have been expected to have a coercive effect on the child ’ s mother, who had persistently prevented contact between the applicant and his son. The Court takes note of the District Court ’ s reasoning that even though the child ’ s mother was accountable for the failed contact, her personal responsibility proved to be minor, as the demands on her educational capabilities had been high and as she had been obliged “not only to reconsider her own stance on the problems within a few weeks, but also to change the child ’ s established pattern of behaviour” (see paragraph 30, above)."

The Court observes in this context that the parties had agreed to institute supervised contact as early as 2005 and that the Frankfurt/Main District Court had first ordered such contact on 22 May 2007 (see Kuppinger, cited above, §§ 7, 16). Having regard to the fact that the mother must have been made aware during the previous court proceedings of her general obligation to allow the applicant contact to his son, it is difficult to follow the District ’ s Court ’ s reasoning that the mother had to reconsider her stance on the problems “within a few weeks”. The Court further observes that the decision contains no information on whether the mother had at least attempted to meet her obligations under the contact order by encouraging the child to meet the applicant. The Court finally observes that the Frankfurt Court of Appeal, in its decision given on 17 September 2014 (see paragraph 80, above), conceded that the administrative fine imposed on the mother might have been insufficient."

Finally, the Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that it was unlikely that the situation would repeat itself, given that the family court had, in the meantime, set up contact custodianship. Even if a contact custodian had more effective means at his disposal than a mere supervisor, it is hardly conceivable that he would be able to achieve his task of implementing contact rights without a certain degree of cooperation on the mother ’ s side."

The Court notes that the District Court did not give a separate decision on the applicant ’ s first request, but awaited the submissions in reply to the subsequent requests before giving a decision. Given the special urgency of the subject matter, the Court is not convinced that the joinder, which caused a delay of several weeks, best served the interest of the efficiency of the proceedings.

It cannot therefore be said that a disappearance is, simply, an “instantaneous” act or event; the additional distinctive element of subsequent failure to account for the whereabouts and fate of the missing person gives rise to a continuing situation. Thus, the positive obligation will, potentially, persist as long as the fate of the person is unaccounted for. This is so even where death may, eventually, be presumed (see, albeit in the context of Articles 2 and 3, Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, § 148, ECHR 2009)."

Whilst it was true that various official reports had been produced after that date, the Government submitted that the applicant could not have “reasonably expected” that any of them would have enabled her to initiate proceedings capable of bringing about the “resolution of her case”.

Where there is a state of ignorance and uncertainty and, by definition, a failure to account for what has happened, if not an appearance of deliberate concealment and obstruction on the part of some authorities, it is more difficult for the relatives of the missing to assess what is happening, or what can be expected to happen. Allowances must be made for the uncertainty and confusion which frequently mark the aftermath of a disappearance. Still, applications can be rejected as out of time where there has been excessive or unexplained delay on the part of applicants once they have, or should have, become aware that no investigation has been instigated or that the investigation has lapsed into inaction or become ineffective and, in any of those eventualities, there is no immediate, realistic prospect of an effective investigation being provided in the future. Where there are initiatives being pursued with regard to a disappearance situation, applicants may reasonably await developments which could resolve crucial factual or legal issues. Indeed, as long as there is some meaningful contact between families and authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a moment when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be provided (see Varnava and Others, cited above, §§ 162 and 165)."

On 16 April 2010 the local media reported that the President of the Parliament had stated that a parliamentary working group was about to be formed in order to prepare new legislation aimed at providing redress to the parents of the “missing babies” (see paragraph 28 above). Lastly, in his report of 29 July 2010 the Serbian Ombudsman opined that the parents remained entitled to know the truth regarding the real fate of their children, and proposed the enactment of a lex specialis in that regard (see paragraph 29 (f) above)."

The Government further produced three judgments of the Supreme Court in which the claimants had been awarded compensation for the harm suffered as a consequence of medical errors and police misconduct, and one ruling setting aside a district court’s decision adopted in the latter context (see Rev. nos. 1118/03, 807/05 and 51/07 of 10 April 2003, 1 December 2005 and 13 March 2007, respectively).

It was true that the said complaint had been lodged in 2003, but the applicant had been unable to obtain any relevant evidence or expect any redress prior to then. Put simply, the “missing-babies issue” had been taboo until 2001, when the parents concerned had started organising themselves, the media had begun extensively reporting on it, and even Parliament had debated the issue at its plenary sessions. It should further be noted that, in the meantime, applicable criminal and civil limitation periods had come into force."

The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, for example, Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, § 15, ECHR 2002-VIII). The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his or her Convention grievances. To be effective, a remedy must be capable of remedying directly the impugned state of affairs (see Balogh v. Hungary, no. 47940/99, § 30, 20 July 2004). The Court has likewise frequently emphasised the need to apply the exhaustion rule with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Ringeisen v.

Once this burden has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement (see Dankevich v.

That complaint was rejected by the public prosecutor’s office, however, without any indication as to whether any preliminary investigation had been carried out (see paragraph 17 above).

They could also, possibly, have ordered other forms of redress “capable” of affording non-pecuniary satisfaction. Neither of those measures, however, could have effectively remedied the applicant’s underlying complaint, which was her need for information as to “the real fate of her son”. The Government have certainly offered no evidence to the contrary. The Court notes, lastly, that neither Parliament nor the Ombudsman addressed this issue in their respective reports. Indeed, if anything, by recommending the enactment of a lex specialis they appear to have suggested that no existing domestic remedies, including the said civil claim, could have been effective (see paragraphs 27 (d), 28 and 29 (f) above)."

                "70. The Court observes that the applicant had an “arguable” claim that the search of his office amounted to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. He was, then, entitled to an effective domestic remedy in that respect. The Court does not consider that in the circumstances the notion of effective remedy went as far as calling for the opening of criminal proceedings against the persons who had carried out the search. Therefore, the refusal of the prosecuting authorities to open such proceedings (see paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 above) did not in itself amount to a breach of Article 13. However, the Court notes that the Government did not point to any other avenue of redress which the applicant could have used to vindicate his right to respect for his private life, nor did they refer to any relevant domestic court judgments or decisions. They have thus failed to show that any remedies existed in respect of the unlawful search in issue (see, mutatis mutandis, Vereinigung demokratischer Soldaten Österreichs and Gubi v. Austria, judgment of 19 December 1994, Series A no. 302, p. 20, § 53; and Yankov v. Bulgaria, no. 39084/97, § 154, 11 December 2003 ). There has therefore been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 8."

He was a close friend of Mr N.D., a prosecutor at the Supreme Administrative Prosecutor's Office, who had become widely known for his public accusations against the Chief Prosecutor, Mr N.F., and for his assertions that the Chief Prosecutor and his entourage were harassing him and exerting improper pressure on him, and who committed suicide on 24 April 2000, leaving a note which said that the Chief Prosecutor should resign."

In that letter he made a number of allegations against the Chief Prosecutor, Mr N. F. He averred that the latter had groundlessly discontinued criminal proceedings against high-ranking persons from the executive branch, and had exploited the Prosecutor's Office for the purpose of reprisals against political opponents of the ruling party and his own opponents. The applicant also claimed that the Chief Prosecutor had created a fearful and morbid working atmosphere in the Prosecutor's Office by acting rudely and insultingly towards his subordinates, even, as rumour had it, occasionally physically assaulting them. He further claimed that, according to certain rumours, the Chief Prosecutor had heavily beaten his former wife and a female judge. According to the same rumours, the Chief Prosecutor was mentally ill and suffered from paranoia, for which he had undergone treatment in a psychiatric hospital. According to the applicant, all these rumours had to be verified by the Supreme Judicial Council. The applicant also alleged that the Chief Prosecutor had deliberately tried to wreck the Criminological Studies Council by harassing members of its staff. The applicant further averred that the Chief Prosecutor and his entourage, who had repeatedly uttered threats against the late Mr N.D., were responsible for the latter's death. According to the applicant, that event had to be investigated with a view to determining whether the Chief Prosecutor had incited Mr N.D.'s suicide, which was a criminal offence. Finally, the applicant submitted that he had intended to resign because of the bad atmosphere in the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor's Office, but had eventually decided that the more proper thing to do was to continue performing his work and opposing the nuisance generated by the Chief Prosecutor from within."

On the contrary, it was evident from the facts that his draft resignation letter had been taken from his office by a person having access to it during the period from 12 to 15 May 2000 and had been submitted by that person to the Chief Prosecutor.

On the basis of these findings made by the national courts, the Court is satisfied that at some point between 12 and 15 May 2000, most probably on the evening of 12 May 2000, the applicant's office was searched by officials – either the prosecutor S.D. or others – of the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor's Office, who took the applicant's draft resignation letter from the drawer of his desk."

It has made reference to this test in other cases as well (see P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 57, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX; Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 58, ECHR 2003 ‑ I; and Von Hannover v.

The Court considers that, in view of its similarity to the cases cited above, the situation obtaining in the present case should also be assessed under the “ reasonable expectation of privacy ” test. In the Court's opinion, the applicant did have such an expectation, if not in respect of the entirety of his office, at least in respect of his desk and his filing cabinets. This is shown by the great number of personal belongings that he kept there (see paragraph 14 above). Moreover, such an arrangement is implicit in habitual employer-employee relations and there is nothing in the particular circumstances of the case – such as a regulation or stated policy of the applicant's employer discouraging employees from storing personal papers and effects in their desks or filing cabinets – to suggest that the applicant's expectation was unwarranted or unreasonable. The fact that he was employed by a public authority and that his office was located on government premises does not of itself alter this conclusion, especially considering that the applicant was not a prosecutor, but a criminology expert employed by the Prosecutor's Office (see paragraph 5 above). Therefore, a search which extended to the applicant's desk and filing cabinets must be regarded as an interference with his private life."

The national courts found that the person who had carried out the search, be it the same prosecutor S.D. or another person, had access to the Courts of Justice building, admittance to which was restricted, and was apparently connected to the Chief Prosecutor (see paragraph 20 above). The material obtained during the search was later brought before the Chief Prosecutor and was used by him to terminate the applicant's employment (see paragraph 12 above). In these circumstances, there is no reason to assume that the search was an act carried out by persons in their private capacity. It is immaterial whether the persons who carried out the search acted as public prosecutors or as representatives of the applicant's employer, the Prosecutor's Office, because in any event they were acting as agents of the State. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the responsibility of a State under the Convention may arise for the acts of all its organs, agents and servants. Acts accomplished by persons in an official capacity are imputed to the State in any case. In particular, the obligations of a Contracting Party under the Convention can be violated by any person exercising an official function vested in him (see, mutatis mutandis, Wille v. Liechtenstein [GC], no. 28396/95, § 46, ECHR 1999 ‑ VII). The Court thus concludes that the search amounted to an interference by a public authority with the applicant's right to respect for his private life."

The purpose of these proceedings was thus to give effect to the applicant's labour rights, not to protect his freedom of expression as such (see, mutatis mutandis, Harabin v.

On this point, the Court notes that the sealing off of the applicant's office took place outside the normal hours of business and within an extremely short time ‑ span after the publication of his letter. The search took place either immediately before or shortly after the office had been sealed off. The applicant's dismissal, which was engineered on the basis of material obtained during the search, followed three days later, immediately after the weekend. During that time the applicant was not allowed access to his office (see paragraphs 9 ‑ 12 above). This sequence of events appears significant to the Court, especially when weighed up against the contents of the applicant's published letter, in which he made grave accusations against the Chief Prosecutor and denounced certain workplace practices which the latter had established (see paragraph 7 above). Moreover, the Government did not exclude the possibility that the applicant's dismissal had been the result of the publication of his letter (see paragraph 49 above). The Court therefore concludes that the string of measures taken against the applicant was indeed a result of that publication and that these measures amounted to restrictions and penalties within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention, that is, an interference with his freedom of expression."
