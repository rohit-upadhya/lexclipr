In these specific situations, customary international law and treaty provisions have clearly recognised and defined the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction by the relevant State (ibid., § 73)."

It was not flying a flag, but was identified as the Winner. The merchant ship suddenly changed course and began to steer a course that was dangerous both for the frigate and for members of the armed forces who had boarded a speedboat. While the Winner refused to answer the attempts of the commander of the frigate to establish radio contact, its crew jettisoned a number of packages into the sea; one of the packages, containing about 100 kilos of cocaine, was recovered by the French seamen. After several warnings and warning shots fired under orders from France’s maritime prefect for the Atlantic went unheeded, the French frigate fired a shot directly at the Winner. The merchant ship then answered by radio and agreed to stop. When they boarded the Winner, the French commando team used their weapons to open certain locked doors. When a crew member of the Winner refused to obey their commands, a “warning shot” was fired at the ground, but the bullet ricocheted and the crew member was wounded. He was immediately evacuated onto the French frigate, then transferred to Dakar hospital, where he died a week later."

After retracing the details of the operations, including the fact that “on 13 June at 6 a.m. the French frigate spotted a merchant ship – first on its radar, then visually – travelling at slow speed and flying no flag, and identified it as the Winner ”, it pronounced judgment in the following terms:",
                "“Considering that the international effort to combat drug trafficking is governed by three conventions: the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 30 March 1961, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed at Montego Bay on [10] December 1982, and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, signed in Vienna on 20 December 1988; while France has signed and ratified all three conventions, Cambodia has not signed the Vienna Convention, Article 17 § 3 of which provides for derogations from the traditional principle of the ‘law of the flag State’.",
                "Considering that the applicants wrongly suggest in this case that in keeping with the traditional rule codified in Article 92 of the Montego Bay Convention, the authority of a State on ships on the high seas flying its flag is both full and exclusive and that coercion may be used to ensure that the rules of international law and the State’s own law are respected as Article 108 of that Convention, on ‘Illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances’, stipulates:",
                "1. All States shall cooperate in the suppression of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances engaged in by ships on the high seas contrary to international conventions.",
                "2. Any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying its flag is engaged in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances may request the cooperation of other States to suppress such traffic.",
                "Considering that, based on that text and ‘with reference’ to the earlier United Nations Convention of 30 March 1961 against international drug trafficking, the French authorities were within their rights to request Cambodia’s cooperation with a view to obtaining that country’s authorisation to intercept the Winner in order to put a stop to the drug trafficking in which all or part of its crew was suspected of being involved; that as the provisions of the Vienna Convention do not apply to Cambodia, it was for that State to ask the French authorities for all the relevant information concerning the alleged drug trafficking to enable it to assess the merits of the request using its unfettered discretion; that the diplomatic telegram sent by the French embassy on 7 June 2002, which actually mentions the reasoned request submitted by the OCRTIS, suffices to establish the existence of an agreement given without restrictions or reservations by the government of Cambodia for the planned interception and all its consequences, and is authoritative until proven otherwise; that on this point the applicants cannot contend that the document does not meet the formal requirements of Article 17 § 3 of the Vienna Convention concerning bilateral agreements between parties, when they are also arguing that the Vienna Convention is not applicable to Cambodia because it has not signed it; and that the value of the diplomatic document is not affected by the fact that the accused did not know the exact status of the person who signed the message or the person who transmitted the Cambodian government’s agreement to the French embassy.",
                "Considering, on the other hand, that in proceeding to intercept the Winner it was the duty of the French authorities to comply with the procedures provided for both in the Vienna Convention signed by France – in particular to ‘take due account of the need not to endanger the safety of life at sea, the security of the vessel and its cargo’ – and in the Law of 15 July 1994, as amended by the Law of 29 April 1996 adapting French law to Article 17 of the Vienna Convention, Articles 12 et seq. of which define the sphere of competence of commanders of naval vessels and the procedures for the search, reporting, prosecution and judgment in the French courts of drug trafficking offences committed at sea.",
                "Considering that the reports drawn up by the commander of the Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Hénaff, duly authorised by the maritime prefect for the Atlantic, which are authoritative until proven otherwise, state that when the frigate drew within sight of the Winner, off the Cape Verde islands, the merchant ship was flying no flag and its captain not only failed to answer the requests to identify his ship, in breach of the rules of international law, and to stop his ship, but responded aggressively with a series of dangerous manoeuvres that jeopardised the safety of the French frigate and the lives of the sailors on board the speedboat; that it was also reported that the crew of the Winner were seen to be throwing suspicious parcels overboard, one of which was recovered and found to contain a large quantity of cocaine; that all these elements together amounted to reasonable grounds for the commander of the frigate to suspect that he was in the presence of drug traffickers who had jettisoned their cargo before attempting to escape; and that by using force to board the Winner and taking appropriate coercive measures to control the crew and confine them to their cabins and to take over and sail the ship, the commander of the frigate acted in strict compliance with:",
                "– the provisions of Article 17 § 4 of the Vienna Convention under which, if evidence of involvement in illicit traffic is found after a ship has been boarded and searched, appropriate action may be taken with respect to the vessel and the persons and cargo on board,",
                "– the provisions of the Law of 15 July 1994 as supplemented by the Law of 29 April 1996, which, in its general provisions (Articles 1 to 10) regulates recourse to coercive measures comprising, if necessary, the use of force in the event of refusal by a ship to submit to control and also, in the particular case of the fight against drug trafficking (Articles 12 to 14), makes provision for the implementation of the control and coercion measures provided for under international law.",
                "Considering that, regard being had to the distinctly aggressive conduct of the captain of the Winner in attempting to evade inspection by the French naval authorities, and to the attitude of the crew members, who took advantage of the time thus gained to eliminate any traces of the drug trafficking by deliberately throwing the evidence overboard, the members of the commando unit who boarded the ship found themselves in the presence of large-scale international trafficking and were likely at any moment to come up against a hostile and potentially dangerous crew who could threaten the security of their mission; that they were obliged to use their weapons in response to the resistance put up by one of the ship’s crew; that it cannot be claimed that Article 13 of the Law of 15 July 1994 as amended provides only for administrative assistance measures and excludes any form of coercion in respect of people when it stipulates in general terms that the competent maritime authorities are authorised to carry out or have carried out ‘the inspection and coercion measures provided for in international law’, and Article 17 § 4 (c) of the Vienna Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs [and Psychotropic Substances] expressly mentions taking ‘appropriate action with respect to the persons on board’; that although the nature of these measures is not specified, the text at least provides for the possibility for the competent naval authorities to limit, if necessary, the freedom of the boarded ship’s crew to come and go, otherwise the provision would be meaningless and the safety of the men taking over control of the ship would be seriously jeopardised; that it cannot be ruled out in the course of such operations against international drug traffickers on the high seas that the crew may have weapons hidden away and may seek to regain control of the ship by force; that consequently, confining the members of the crew of the Winner – all but the wounded man, who was transferred to the frigate – to their cabins under the guard of the commando unit, so that the ship could be safely taken over and rerouted, fell within the appropriate measures provided for in Article 17 § 4 (c) of the Vienna Convention.",
                "Considering that the Law of 15 July 1994 necessarily requires some departure from ordinary criminal procedure to allow for the specific needs of the effort to combat drug trafficking by ships on the high seas, in keeping with the rules of international law, and for the fact that it is impossible in practice, bearing in mind the time needed to sail to the new port of destination, to apply the ordinary rules governing detention and the right to be brought promptly before a judge; and, that being so, that the restrictions placed on the movements of the boarded ship’s crew, as authorised in such cases by the United Nations Convention signed in Vienna on 20 December 1988, were not at variance with Article 5 § 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and did not amount to unlawful detention; and that it should be noted that as soon as the Winner docked in Brest, its crew were handed over to the police, immediately informed of their rights and placed in custody, then brought before the investigating judge.",

It found it sufficient to rely on Article 108 of the Montego Bay Convention, which provides: ‘Any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying its flag is engaged in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances may request the cooperation of other States to suppress such traffic.’ On the other hand, when carrying out the interception, a State Party to the Vienna Convention which stops such a ship – in this case, France – must comply with the rules laid down therein and may thus rely on the provisions of Article 17 of the Vienna Convention, concerning coercion measures.

On this last point the Chamber noted that although measures taken under the Law of 15 July 1994 were taken under the supervision of the public prosecutor, the public prosecutor was not a “competent legal authority” within the meaning the Court’s case-law gave to that notion (see Schiesser v.

They maintained that it could not be considered as a delegation of jurisdiction to France. Even assuming, for argument’s sake, that such an ad hoc agreement did justify French intervention in keeping with the principle of public international law that a State could relinquish part of its sovereignty other than by a convention, they alleged that the limits of such an exceptional transfer of power had been considerably exceeded in the present case. According to the Government’s own submissions, the agreement had merely concerned a “request to intercept”, while the Cambodian government had only authorised the “stopping” of the ship (“ arraisonnement ” in French). Strictly speaking, this consisted solely in stopping the ship at sea or on arrival in port to make certain verifications (concerning its identity and its nationality, for example): it did not extend to searches or arrests on board the ship. Yet that was what had happened in this case: the applicants had been arrested and confined to their cabins for thirteen days. Their detention on board the Winner and their judgment in another country had not been authorised by Cambodia. The applicants thus challenged the existence of any ad hoc agreement justifying the stopping of the Winner and considered that even if there had been such an agreement, it did not justify the detention of the crew following the French military operation."

In their preliminary observations the Government stressed that the events in this case had taken place on the high seas, so that it was necessary to take into account the specificities of the maritime environment and of navigation at sea. In the Government’s submissions this had two specific consequences. First of all, the Convention was completely silent about maritime matters and the Government argued that it was possible to draw a parallel with the solution adopted by the Court in cases concerning the handing over of persons by one State to another in the context of extradition (see Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, ECHR 2005-IV; Freda v. Italy, no. 8916/80, Commission decision of 7 October 1980, Decisions and Reports (DR) 21, p. 254; Altmann (Barbie) v.

Secondly, they submitted that freedom to come and go on board a ship had more restrictive limits, which were the confines of the ship itself: the lawful rerouting of a ship therefore necessarily authorised restrictions on the movements of the people on board; the specificities and the risks of navigation at sea justified the extensive powers enjoyed by ships’ captains. The Government inferred that the applicants had not been deprived of their liberty within the meaning of Article 5 but had been subjected to restrictions of liberty that were justified, restrictions they were challenging on a purely formalistic and litigious basis.

The Government considered in any event that the agreement given by Cambodia to the French authorities by diplomatic note had made the intervention of the French navy perfectly lawful from the international law perspective. The Montego Bay Convention well illustrated the signatory States’ aim of “cohabitation” in what belonged to all and yet to none, by strictly defining the conditions in which a State could interfere with another State’s sovereignty by having a naval vessel inspect a ship flying a foreign flag. And although Cambodia was not a party to the Vienna Convention, the agreement which that sovereign State had given by diplomatic note had been self-sufficient with regard to the principles of public international law and the law of the sea. The diplomatic note of 7 June 2002 had authorised the stopping of the ship and all “its consequences”, as confirmed by the Cambodian authorities in their note of 9 September 2008. In such circumstances the agreement concerned had provided a legal basis for the rerouting of the Winner and its crew."

As the sea could be a “safe haven” (see Öcalan, cited above, § 88) for traffickers, international law had provided for the flag State to be able to delegate its power to combat this type of crime. The Government further noted that in Rigopoulos v. Spain ((dec.), no. 37388/97, ECHR 1999-II), the Court had found that the verbal agreement given to Spain by Panama had been sufficient to make the operations lawful under public international law."

They submitted that in any event the Investigation Division had not based its findings solely on Article 17 of the Vienna Convention, but also on the general provisions of Law no. 94-589 of 15 July 1994, which empowered commanders of naval vessels responsible for surveillance at sea to carry out, or have carried out “inspection and coercion measures”. They accordingly considered that that part of the law had provided a legal basis for the measures complained of, because the ship was suspected of drug trafficking and because it had been flying no flag, had refused to identify itself and had responded aggressively by making dangerous manoeuvres."

As to the quality of the legal basis, which the Chamber had questioned, the Government maintained that the specificity of the law of the sea had to be taken into consideration to appreciate the precise meaning of the legal standards; the French Law of 15 July 1994, in conjunction with Cambodia’s agreement in conformity with the provisions of Article 17 § 4 of the Vienna Convention and the Montego Bay Convention, had authorised the rerouting of the ship. So, as the law provided for the ship to be rerouted, it also provided for restriction of the freedom of movement of those on board, as the two were inseparable. According to the Government, the rerouting was nevertheless to be considered as a preliminary to the suspects being brought before the judicial authorities."

The Government considered that the allegation that it had not been possible for the applicants to contact a relative or a lawyer was unfounded, as the technical conditions for such contact were not always available; besides, as the applicants had not established that they had been in contact with their families or their lawyers prior to the interception by the French navy, their practical situation had not been altered by the rerouting of their ship. The Government also pointed out that the length of the voyage had merely been a material contingency and that the applicants had not been questioned during the thirteen days spent on board, naval personnel having no power to take such action. Accordingly, the Government considered that the right to contact a lawyer or a family member would have been theoretical and illusory."

On this last point the Government developed arguments demonstrating the guarantees of the independence of public prosecutors in terms of their status, the way they were recruited, their powers and their institutional role.

Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, § 62, Series A no. 310).

When the Winner was spotted off Cape Verde on 13 June 2002, the frigate issued several warnings and fired warning shots, before firing directly at the merchant ship, under orders from France’s maritime prefect for the Atlantic. When they boarded the Winner, the French commando team were obliged to use their weapons to defend themselves, and subsequently kept the crew members under their exclusive guard and confined them to their cabins during the journey to France, where they arrived on 26 June 2002. The rerouting of the Winner to France, by a decision of the French authorities, was made possible by sending a tug out of Brest harbour to tow the ship back to the French port, escorted by another warship, the frigate Commandant Bouan, all under orders from the maritime prefect and at the request of the Brest public prosecutor."

Its aim is to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of this liberty in an arbitrary fashion. In order to determine whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5 the starting-point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III).

The crew members were placed under the control of the French special forces and confined to their cabins during the voyage. True, the Government maintained that during the voyage the restrictions were relaxed. In the Court’s view that does not alter the fact that the applicants were deprived of their liberty throughout the voyage as the ship’s course was imposed by the French forces."

Nevertheless, the special nature of the maritime environment relied upon by the Government in the instant case cannot justify an area outside the law where ships’ crews are covered by no legal system capable of affording them enjoyment of the rights and guarantees protected by the Convention which the States have undertaken to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction, any more than it can provide offenders with a “safe haven”.",

It does not provide in general for States to request cooperation whenever they suspect a ship not flying their flag of such trafficking. The Court considers that Article 108 does not provide any legal basis for the action taken by the French authorities in this case. As Cambodia is not party to the Montego Bay Convention, it cannot have been acting under that Convention when it sent its diplomatic note of 7 June 2002.

Lastly, while the provisions of the Montego Bay Convention concerning illegal drug trafficking on the high seas appear to suggest that the issue was not a part of customary law when that Convention was signed, the Government have not shown that there has since been any constant practice on the part of the States capable of establishing the existence of a principle of customary international law generally authorising the intervention of any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying the flag of another State is engaged in illicit traffic in drugs."

It is an undisputed fact that the meeting of the frigate Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Hénaff and the Winner owed nothing to chance. The Winner was under the observation of the American, Spanish and Greek drug control agencies when the Central Office Against Illegal Drug Trafficking (“the OCRTIS”), which suspected it of transporting a large quantity of drugs for the European market, requested authorisation to intercept it. The ship’s nationality being known in fact as early as 7 June 2002, the French embassy requested Cambodia’s consent to the French authorities’ intervention; that agreement was given in a diplomatic note of 7 June 2002 and the Ministry of Defence in Paris was immediately informed. Thus, by 7 June 2002 at the latest the Winner had been precisely identified as a ship flying the Cambodian flag, as expressly stated in the diplomatic note sent by the Cambodian authorities. As to the frigate Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Hénaff, it had been at anchor in Brest harbour, and had already been assigned another mission off the African coast when, instead, it was specially instructed to set sail immediately to intercept the Winner. In order to carry out this clearly defined mission it took on board a French navy special forces team specialised in boarding vessels at sea, as well as three experts from the OCRTIS."

The circumstances of the case do not support such an assertion.

On this point the Court observes first of all that the text of the diplomatic note mentions “the ship Winner, flying the Cambodian flag”, the sole object of the agreement, confirming the authorisation to intercept, inspect and take legal action against it (see paragraph 10 above). Evidently, therefore, the fate of the crew was not covered sufficiently clearly by the note and so it is not established that their deprivation of liberty was the subject of an agreement between the two States that could be considered to represent a “clearly defined law” within the meaning of the Court’s case ‑ law. As to the explanatory diplomatic note produced by the Cambodian authorities on 9 September 2008 in response to a request from the French authorities of 3 September 2008 and submitted by the respondent Government for the first time to the Grand Chamber, after the Chamber pronounced its finding of a violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention and more than six years after the events, the applicants having had no opportunity at the material time to familiarise themselves with the explanations given, the Court does not consider it decisive."

                "100. Secondly, the Court considers that the diplomatic note did not meet the “foreseeability” requirement either. Nor have the Government demonstrated the existence of any current and long-standing practice between Cambodia and France in the battle against drug trafficking at sea in respect of ships flying the Cambodian flag; on the contrary, the use of an ad hoc agreement by diplomatic note, in the absence of any permanent bilateral or multilateral treaty or agreement between the two States, attests to the exceptional, one-off nature of the cooperation measure adopted in this case. Added to the fact that Cambodia had not ratified the relevant conventions, this shows that the intervention of the French authorities on the basis of an ad hoc agreement cannot reasonably be said to have been “foreseeable” within the meaning of the Court’s case-law, even with the help of appropriate advice. In any event, the Court considers that the foreseeability, for an offender, of prosecution for drug trafficking should not be confused with the foreseeability of the law pleaded as the basis for the intervention. Otherwise, any activity considered criminal under domestic law would release the States from their obligation to pass laws having the requisite qualities, particularly with regard to Article 5 § 1 of the Convention and, in so doing, deprive that provision of its substance."

It is regrettable, in the Court’s view, that the international effort to combat drug trafficking on the high seas is not better coordinated bearing in mind the increasingly global dimension of the problem. The fact remains that when a flag State, like Cambodia in this case, is not a party to the Montego Bay or Vienna Conventions, the insufficiency of such legal instruments, for want of regional or bilateral initiatives, is of no real consequence. In fact, such initiatives are not always supported by the States in spite of the fact that they afford the possibility of acting within a clearly defined legal framework. In any event, for States that are not parties to the Montego Bay and Vienna Conventions one solution might be to conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements, like the San José Agreement of 2003, with other States. Having regard to the gravity and enormity of the problem posed by illegal drug trafficking, developments in public international law which embraced the principle that all States have jurisdiction as an exception to the law of the flag State would be a significant step in the fight against illegal trade in narcotics. This would bring international law on drug trafficking into line with what has already existed for many years now in respect of piracy."

On this point they noted that the interception had been planned for several weeks and the investigation opened no later than 24 June 2002: the two or three extra days in police custody had therefore been unnecessary.

Switzerland, 23 October 1990, Series A no. 188; and Brincat v. Italy, 26 November 1992, Series A no. 249-A), in particular because of his lack of independence vis ‑ à ‑ vis the executive. They maintained that the purely formal criterion relied on by the Government was ineffective in the light of the functional criterion developed by the Court in its case-law, as confirmed in the Chamber judgment. Thus, unlike the Spanish authorities in the Rigopoulos case, where the deprivation of liberty had been decided by the Central Investigating Court, an officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, by means of a promptly issued, duly reasoned detention order, the French authorities had made no attempt to regularise the applicants’ situation. Yet their ship was not an “area outside the law”, especially considering that an investigating judge could have been contacted by radio, and the crew could have been informed of their rights and allowed to contact a lawyer and alert a family member. In addition to the resulting alleged violation of Article 5 § 3, the applicants, referring to the partially dissenting opinion expressed by three of the Chamber judges, pointed out that they had had to wait another two or three days to be brought before the liberties and detention judge."

Investigating judges were fully independent judges whose job was to seek evidence both for and against the accused party, without participating in the prosecution or the judgment of the cases they investigated. In France the investigating judge supervised all custodial measures taken in the cases under his responsibility – be it police custody or detention pending trial – and could terminate them at any time.

The respondent Government have not argued that the investigation into the death of the applicant ’ s husband did not attract Lithuania ’ s responsibility because he died when ‘ the ship was on a voyage in the Atlantic Ocean near the Brazilian port of Imbituba ’ (see paragraph 19 above). Be that as it may, the Court has already recognised that instances of the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction by a State to include cases involving the activities on board of ships registered in, or flying the flag of, that State (see Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others (dec.) [GC], no. 52207/99, § § 59-61, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII, and Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, § 65, ECHR 2010). In the instant case the Court observes that the Vega belonged to a Lithuanian company Limarko, the ship was registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania and sailed under a Lithuanian flag (see paragraphs 6, 33, 44 and 53 above). Under Lithuanian legislation, the Vega ’ s captain exercised exclusive control over the ship while it was on a voyage (see, mutatis mutandis, Medvedyev, cited above, § § 6 5-67 ). The relations between the ship ’ s crew and the captain, including those related to safety at work, were determined by Lithuanian laws (see paragraph 53 above). The Court therefore considers that the special features of this case do not absolve Lithuania from an obligation to carry out an effective investigation (see Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, no. 25965/04, § § 243-247, ECHR 2010 (extracts))."

The sailors testified that V.B., who was a refrigerator mechanic, worked in the machinery section of the ship, where the refrigerators were placed. There had been frequent fires in the machinery section of the ship during the voyage by the Vega. When fires broke out, there was a strong smell of fumes. When there was a fire in the machinery section, the air conditioning in the ship ’ s cabins did not work, and the temperature would rise as high as 50 ˚C. In the run up to 24 October 2007, the ship had been preparing to have goods loaded. For that reason, V.B. had worked for about a week prior to his death in the machinery section preparing refrigerators for the shipment. The applicant ’ s husband was seen working in the machinery section both with and without a gas mask. In the week before his death, V.B. had worked intensively and rested little. No repairs in the machinery section had been carried out until V.B. ’ s death. After the death, the ship had been repaired in a Brazilian port, after which there had been no smell of gas in the machinery section.

The SLI held that the reasons for V.B. ’ s death were not connected to his work. The SLI discontinued its investigation, on the grounds that V.B. ’ s death certificate had indicated that he had died of a heart attack, and that the authorisation to preserve his body had read that there had been no indication against such an action. When examining the applicant ’ s complaint, the SLI had obtained internal correspondence between Limarko and the Vega, which showed that the working conditions on the ship had been hard – the ship ’ s machinery, including the main engine, would often break down, and the engine emitted combustion gases into the ship; there had also been frequent fires. However, according to the SLI, V.B. ’ s duties did not include repairs to the main engine or extinguishing fires, and he had not done such jobs. The SLI did not have any other proof that the working conditions on the Vega had been harmful.

The prosecutor also relied on the testimony given by an expert, V. A. during the hearing in April 200 8 before the Klaipėda Regional Administrative Court (see paragraph 49 below). On the basis of V.B. ’ s medical record of 15 June 2001 that expert had testified that V.B. had a partial blockage of the nerve in the heart which makes the heart contract. If the nerve did not work properly, heart arrhythmia could occur, which could in turn cause a heart attack. The position of V.B. ’ s body was typical of someone who had died of a heart attack. According to that expert, fire could cause a heart attack if a person had been in a smoky environment or a closed space, and there had been a lack of oxygen. However, a heart attack would happen at a slower pace than a person would die of suffocation. Death from a heart attack caused by a fire could not take a day or week to happen.",

In particular, the applicant submitted that the SLI ’ s decision not to treat the death as an accident at work had been hasty. The applicant was also dissatisfied that the SLI had not inspected the Vega itself, nor had it questioned the crew members, who could have confirmed the unsafe working conditions on board. There had also been no autopsy, nor any test for toxins in her husband ’ s skin or hair. The body had been embalmed too quickly, without such examinations. The applicant further submitted that Lithuanian diplomats had not been present when the body had been embalmed. The applicant also pointed out that her husband had been healthy: he had been examined by a doctors ’ commission in April 2007 and that that conclusion was valid for one year; moreover, her husband had not complained about any heart issue. The applicant also maintained that even local journalists in the town in Brazil where V.B. ’ s death had been given as a heart attack had not been able to find contact data for doctor P. C.

She had also asked for documents confirming whether it had been verified that V.B. could have died of poisoning by combustion gases; for the questioning of doctor V.G. , who had signed the conclusion of the doctors ’ commission ( of April 200 7 ) as to V.B. ’ s health; and for other investigative actions. Given that the applicant had had the status of a victim, the prosecutor had been under an obligation to take a decision on those requests. However, he had ignored the applicant ’ s requests for three months, until he had taken the decision to discontinue the criminal investigation, which had been in breach of Article 178 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( see paragraph 52 below )."

It emphasised that what was at issue was a criminal investigation into charges of a violation of requirements to protect health and safety at work. Having examined the pre-trial investigation material, the regional court concluded that the kind of breaches alleged by the applicant had not been properly examined during the criminal investigation. Furthermore, as could be seen from the SLI ’ s report of 27 March 2008, the inquiry performed by that body had not been sufficiently comprehensive either (see paragraph 1 7 above). Accordingly, it could not be stated that the pre-trial investigation into the circumstances of V.B. ’ s death had been performed thoroughly. In the opinion of the Klaipėda Regional Court, it was therefore vital to continue the pre-trial investigation and to eliminate the doubts raised by the applicant as to the reliability of the results of the medical examination of V.B. ’ s body, and to establish whether V.B. had indeed worked in harmful conditions during the voyage, including whether regulations on hours of work had been observed. Should breaches of working conditions be established, it was also necessary to order a forensic expert to perform an objective investigation and to establish whether such breaches had had any impact on V.B. ’ s death. Without a comprehensive examination of those aspects, it had not been reasonable or lawful to discontinue the pre-trial investigation."

The Code also stipulated that an investigating officer or prosecutor had the right to order individuals or legal entities to provide objects or documents of relevance to a criminal investigation (Article 97).

The right of ownership of a ship sailing outside the territorial boundaries of the Republic of Lithuania was to be determined based on the laws of the State whose flag the ship was sailing under. The legal status of the ship ’ s crew was to be determined by the laws of the State whose flag the ship was sailing under. Relations between the ship ’ s crew and the captain were to be determined by the legal acts of the State whose flag the ship was sailing under, unless an agreement regulating such relations provided otherwise. The provisions of civil, administrative, labour and other laws of the Republic of Lithuania applied accordingly to civil and administrative relations and those related to work on board ships and other legal relations arising from maritime shipping and not falling within the sphere of regulation of the Law in question (Article 5 §§ 1, 4, 5 and 17). The right to sail under the State flag of Lithuania was to be granted to ships which were entered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania (Article 7). A ship was to be registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania if its owner was a Lithuanian citizen or legal entity registered in Lithuania (Article 8). A ship registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania and sailing under a Lithuanian flag was considered to be a subject of the Republic of Lithuania ( laivas, įregistruotas Lietuvos Respublikos jūrų laivų registre ir plaukiojantis su Lietuvos valstybės vėliava, turi Lietuvos Respublikos nacionalinę priklausomybę ) (Article 9).",

As to the request for legal assistance, there had been objective reasons for it taking several months to send it out after it had been prepared. Firstly, because of the specific rules on asking for legal assistance, and, secondly, because of the need to translate the documents into Portuguese, when there were few competent translators for such work in Lithuania. In addition, the investigators had also relied on the findings of the domestic administrative courts, which had separately looked at the issue of whether the applicant ’ s husband ’ s death could be recognised as a workplace accident. In the view of the Government, if the administrative courts had had any doubts about V.B. ’ s death being due to natural causes, then those courts would have stayed proceedings until the criminal case, pending at the time of the administrative court proceedings, had been decided."

The respondent Government have not argued that the investigation into the death of the applicant ’ s husband did not attract Lithuania ’ s responsibility because he died when ‘ the ship was on a voyage in the Atlantic Ocean near the Brazilian port of Imbituba ’ (see paragraph 19 above). Be that as it may, the Court has already recognised that instances of the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction by a State to include cases involving the activities on board of ships registered in, or flying the flag of, that State (see Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others (dec.) [GC], no. 52207/99, § § 59-61, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII, and Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, § 65, ECHR 2010). In the instant case the Court observes that the Vega belonged to a Lithuanian company Limarko, the ship was registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania and sailed under a Lithuanian flag (see paragraphs 6, 33, 44 and 53 above). Under Lithuanian legislation, the Vega ’ s captain exercised exclusive control over the ship while it was on a voyage (see, mutatis mutandis, Medvedyev, cited above, § § 6 5-67 ). The relations between the ship ’ s crew and the captain, including those related to safety at work, were determined by Lithuanian laws (see paragraph 53 above). The Court therefore considers that the special features of this case do not absolve Lithuania from an obligation to carry out an effective investigation (see Rantsev v.

The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility ( see Anguelova v.

In as much as different considerations apply in cases such as the present one, in which the death has not been caused by use of force or similar direct official action, the standard against which the investigation ’ s effectiveness is to be assessed may be less exacting. However, even in such situations, those concerned are entitled to an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to its effectiveness ( see Jasinskis v. Latvia, no. 45744/08, § 73, 21 December 2010, and the case-law cited therein). In that regard, the Court would point out that this is not an obligation of result, but of means (see, among other authorities, Emars v. Latvia, no. 22412/08, § 76, 1 8 November 2014; Mulini v. Bulgaria, no. 2092/08, § 42, 20 October 2015 ), and that Article 2 does not entail the right to have others prosecuted or sentenced for an offence, or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence (see Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, §§ 94 and 96, ECHR 2004-XII). Nevertheless, in this context the Court also recalls that the authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see Kalicki v. Poland, no. 46797/08, § 51, 8 December 2015 ). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death, or identify the person or persons responsible, will risk falling foul of this standard (see Olszewscy v. Poland, no. 99/12, § 68, 3 November 2015 ). Whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see Rantsev, cited above, § 232).",

In light of the ambiguous and unexplained circumstances surrounding V.B. ’ s death and the allegations of fires and leaks of gases on the Vega in the period leading up to his death, the Court observes that a procedural obligation of effective criminal inquiry did arise in respect of the Lithuanian authorities to investigate the circumstances of V.B. ’ s death (see paragraphs 5 1 and 5 2 above). By necessity, the investigation was required to consider not only the immediate circumstance of V.B. ’ s heart attack but also the broader context of V.B. ’ s working conditions on the Vega, in order to assess whether there was a link between the allegations of hazardous working conditions and V.B. ’ s death."

Contrary to what has been suggested by the Government, the Court does not attach particular weight to the fact that the circumstances of the applicant ’ s work on the Vega, and the possible causes of his death, were examined in two separate sets of court proceedings – criminal and administrative. It is true that the administrative proceedings dealt with the question of whether the death of the applicant ’ s husband could be considered as a work accident. Those proceedings terminated with the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s conclusion of 5 February 2009, dispelling the applicant ’ s version of events (see paragraph 50 above). That being so, for the Court it is sufficient to note that on 20 March 2009, when the administrative court proceedings were already over, the Klaipėda Regional Court held that the criminal investigation as to the true cause of V.B. ’ s death had not been thorough. In fact, to dispel any remaining doubts, the prosecutor was ordered to continue the pre-trial investigation, and a number of investigative measures were conducted afterwards (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above)."

                "70. As to the adequacy of the criminal investigation, the Court accepts that the ship ’ s captain and other members of its crew examined the scene and that photographs were taken. The following day, the Brazilian police took statements from the captain and the chief engineer (see paragraph 7 above). Aside from those actions, as the applicant rightly noted to the Lithuanian criminal court (see paragraph 2 1 above), her husband ’ s body was quickly embalmed the same day without her being asked whether she wished any further investigative actions to be taken. As a result, the experts could subsequently only discuss hypothetical possible causes for V.B. ’ s death, given that the lack of an autopsy prevented them from stating with certainty that he had died of a heart attack (see paragraphs 40-42 above). On this point the Court also notes that the ship ’ s captain performs the role of an investigative officer if a criminal act takes place on his ship (see paragraph 53 above). Whilst acknowledging that it was mostly not within the captain ’ s competence to decide what investigative measures the Brazilian authorities should have undertaken before embalming the body, it cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that a heart attack as the cause of death was opportune in the face of the overall suspicions of hazardous work conditions on that ship. That being so, and whilst any possible failure to undertake investigative measures on 24 or 25 October 2007 on Brazilian territory is mostly not down to the Lithuanian ship ’ s captain and thus not down to the Lithuanian authorities (see paragraph 53 above), it also transpires from the facts of the case that there were numerous deficiencies once the investigation into the circumstances of the applicant ’ s husband ’ s death was conducted in Lithuania."

Turning to the criminal investigation, the Court firstly shares the applicant ’ s view, also confirmed by the Klaipėda Regional Court, that on 29 December 2007 the Lithuanian prosecutor acted hastily in discontinuing the criminal proceedings, essentially relying only on what by then appears to have been a fairly limited amount of evidence, and quickly accepting the fact that V.B. had died of heart attack, as had been indicated in V.B. ’ s Brazilian death certificate (see paragraphs 1 3 and 1 4 above)."

The Court also observes that after the criminal case had been returned for further investigation, in 2009 the Klaipėda Seaport Police eventually asked the SLI to provide information on whether the Vega had been inspected. It is particularly striking to note the SLI ’ s answer that they had not inspected the ship after V.B. ’ s death, which had taken place nearly two years before (see paragraphs 24 and 27 above). Although the applicant strongly believed that her husband had not died of natural causes, but had been a victim of poisoning by combustion gases, and abundant evidence about those gases and fires on the ship had been brought to the attention of the Lithuanian authorities as early as in spring 2008 (see paragraphs 1 5-17 above ), the Lithuanian authorities made no effort to instruct the Limarko company to bring the ship back to Lithuania, where it could be properly examined, whereas Article 76 of the Code of Criminal Procedure appears to grant the prosecutor exactly that right (see paragraph 5 2 above). In that connection, the Court further notes that documents and medical experts have established, on the one hand, that the applicant ’ s husband was healthy, and that there were no obstacles to him serving on board a ship; on the other hand, those experts also concluded that in the absence of documents about the gases it was not possible to say that those gases were not the cause of V.B. ’ s death (see paragraphs 19 in fine, 30 and 40 above)."

The Court further observes that on 10 September 2008 the applicant submitted a written request to the prosecutor to take particular actions to find out about the working conditions on the Vega at the material time. The prosecutor ignored her requests, which was recognised by the Klaipėda City District Court (see paragraph 2 2 above). Furthermore, although the applicant had as early as July 2009 alerted the prosecutor to the fact that Limarko intended to sell the Vega, and had asked the prosecutor to make sure that relevant documents would not be lost, her request again did not receive a timely response from the Lithuanian authorities. As a result, when half a year later the Klaipėda Seaport Police finally asked Limarko to submit documents regarding the Vega ’ s machinery section, the company confirmed that the ship had been sold to a third party, and the relevant logbooks had been destroyed (see paragraphs 28, 33 and 34 above). That being so, the Court finds that the Lithuanian authorities failed to secure all the relevant evidence, given the value of such evidence in helping to clarify matters which were central to the investigation. The Court also considers that even if the applicant had been granted victim status at the beginning of the criminal investigation, her participation appears to have been limited to being able only to gain access to the investigation file (see paragraphs 12, 20 and 32 above). Accordingly, the Lithuanian authorities failed to ensure that the applicant was able to participate effectively in the proceedings, despite her constant and strenuous efforts to remain involved."

In any case, given that the request was sent more than three years after the death and after the opening of the pre-trial investigation, it is not astounding that no relevant information was received from the Brazilian authorities (see paragraph 38 above). That notwithstanding, the Court cannot but hold that the Lithuanian prosecutors once again simply accepted the lack of information as a fact, without considering whether it was necessary, for example, to submit another request for legal assistance to their Brazilian colleagues (see, mutatis mutandis, Rantsev, cited above, § 241).

As regards the committee's findings on the subject of the presidential pardon, the President of the Supreme Court of Georgia noted, firstly, that the right conferred by the Constitution on the Georgian President to grant a pardon was absolute and unconditional and could be exercised independently of the regulations laying down the principles on which requests for a pardon were to be examined by the Presidential Office. He further noted that in many countries there was no right of appeal against a pardon, which constituted the ultimate act of humanity. The fact that the applicant's request for a pardon had not been examined beforehand by the Presidential Pardons Board could not render the pardon illegal, especially as, in the applicant's case, obtaining his file and details from the Ajarian prison authorities had been no easy task. The President of the Supreme Court of Georgia also pointed out that, in the instant case, the grant of a pardon also represented an attempt at restoring justice to a convicted prisoner who had been held for years in an unlawful place of detention."

The President of the Supreme Court of Georgia said that it was regrettable that the committee had omitted to mention that the Ajarian High Court had on 11 November 1999, in breach of the law then in force, assumed jurisdiction to hear an application for judicial review of a pardon granted by the President of Georgia."

In the instant case, on 25 March 2003, following a request for the reopening of the proceedings by the civil party, the General Prosecutor's Office of Georgia found that the parliamentary committee's findings in its report of 26 September 2002 did not constitute new factual or legal circumstances that could warrant reopening the applicant's case (see paragraph 89 above).",

The position in the present case is quite different: no State apart from Georgia exercised control – and therefore had jurisdiction – over the Ajarian Autonomous Republic and indeed it has not been suggested otherwise before the Court, quite the opposite (see paragraphs 132- 36 above). The present application also differs from that in Banković and Others, which was distinguishable from the two preceding cases, in that the respondent States – which were parties to the Convention and members of NATO – did not exercise “overall control” over the territory concerned.

In so arguing, he relied primarily on the findings of the parliamentary committee's report of 26 September 2002. In his submission, since the judgment of 29 January 2001 was invalid, the basis for the applicant's detention since then had been his conviction and sentence on 2 October 2000 (see paragraph 44 above), that being the only judgment which remained effective. The detention consequently fell within Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention and complied fully with that provision.

Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 25, § 58).

                "42. It firstly pointed out that, under Article 25 of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations member States had undertaken to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the Charter. It then observed that under Article 103 of the Charter the obligations arising from that instrument did not only prevail over the domestic law of the member States but also over obligations under other international agreements, regardless of their nature, whether bilateral or multilateral. It further stated that this primacy did not relate only to the Charter but extended to all obligations which arose from a binding resolution of the Security Council."

The Federal Court observed, however, that the Security Council was itself bound by the Charter and was required to act in accordance with its purposes and principles (Article 24 § 2 of the Charter), which included respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms (Article 1 § 3 of the Charter). At the same time, it took the view that the member States were not permitted to avoid an obligation on the ground that a decision (or resolution) by the Security Council was substantively inconsistent with the Charter, in particular decisions (resolutions) based on Chapter VII thereof (action with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression)."

It took the view that the applicable international law, in addition to international treaties ratified by Switzerland, also included customary international law, general principles of law and the decisions of international organisations which were binding on Switzerland, including the Security Council’s decisions concerning the sanctions regime."

                "45. However, it observed that Article 190 of the Constitution contained no rules on how to settle possible conflicts between different norms of international law which were legally binding on Switzerland, and that in the present case there was such a conflict between the Security Council’s decisions on the one hand and the guarantees of the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the other. It took the view that unless the conflict could be resolved by the rules on the interpretation of treaties, it would be necessary, in order to settle the issue, to look to the hierarchy of international legal norms, according to which obligations under the United Nations Charter prevailed over obligations under any other international agreement (Article 103 of the Charter, taken together with Article 30 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties; see paragraphs 69 and 80 below). The Federal Court was of the opinion that the uniform application of United Nations sanctions would be endangered if the courts of States Parties to the European Convention or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights were able to disregard those sanctions in order to protect the fundamental rights of certain individuals or organisations."

The Federal Court then cited, as examples of jus cogens norms, the right to life, protection from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment, the prohibition of slavery, the prohibition of collective punishment, the principle of individual criminal responsibility and the non-refoulement principle. It took the view, however, that the enjoyment of possessions, economic freedom, the guarantees of a fair trial or the right to an effective remedy did not fall within jus cogens."

These sanctions include far-reaching commercial restrictions for those affected; the funds necessary for their survival are not, however, blocked (see Resolution 1452 (2002), paragraph 1(a)), as a result of which there is neither any threat to their life or health nor any inhuman or degrading treatment.",

It mentioned in this connection that, in particular under the terms of Resolution 1730 (2006), the delisting procedure allowing individuals to have direct access to the Sanctions Committee already represented substantial progress, even though the system still had considerable shortcomings from the point of view of human rights."

                "The sanctions (freezing of assets, entry-and-transit ban, arms embargo) are described in detail and afford member States no margin of appreciation in their implementation. The names of those affected by the sanctions are also indicated to the member States: this is determined by the list drawn up and maintained by the Sanctions Committee (see paragraph 8(c) of Resolution 1333 (2000)).",
                "As regards the possibility of obtaining deletion from the list, the Sanctions Committee has introduced a specific procedure (see paragraphs 13 et seq. of Resolution 1735 (2006) and the directives of the Sanctions Committee dated 12 February 2007). The member States are thus debarred from deciding of their own motion whether or not sanctions should continue to be imposed on a person or organisation appearing on the Sanctions Committee’s list.",
                "Switzerland would therefore be in breach of its obligations under the Charter were it to delete the names of the appellant and his organisations from the annex to the Taliban Ordinance.",

The Federal Court may certainly examine whether and to what extent Switzerland is bound by the Resolutions of the Security Council, but it is not permitted to remove the sanctions against the appellant on the ground that they breach his fundamental rights.",
                "The Sanctions Committee alone is responsible for the delisting of persons or entities. In spite of the improvements mentioned above, the delisting procedure fails to meet both the requirement of access to a court under Article 29a of the Federal Constitution, Article 6 § 1 of the [Convention] and Article 14 § 1 of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and that of an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the [Convention] and Article 2 § 3 of the United Nations Covenant ...”"

                "“9.1 The lower courts examined whether Switzerland was obliged to initiate the delisting procedure on behalf of the appellant. In the meantime, this issue has become irrelevant as, since the amendment of the delisting procedure, the appellant has been able to make an application himself and has indeed availed himself of this opportunity.",

                "On the other hand, should the criminal proceedings end in an acquittal or be discontinued, this should lead to the removal of the preventive sanctions. Admittedly, the country which has conducted the criminal proceedings or preliminary investigation cannot itself proceed with the deletion, but it can at least transmit the results of its investigations to the Sanctions Committee and request or support the person’s delisting.”"

                "52. Lastly, the Federal Court examined whether the travel ban enforced under Article 4a of the Taliban Ordinance extended beyond the sanctions introduced by the Security Council Resolutions and whether the Swiss authorities thus had any latitude in that connection. The court found as follows:",
                "“10.1 Article 4a § 1 of the Taliban Ordinance prohibits the individuals listed in Annex 2 from entering or transiting through Switzerland. Article 4a § 2 provides that, in agreement with the United Nations Security Council decisions or for the protection of Swiss interests, the Federal Office for Migration is entitled to grant exemptions.",

In addition, exemptions can be granted in individual cases with the agreement of the Sanctions Committee (see paragraph 1(b) of Resolution 1735 (2006)). This includes in particular travel on medical, humanitarian or religious grounds ...",
                "10.2 Article 4a § 2 of the Taliban Ordinance is formulated as an ‘enabling’ provision and gives the impression that the Federal Office for Migration has a certain margin of appreciation. Constitutionally however, the provision is to be interpreted as meaning that an exemption should be granted in all cases where the United Nations sanctions regime so permits. A more far-reaching restriction on the appellant’s freedom of movement could not be regarded as based on the Security Council Resolutions, would not be in the public interest and would be disproportionate in the light of the appellant’s particular situation.",
                "The appellant lives in Campione, an Italian enclave in Ticino, with an area of 1.6 sq. km. As a result of the ban on entry into and transit through Switzerland, he is unable to leave Campione. Practically speaking, as the appellant correctly argued, this is tantamount to house arrest and thus represents a serious restriction on his personal liberty. In these circumstances the Swiss authorities are obliged to exhaust all the relaxations of the sanctions regime available under the United Nations Security Council Resolutions.",
                "The Federal Office for Migration thus has no margin of appreciation. Rather, it must examine whether the conditions for the granting of an exemption are met. Should the request not fall within one of the general exemptions envisaged by the Security Council, it must be submitted to the Sanctions Committee for approval.",
                "10.3 The question whether the Federal Office for Migration has disregarded the constitutional requirements in dealing with the appellant’s applications for leave to travel abroad does not need to be examined here: the relevant orders of the Federal Office have not been challenged by the appellant and are not a matter of dispute in the present proceedings.",

The applicant did not dispute the fact that he had been convicted but argued that he had never been informed of the proceedings against him and that he had therefore never had the possibility of defending himself in person or through the intermediary of a lawyer.

Moreover, in the autumn of 2009 Switzerland had worked intensively with its partners to ensure that the Resolution on the renewal of the sanctions regime against al-Qaeda and the Taliban, scheduled for adoption in December, met that need.

In the exercise of that latter power it is necessary for the Community to attach special importance to the fact that, in accordance with Article 24 of the Charter of the United Nations, the adoption by the Security Council of resolutions under Chapter VII of the Charter constitutes the exercise of the primary responsibility with which that international body is invested for the maintenance of peace and security at the global level, a responsibility which, under Chapter VII, includes the power to determine what and who poses a threat to international peace and security and to take the measures necessary to maintain or restore them.",

The two complainants, Belgian nationals, had been placed on the lists appended to that Resolution in January 2003, on the basis of information which had been provided to the Security Council by Belgium, shortly after the commencement of a domestic criminal investigation in September 2002. They had submitted several delisting requests at national, regional and United Nations levels, all to no avail.

The Committee found a violation of the complainants’ right to freedom of movement under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, because both the dismissal of the criminal investigation and the State Party’s delisting requests showed that the restrictions were not necessary to protect national security or public order."

G answers to that description because he has been designated by the 1267 Committee [the Sanctions Committee].

This is something that, under the system that the 1267 Committee currently operates, is denied to him. I would hold that Article 3 § 1 (b) of the AQO [al-Qaeda Order], which has this effect, is ultra vires section 1 of the 1946 Act.

Two diverging commitments must therefore be harmonised as far as possible so that they produce effects that are fully in accordance with existing law (see, to this effect, Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi, cited above, § 126; Al-Adsani, cited above, § 55; and the Banković decision, cited above, §§ 55 ‑ 57; see also the references cited in the International Law Commission study group’s report entitled “Fragmentation of international law: difficulties arising from the diversification and expansion of international law”, paragraph 81 above)."

                "“101. Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations provides that the obligations of the members of the United Nations under the Charter shall prevail in the event of a conflict with obligations under any other international agreement. Before it can consider whether Article 103 had any application in the present case, the Court must determine whether there was a conflict between the United Kingdom’s obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 and its obligations under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. In other words, the key question is whether Resolution 1546 placed the United Kingdom under an obligation to hold the applicant in internment.",
                "102. In its approach to the interpretation of Resolution 1546, the Court has reference to the considerations set out in paragraph 76 above. In addition, the Court must have regard to the purposes for which the United Nations was created. As well as the purpose of maintaining international peace and security, set out in the first sub-paragraph of Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations, the third sub-paragraph provides that the United Nations was established to ‘achieve international cooperation in ... promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms’. Article 24 § 2 of the Charter requires the Security Council, in discharging its duties with respect to its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, to ‘act in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations’. Against this background, the Court considers that, in interpreting its resolutions, there must be a presumption that the Security Council does not intend to impose any obligation on member States to breach fundamental principles of human rights. In the event of any ambiguity in the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution, the Court must therefore choose the interpretation which is most in harmony with the requirements of the Convention and which avoids any conflict of obligations. In the light of the United Nations’ important role in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights, it is to be expected that clear and explicit language would be used were the Security Council to intend States to take particular measures which would conflict with their obligations under international human rights law.”"

As a result, the above-mentioned presumption is rebutted in the present case, having regard to the clear and explicit language, imposing an obligation to take measures capable of breaching human rights, that was used in that Resolution (see also paragraph 7 of Resolution 1267 (1999), paragraph 70 above, in which the Security Council was even more explicit in setting aside any other international obligations that might be incompatible with the Resolution)."

Without prejudice to the binding nature of such resolutions, the Charter in principle leaves to United Nations member States a free choice among the various possible models for transposition of those resolutions into their domestic legal order.

Switzerland (no. 16360/90, Commission decision of 2 March 1994, Decisions and Reports 76-B, pp. 13 et seq.) cases, argued that there had been no “deprivation of liberty” in the present case. They stated that the purpose of the measure in question had never been to confine the applicant to the territory of Campione d’Italia. Only a ban on entering and transiting through Switzerland had been imposed on him. The fact that the applicant found that his movements were restricted by the impugned measure was attributable only to himself, because he had chosen to live in an Italian enclave surrounded by Swiss territory. Neither the sanctions as decided by the United Nations, nor their implementation by the Swiss authorities, had obliged him to remain a resident of Campione d’Italia. At any time he could thus have requested authorisation to transfer his home to another part of Italy."

In particular, he was not under surveillance by the Swiss authorities, had no specific obligations and could have received as many visits as he wished. He was also able, at all times, to meet his lawyers freely. The Government further pointed out that the border between Campione d’Italia and Switzerland was not patrolled, so the ban on entry into Switzerland could not have been perceived by him as a physical obstacle."

Switzerland (cited above), in which the Commission had declared inadmissible the complaint of an applicant under Article 5 that he had not been authorised to leave Campione d’Italia for several years. Firstly, in the applicant’s case the inability to leave the area was not the result of a criminal conviction and, secondly, he had been unable to challenge the impugned restrictions in the context of a fair hearing, unlike the applicant in S.F. v.

The text of Article 5 makes it clear that the guarantees it contains apply to “everyone”. Sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) of Article 5 § 1 contain an exhaustive list of permissible grounds on which persons may be deprived of their liberty. No deprivation of liberty will be compatible with Article 5 § 1 unless it falls within one of those grounds or is provided for by a lawful derogation under Article 15 of the Convention, which allows for a Contracting State “[i]n time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation” to take measures derogating from its obligations under Article 5 “to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation” (see, among other authorities, Al-Jedda, cited above, § 99; A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, §§ 162-63, ECHR 2009; and Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 194)."

In order to determine whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5, the starting-point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question. The difference between deprivation and restriction of liberty is one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance (see Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09, § 57, ECHR 2012; Stanev v.

Indeed, the context in which the measure is taken is an important factor, since situations commonly occur in modern society where the public may be called on to endure restrictions on freedom of movement or liberty in the interests of the common good (see, mutatis mutandis, Austin and Others, cited above, § 59)."

In that case, the application had been lodged by an individual who, being suspected of belonging to a “band of mafiosi”, had been forced to live on an island within an (unfenced) area of 2.5 sq. km, together with other residents in a similar situation and supervisory staff. The Court found that the applicant had been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5 and that he could therefore rely on the guarantees under that provision (see also Giulia Manzoni v.

The restrictions in question did not prevent the applicant from freely living and moving within the territory of his permanent residence, where he had chosen, of his own free will, to live and carry on his activities. The Court considers that, in these circumstances, his case differs radically from the factual situation in Guzzardi (cited above) and that the prohibition imposed upon the applicant does not raise an issue under Article 5 of the Convention."
