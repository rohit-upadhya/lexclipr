If so, they had failed to pursue their claim before the Real Estate Court, which they could have done under the 1986 Act (see paragraph 16 above). Consequently, any compensation to be awarded under this head should not be based on an assumption that the water had been polluted as a result of VAFAB ’ s activities. In any event, the amount should not exceed what had been awarded by the Court or the Committee of Ministers in similar cases."

In the majority of those cases the Court has found that the first condition, that is, whether national law “expressly excluded” access to a court for the post or category of staff in question was not fulfilled and that Article 6 was thus applicable to the proceedings in question."

                "75. However, it emerges from many of those cases that the existence of the possibility of review is not per se a sine qua non in order for the first condition of the Eskelinen test to be fulfilled. So in Saghatelyan v. Armenia (no. 7984/06, § § 32-35, 20 October 2015), in which the applicant had been dismissed as a judge on the basis of a presidential decree following a recommendation by the Council of Justice, the Court considered that the first condition of the test had not been satisfied. It observed in that regard, first, that the Government had not mentioned a particular provision of the law which expressly excluded judicial protection in connection with disciplinary proceedings against judges and, second, that although at the material time it had not been possible to challenge a presidential decree, as this applied to all individuals, national law did not rule out access to court for the applicant based on her status as a holder of public power. In Harabin v. Slovakia ( no. 58688/11, 20 November 2012), disciplinary proceedings were brought against the applicant, who was the President of the Supreme Court, before the Constitutional Court. It found him guilty of a serious disciplinary offence and imposed a disciplinary sanction (§§ 36-37). The decision was final, there being no remedy against the Constitutional Court ’ s decisions (§ 54). In applying the Eskelinen test, the Court observed that the Constitutional Court was a tribunal with powers to determine the relevant issues. National law therefore did not exclude a judicial examination of the relevant points and the applicant had actually had access to a court (§ 123). The Court thus took the approach that even though the disciplinary proceedings brought against the applicant were only examined at one level of jurisdiction, that qualified as “access to court” for the purposes of the first condition of the Eskelinen test."

That constitutional provision secures the well-known rights that an accused has in a criminal trial and are identical to those secured under Articles 6 §§ 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was ratified by the House of Representatives by law in 1962 ( Law 39/62). Furthermore, the provisions of Article 30 of our Constitution, which are the equivalent to those of Article 6 of the Convention, are also applicable.",

The President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature did not put a single question to the witnesses who were listed on the charge sheet, or to those summoned on behalf of Mr Kamenos, which might have been construed as cross-examination for the purpose of contesting the witnesses ’ allegations. On the contrary, the President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature asked very few questions, and they were solely for the purpose of clarification; special reference will be made to some of those questions at the appropriate stage. Not a single question was put to Mr Kamenos. The Supreme Council of Judicature was not seeking to pursue a procedure of prosecution against Mr Kamenos in the form of a confrontation between prosecution and defence. For that reason, and despite having such powers under Rule 16, the relevant provision of the Constitution on the judicial process and the procedure to be followed in investigating disciplinary cases, it did not assign the duties of prosecutor to the judge-investigator or to any other judicial official. In that way, which was the declared intention of the Supreme Council of Judicature, more rights were secured for Mr Kamenos than those which he had under the aforementioned Articles of the Constitution and the Rule. That was precisely the aim of the procedure followed by the Supreme Council of Judicature, which essentially remained an audience for the witnesses ’ statements.",

Its subject relates directly and absolutely to what we have just said. The lawyer alleged that the Supreme Council of Judicature had functioned in a dual capacity, given that it had judged the case and simultaneously exercised the duties of prosecutor. Clarifying his position, he said that that is inferred from the fact that the President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature put questions to the witnesses. In our opinion, that suggestion is unfounded and unjustifiable. It is unfounded for the reasons which we explained above, and unjustifiable because it conflicts with what the lawyer said to us at the beginning of the proceedings, when he ... spoke in praise of the powers invested by the Constitution in the Supreme Council of Judicature, describing its work as difficult and important [in those instances] when it is called upon to decide whether a judge displayed misconduct and is obliged, again in accordance with the Constitution, to terminate the latter ’ s services in the event of conviction. In brief, Mr Efstathiou not only accepted but also praised as correct the competence, arising from the Constitution, of the Supreme Council of Judicature, which is made up of the full bench of the Members of the Supreme Court, the highest judicial authority in the State.",
                "[The applicant ’ s lawyer ] asked many witnesses to express an opinion on the extent to which they considered that Mr Kamenos ’ s decisions were correct. Most of them, including the lawyers, gave the right reply, namely, that it was not for them to judge Mr Kamenos ’ s decisions. In the same way, the Supreme Council of Judicature is not judging the correctness of Mr Kamenos ’ s decisions. We do not have such competence. That belongs to the Supreme Court. The competence of the Supreme Council of Judicature is only to decide whether the charges of improper behaviour (misconduct) are proved, which [behaviour] in the case we are examining and according to the particulars of the charges, is continuous ( κατά συρροή, διαρκής ) and directly refers to the function of Mr Kamenos as the President of the Industrial Disputes Court.",
                "We previously stated that certain witnesses called by Mr Kamenos, evidently in an endeavour to tone down or explain what the witnesses listed on the charge sheet had testified to and who touched on Mr Kamenos ’ s behaviour in the course of the hearing, in essence confirmed what those witnesses had said. Several examples follow ...",

We borrow and adopt the above principle from the decision (Investigation concerning Judge Bruce Van Voorhis, No. 165) given in February 2003 by the Commission of Judicial Performance of the State of California, in the United States of America, which concerned a procedure against a specific judge whose services were also terminated for misconduct, with facts and particulars similar to the case before us. In essence, we translate the principle which that Commission adopted and recorded on page 31 of the decision. The principle is based, as stated in the decision, on what was said by the Supreme Court of the State, that the purpose of the procedure was not to punish judges who have erred but to protect the judicial system and those who are subject to the formidable power exercised by judges.",
                "Evaluating the above with great care, caution and, we would say, anxiety, we are led to the conclusion that everything imputed to Mr Kamenos as stated in the two charges has been proved. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution, which are referred to in our decision, the proof of a charge of misconduct against a judge leads to the termination of his services.”"

As regards the procedure, the judge noted, inter alia, that the Supreme Council of Judicature had asked the witnesses very few questions and that they had been for the purposes of clarification. Furthermore, with regard to the investigation and the object of the hearing, he observed:",
                "“A judicial official with the duties of prosecutor was not appointed, a possibility which is referred to in Rule 16, and we adopted the following approach: every witness read his statement to the investigating officer out loud and, immediately after, was cross-examined by Mr Kamenos ’ s lawyer. During the cross-examination or subsequently members of the Supreme Council of Judicature asked the witnesses a few questions for clarification purposes. This is also exactly what happened in the case of Mr Kamenos and the 36 witnesses called by him.",
                "Before referring to the evidence, it is useful if we outline the methodology which led to the taking of statements by the Investigating Officer. He did not himself take the initiative of collecting evidence in view of the accusation, as he explains in his report. The persons who signed the accusation did not have any personal knowledge of the circumstances and statements were taken from all those they ... named, and from others subsequently named by those who had been initially summoned. The investigation into the manner in which Mr Kamenos exercised his duties in general was therefore not systematic and that is also the reason for not taking statements from a number of other persons whom Mr Kamenos himself indicated. Besides, as we have seen, of the 28 statements which the Investigating Office took, only 15 were attached to the charge sheet, with a further reduction to 10 in the course of the hearing. They did not include statements which, as the Investigating Officer reported, not only expressed no complaints but stated that Mr Kamenos ’ s conduct had been irreproachable in all respects. Consequently, as is in any case self-evident, the object of the hearing is [to determine] whether, on the basis of the evidence of those ten witnesses, the charge has been substantiated as formulated. That is to say, whether, from each individual ’ s evidence and the correlation between them, to the extent possible, there arises conduct as cumulatively stated on the charge sheet, [and] in the case of the second charge “with the result that, owing to the agitation and disruption they were caused, the entire proceedings were diverted from their proper course ”. This (was the wording), without any specification on the charge sheet of a definite, specific incident at a specific time, ... in relation to a specific person in the context of a specific case. The witnesses who remained on the charge sheet (whose statements I shall of course return to), as lay members of the court, or as lawyers or witnesses, did not submit a complaint there and then about what they considered to be objectionable conduct. ... Nor did the litigants in any specific case which could be related to the charge sheet make a complaint at the time, or appeal or employ any other legal means so that any objectionable conduct would be examined also from the aspect of its effect on the final outcome. That was what occurred in the cases of Athanasiou v. Reana Manuf. & Trade Co.Ltd and others (2001) 1 C.L.R. 1635, and Fanos N. Epiphaniou Ltd v. Melarta and others (2002) 1 C.L.R.654, in which the Supreme Court annulled decisions issued by the Industrial Disputes Tribunal under the presidency of Mr Kamenos, using strong language about the degree of his intervention in the proceedings and the appearance of partiality to which it could give rise. Of course, the charge sheet does not extend to those cases and does not concern the issue of interventions as such ... The core of the charge is the conduct attributed to Mr Kamenos at the expense of lay members of the court, lawyers, litigants and witnesses, and it is in the light of such considerations that I shall go on to examine the evidence adduced.”"

The 1960 Constitution, which came into force when the Republic of Cyprus was established, provided for the existence of a Supreme Constitutional Court and a High Court (Parts IX and X of the Constitution respectively). Both courts were composed of a Greek, Turkish and a neutral judge (Articles 133 and 153). The neutral judges, who were not subjects or citizens of Greece, Turkey or the United Kingdom (and the Colonies), presided over the courts (Articles 133 and 153). That Constitutional arrangement only lasted until the beginning of 1964 : following the inter-communal problems of 1963, the neutral presidents vacated their posts without being replaced. The Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) (“ Law no. 33/1964 ” ) was enacted in order to address an emergency situation and to set up the necessary judicial machinery for the continued administration of justice. By virtue of that law, the two highest courts were merged into one, the Supreme Court, to which the jurisdiction and powers of the two earlier courts were transferred.

The Supreme Court sat as a full bench (that is, all thirteen judges; see paragraph 35 above ). The complainant requested that the Supreme Court re-examine and/or revise its judgment in Kourris (see paragraph 43 above) and that his case be heard by a different bench, arguing that the thirteen judges in question had themselves written the impugned decision, which they had taken in their capacity as members of the SCJ. On 15 March 2001 the Supreme Court dismissed the recourse for want of jurisdiction without addressing the issue of impartiality.

Judicial appointments were closely, even inextricably, interwoven with the exercise of the judicial function; more precisely, they constituted a precondition for the exercise of that function.

They submitted that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had not constituted a determination of his civil rights and obligations within the meaning of Article 6 § 1. First, no “right” had existed in the present case: there had been no right to remain as a judge or as President of the IDC and there had been no right not to be dismissed from his post. The applicant did not have arguable grounds on which to claim such a right. Secondly, even if such a right was deemed to exist, it was not “civil” in nature as the two conditions established in the case of Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, § 62, ECHR 2007 ‑ II) had been fulfilled. As to the first condition, the Government observed that the applicant had not had a right of access to a court in order to challenge his removal. Although neither the Constitution nor the applicable procedural rules concerning the exercise of the SCJ ’ s disciplinary authority expressly excluded access to a court in order to challenge the removal of a judge from his post, the Supreme Court had expressly ruled in the cases of Kourris and Karatsis (cited above) that the acts, decisions or omissions of the SCJ could not be challenged by way of a recourse under Article 146 of the Constitution (see paragraphs 43 and 44 above). The applicant had therefore not had access to a court in order to challenge his dismissal."
            ],
            [
                "56. As to the second condition set out in Vilho Eskelinen, the Government pointed out that the Court had acknowledged that a judge had specific responsibilities in the field of the administration of justice, which was a sphere in which States exercised sovereign power. A judge participated directly in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and performed duties designed to safeguard the general interest of the State (relying on Serdal Apay v. Turkey (dec.), no. 3964/05, 11 December 2007; Muammer Yilmazoǧlu v. Turkey (dec.), no. 36593/97, 12 June 2003 and Pitkevich v. Russia (dec.), no. 47936, 8 February 2001). The exclusion from access to court by domestic law was justified on objective grounds and in the State ’ s interests. In the Karatsis case the Supreme Court had highlighted that judicial appointments were inextricably interwoven with the exercise of the judicial function and, more precisely, constituted a precondition for the exercise of that function. Entrusting the appointment of judicial officers to the judicial function itself constituted an aspect of the independence of the judiciary and was an expression of the autonomy of its function (see paragraph 44 above). In the present case, the applicant, as a judge at the IDC, and even more so as its president, had occupied a post of the highest rank in the field of the administration of justice. He had had powers conferred by public law and had assumed duties to safeguard the general interests of the State. The applicant ’ s misconduct had eroded public confidence in the integrity and independence of the judicial function as a whole. As stated by the SCJ in its decision in the present case, the purpose of the procedure had not been to punish the applicant, but rather to protect the public by adopting a strict standard of judicial conduct so as to preserve the public ’ s trust in the integrity, reputation and independence of the judicial system (see paragraph 31 above). Preventing the applicant from having access to a court had therefore been justified on objective grounds and the subject matter of the dispute had been related to the exercise of State power."

Any public ‑ law features of a disciplinary nature in the case did not exclude the proceedings from the scope of Article 6 since their outcome had been severe and far-reaching : the applicant had been dismissed from his post, affecting his career and professional activities. The fact that Articles 12 § 5 and 30 of the Constitution, which contained equivalent guarantees to Article 6 of the Convention, had been applicable to the disciplinary proceedings were indicative of the civil nature of the right at stake."

                "58. The applicant emphasised that he had not had access to court because he was not able to seek a review of the SCJ ’ s decision and that there had been no objective justification for that exclusion. The Court ’ s decisions in Serdal Apay, Muammer Yilmazoǧlu and Pitkevich (all cited above), on which the Government had relied in their submissions on this point (see paragraph 56 above) had nothing to do with his case as the State ’ s interest in those cases had been strictly interpreted on the basis of their specific facts. It emerged clearly from the Court ’ s judgment in Vilho Eskelinen (cited above) that only the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question could justify not applying Article 6.

In so far as the “civil” nature of the right is concerned, in cases concerning employment disputes concerning civil servants the Court, applies a two-tier test which it established in its Grand Chamber judgment in Vilho Eskelinen (cited above - hereinafter referred to as the “ Eskelinen test ” ). In order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. First, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, a “special bond of trust and loyalty” between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond (ibid., §§ 102-103). Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question (ibid., § 103). There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified ( ibid. , § 103 )."

However, it emerges from many of those cases that the existence of the possibility of review is not per se a sine qua non in order for the first condition of the Eskelinen test to be fulfilled. So in Saghatelyan v. Armenia (no. 7984/06, § § 32-35, 20 October 2015), in which the applicant had been dismissed as a judge on the basis of a presidential decree following a recommendation by the Council of Justice, the Court considered that the first condition of the test had not been satisfied. It observed in that regard, first, that the Government had not mentioned a particular provision of the law which expressly excluded judicial protection in connection with disciplinary proceedings against judges and, second, that although at the material time it had not been possible to challenge a presidential decree, as this applied to all individuals, national law did not rule out access to court for the applicant based on her status as a holder of public power. In Harabin v. Slovakia ( no. 58688/11, 20 November 2012), disciplinary proceedings were brought against the applicant, who was the President of the Supreme Court, before the Constitutional Court. It found him guilty of a serious disciplinary offence and imposed a disciplinary sanction (§§ 36-37). The decision was final, there being no remedy against the Constitutional Court ’ s decisions (§ 54). In applying the Eskelinen test, the Court observed that the Constitutional Court was a tribunal with powers to determine the relevant issues. National law therefore did not exclude a judicial examination of the relevant points and the applicant had actually had access to a court (§ 123). The Court thus took the approach that even though the disciplinary proceedings brought against the applicant were only examined at one level of jurisdiction, that qualified as “access to court” for the purposes of the first condition of the Eskelinen test."

Croatia (no. 22330/05, § 36-37, 5 February 2009) and in Oleksandr Volkov ( cited above, § 88 ), which both concerned the dismissal of judges, the Court did not confine its reasoning to the fact that it had been open to the applicants to seek review of the decision of the first - instance bodies. The Court highlighted that in the context of the first condition, it was not prevented from categorising a particular domestic body, outside the domestic judiciary, as a “court” for the purposes of the Eskelinen test. In that connection, it reiterated that for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention a tribunal need not be a court of law integrated with the standard judicial machinery since a tribunal, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, was characterised in the substantive sense of the term by its judicial function, that is to say, the determining of matters within its competence on the basis of rules of law and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner. Consequently, a non-judicial body, for example an administrative or parliamentary body, may qualify as a “court” in the substantive sense of the term if it performed judicial functions ( see also Savino and Others v. Italy, nos. 17214/05 and 2 others, § § 72-75, 28 April 2009 )."

Hence, in Olujić (cited above, § § 36 -42), although the applicant had filed a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court against the decisions of the first decision - making body, the National Judicial Council, the Court examined the powers of the National Judicial Council and the nature of the proceedings before it. It noted that the proceedings before the National Judicial Council followed the rules of criminal procedure, which included, inter alia, all the guarantees provided by Article 6 of the Convention and enabled the accused to submit a defence. When ruling in disciplinary proceedings against judges, the National Judicial Council was empowered to establish the facts of a given case, hold hearings, hear witnesses and assess other evidence and decide on all the questions of fact and law. It therefore concluded that in that case the National Judicial Council had exercised judicial powers in determining the applicant ’ s disciplinary responsibility and thus that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had been conducted before a tribunal for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

Similarly, in Oleksandr Volkov ( cited above, §§ 88-91 ), although the dismissal decision had been reviewed by the Higher Administrative Court, the Court, in determining whether the applicant had had access to a court in the context of the first condition of the Eskelinen test, noted that in determining the applicant ’ s case and taking a binding decision, it appeared that the High Council of Justice, the Parliamentary Committee on the Judiciary and the plenary meeting of Parliament had, in combination, performed a judicial function. In that regard, it observed that the High Council of Justice had determined all the questions of fact and law after holding a hearing and assessing the evidence, the Parliamentary Committee had been empowered to hold its own deliberations and conduct additional inquiries, if deemed necessary, which could end with a recommendation to dismiss or retain the judge and that the plenary of Parliament had subsequently approved dismissing the applicant based on the HCJ ’ s submissions and the Parliamentary Committee ’ s recommendation."

Georgia ( no. 45729/05, § 27, 28 March 2017), a disciplinary charge against the applicant had been examined by the Disciplinary Council of Judges at first instance as a four-member panel and on appeal sitting as a plenary. The decisions were then reviewed by the Supreme Court of Georgia. The Court observed that the disciplinary bodies that had conducted the proceedings had clearly performed a judicial function and that the Disciplinary Council of Judges clearly represented “a tribunal” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In Di Giovanni v. Italy ( no. 51160/06, § 37, 9 July 2013) the Court observed that the first - instance body – the disciplinary section of the Supreme Judicial Council ­ – had full jurisdiction to examine all the questions raised in the case. The fact that the decision could be appealed against before the Court of Cassation ( Sezioni Unite ) was an additional factor. Similarly, in several recent judgments against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Court observed in the context of the first condition that the first - instance disciplinary body, the State Judicial Council, determined all questions of facts and law after holding hearings and assessing evidence ( Poposki and Duma v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 69916/10 and 36531/11, § 37, 7 January 2016; Gerovska Popčevska v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 48783/07, § 58, 7 January 2016; Jakšovski and Trifunovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 56381/09 and 58738/09, § 32, 7 January 2016; and Mitrinovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 6899/12, § 29, 30 April 2015 )."

In dealing with the investigation material submitted to it by the investigating judge, the Supreme Court ’ s role had been to examine whether, based on the statements that had been made, the conduct allegedly exhibited by the applicant had raised a disciplinary issue which needed to be determined in trial proceedings conducted with procedural safeguards. Under domestic law therefore, the Supreme Court ’ s function at that phase had not been to weigh the witness statements, including those of the applicant, to assess their veracity or to assess or determine in any way whether they had pointed to guilt or to any suspicion of guilt. It had also not had the function of assessing whether there was a prima facie case against the applicant as that could only be determined by the SCJ, which heard the case. It had therefore not dealt with the same issues that had been subsequently examined by the SCJ.

By further defining the scope of the “civil” concept in Vilho Eskelinen and Others, the Court developed new criteria for the applicability of Article 6 § 1 to employment disputes concerning civil servants. According to these criteria, in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, to use the words of the Court in Pellegrin, a “special bond of trust and loyalty” between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, § 62)."

Whilst the Court stated in the Vilho Eskelinen and Others judgment that its reasoning in that case was limited to the situation of civil servants (§ 61, ibid.), the Grand Chamber notes that the criteria established in that judgment have been applied by different Chambers of the Court to disputes regarding judges (see G. v. Finland, no. 33173/05, 27 January 2009; Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine, no. 21722/11, ECHR 2013; Di Giovanni v. Italy, no. 51160/06, 9 July 2013; and Tsanova-Gecheva v.

In G. v. Finland (cited above, §§ 31-34), where the Government had maintained that a judge ’ s right to remain in office was special and could not be equated with “ordinary labour disputes” within the meaning of the Vilho Eskelinen and Others judgment, the Court implicitly rejected that argument and applied the principles laid down in Vilho Eskelinen and Others. More explicitly, in Bayer v. Germany, no. 8453/04, § 38, 16 July 2009, concerning the removal from office of a publicly employed bailiff following disciplinary proceedings, the Court held that disputes relating to “salaries, allowances or similar entitlements” were no more than non-exhaustive examples of the “ordinary labour disputes” to which Article 6 should in principle apply under the Vilho Eskelinen test.

By 31 December 2012 a further 46 judges will have to terminate their careers. As a consequence of this decision, the rapidity of judicial proceedings will significantly deteriorate (nearly 40,000 cases will have to be reassigned, which may even result in several years ’ delay in judicial proceedings, concerning tens of thousands of persons). The administration of the courts will be seriously hindered, since it is extremely difficult to replace dozens of retiring judges.",

Moreover, the proposal is unfair and humiliating with respect to the persons concerned, who took an oath to serve the Republic of Hungary and to administer justice, and who have devoted their lives to the judicial vocation.",

According to the explanatory memorandum to the Bills, it was proposed that the National Council of Justice be abolished and replaced by a National Judicial Office and a National Judicial Council. The purpose of those proposals was to separate judicial and managerial functions, which had been “unified” in the person of the President of the Supreme Court, who was at the same time President of the National Council of Justice. The proposed reform sought to concentrate the tasks of judicial management in the hands of the President of the new National Judicial Office, while leaving the responsibility for overseeing the uniform administration of justice with the President of the Supreme Court (which would be called by the historical name of “ Kúria ”).",

                "53. The Hungarian Ombudsman appealed to the Constitutional Court against the retrospective lowering of the retirement age of judges. In its judgment of 16 July 2012, the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional and consequently annulled the provisions on the compulsory retirement age of judges (sections 90(ha) and 230 of the 2011 Legal Status and Remuneration of Judges Act) as of 1 January 2012 (the date of entry into force of the Act). The Constitutional Court held that the new regulation violated the constitutional requirements for judicial independence on both “formal” and “substantive” grounds. From a formal perspective, a cardinal Act ought to determine the length of judicial service and the retirement age, in order to guarantee the irremovability of judges. Reference to the “general retirement age” in an ordinary Act did not fulfil that requirement. With regard to the substantive unconstitutionality of the provision, the new regulation had resulted in the removal of judges within a short period of three months. Notwithstanding the relative freedom of the legislature to determine the maximum age of serving judges, and the fact that no specific age can be deduced from the Fundamental Law, the Constitutional Court held that the introduction of a lowered retirement age for judges had to be done gradually, with an appropriate transition period and without violating the principle of the irremovability of judges. The greater the difference between the new retirement age and the age of 70 years, the longer the transitional period required for introducing a lower retirement age. Otherwise, the irremovability of judges, which constituted an essential element of the independence of the judiciary, would be violated."

XX of 2013, which repealed section 230, amended section 91 and added section 233/C to Law no. CLXII of 2011, with effect from 2 April 2013. Under the modified scheme, the reduction of the compulsory retirement age to a unified limit of 65 years will be effective as of 1 January 2023. Transitional provisions apply to the period between 2 April 2013 (the entry into force of the amendment) and 31 December 2022. During this interval, the age-limit for compulsory retirement will vary between 70 and 65 years, according to the date of birth of the person concerned (the older a judge is, the longer the preparation time accorded to him or her before compulsory retirement). For those judges who had already been affected by the rules of compulsory retirement and forced to retire, the new law introduced the possibility of choosing, within a 30-day time-limit to be calculated from the amendment ’ s entry into force, from three options. Firstly, they could request a stand-by post at the court from which they had retired, meaning that they would receive the difference between their pension allowance and 80% of their last basic salary (that is, calculated without the additional allowances received for holding senior positions, and so forth) and that, once in every three-year period, they may be ordered to perform judicial or managerial tasks for a maximum of two years. Secondly, they could apply to be reinstated to their normal judicial service. In that case, they would also be entitled to salary arrears for the period of their unconstitutionally ordered retirement. However, they could not be reinstated to their previous senior positions, such as court president (vice-president) or head of division (deputy head of division), unless that position had not been filled in the meantime. Thirdly, those who did not request reinstatement or placement in a stand-by post were entitled to lump-sum compensation, equal to one year ’ s salary.",

It noted that the Kúria ’ s tasks and competences had been broadened, in particular with regard to the supervision of the legality of municipal council regulations. The relevant parts of the judgment read as follows.",
                "“[30] 1. The impugned statutory provision terminated the mandate of an executive of an organ of the judiciary, an independent branch of State power, whose status was regulated by the Constitution.",
                "[31] The Vice-President of the Supreme Court was one of the executive officials of the judiciary, whose term of office was regulated by Article 48 § 1 of the Constitution. This Constitutional provision provided that the Vice-President of the Supreme Court was to be appointed by the President of the Republic upon the proposal of the Supreme Court ’ s President. Under section 69(1) of the old AOAC [Law no. LXVI of 1997 on the organisation and administration of the courts], the Vice-President ’ s term of office should last for a fixed duration of 6 years. One element of the system of separation of powers was that the Constitution distinguished the appointment of the executives of the highest judicial forum from the ordinary system for appointing court executives by placing their appointment in the hands of another branch, namely Parliament in the case of the Supreme Court ’ s President, and the President of the Republic in the case of its Vice-President. The fact that the former AOAC stipulated a longer fixed-term office for court executives than the mandate of the Government (thus overlapping governmental cycles) constituted one of the constitutional guarantees of the independence of the judiciary, a separate branch within the State.",
                "[32] The Fundamental Law and the new AOAC maintained this distinction with regard to the executives of the Kúria. Although the Fundamental Law does not regulate the appointment and dismissal of the Vice-President, the new AOAC contains a regulation which is similar to the previous one. According to its section 128(1), Vice-Presidents of the Kúria shall be appointed by the President of the Republic on proposals from the Kúria ’ s President. Their term of office lasts for a determinate period of six years, as stipulated in section 127(1). Pursuant to this regulation, the declaration of the termination of the Vice-President ’ s term of office by a unilateral State decision, that is, dismissal, is also within the power of the President of the Republic (see decision 176/1991. (IX. 4.) KE of the President of the Republic).",
                "[33] Under section 73 of the former AOAC and section 138 of the new AOAC, the term of office of a judicial executive shall be terminated, as a general rule, upon the expiry of the determinate period of appointment. However, it may be terminated sooner in the event of: resignation, mutual agreement, loss of judicial status and (if an appraisal concludes that the executive is inapt) dismissal.",
                "[34] 2. Taking into account the Constitutional Court ’ s case-law, it is observed that the shortening of fixed-term appointments via legislation has not been automatically declared unconstitutional if certain conditions were met. The Constitutional Court established [in its judgment no. 5/2007. (II. 27.) AB] that ‘ [t]he shortening of fixed-term appointments of State officials may only result from objective or subjective statutory causes (resignation, decease, establishment of incompatibility, application of a specified cause for dismissal or another reason directly affecting the term of office, such as structural modification of the institution) ’ (ABH 2007, 120, 126). The Constitutional Court holds that, in addition to organisational restructuring, an important change in the organisation ’ s functions, that is, in its powers and tasks, may warrant legislative intervention. Specifically, by the time of the selection of the executive in office, competencies required for the new functions of the organisation could not have been assessed. However, it cannot be ruled out that the organisation ’ s new tasks would require a person with different attitudes, professional experience and practice.",
                "[35] Accordingly, the Constitutional Court had to examine in the present case whether the entry into force of the Fundamental Law affected the functions and tasks of the highest judicial forum in a way which would justify the premature termination of the Vice-President ’ s term of office.",
                "[36] The Supreme Court was renamed Kúria. The Fundamental Law and the new AOAC modified thoroughly the central administration of the judicial system. Article 11 of the Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law separated the professional guidance of judicial activities and the organisational management of the judicial system from each other, on both an institutional and personal level. It provided that the successors to the Supreme Court, the National Council of Justice and its President are to be the Kúria in respect of adjudicating activities, and, in respect of court management – unless otherwise provided in a cardinal Act – the President of the National Judicial Office. It is because of this modification of the central management of the judiciary that Article 11 § 2 of the Transitional Provisions terminated the term of office of the President of the Supreme Court and of the President and the members of the National Council of Justice upon the entry into force of the Fundamental Law. This provision does not put an end to the Vice-President ’ s term of office, despite the fact that his mandate was regulated in the Constitution.",
                "[37] With the entry into force of the Fundamental Law and the new AOAC, the functions of the Kúria broadened and new tasks have been assigned to it. Pursuant to the Fundamental Law, it was given jurisdiction to supervise the legality of municipal council regulations and to establish whether or not local government had failed to comply with their legislation-related statutory obligations. The new AOAC contains a new chapter on the local government chamber of the Kúria as well as detailed regulations on the procedural rules related to the above-mentioned competences.",
                "[38] The Kúria ’ s competences in safeguarding the uniform application of law [coherence of the case-law] have also been extended. Besides adopting resolutions to promote the unity of jurisprudence [ jogegységi határozat ], it became competent to publish judicial resolutions of theoretical importance [ elvi bírósági határozat ] and to analyse the case-law on the basis of final and binding decisions.",
                "[39] Since safeguarding the consistent application of law became one of the main tasks of the Kúria, its President became responsible, besides internal management of the Kúria, for providing professional guidance on the monitoring, development and consistency of the case-law with regard to the entire court system.",
                "[40] The new AOAC, in its separate chapter on the uniform application of law, contains more detailed and in-depth regulations as regards the tasks and powers already contained in the old AOAC and vests new tasks in both the judicial organisation as a whole and in its executives. Whereas the relevant chapter of the old AOAC referred to the President of the Supreme Court only twice, the new AOAC designates the President or the Vice-President as holders of thirteen specific tasks and powers. In particular, the presidents of the Court of Appeals must inform the President of the Kúria about any decision of theoretical importance adopted by a court under their supervision, about emerging practice based on divergent principles or about final judgments based on divergent principles. The Presidents and Heads of Divisions of High Courts, as well as the Heads of Regional Administrative and Labour Law Divisions, have similar obligations to inform the President of the Kúria directly. A proposal for the publication of a decision of theoretical importance must be addressed to the President of the Kúria, and it is the President of the Kúria who should be notified by the President of the National Judicial Office about the necessity of initiating a uniformity procedure.",
                "[41] It is the President of the Kúria who defines on an annual basis the subjects to be examined by the case-law analysis groups. He or she appoints the heads and members of these groups. If the analysis indicates the need for legislative amendments, it is the President of the Kúria who proposes to the President of the National Judicial Office that he or she submit such a motion. It is the President of the Kúria who proposes to the Publication Panel the publication of a decision qualifying as a decision of theoretical importance. He or she is entitled to order that uniformity procedure be conducted, based on a proposal from the President of the Kúria, who also presides in such proceedings (in addition to the Vice-President and the Head or Deputy-head of the competent Division). In uniformity proceedings related to more than one Division, it is only the President or Vice-President of the Kúria who may preside. Similarly, if the aim of the uniformity proceedings is to modify or abrogate a previous uniformity resolution or to take a stance on a question of principle, the uniformity panel may only be presided by the President or the Vice-President of the Kúria.",
                "[42] Section 123(2) of the new AOAC provides that ‘ the Vice-President of the Kúria may replace the President ... with full power ’. It is therefore clear that the modification of the judicial system seriously affects not only the President ’ s but also the Vice-President ’ s functions. It follows from the possibility of a replacement exercising the full power of the President (which may occur at any time if the President is hindered for any reason or if the position is vacant) that there must be constant and close cooperation between the President and the Vice-President. Besides acting as a replacement, the Vice-President ‘ fulfils the tasks vested in him by the Rules of Court ’ (see section 123(2) of the new AOAC). This legal authority enables the Vice-President to fulfil some of the President ’ s tasks on a constant basis and to relieve him or her [of certain duties].",
                "[43] In the Constitutional Court ’ s opinion, the full-scale restructuring of the judicial system and the important changes relating to the functions and tasks of the Kúria and its President have significantly modified the legal position of the President compared to the date that the Vice-President was appointed. All this necessarily entails the simultaneous modification of the functions, tasks and competences of the Vice-President.",
                "[44] In the light of these changes, the relationship of trust between the President and the Vice-President, enshrined in Constitutional and statutory regulations, is of increased importance.",
                "[45] Consequently, the Constitutional Court finds that these changes provide sufficient justification for the premature termination of the applicant ’ s term of office."

Seven judges dissented and considered that the changes with regard to the judicial system, the new Kúria and the person of its President had not fundamentally affected the status of the Vice-President. The position of the Vice-President within the organisation of the supreme judicial instance did not change. Under the 1997 Organisation and Administration of the Courts Act, the Vice-President had already been entitled to replace the President of the Supreme Court with regard only to managerial tasks at the Supreme Court but not with regard to his or her functions as President of the National Council of Justice. The dissenting judges concluded that the premature termination of the applicant ’ s term of office had weakened the guarantees for the separation of powers, had been contrary to the prohibition on retrospective legislation, and had breached the principle of the rule of law and the right to a remedy.",

                "“107. According to Article 25 (1) of the new Constitution, the ‘ Curia ’ (the Hungarian historical name for the Supreme Court) will be the highest justice authority of Hungary. In the absence of transitional provisions and despite the fact that the election rules for its president remain unchanged in the new Constitution a question arises: will this change of the judicial body ’ s name result in replacement of the Supreme Court ’ s president by a new president of the ‘ Curia ’? As to the judges, they ‘ shall be appointed by the President of the Republic as defined by a cardinal Act ’ (Article 26 (2)). This also leaves of margin of interpretation as to the need to change (or not) the composition of the supreme body.",
                "108. As stipulated by Article 26 (2), the general retirement age will also be applied to judges. While it understands that the lowering of the judge ’ s retirement age (from 70 to 62) is part of the envisaged reform of the judicial system, the Commission finds this measure questionable in the light of the core principles and rules pertaining to the independence, the status and immovability of judges. According to different sources, this provision entails that around 300 of the most experienced judges will be obliged to retire within a year. Correspondingly, around 300 vacancies will need to be filled. This may undermine the operational capacity of the courts and affect continuity and legal security and might also open the way for undue influence on the composition of the judiciary. In the absence of sufficiently clear information on the reasons having led to this decision, the Commission trusts that adequate solutions will be found, in the context of the reform, to address, in line with the requirements of the rule of law, the difficulties and challenges engendered by this measure.",

As previously indicated, the reference in [the] second paragraph of the Closing Provisions to the 1949 Constitution seems to be in contradiction with the statement, in the Preamble, by which the Hungarian 1949 Constitution is declared as invalid. The Venice Commission tends to interpret this apparent inconsistency as a confirmation of the fact that the said statement does not have legal significance. Nevertheless, it is recommended that this is specifically clarified by the Hungarian authorities. The adoption of transitional provisions (as required by the third paragraph of the Closing Provisions), of particular importance in the light of the existence, for certain provisions of the new Constitution, of possibly diverging interpretations, could be used as an excellent opportunity for providing the necessary clarifications. This should not be used as a means to put an end to the term of office of persons elected or appointed under the previous Constitution.”"

According to Article 11 of the Temporary Provisions of the Fundamental Law, the Curia is the heir (legal successor) to the Supreme Court. All judges of the Supreme Court remained in office as judges with the exception of its President. Section 114 [of the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Act] established a new criterion for the election of the new President, which leads to the ineligibility of the former President of the Supreme Court as President of the Curia. This criterion refers to the time served as a judge in Hungary, not counting the time served as a judge for instance in a European Court. Many believe that the new criterion was aimed at preventing an individual person – the actual president of the Supreme Court – from being eligible for the post of the President of the Curia. Although the Law was formulated in a general way, its effect was directed against a specific person. Laws of this type are contrary to the rule of law.",
                "113. Other countries have rules that accept time periods that judges have spent abroad. Section 28.3 [of the Legal Status and Remuneration of Judges Act] states that a judge ’ s long-term secondment abroad shall be regarded as time completed at the service post occupied prior to the commencement of his or her time abroad. The Law does not provide for a minimum time a judge must have spent in Hungary before being posted abroad. Therefore, regulations of equivalence between national and international functions should be established, particularly with regard to requirements that a person has to fulfil in order to be appointed e.g. President of the Curia. Furthermore, it is highly uncommon to enact regulations that are retroactive and lead to the removal from a high function such as the President of the Curia.",
                "114. The unequal treatment between the judges of the Supreme Court and their President is difficult to justify. The Hungarian authorities seem to argue that the nature of the tasks of the President of the Curia and of the Supreme Court are radically different, and that the latter would be more engaged in administrative matters as the President of the previous National Council of the Judiciary, whereas the President of the Curia would deal more with substantive law and ensure the uniformity of the case-law. However, this argument is not convincing. The experience of the European Court of Human Rights could be particularly useful for the tasks of the President of the Curia.",
                "115. Since the provision of the Fundamental Law concerning the eligibility to become President of the Curia might be understood as an attempt to get rid of a specific person who would be a candidate for the President, who has served as president of the predecessor of the Curia, the law can operate as a kind of a sanction of the former president of the Supreme Court. Even if this is not the case, the impression that this might be the case, bears the risk of causing a chilling effect, thus threatening the independence of the judiciary.”"

It trusts that the Hungarian authorities will respect this judgment and ensure its implementation, i.e. re-instate the former judges to their previous positions. It seems that the labour courts have started to reinstate the retired judges. The Venice Commission ’ s delegation has however learned that the implementation of this judgment has resulted in considerable legal uncertainty. While the legal basis of early retirement was annulled with ex tunc effect, the individual resolutions of the President of Hungary, which dismissed some ten per cent of the Hungarian judges, are considered to remain in force, even if their legal basis had ceased to exist. The President of Hungary did not repeal them. The Legislator should adopt provisions re-instating the dismissed judges in their previous position without requiring them to go through a re-appointment procedure.",

Several judges already won their cases before the labour courts, but these judgments were appealed against by the President of the NJO because she disagreed with their reasoning. Most importantly, even final judgments of the labour courts would not result in a reinstatement of the judges concerned in their previous position, but they will go through a new appointment process and could be assigned to other courts than those, which they belonged to before their dismissal.",

In September 2012, the Hungarian Government introduced the legislative proposal T/8289, which would amend the Transitory Provisions of the Fundamental Law, introducing a new retirement age of 65 years for judges and prosecutors. Judges who are older than 65 would (after their re-appointment) be able to continue in office for one year before they would have to retire. The legislative proposal remains however silent on how the dismissed judges should be reinstated, leaving open only the way through the labour courts.",

The Commission is of the opinion that it should be possible to find a legislative solution that takes into account the various cases.",

This concerns reinstated judges but in the future also all other judges who turn 63. They would lose their leading position and would have to terminate their career as an ordinary judge. Apart from the fact that these judges are the most experienced to lead the courts, such a limitation constitutes evident age discrimination. The delegation was told that these experienced judges should train younger judges rather than hold leading positions in courts. This argument is hard to follow because younger judges learn from older ones precisely when they see how they act in leading positions.",

These new provisions are widely seen as being solely adopted to dismiss the sitting President of the Supreme Court, Mr Baka, who in the past had been critical of the government ’ s policies of judicial reform and who had successfully challenged a number of government decisions and laws before the Constitutional Court. Mr Baka was the Hungarian Judge to the European Court of Human Rights from 1991 to 2007, and was elected President of the Supreme Court by the Hungarian parliament in June 2009. Mr Baka had not previously served a five year term as a judge in Hungary, and was therefore, despite his 17 years of experience as a judge on the ECHR, ineligible for the post of President of the Curia. The widespread perception that these legal provisions were adopted against a specific person is strengthened by the fact that, in June 2011, the parliament adopted a decision that suspended all appointment procedures for judges until 1 January 2012, when Mr Baka would no longer be in office. This despite the backlog in cases that is often mentioned by the authorities as one of the underlying reasons for the reform of the judiciary. As mentioned by the Venice Commission, generally formulated legal provisions that are in reality directed against a specific person or persons are contrary to the rule of law.

The CJEU observed that the categories of persons concerned by the provisions in issue benefited, until their entry into force, from a derogation allowing them to remain in office until the age of 70, which gave rise, in those persons, to a well-founded expectation that they would be able to remain in office until that age.

The Committee also notes that presidential decree of 24 January 1997 No. 106 was not based on the replacement of the Constitutional Court with a new court but that the decree referred to the author in person and the sole reason given in the presidential decree for the dismissal of the author was stated as the expiry of his term as Constitutional Court judge, which was manifestly not the case. Furthermore, no effective judicial protections were available to the author to contest his dismissal by the executive. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the author ’ s dismissal from his position as a judge of the Constitutional Court, several years before the expiry of the term for which he had been appointed, constituted an attack on the independence of the judiciary and failed to respect the author ’ s right of access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country.

The Committee notes in this regard that the Minister of Justice, in his statement of June 1999 ..., and the Attorney-General of the Republic, in the report by the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office of 19 September 2000 ... recognize that the established procedures and safeguards for dismissal were not respected. Furthermore, the Committee considers that the circumstances referred to in Presidential Decree No. 144 could not be accepted by it in this specific case as grounds justifying the fact that the dismissal measures were in conformity with the law and, in particular, with Article 4 of the Covenant. The Presidential Decree merely refers to specific circumstances without, however, specifying the nature and extent of derogations from the rights provided for in domestic legislation and in the Covenant and without demonstrating that these derogations are strictly required and how long they are to last. Moreover, the Committee notes that the Democratic Republic of the Congo failed to inform the international community that it had availed itself of the right of derogation, as stipulated in Article 4, paragraph 3, of the Covenant. In accordance with its jurisprudence, the Committee recalls, moreover, that the principle of access to public service on general terms of equality implies that the State has a duty to ensure that it does not discriminate against anyone. This principle is all the more applicable to persons employed in the public service and to those who have been dismissed. With regard to Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Covenant, the Committee notes the absence of any reply from the State party and also notes, on the one hand, that the authors did not benefit from the guarantees to which they were entitled in their capacity as judges and by virtue of which they should have been brought before the Supreme Council of the Judiciary in accordance with the law, and on the other hand, that the President of the Supreme Court had publicly, before the case had been heard, supported the dismissals that had taken place ... thus damaging the equitable hearing of the case. Consequently, the Committee considers that those dismissals constitute an attack on the independence of the judiciary protected by Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Covenant. The dismissal of the authors was ordered on grounds that cannot be accepted by the Committee as a justification of the failure to respect the established procedures and guarantees that all citizens must be able to enjoy on general terms of equality. In the absence of a reply from the State party, and inasmuch as the Supreme Court, by its ruling of 26 September 2001, has deprived the authors of all remedies by declaring their appeals inadmissible on the grounds that Presidential Decree No. 144 constituted an act of Government, the Committee considers that, in this specific case, the facts show that there has been a violation of Article 25, paragraph (c), read in conjunction with Article 14, paragraph 1, on the independence of the judiciary, and of Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Covenant.”"

A procedure is not objective or reasonable if it does not respect the requirements of basic procedural fairness. The Committee also considers that the right of equal access to public service includes the right not to be arbitrarily dismissed from public service. The Committee notes the author ’ s claim that the procedure leading to his dismissal was neither objective nor reasonable. Despite numerous requests, he did not receive a copy of the proceedings from his first hearing before the JSC [Judicial Service Commission] on 18 November 1998; this is confirmed in the Supreme Court decision of 6 September 2004, and is not contested by the State party. Nor did he receive the findings of the Committee of Inquiry, on the basis of which he was dismissed by the JSC.

The Committee finds that the JSC ’ s failure to provide the author with all of the documentation necessary to ensure that he had a fair hearing, in particular its failure to inform him of the reasoning behind the Committee of Inquiry ’ s guilty verdict, on the basis of which he was ultimately dismissed, in their combination, amounts to a dismissal procedure which did not respect the requirements of basic procedural fairness and thus was unreasonable and arbitrary. For these reasons, the Committee finds that the conduct of the dismissal procedure was conducted neither objectively nor reasonably and it failed to respect the author ’ s right of access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country.

As set out in the same general comment, the Committee recalls that ‘ judges may be dismissed only on serious grounds of misconduct or incompetence, in accordance with fair procedures ensuring objectivity and impartiality set out in the constitution or the law. ’ For the reasons set out in paragraph 7.2 above, the dismissal procedure did not respect the requirements of basic procedural fairness and failed to ensure that the author benefited from the necessary guarantees to which he was entitled in his capacity as a judge, thus constituting an attack on the independence of the judiciary. For this reason the Committee concludes that the author ’ s rights under Article 25 (c) in conjunction with Article 14, paragraph 1, have been violated.”"

The dismissal of judges on such a short notice practically means that after the entry into force of the amendment elections for court chairpersons should be organised, and after the elections all the mandate of chairpersons appointed before the amendment (except the chairperson of the Court of Cassation) is terminated.

As far as the justification or compelling reasons for such a transitional rule are concerned, the amendments are proposed at the background of the possible estimation of the role of the court chairpersons in Armenia that could involuntarily create a situation when court chairpersons may exercise some influence on other judges of the court. The Venice Commission notes, however, that the powers of court presidents, as defined in Article 25 of the Judicial Code are essentially of an administrative character. Although the proposed reform serves the legitimate aim of avoiding any undue influence of the court presidents on other judges, it does not appear from the rationale that the need of the removal of the sitting presidents of these courts from their office is so urgent as to justify such a radical and immediate removal of court presidents from their office.",

The Commission therefore concludes that such a radical change of chairpersons has no justification within the amendment and it does not follow from the rules of the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia.

The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in its case-law concerning the removal of judges, has referred to the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary and to General Comment No. 32 of the UN Human Rights Committee. The case of Supreme Court of Justice (Quintana Coello et al.) v. Ecuador (preliminary objection, merits, reparations and costs), judgment of 23 August 2013, Series C No. 266, concerned the removal of twenty-seven judges of the Supreme Court of Justice of Ecuador through a parliamentary resolution. The Inter-American Court found that the State had violated Article 8 § 1 (right to a fair trial), in conjunction with Article 1 § 1 (obligation to respect rights) of the American Convention on Human Rights, to the detriment of the victims, because they had been dismissed from office by a body without jurisdiction, which moreover had not granted them an opportunity to be heard. Furthermore, the Court found a violation of Article 8 § 1 in conjunction with Article 23 § 1 (c) (right to have access, under general conditions of equality, to the public service of his country) and Article 1 § 1 of the American Convention, given the arbitrary effects on the tenure in office of the judiciary and the consequent effects on judicial independence, to the detriment of the twenty-seven victims. It noted as follows as regards the general standards on judicial independence (footnotes omitted).",
                "“ 1(1). General standards on judicial independence",
                "144. In its case law, the Court has indicated that the scope of judicial guarantees and effective judicial protection for judges must be examined in relation to the standards on judicial independence. In the case of Reverón Trujillo v. Venezuela, the Court emphasized that judges, unlike other public officials, enjoy specific guarantees due to the independence required of the judiciary, which the Court has understood as ‘ essential for the exercise of the judiciary. ’ The Court has reiterated that one of the main objectives of the separation of public powers is to guarantee the independence of judges. The purpose of protection is to ensure that the judicial system in general, and its members in particular, are not subject to possible undue restrictions in the exercise their duties by bodies outside the Judiciary, or even by judges who exercise functions of review or appeal. In line with the case law of this Court and of the European Court of Human Rights, and in accordance with the United Nations Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary (hereinafter ‘ Basic Principles ’ ), the following guarantees are derived from judicial independence: an appropriate process of appointment, guaranteed tenure and guarantees against external pressures.",
                "145. Regarding the scope of security of tenure relevant to this case, the Basic Principles establish that ‘ [t]he term of office of judges [...] shall be adequately secured by law ’ and that ‘ [j]udges, whether appointed or elected, shall have guaranteed tenure until the mandatory retirement age or the expiry of the term of office, where such exists. ’ Moreover, the Human Rights Committee has stated that judges may be dismissed only on grounds of serious misconduct or incompetence, in accordance with fair procedures ensuring objectivity and impartiality set out in the Constitution or the law. This Court has accepted these principles and has stated that the authority responsible for the process of removing a judge must act independently and impartially in the procedure established for that purpose and must allow for the exercise of the right to defense. This is so because the free removal of judges raises the objective doubt of the observer regarding the judges ’ real possibilities of ruling on specific disputes without fear of reprisals.",
                "147. Nevertheless, judges do not have absolute guarantees of tenure in their positions. International human rights law accepts that judges may be dismissed for conduct that is clearly unacceptable. In General Comment No. 32, the Human Rights Committee has established that judges may be dismissed only for reasons of serious misconduct or incompetence. ...",
                "148. In addition, other standards draw a distinction between the sanctions applicable, emphasizing that the guarantee of immovability implies that dismissal is the result of serious misconduct, while other sanctions may be considered in the event of negligence or incompetence. ...",
                "150. Furthermore, regarding the protection afforded by Article 23(1) (c) of the American Convention in the cases of Apitz Barbera et al., and Reverón Trujillo, this Court specified that Article 23(1) (c) does not establish the right to participate in government, but to do so ‘ under general conditions of equality. ’ This means that respect for and guarantee of this right are fulfilled when there are ‘ clear procedures and objective criteria for appointment, promotion, suspension and dismissal ’ and that ‘ persons are not subject to discrimination ’ in the exercise of this right. In this respect, the Court has pointed out that equality of opportunities in access to and tenure in office guarantee freedom from all interference or political pressure.",
                "151. Likewise, the Court has stated that a judge ’ s guarantee of tenure is related to the right to remain in public office, under general conditions of equality. Indeed, in the case of Reverón Trujillo it established that ‘ access in equal conditions would constitute an insufficient guarantee if it were not accompanied by the effective protection of the continuance in what is accessed. ’",
                "152. For its part, in cases of arbitrary dismissal of Judges the Human Rights Committee has considered that failure to observe the basic requirements of due process violates the right to due process enshrined in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the counterpart of Article 8 of the American Convention), in conjunction with the right to have access under general conditions of equality to public office in the country, as provided for under Article 25(c) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the counterpart of Article 23(1)(c) of the American Convention).",
                "153. The foregoing serves to clarify some aspects of the Court ’ s jurisprudence. Indeed, in the case of Reverón Trujillo v. Venezuela, the Court concluded that the right to be heard by an independent tribunal, enshrined in Article 8(1) of the Convention, only implied that a citizen has a right to be judged by an independent judge. However, it is important to point out that judicial independence should not only be analyzed in relation to justiciable matters, given that the judge must have a series of guarantees that allow for judicial independence. The Court considers it pertinent to specify that the violation of the guarantee of judicial independence, as it relates to a judge ’ s tenure and stability in his position, must be examined in light of the conventional rights of a judge who is affected by a State decision that arbitrarily affects the term of his appointment. In that sense, the institutional guarantee of judicial independence is directly related to a judge ’ s right to remain in his post, as a consequence of the guarantee of tenure in office.",
                "154. Finally, the Court has emphasized that the State must guarantee the independent exercise of the judiciary, both in its institutional aspect, that is, in terms of the judicial branch as a system, and in its individual aspect, that is, in relation to a particular individual judge. The Court deems it pertinent to point out that the objective dimension is related to essential aspects for the Rule of Law, such as the principle of separation of powers, and the important role played by the judiciary in a democracy. Consequently, this objective dimension transcends the figure of the judge and collectively affects society as a whole. Likewise, there is a direct connection between the objective dimension of judicial independence and the right of judges to have access to and remain in public service, under general conditions of equality, as an expression of their guaranteed tenure.",
                "155. Bearing in mind the aforementioned standards, the Court considers that: i) respect for judicial guarantees implies respect for judicial independence; ii) the scope of judicial independence translates into a judge ’ s subjective right to be dismissed from his position exclusively for the reasons permitted, either by means of a process that complies with judicial guarantees or because the term or period of his mandate has expired, and iii) when a judge ’ s tenure is affected in an arbitrary manner, the right to judicial independence enshrined in Article 8(1) of the American Convention is violated, in conjunction with the right to access and remain in public office, on general terms of equality, established in Article 23(1)(c) of the American Convention.”"

It noted that the criterion introduced in Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ( [GC], no. 63235/00, ECHR 2007 ‑ II) in respect of the applicability of Article 6 to disputes concerning civil servants was indistinguishable from the merits of the applicant ’ s complaint under this provision (access to a court). It therefore joined the issue of its competence ratione materiae to the merits (see paragraph 71 of the Chamber judgment). In applying the test introduced in the above-mentioned judgment (hereafter “the Vilho Eskelinen test”), the Chamber observed that under Hungarian law judges of the Supreme Court, including their president, were not expressly excluded from the right of access to a court. In fact, domestic law expressly provided for the right to a court in the event of dismissal of a court executive (see paragraph 74 of the Chamber judgment). Rather than by express exclusion, the applicant ’ s access to a court had been impeded by the fact that the impugned measure – the premature termination of his mandate as President of the Supreme Court – had been written into the new Constitution itself and had therefore not been subject to any form of judicial review, including by the Constitutional Court. In those circumstances, the nature of the impugned measure itself rendered the applicant ’ s access to a court impossible “in practice” (see paragraph 75 of the Chamber judgment). Therefore, it could not be concluded that the national law had “expressly excluded access to a court” for the applicant ’ s claim. The first condition of the Vilho Eskelinen test had not been met and Article 6 applied under its civil head (see paragraph 76 of the Chamber judgment)."

Furthermore, even assuming that the national legislative framework had specifically denied the applicant the right of access to a court, the Chamber considered that the applicant ’ s exclusion from that right had not been justified. The mere fact that the applicant was in a sector or department which participated in the exercise of power conferred by public law was not in itself decisive. In the applicant ’ s case, the Government had not adduced any arguments to show that the subject matter of the dispute had been linked to the exercise of State power in such a way that the exclusion of the Article 6 guarantees had been objectively justified. In this regard, the Chamber considered it significant that, unlike the applicant, the former Vice-President of the Supreme Court had been able to challenge the premature termination of his mandate before the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 77 of the Chamber judgment)."

The legislative measures terminating his mandate had interfered with his explicit and unconditional right enshrined in the domestic law and, in particular, the Constitution, to fulfil his mandate. Given that he had been transferred to a post with a lower grade and had been subject to a reduction in his remuneration, the facts of the case boiled down to an employment dispute."

According to the applicant, in order to determine the “civil” nature of his right, the relevant test was the Vilho Eskelinen test, which applies irrespective of which of the rights contained in Article 6 § 1 is considered to have been violated (access to a court or other guarantees). He considered that none of the conditions of the test that would render Article 6 inapplicable to his dispute had been met. As regards the first condition, an implied bar was not enough; the national law must expressly exclude access to a court for a certain post or category of staff, and that exclusion must be of an abstract nature, that is, it must concern all office holders and not a specified person. The impugned legislative act terminating his mandate concerned him alone. Hungarian law, rather than excluding access to a court for the post or category of staff in question, expressly ensured that a court executive had the right of access to a court in the event of his or her dismissal. Furthermore, the impugned measure terminating his mandate was unforeseeable and of an abusive nature. As regards the second condition of the Vilho Eskelinen test, the applicant ’ s legal status, far from being incomparable with that of the other court executives, did not involve any special exercise of discretionary powers intrinsic to State sovereignty to an extent that would justify the exclusion of his access to a court in relation to his dismissal. Although he performed some special tasks within the judiciary (coordination, guidance and advocacy, aimed at the continuous development of the judiciary), from the perspective of the separation of powers he did not have a stronger “bond of trust and loyalty” with the State than his colleagues. He shared the very same judicial independence.

They maintained that the Vilho Eskelinen test was intended for cases which did not concern the right of access to a court but rather the applicability of the procedural guarantees provided for by Article 6 § 1. In any event, they were of the opinion that the two cumulative conditions of the test had been met, rendering Article 6 inapplicable. Firstly, contrary to the conclusions of the Chamber judgment (see paragraph 75 of the Chamber judgment), the nature of the impugned measure itself had rendered the applicant ’ s access to a court impossible not “in practice”, but “in law”. It would be unreasonable to expect the legislature to enact a provision expressly excluding access to a court in respect of measures that are obviously and undisputedly not subject to any form of judicial review. As regards the second condition, the applicant ’ s post involved by its very nature the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State (the Government referred to Harabin v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 62584/00, 9 July 2002, concerning the President of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic; and Apay v. Turkey (dec.), no. 3964/05, 11 December 2007, and Nazsiz v. Turkey (dec.), no. 22412/05, 26 May 2009, both concerning public prosecutors). If public prosecutors had been found by the Court to fall within the category of public servants exercising discretionary powers intrinsic to State sovereignty, it was surprising that the President of the Supreme Court of Hungary, whose privileges were regulated among those of the highest-ranking public officials, had not been found by the Chamber to fall into that category. In the light of the constitutional status of the President of the Supreme Court, it seemed to be quite arbitrary to conclude that the termination of his mandate was not linked to the exercise of State power to at least the same extent as termination of the employment of public prosecutors."

The International Commission of Jurists observed that the special and fundamental role of the judiciary as an independent branch of State power, in accordance with the principles of the separation of powers and the rule of law, is recognised within the Convention, both explicitly and implicitly. This special role must accordingly be given significant weight in assessing any restrictions imposed by the other branches of the State on Convention rights applicable to judges. In order to preserve the special role of the judiciary, the Convention should be interpreted in a manner that limits the scope for the executive or legislative branch to justify the imposition of restrictions on Article 6 rights of judges in employment disputes on grounds of legitimate interest. The power exercised by a judge, although quintessentially of a public nature, is both structurally and inherently distinct from that of public servants of the executive or legislature. The International Commission of Jurists submitted that under the second condition of the Vilho Eskelinen test it would rarely, if ever, be objectively justifiable in the public interest for the executive or legislative branches to impose measures excluding the application of Article 6 § 1 to employment disputes involving judges, particularly in those cases that affected judicial independence, and, therefore, the separation of powers and the rule of law.

Effective access to justice and fair procedures in resolving disputes on the tenure, removal or conditions of service of judges are important safeguards for judicial independence. When assessing any justification advanced by the State for excluding judges ’ access to a court in respect of their career and security of tenure, consideration should be given to the strong public interest of upholding the role, independence and integrity of the judiciary in a democratic society under the rule of law. Although the individual judge may be the immediate beneficiary of the full protection of his or her Article 6 rights, the protection ultimately benefits all persons entitled under Article 6 § 1 to an “independent and impartial tribunal”.",

The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 § 1 into play (see, among many other authorities, Boulois v.

Following the functional criterion adopted in Pellegrin, employment disputes involving posts in the judiciary were excluded from the scope of Article 6 § 1 because, although the judiciary was not part of the ordinary civil service, it was nonetheless considered part of typical public service (see Pitkevich v.

By further defining the scope of the “civil” concept in Vilho Eskelinen and Others, the Court developed new criteria for the applicability of Article 6 § 1 to employment disputes concerning civil servants. According to these criteria, in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, to use the words of the Court in Pellegrin, a “special bond of trust and loyalty” between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, § 62)."

The rules governing the tenure of the President of the Supreme Court were contained not in the 1949 Constitution but, during its term of validity until 31 December 2011, in Law no. LXVI of 1997 – the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Act (see paragraphs 40-43 above). Section 62 of that Act listed the president of a court among the so-called “court executives”, that is, judges responsible for the management and administration of courts. Since the applicant was elected President of the Supreme Court under Article 48 § 1 of the 1949 Constitution, he became a “court executive”. Under section 69 of the 1997 Organisation and Administration of the Courts Act, court executives were appointed for six years, with the undisputed consequence that the applicant ’ s term of office as President of the Supreme Court should in principle have been six years (from 22 June 2009 until 22 June 2015). Section 73 of the Act contained an exhaustive list of reasons for terminating the mandates of court executives (mutual agreement, resignation, dismissal, expiry of the period of the term of office and termination of the person ’ s judicial office). As this provision indicates, unless a term of office was terminated on the ground of its expiry or that the person ’ s judicial mandate had come to an end (sub-sections (d) and (e)), the only permissible grounds were mutual agreement, resignation or dismissal (sub-sections (a) to (c)). Furthermore, as regards the latter, pursuant to section 74/A(1), the only possible ground for dismissal was demonstrable incompetence in performing the managerial position, in which event the incumbent was entitled to seek judicial review of the dismissal before the Service Tribunal (see paragraph 43 above). It thus transpires from the terms of the said provisions that there existed a right for an office holder to serve a term of office until such time as it expired, or until his or her judicial mandate came to an end. This is further shown by the fact that, should the office be terminated at an earlier stage against that person ’ s consent, namely by way of dismissal, he or she would have standing to apply for judicial review of that decision (see, mutatis mutandis, Zander v.

In this connection, it attaches some weight to the fact that the Constitutional Court did not dismiss the former Vice-President of the Supreme Court ’ s constitutional complaint against the premature termination of his position as lacking a legal basis (see paragraph 55 above).

On the contrary, domestic law expressly provided for the right to a court in those limited circumstances in which the dismissal of a court executive was permissible: the dismissed court executive was indeed entitled to contest his or her dismissal before the Service Tribunal (see paragraph 43 above). In this respect, judicial protection was available under domestic law for cases of dismissal, in line with the international and Council of Europe standards on the independence of the judiciary and the procedural safeguards applicable in cases of removal of judges (see, in particular, point 20 of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary in paragraph 72 above; General Comment No. 32 of the UN Human Rights Committee in paragraph 73 above; the relevant case-law of the Human Rights Committee in paragraphs 74-76 above; paragraphs 1.3, 5.1 and 7.2 of the European Charter on the Statute for Judges in paragraph 77 above; paragraphs 59-60 of Opinion no. 1 (2001) of the Consultative Council of European Judges (CCJE) on standards concerning the independence of the judiciary and the irremovability of judges in paragraph 79 above; paragraph 6 of the Magna Carta of Judges of the CCJE in paragraph 81 above; and the case-law of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in paragraph 84 above)."

This precluded him from contesting that measure before the Service Tribunal, which he would have been able to do in the event of a dismissal on the basis of the existing legal framework (see paragraph 43 above). Moreover, and unlike the Vice-President of the Supreme Court, whose mandate was also terminated at the statutory level by the transitional provisions of the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Act, the termination of the applicant ’ s mandate was provided for in the Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law, which also came into force on 1 January 2012 (see paragraph 49 above).

In the light of the above considerations the Court is of the view that, in the specific circumstances of the present case, it must determine whether access to a court had been excluded under domestic law before, rather than at the time when, the impugned measure concerning the applicant was adopted. To hold otherwise would mean that the impugned measure itself, which constituted the alleged interference with the applicant ’ s “right”, could at the same time be the legal basis for the exclusion of the applicant ’ s claim from access to a court. This would open the way to abuse, allowing Contracting States to bar access to a court in respect of individual measures concerning their public servants, by simply including those measures in an ad hoc statutory provision not subject to judicial review."

This concept, which is expressly mentioned in the Preamble to the Convention and is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention, requires, inter alia, that any interference must in principle be based on an instrument of general application (see, mutatis mutandis, Vistiņš and Perepjolkins v. Latvia [GC], no. 71243/01, § 99, 25 October 2012; see also, mutatis mutandis, concerning legislative interferences and the rule of law, Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v.

Given that the two conditions for excluding the application of Article 6 must be fulfilled, the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine whether the second condition of the Vilho Eskelinen test would have been met (see, for instance, Karaduman and Tandoğan v.

The whole makes up the right to a fair trial secured by Article 6 § 1 (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 36, Series A no. 18). However, the right of access to the courts is not absolute and may be subject to limitations that do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Markovic and Others v.

Although its above findings with regard to the issue of applicability do not prejudge its consideration of the question of compliance (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, § 64, and Tsanova-Gecheva, § 87, both cited above), the Court cannot but note the growing importance which international and Council of Europe instruments, as well as the case-law of international courts and the practice of other international bodies, are attaching to procedural fairness in cases involving the removal or dismissal of judges, including the intervention of an authority independent of the executive and legislative powers in respect of every decision affecting the termination of office of a judge (see paragraphs 72-77, 79, 81 and 84 above).

The proposals to terminate his mandate and the new eligibility criterion for the post of President of the Kúria had all been submitted to Parliament after the applicant had publicly expressed his views on a number of legislative reforms, and had been adopted within an extremely short time (see paragraph 94 of the Chamber judgment). The fact that the functions of the President of the National Council of Justice had been separated from those of the President of the new Kúria was not in itself sufficient to conclude that the functions to which the applicant had been elected had ceased to exist after the entry into force of the Fundamental Law.

Issues concerning the functioning of the justice system constituted questions of public interest, the debate of which enjoyed the protection of Article 10 of the Convention. It had been not only the applicant ’ s right but also his duty as President of the National Council of Justice to express his opinion on legislative reforms affecting the judiciary. As regards the proportionality of the interference, the applicant ’ s term of office as President of the Supreme Court had been terminated three and a half years before the end of the fixed term applicable under the legislation in force at the time of his election. The Chamber reiterated that the fear of sanction had a “chilling effect” on the exercise of freedom of expression and, in particular, risked discouraging judges from making critical remarks about public institutions or policies (see paragraph 101 of the judgment). In addition, the impugned measure had not been subject to effective judicial review by the domestic courts.

There was a unanimous perception at both national and international level that a causal link existed between the expression of his opinion on the legislative reforms in question and the legislative measures entailing his premature removal. The chain of events and the very significant amount of evidence furnished by him all supported that causal link. The interviews given by the two members of the parliamentary majority and the Government ’ s assurances to the Venice Commission all pre-dated the applicant ’ s speech in Parliament on 3 November 2011, after which the proposals to terminate his mandate and to abolish his post-term allowances had been submitted. The alleged link between the changes affecting the Supreme Court on the one hand, and the termination of his mandate on the other, had merely been created subsequently by the Government as a pretext. The applicant noted in this regard that none of the proposals for the termination of his mandate were supported by an explanatory memorandum justifying the measure in question by the fundamental changes in the functions and tasks of the supreme judicial authority. They referred only to the entry into force of the new Fundamental Law, which could hardly be seen as a sufficient and acceptable reason in the circumstances of the case. In any event, both the functions of the new Kúria and the role of its president remained essentially the same. The fact that the managerial tasks attached to the position of the President of the National Council of Justice, which was accessorial to that of the President of the Supreme Court, had been taken away, affected in no way whatsoever the validity of his election to the presidency of the supreme judicial body."

Hungary on the premature removal of the former Hungarian data-protection supervisor, see paragraph 70 above, which should apply a fortiori to a Supreme Court president). He pointed out that in a democratic society governed by the rule of law no reconsideration, either by the legislature or by the executive, of the suitability of any elected judicial official could be allowed before the expiry of the term of office (without prejudice to the legally provided grounds for dismissal or revocation). Furthermore, the only purpose of introducing the new eligibility criterion (five years of judicial service) had been to provide justification for his removal, albeit retroactively.

The fact that the public expression of his opinions pre-dated the termination of his mandate was not sufficient to prove that there was a causal relationship between them. The applicant ’ s mandate had been terminated because of the fundamental changes in the functions of the supreme judicial authority in Hungary. The function to which he had been elected (comprising a mixture of administrative and judicial functions) had ceased to exist upon the entry into force of the new Fundamental Law of Hungary. His activities had been mostly connected with the functions of the President of the National Council of Justice, which had been separated from the functions of the President of the Kúria. In addition, the functions and competences of the Kúria itself had also been changed and broadened (it had been given a new power to supervise the legality of local-government regulations, and new tasks in securing the consistency of the case-law). Relying on the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 19 March 2013 concerning the termination of the mandate of the former Vice-President of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 55 above), the Government noted that the major changes in the functions of the President of the Kúria as compared to the President of the Supreme Court justified the reconsideration of the applicant ’ s suitability for the post of administrative head of the Kúria, having regard to his professional expertise and previous professional career."

In their opinion, any case of removal of a president of one of the highest domestic courts, in circumstances which could raise justified concerns as to the actual reasons for removal, should be reviewed by the Court with utmost scrutiny and would require a particularly compelling justification for its lawfulness. The third party referred to the international and comparative-law standards on judicial independence and irremovability of judges, including presidents of courts. In this respect, for instance, the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic had in a judgment of 11 July 2006 interpreted the principle of judicial irremovability as protecting against arbitrary removal from high judicial office and held that the Constitution required that court presidents and deputy court presidents could be removed only “on the grounds foreseen in the law and on the basis of a decision of a court”. The Constitutional Court had reiterated this principle in a judgment of 6 October 2010, in which it had stated that “[i]t is not possible to construct a duality in the legal position of the chairman of a court as an official of State administration, on one hand, and judge, on the other hand.

In order to answer this question, the scope of the measure must be determined by putting it in the context of the facts of the case and of the relevant legislation. For a recapitulation of the relevant case-law, see Wille, cited above, §§ 42-43; Harabin (dec.) 2004, cited above; Kayasu v.

The Court observed that, in that letter, the Prince had criticised the content of the applicant ’ s public lecture on the powers of the Constitutional Court and announced the intention to sanction him because of his opinion on certain questions of constitutional law. The Court therefore concluded that Article 10 was applicable and that there had been an interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression. Similarly, in Kudeshkina (cited above), the Court observed that the decision to bar the applicant from holding judicial office had been prompted by her statements to the media. Neither the applicant ’ s eligibility for public service nor her professional ability to exercise judicial functions formed part of the arguments before the domestic authorities. Accordingly, the measure complained of essentially related to freedom of expression, and not to the holding of a public post in the administration of justice, the right to which is not secured by the Convention (see Kudeshkina, §§ 79-80; see also, as regards the disciplinary dismissal of a public prosecutor, Kayasu, cited above, §§ 77 ‑ 81)."

On the contrary, in other cases the Court found that the measure complained of lay, as such, within the sphere of holding a public post within the administration of justice, and was unrelated to the exercise of freedom of expression. In Harabin (dec.) 2004, cited above, the Court considered that the Government ’ s proposal to dismiss the applicant as President of the Supreme Court (based on a report by the Minister of Justice) essentially related to the applicant ’ s ability to exercise his functions, that is, to the appraisal of his professional qualifications and personal qualities in the context of his activities and attitudes relating to State administration of the Supreme Court. The report submitted by the Minister of Justice referred, among other things, to the applicant ’ s failure to initiate the dismissal of a Supreme Court judge who had attacked an official of the Ministry of Justice and to his alleged failure to apply professional criteria when proposing candidates to fill the posts at the Supreme Court. Although it also referred to the views expressed by the applicant on a draft amendment to the Constitution (raising concerns about the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary), the documents before the Court did not indicate that the proposal to remove the applicant was “exclusively or preponderantly prompted by those views”. Similarly, in the Harabin judgment (cited above), it was the applicant ’ s professional behaviour in the context of the administration of justice which represented the essential aspect of the case. The disciplinary proceedings against him (after refusing to allow an audit by Ministry of Finance staff that he considered should have been conducted by the Supreme Audit Office) related to the discharge of his duties as President of the Supreme Court, and therefore lay within the sphere of his employment in the civil service. Furthermore, the disciplinary offence of which he had been found guilty did not involve any statements or views expressed by him in the context of a public debate. The Court accordingly concluded that the disputed measure did not constitute an interference with Article 10 rights and declared the relevant complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded (ibid., §§ 150-53).",

                "143. As stated above, the Court must first ascertain whether the measure complained of amounted to an interference with the applicant ’ s exercise of freedom of expression. In order to answer that question, the scope of the measure must be determined by putting it in the context of the facts of the case and of the relevant legislation (see Wille, cited above, § 43). Having regard to the facts of the present case and the nature of the allegations made, the Court considers that this issue should be examined in the light of the general principles emerging from its case-law on the assessment of evidence. It reiterates in this connection that in assessing evidence, it has adopted the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard. The Court ’ s role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States ’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005-VII). The Court adopts those conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts in their entirety and from the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (ibid.). It has been the Court ’ s practice to allow flexibility in this respect, taking into consideration the nature of the substantive right at stake and any evidentiary difficulties involved. In certain instances, only the Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting the applicant ’ s allegations; consequently, a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti, non neganti, incumbit probatio is impossible (see Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 79, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV). Although these principles have mainly been applied in the context of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (see Aktaş v. Turkey, no. 24351/94, § 79, 24 April 2003, and El ‑ Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, §§ 151 ‑ 52, ECHR 2012 ), the Court observes that there are examples in which they have been applied in respect of other Convention rights (Article 5 in Creangă v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, §§ 88-90, 23 February 2012; Article 8 in Fadeyeva, cited above; Article 11 in Makhmudov v. Russia, no. 35082/04, §§ 68-73, 26 July 2007; and Article 14 in D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, §§ 177-79, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV )."

These principles are particularly relevant in the present case, where no domestic court ever examined the applicant ’ s allegations and the reasons for the termination of his mandate as President of the Supreme Court. It is against this background that the Grand Chamber agrees with the Chamber ’ s approach according to which the facts of the case and the sequence of events have to be assessed and considered “in their entirety” (compare with Ivanova v.

                "145. The Court deems it necessary to note the sequence of events in the present case. It notes at the outset that the applicant, in his professional capacity as President of the Supreme Court and the National Council of Justice, publicly expressed his views on various legislative reforms affecting the judiciary. On 12 February 2011 the applicant ’ s spokesperson explained to a newspaper the concerns felt by the applicant in relation to the Nullification Bill ordering the annulment of final convictions (see paragraph 16 above). On 24 March 2011 he delivered a speech in Parliament on certain aspects of the draft version of the new Fundamental Law of Hungary (see paragraph 18 above). On 7 April 2011 the applicant, together with other court presidents, addressed a letter to the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister in which they criticised the proposal in the draft version of the Fundamental Law of Hungary to reduce the mandatory retirement age of judges (see paragraph 19 above). On 11 April 2011 the applicant addressed a letter to the Prime Minister in which he again criticised the proposal on the retirement age of judges, stressing that the proposal was humiliating and that it infringed the principles of the independence and irremovability of judges (see paragraph 20 above). On 14 April 2011 the applicant in his capacity as President of the National Council of Justice, together with the plenary of the Supreme Court and other court presidents, issued a public communiqué criticising again the new retirement age of judges, as well as the proposal to modify the National Council of Justice (see paragraph 21 above). In their communiqué, they expressed the view that the new retirement age had been regulated in the Fundamental Law to avoid any possibility of judicial review by the Constitutional Court, and suggested that there had been political motivation behind that approach. On 4 August 2011 the applicant challenged certain new legislation on judicial proceedings before the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 22 above). On 3 November 2011 the applicant delivered another speech before Parliament, in which he raised his concerns about the proposal to replace the National Council of Justice by an external administration (the National Judicial Office) entrusted with the management of the courts (see paragraph 23 above). In his speech, the applicant strongly criticised the proposal, and stated that the new body would have “excessive”, “unconstitutional” and “uncontrollable” powers. The applicant again criticised the new retirement age of judges, stating that it would have a severe effect on the Supreme Court."

                "146. The Court further notes that two members of the parliamentary majority, one of whom was State Secretary of Justice, gave interviews on 14 April and 19 October 2011, declaring that the President of the Supreme Court would remain as President of the new Kúria and that only the name of the institution would change (see paragraph 25 above). On 6 July 2011 the Government had assured the Venice Commission that the drafting of the transitional provisions of the Fundamental Law would not be used to unduly put an end to the terms of office of persons elected under the previous legal regime (see paragraph 26 above). The Court does not accept the Government ’ s argument that the fact that those two interviews were given after the applicant had expressed some of his criticisms proves that the contested measure was not ultimately a consequence of those criticisms. All of the proposals to terminate his mandate as President of the Supreme Court were made public and submitted to Parliament between 19 and 23 November 2011, shortly after his parliamentary speech of 3 November 2011, and were adopted within a strikingly short time. The termination of the applicant ’ s mandate came into effect on 1 January 2012, when the Fundamental Law came into force and the new Kúria became the legal successor to the Supreme Court."

Moreover, the Court observes that on 9 November 2011 the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Bill was amended and a new criterion was introduced as regards eligibility for the post of President of the Kúria (see paragraphs 35 and 50 above). The candidates for that post had to be judges appointed for an indeterminate term, having served at least five years as a judge in Hungary. The time served as a judge in an international court was not covered, which resulted in the applicant ’ s ineligibility for the post of President of the new Kúria."

                "148. In the Court ’ s view, having regard to the sequence of events in their entirety, rather than as separate and distinct incidents, there is prima facie evidence of a causal link between the applicant ’ s exercise of his freedom of expression and the termination of his mandate. This is corroborated by the numerous documents submitted by the applicant which refer to the widespread perception that such a causal link existed. These include not only articles published in both the Hungarian and foreign press, but also texts adopted by Council of Europe institutions (see the position of the Monitoring Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in paragraph 62, and the position of the Venice Commission in paragraph 59 above)."

            [
                "149. The Court is of the view that once there is prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant ’ s version of the events and the existence of a causal link, the burden of proof should shift to the Government. This is particularly important in the case at hand, since the reasons behind the termination of the applicant ’ s mandate lie within the knowledge of the Government and were never established or reviewed by an independent court or body, in contrast to the case of the former Vice-President of the Supreme Court. The Court notes that the explanations given at the relevant time in the bills introducing the amendments on the termination of the applicant ’ s mandate were not very detailed. The bills referred in general terms to the new Fundamental Law of Hungary, the succession of the Supreme Court and the modifications to the court system resulting from that Law, without explaining the changes that prompted the premature termination of the applicant ’ s mandate as President. This cannot be considered sufficient in the circumstances of the present case, in view of the fact that the previous bills submitted during the legislative process had not mentioned the termination of the applicant ’ s mandate (see paragraph 30 above, versions of 21 October and 17 November 2011), and that previous declarations by the Government and members of the parliamentary majority had indicated precisely the opposite, namely that the applicant ’ s mandate would not be terminated upon the entry into force of the Fundamental Law (see paragraphs 25-26 above). Furthermore, neither the applicant ’ s ability to exercise his functions as president of the supreme judicial body nor his professional conduct were called into question by the domestic authorities (see, conversely, Harabin (dec.) 2004, cited above, and the judgment in Harabin, cited above, § 151)."

                "150. As to the reasons put forward by the Government to justify the impugned measure before the Court, it is not apparent that the changes made to the functions of the supreme judicial authority or the tasks of its president were of such a fundamental nature that they could or should have prompted the premature termination of the applicant ’ s mandate. The Government pointed out that the function to which the applicant had been elected had ceased to exist, since his activities were mostly connected with the managerial functions of the President of the National Council of Justice, which – following the entry into force of the Fundamental Law – were separated from the functions of the President of the Kúria. In this respect, the Court would emphasise that the position of the President of the National Council of Justice seemed to be auxiliary to that of the President of the Supreme Court and not the other way round. Furthermore, if the applicant was deemed competent to exercise both functions at the time of his election, the fact that one of them was subsequently removed should not in principle affect his suitability to continue exercising the other function. With regard to the alleged changes in the competences of the supreme judicial body, they do not appear to be of such a fundamental nature. The main new competence attributed to the Kúria was the power to review the legality of local government regulations and to establish local governments ’ failure to comply with statutory legislative obligations. As to the role in safeguarding the consistency of the case-law, that had already existed previously (see Article 47 § 2 of the former Constitution, which mentioned uniformity resolutions), although new means to carry out this task were introduced under the new legislation, with more detailed regulations (creation of groups analysing the case-law, publication of guiding decisions from lower courts)."

They referred to the circumstances of the applicant ’ s election as President of the Supreme Court in 2009 and to the fact that his office was very much of an administrative and “governmental” nature, which justified the termination of his mandate with a view to increasing the independence of the judiciary."

The Court accepts that changing the rules for electing the president of a country ’ s highest judicial body with a view to reinforcing the independence of the person holding that position can be linked to the legitimate aim of “maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2. The Court takes the view, however, that a State Party cannot legitimately invoke the independence of the judiciary in order to justify a measure such as the premature termination of the mandate of a court president for reasons that had not been established by law and which did not relate to any grounds of professional incompetence or misconduct. The Court considers that this measure could not serve the aim of increasing the independence of the judiciary, since it was simultaneously, and for the reasons set out above (see paragraphs 151 ‑ 52), a consequence of the previous exercise of the right to freedom of expression by the applicant, who was the highest office holder in the judiciary. As stated above in the context of Article 6, it was also a measure which interfered with his right to serve his full six-year term as President of the Supreme Court, as recognised under domestic law. In these circumstances, rather than serving the aim of maintaining the independence of the judiciary, the premature termination of the applicant ’ s mandate as President of the Supreme Court appeared to be incompatible with that aim."

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",

This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ...”"

In carrying out this review, the Court will bear in mind that whenever a civil servant ’ s right to freedom of expression is in issue the “duties and responsibilities” referred to in Article 10 § 2 assume a special significance, which justifies leaving to the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate to the above aim (see Vogt, cited above, § 53, and Albayrak v.

It was not only his right but also his duty as President of the National Council of Justice to express his opinion on legislative reforms affecting the judiciary, after having gathered and summarised the opinions of lower courts (see paragraph 44 above). The applicant also used his power to challenge some of the relevant legislation before the Constitutional Court and used the possibility to express his opinion directly before Parliament on two occasions, in accordance with parliamentary rules (see paragraph 46 above).

It refers in this connection to the Council of Europe instruments, which recognise that each judge is responsible for promoting and protecting judicial independence (see paragraph 3 of the Magna Carta of Judges in paragraph 81 above) and that judges and the judiciary should be consulted and involved in the preparation of legislation concerning their statute and, more generally, the functioning of the judicial system (see paragraph 34 of Opinion no. 3 (2002) of the CCJE in paragraph 80 above; and paragraph 9 of the Magna Carta of Judges in paragraph 81 above)."

                "169. In this regard, the Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that the applicant ’ s functions as President of the Supreme Court were more administrative than judicial in nature, and that the removal from his position “should be assessed in the light of the rules governing the removal of political appointees rather than those governing the removal of judges”, in which case the authorities could legitimately take into account the applicant ’ s views on the reform of the judiciary."

The present case should also be distinguished from other cases in which the issue at stake was public confidence in the judiciary and the need to protect such confidence against destructive attacks (see Di Giovanni, § 81, and Kudeshkina, § 86, both cited above). Although the Government relied on the need to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary, the views and statements publicly expressed by the applicant did not contain attacks against other members of the judiciary (compare with Di Giovanni and Poyraz, both cited above); nor did they concern criticisms with regard to the conduct of the judiciary dealing with pending proceedings (see Kudeshkina, cited above, § 94)."

On the contrary, the applicant expressed his views and criticisms on constitutional and legislative reforms affecting the judiciary, on issues related to the functioning and reform of the judicial system, the independence and irremovability of judges, and the lowering of the retirement age for judges, all of which are questions of public interest (see, mutatis mutandis, Kudeshkina, §§ 86 and 94). His statements did not go beyond mere criticism from a strictly professional perspective. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicant ’ s position and statements, which clearly fell within the context of a debate on matters of great public interest, called for a high degree of protection for his freedom of expression and strict scrutiny of any interference, with a correspondingly narrow margin of appreciation being afforded to the authorities of the respondent State."

Furthermore, although the applicant remained in office as judge and president of a civil division of the new Kúria, he was removed from the office of President of the Supreme Court three and a half years before the end of the fixed term applicable under the legislation in force at the time of his election. This can hardly be reconciled with the particular consideration to be given to the nature of the judicial function as an independent branch of State power and to the principle of the irremovability of judges, which – according to the Court ’ s case-law and international and Council of Europe instruments – is a key element for the maintenance of judicial independence (see the principles on the irremovability of judges emerging from the Court ’ s case-law under Article 6 § 1 in Fruni v. Slovakia, no. 8014/07, § 145, 21 June 2011, and Henryk Urban and Ryszard Urban v. Poland, no. 23614/08, § 53, 30 November 2010; see the international and Council of Europe materials in paragraphs 72-79 and 81-85 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, the judgment of 8 April 2014 of the CJEU in the case of Commission v. Hungary, concerning the premature removal from office of the former data-protection supervisor, in paragraph 70 above). Against this background, it appears that the premature removal of the applicant from his position as President of the Supreme Court defeated, rather than served, the very purpose of maintaining the independence of the judiciary, contrary to what has been argued by the Government."

                "18. The Supreme Court observed that Article 479 of the Lithuanian Code of Civil Procedure, as then in force, established the principle of absolute State immunity, but that that provision had become inapplicable in practice. It noted that the prevailing international practice was to adopt a restrictive interpretation of State immunity, granting such immunity only for acts of sovereign authority ( acta jure imperii ), as opposed to acts of a commercial or private-law nature ( acta jure gestionis ). The Supreme Court further held, in particular, as follows :",
                "“... in the Supreme Court ’ s view, it is possible to apply the principle of restrictive immunity to the Republic of Poland. Having regard to the fact that Lithuania recognises that foreign nationals may bring actions in respect of private-law disputes, it must be accepted that, in order to defend their rights, individuals or entities from the Republic of Lithuania are entitled to take proceedings against foreign States.",
                "It is thus necessary to establish in the present case whether the relationship between the claimant and the Republic of Poland was one of a public-law nature ( acta jure imperii ) or a private-law nature ( acta jure gestionis ). Besides that, other criteria are applicable and should allow [the court] to determine whether the State concerned enjoys immunity ... in employment disputes. These criteria include, in particular, the nature of the workplace, the status of the employee, the territorial connection between the country of employment and the country of the court, and the nature of the claim.",
                "Regard being had to the plea of immunity by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland ... it is possible to conclude that there was a public -service relationship governed by public law ( acta jure imperii ) between the claimant and the embassy of the Republic of Poland, and that the Republic of Poland may lay claim to immunity from the jurisdiction of foreign courts. This conclusion is supported by other criteria. With regard to the nature of the workplace, it should be noted that the main function of the embassy ... is directly related to the exercise of sovereignty of the Republic of Poland. With respect to the status of [the] employee ... while the parties had entered into a contract of employment, the very fact that the employee was a switchboard operator implies that the parties developed a relationship akin to that which characterises a public- service function ... The court was unable to obtain any information allowing it to establish the scope of the claimant ’ s actual duties. Thus, merely from the title of her position, it can be concluded that the duties entrusted to her facilitated, to a certain degree, the exercise by the Republic of Poland of its sovereign functions. ... It must also be established whether the country of employment is the country of the court, since a court in the country of employment is best placed to resolve a dispute that has arisen in that country. In this respect, it is to be recognised that the exercise of the sovereign powers of the forum State is severely restricted with regard to an embassy, even though it is not a foreign territory as such ( section 11 ( 2 ) of the Status of Diplomatic Missions of Foreign States Act). As to the nature of the claim ... it should be noted that a claim for recognition of unlawful dismissal and for compensation cannot be regarded as violating the sovereignty of [another] State, since such a claim pertains solely to the economic aspect of the impugned legal relationship[;] there is no claim for reinstatement ... However, by reason of this criterion alone, it cannot be unconditionally asserted that the Republic of Poland cannot invoke State immunity in this case. ... [The claimant ] has submitted no [other] evidence to confirm the inability for the Republic of Poland to enjoy State immunity (Article 58 of the Code of Civil Procedure).",
                "Against the background of the above criteria, [in view of] the aspiration of Lithuania and Poland to maintain good bilateral relations ... and respect the principle of sovereign equality between States ..., the chamber concludes that the courts [below] properly decided that they had no jurisdiction to entertain this case.",

Those courts did not examine the question of the application of restrictive jurisdictional immunity in the light of the criteria developed by the Supreme Court. However, this breach of procedural rules does not constitute, in the Supreme Court ’ s view, a ground for quashing the decisions of the courts below. ...",

In that case it was considered that the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property, adopted on 2 December 2004, could be taken into account, even though they were not binding, since they reflected a certain trend in international law in matters of State immunity. The Supreme Court further observed that the case-law of the courts of both States – Lithuania and Sweden – being based on common practice in international relations, confirmed that they had been adhering to a restrictive approach to State immunity, whereby a State could not claim immunity from jurisdiction if the dispute was of a private-law nature. In such cases Sweden could not therefore object to the case being heard by the Lithuanian courts.

The Polish courts had jurisdiction to hear her case and would have applied Lithuanian substantive law. The applicant ’ s contract of employment actually contained a clause providing that any dispute arising under the contract was to be settled in accordance with the laws of Lithuania. Since Article 479 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the relevant case-law excluded the jurisdiction of the Lithuanian courts, following the Republic of Poland ’ s request to be granted State immunity, that clause covered the application only of the substantive provisions of Lithuanian law. Furthermore, by virtue of Lithuanian law, the applicant was not time-barred from taking proceedings in the Polish courts, which still had jurisdiction to examine her claims concerning the termination of her contract of employment."

It could therefore be argued that, if the applicant had submitted her complaints to the Polish courts, they would have applied the substantive law chosen by the parties, that is to say Lithuanian law.

They contended that States enjoyed a discretionary power of appointment to official posts. The same applied to the “dismissal” or “ termination of contract ” of civil servants after an inquiry or an investigation as part of the supervisory or disciplinary powers exercised by the employer State."

In the present case, the reason why the Polish embassy had requested the application of State immunity in the applicant ’ s case was, in the Government ’ s submission, partly to do with the origin of the dispute – allegations of sexual harassment involving a member of the embassy ’ s diplomatic staff – that the Lithuanian courts could not have properly examined without questioning persons enjoying diplomatic immunity."

The Lithuanian Supreme Court had reached a reasonable conclusion, taking into consideration, inter alia, the fact that Poland, in invoking State immunity, considered that the dispute between the applicant and the Polish embassy was not an ordinary employment dispute."

                "54. The Court reiterates that the right to a fair hearing, as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, must be construed in the light of the principle of the rule of law, which requires that all litigants should have an effective judicial remedy enabling them to assert their civil rights (see Běleš and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 47273/99, § 49, ECHR 2002 - IX ). Everyone has the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way, Article 6 § 1 embodies the “right to a court”, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect only (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 36, Series A no. 18, and Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v. Germany [GC], no. 42527/98, § 43, ECHR 2001 - VIII )."

                "55. However, the right of access to a court secured by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State. In this respect, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, although the final decision as to the observance of the Convention ’ s requirements rests with the Court. It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation of the right of access to a court will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, § 59, ECHR 1999 - I; T.P. and K.M. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28945/95, § 98, 10 May 2001; and Fogarty v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 37112/97, § 33, 21 November 2001 )."

Moreover, the Convention has to be interpreted in the light of the rules set out in the Vienna Convention of 23 May 1969 on the Law of Treaties, Article 31 § 3 (c) of which indicates that account is to be taken of “any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties”. The Convention, including Article 6, cannot be interpreted in a vacuum. The Court must therefore be mindful of the Convention ’ s special character as a human rights treaty, and it must also take the relevant rules of international law into account, including those relating to the grant of State immunity (see Fogarty, cited above, § 35 )."

It follows that measures taken by a High Contracting Party which reflect generally recognised rules of public international law on State immunity cannot in principle be regarded as imposing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to a court as embodied in Article 6 § 1. Just as the right of access to a court is an inherent part of the fair trial guarantee in that Article, so some restrictions on access must likewise be regarded as inherent, an example being those limitations generally accepted by the community of nations as part of the doctrine of State immunity (see Kalogeropoulou and Others v. Greece and Germany ( dec. ), no. 59021/00, ECHR 2002 - X, and Fogarty, cited above, § 36)."

France, 28 October 1998, § 52, Reports 1998 - VIII ). It would not be consistent with the rule of law in a democratic society or with the basic principle underlying Article 6 § 1 – namely that civil claims must be capable of being submitted to a judge for adjudication – if a State could, without restraint or control by the Convention enforcement bodies, remove from the jurisdiction of the courts a whole range of civil claims or confer immunities from civil liability on categories of persons (see Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, § 65, Series A no. 294 - B )."

In this connection, it observes that State immunity was developed in international law out of the principle par in parem non habet imperium, by virtue of which one State could not be subject to the jurisdiction of another. The Court considers that the grant of immunity to a State in civil proceedings pursues the legitimate aim of complying with international law to promote comity and good relations between States through the respect of another State ’ s sovereignty."

Following a number of subsequent and unsuccessful applications for other employment at the embassy, the applicant had then commenced fresh proceedings before the United Kingdom courts claiming sex discrimination, but those proceedings were discontinued because the United States government claimed immunity from jurisdiction. It was this second set of proceedings that gave rise to the application to the Court and ultimately to the Fogarty judgment."

The Court notes that the present case can be distinguished from that of Fogarty in that it does not concern recruitment but rather the dismissal of a member of the local staff of an embassy. In spite of that difference, the Court takes the view that its finding that the restrictions in the Fogarty case pursued a legitimate aim similarly applies to the present case. It should therefore now be examined whether the impugned restriction to the applicant ’ s right of access was proportionate to the aim pursued."

            [
                "64. In this connection, the Court notes that the application of absolute State immunity has, for many years, clearly been eroded. In 1979 the International Law Commission (ILC) was given the task of codifying and gradually developing international law in the area of jurisdictional immunities of States and their property. It produced a number of drafts that were submitted to States for comment. The Draft Articles it adopted in 1991 included one – Article 11 – on contracts of employment (see paragraph 28 above). In 2004 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property (see paragraph 30 above)."
            ],
            [
                "65. The 1991 Draft Articles, on which the 2004 United Nations Convention ( and Article 11 in particular) was based, created a significant exception in matters of State immunity by, in principle, removing from the application of the immunity rule a State ’ s employment contracts with the staff of its diplomatic missions abroad. However, that exception was itself subject to exceptions whereby, in substance, immunity still applied to diplomatic and consular staff in cases where: the subject of the dispute was the recruitment, renewal of employment or reinstatement of an individual; the employee was a national of the employer State; or, lastly, the employer State and the employee had otherwise agreed in writing."
            ],
            [
                "66. The report appended to the 1991 Draft Articles stated that the rules formulated in Article 11 appeared to be consistent with the emerging trend in the legislative and treaty practice of a growing number of States ( ILC Yearbook, 1991, Vol. II, Part 2, p. 44, paragraph 14). This must also hold true for the 2004 United Nations Convention. Furthermore, it is a well-established principle of international law that, even if a State has not ratified a treaty, it may be bound by one of its provisions in so far as that provision reflects customary international law, either “codifying” it or forming a new customary rule (see the judgment of the International Court of Justice in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, ICJ Reports 1969, p. 41, § 71). Moreover, there were no particular objections by States to the wording of Article 11 of the ILC ’ s Draft Articles, at least not by the respondent State. As to the 2004 United Nations Convention, Lithuania has admittedly not ratified it but did not vote against its adoption either."
            ],
            [
                "67. Consequently, it is possible to affirm that Article 11 of the ILC ’ s 1991 Draft Articles, on which the 2004 United Nations Convention was based, applies to the respondent State under customary international law. The Court must take this into consideration in examining whether the right of access to a court, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, was respected."
            ],
            [
                "68. The above finding is in fact confirmed by Lithuanian domestic law. Admittedly, Article 479 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as in force at the relevant time, enshrined the so-called absolute State immunity rule. However, on 21 December 2000 the plenary of the Lithuanian Supreme Court adopted a decision ( no. 28 ) regarding “ Judicial Practice in the Republic of Lithuania in Applying Rules of Private International Law”. It stated that while Article 479 of the Code of Civil Procedure established a norm whereby “foreign States [and] diplomatic and consular representatives and diplomats of foreign States enjoy [ed] immunity from the jurisdiction of Lithuanian courts ”, that rule guaranteed State immunity only for “legal relations governed by public law”. A contrario, that immunity rule did not apply to relations governed by private law. This conclusion confirmed the practice of the Supreme Court, which has abandoned the concept of absolute State immunity (see paragraph 22 above)."

The Court further notes that the applicant was not covered by any of the exceptions enumerated in Article 11 of the ILC ’ s Draft Articles: she did not perform any particular functions closely related to the exercise of governmental authority. In addition, she was not a diplomatic agent or consular officer, nor was she a national of the employer State. Lastly, the subject matter of the dispute was linked to the applicant ’ s dismissal."

The Court observes in particular that the applicant was a switchboard operator at the Polish embassy whose main duties were: recording international telephone conversations, typing, sending and receiving faxes, photocopying documents, providing information and assisting with the organisation of certain events. Neither the Lithuanian Supreme Court nor the respondent Government have shown how these duties could objectively have been related to the sovereign interests of the Polish government. While the schedule to the employment contract stated that the applicant could have been called upon to do other work at the request of the head of mission, it does not appear from the case file – nor have the Government provided any details in this connection – that she actually performed any functions related to the exercise of sovereignty by the Polish State."

In its judgment of 25 June 2001, the Supreme Court stated that, in order to determine whether or not it had jurisdiction to hear employment disputes involving a foreign mission or embassy, it was necessary to establish in each case whether the employment relationship in question was one of a public-law nature ( acta jure imperii ) or of a private-law nature ( acta jure gestionis ). In the present case, however, the Supreme Court found that it had been unable to obtain any information allowing it to establish the scope of the applicant ’ s “ actual duties ”. It therefore referred solely to the title of her position, and to the fact that Poland had invoked immunity from jurisdiction, in concluding that the duties entrusted to her had “ facilitated, to a certain degree, the exercise by the Republic of Poland of its sovereign functions ” (see paragraph 18 above)."

As to whether the duties in question were of importance for Poland ’ s security interests – a criterion subsequently enshrined in Article 11 § 2 (d) of the 2004 United Nations Convention – the mere allegation that the applicant could have had access to certain documents or could have been privy to confidential telephone conversations in the course of her duties is not sufficient. On this point it should not be overlooked that the applicant ’ s dismissal and the ensuing proceedings arose originally from acts of sexual harassment that had been established by the Lithuanian Equal Opportunities Ombudsman, with whom the applicant had filed her complaint. Such acts can hardly be regarded as undermining Poland ’ s security interests."

The Court reiterates that where an individual raises an arguable claim that he has been ill-treated by the State authorities in breach of Article 3, that provision, read in conjunction with the State’s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. For the investigation to be regarded as “effective”, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev v. Russia, no. 77617/01, § 107 et seq., 26 January 2006, and Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, §§ 102 et seq.)."

It follows that the head of the police department had been informed of the incident on the same day and, given the substantive involvement of the three police officers of the department in that incident, should have realised that the enquiries by the officers of the same department would lack the requisite objectivity and impartiality. Nevertheless, between 22 August and 2 September 1998 “pre-investigation” enquiries were conducted by the Horodenka District Police Department. In the Court’s opinion these enquiries fell foul of the requirement of impartiality and objectivity (see, mutatis mutandis, Yaremenko v. Ukraine, no. 32092/02, § 69, 12 June 2008 and Kopylov v. Russia, no. 3933/04, § 138, 29 July 2010).

Next, the Court considers that the lack of impartiality of the investigation at its initial stage was not removed in the latter stages of the investigation because starting from 14 May 1999 the case was investigated by the Horodenka District Police Department. The formal justification for the transfer of the case was the decision of 30 April 1999 by which the investigator at the Snyatyn District Prosecutor’s Office refused to open criminal proceedings in respect of the three police officers (see paragraph 47). The Court would not exclude that that decision was artificial and was made to enable the police department which employed the officers involved, to take care of the further investigation. Moreover, that decision must have frustrated the applicant’s understanding of the overall picture of the proceedings in his case, especially in circumstances when the applicant had not been notified of the decisions in timely fashion and did not receive copies of them for a long time (see paragraphs 50 and 74).",

However, the Court has held in other contexts that this investigative procedure does not comply with the principles of an effective remedy, because the enquiring officer can take only a limited number of procedural steps within that procedure while a victim’s procedural status is not properly formalised (see Davydov and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 17674/02 and 39081/02, §§ 310-312, 1 July 2010). The full-scale investigation was commenced only on 30 December 1998 (see paragraph 37), that is with four months delay.

The Court further considers that the investigators dealing with the case after it had been referred to them from the Horodenka District Police Department did not sufficiently scrutinise the explanations by the key witnesses – the sales assistant and the security guard: the two witnesses were initially interviewed by Kh., one of the police officers, who was at the scene of the incident. The authorities did not look into the matter of whether the two key witnesses might have been improperly inclined to support the police version under various pretexts, including threats that they would become suspects themselves as it had been unclear why the applicant had been so severely injured. Indeed, as admitted by the sales assistant, the police officer Kh. went to see him during the night of the incident and demanded explanations, after stating that the man about whom the sales assistant had complained had been severely beaten up (see paragraph 41). However, that officer never stated in other contexts that the applicant had been beaten up."

Similarly, the objectivity of the initial statements by the doctors had to be assessed together with the doctors’ unexplained failure to test the level of the applicant’s alcoholic intoxication and the fact that Kh. (one of the three police officers identified by the applicant), whose parents were working at the same hospital (see paragraph 40), specified the doctors who had to examine the applicant. It is remarkable that when questioned by officers of the Horodenka District Police Department the doctors submitted that the applicant could not explain what had happened to him (see paragraph 25). Subsequently, Doctor B. admitted to the other authority however that the applicant had stated that he had been beaten up by police officers (see paragraph 30)."

The Court also considers that in accepting the version of the applicant’s accidental fall the authorities were expected to show particular diligence in exploring the terrain and establishing the exact placement of the applicant’s body. Nevertheless, the authorities did not establish with sufficient precision where exactly the applicant was found by the police officers and what was the distance from that place to the fences available in the park. Moreover, the height of the fences measured by the officer of the Horodenka District Police Department was significantly different from the height measured by the investigator at the Snyatyn District Prosecutor’s Office (see paragraphs 24 and 37). The discrepancy in the measurements was not subsequently resolved."

Accordingly, if the applicant did not remain still, he, at the very least, would not have been able to move far from the place where he had fallen within the short time-frame given. Meanwhile, it appears from the report of 18 January 1999 on the reconstruction of events and the photographs enclosed with it that the distances from the fences to the place where the applicant had been found was too far to assume that he might have fallen from any of the fences and landed on the spot indicated by the security guard. At the same time, the absence of the precise information on the height of the fences, from which the applicant might have fallen, suggests that the on-site investigations of the theory of an accident were superficial (see paragraph 39)."

No further medical confirmation in this respect had been obtained by the investigating authorities. Moreover, the investigators and the experts never examined the origin of the concussion from which the applicant was also suffering (see paragraphs 17, 31 and 43)."

The Court further notes that during the final forensic medical examination the investigator decided to check a certain very particular statement made by the applicant, namely that he had received a hard blow on the back when he was getting up and his spine was bent (see paragraph 45). This rigorous concentration on a particular detail in the applicant’s submissions appears surprising, given that the applicant had always referred to numerous blows he received to the whole of his body and the detail, dragged out by the investigator, had been specified by the applicant after the lapse of a considerable period of time from the incident (see paragraph 38). This step by the investigator is even more disconcerting, given that he failed to take into account that the applicant had sustained concussion during the incident, which might have caused him difficulty in remembering such details."

Meanwhile, his requests for free legal representation to support his allegations of ill-treatment turned out to be futile."

Mostly, the issue has been examined under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention, the provision which expressly requires free legal representation in criminal proceedings against the person concerned. The Court has also held that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention may in certain circumstances compel the State to provide for the assistance of a lawyer when such assistance proves indispensable for effective access to court (see Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 26, Series A no. 32, and Bertuzzi v. France, no. 36378/97, §§ 23-32, ECHR 2003 ‑ III) or ensuring the principle of equality of arms (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, §§ 63-72, ECHR 2005 ‑ II).

Lastly, the absence of free legal representation has been regarded as indication to the ineffectiveness of domestic remedies for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, §154, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V, and Abdolkhani and Karimnia v.

Moreover, after the applicant’s enquiries made to the legal advice offices at the departments of Justice, he was given the reply that representation of citizens by such offices had not been foreseen (see paragraph 75 above). The Government’s reference to the Free Legal Assistance Act is not relevant, as that Act was enacted only on 2 June 2011, and its provisions concerning legal advice on procedural issues and legal representation had not yet been implemented (see paragraphs 83 and 84).

A copy of that decision was received by the applicant only on 12 May 2011, which means that before that date he did not know the precise reasons for it and thus was not in a position to appeal effectively against it (see Akulinin and Babich v. Russia, no. 5742/02, § 29, 2 October 2008). Moreover, the absence of legal advice resulted in the remedy suggested by the Government being unavailable to the applicant.

The requested documents were important for the applicant as, among other issues, they had to shed light on the incident following which the applicant became severely handicapped for the rest of his life. These documents also affected the moral integrity and personal reputation of the applicant, as they suggested that the applicant had been very drunk on the night of the incident, and that this had resulted in his serious injuries. The Court considers that the applicant’s access to this kind of information was sufficiently closely linked to his private life in the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention (compare Gaskin v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, §§ 35-37, Series A no. 160; McGinley and Egan v. the United Kingdom, 9 June 1998, §97, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ III; Odièvre v.

In this connection, it is to be recalled that there has been a shift in Court’s case-law towards applying the civil limb of Article 6 to cases which might not initially appear to concern a civil right but which may have direct and significant repercussions on a private right belonging to an individual (see De Tommaso v.

While it is true that the applicant institute did not have a right to be awarded the sum of money offered by the Government and that, in applying the Rules on Quality Assessment and Funding of the Public Research Organisation Programme (see paragraph 6 above) in order to determine which was the best scientific research programme, the domestic authorities enjoyed a certain discretionary power, it is not disputed by the parties that the participants in the tender had the right to a lawful procedure for examination of their tenders. The Court further recalls that it has recently stated the principles pertaining to the application of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in its judgment in the case of Regner v. the Czech Republic ([GC], no. 35289/11, ECHR 2017 (extracts)). It distinguished four different situations where Article 6 § 1 is applicable, one of them regarding certain decisions where the authorities have a purely discretionary power to grant or refuse an advantage or privilege, with the law conferring on the person concerned the right to apply to the courts, which, where they find that the decision was unlawful, may set it aside. In such a case Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is applicable, on condition that the advantage or privilege, once granted, gives rise to a civil right (ibid., § 105)."

It is true that in some decisions, adopted before the Regner judgment, the Court had excluded the applicability of Article 6 to procedures concerning a call for tenders by the domestic authorities, pointing out that the latter enjoyed a discretionary power and that the substantive law of the State concerned did not confer to the applicants a right to be awarded the tender (see, in particular, Marti AG and Others v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 36308/97, ECHR 2000 VIII; SKYRADIO AG and Others v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 46841/99, 31 August 2004; I.T.C. LTD v. Malta (dec.), no. 2629/06, 11 December 2007; and S.C. Black Sea Caviar S.R.L. v. Romania (dec.) [Committee], no. 13013/06, 31 May 2016). However, the Court considers the principles stated in Regner to be relevant for the present case, where the applicant institute clearly enjoyed a procedural right to the lawful and correct adjudication of the tenders. Should the tender be awarded to the applicant institute, the latter would have been conferred a civil right. In this connection, it is to be recalled that there has been a shift in Court’s case-law towards applying the civil limb of Article 6 to cases which might not initially appear to concern a civil right but which may have direct and significant repercussions on a private right belonging to an individual (see De Tommaso v.

The applicant institute had been unable to prove its claims because, instead of taking the requested evidence, the Administrative Court had relied on the administrative decisions of the opposing party and had accepted them as facts.

Although the Government agreed that the facts had been disputed between the parties, they contended that the applicant institute had failed to substantiate the relevance of the adduced evidence. As to the court’s failure to hear the witness K. (see paragraph 11 above), the Administrative Court had had his letter of 2 December 2003 at its disposal and had been able to take it into account.

The Court reiterates that, in proceedings before a court of first and only instance, the right to a “public hearing” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 entails an entitlement to an “oral hearing” unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with such a hearing (see Göç v. Turkey [GC], no. 36590/97, § 47, ECHR 2002-V, with further references). In proceedings before two instances, at least one instance must, in general, provide such a hearing if no such exceptional circumstances are at hand (see Salomonsson v. Sweden, no. 38978/97, § 36, 12 November 2002). This public character protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts can be maintained. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, an oral hearing in public contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 § 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Mehmet Emin Şimşek v. Turkey, no. 5488/05, § 28, 28 February 2012, and Szücs v. Austria, 24 November 1997, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII)."

There may be proceedings in which an oral hearing may not be required: for example, where there are no issues of credibility or contested facts which necessitate a hearing and the courts may fairly and reasonably decide the case on the basis of the parties’ submissions and other written materials (see Jussila, cited above, § 41, with reference to Döry v.

It delivered a decision on a new legal question, namely the legal and procedural question of whether the appeal application was null and void, viz, whether the method of appeal used by the applicant company was one envisaged and allowed according to the COCP. It therefore did not decide on the merits of its previous decision. Moreover, it found that it had not been sufficiently proved that there was a real risk that the relevant judges had been biased. Indeed, the applicant company had not contested the impartiality of the Court of Appeal at the beginning of the proceedings, namely on the basis that the appeal in respect of the decision of 25 February 2005 had also been decided by the same formation of the Court of Appeal.

As to the dismissal of the request for reconsideration, after postponing the case to later on that same day, the court concluded that the judgment of 3 November 2005, rejecting the request for a stay of execution, constituted a final judgment (as opposed to “a decree”) and therefore Article 229 of the COCP, invoked by the applicant company, did not apply.

Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, § 40, ECHR 2007 ‑ II; and K.T. v. Norway, no. 26664/03, § 82, 25 September 2008). The dispute was genuine and serious; it related not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise (ibid.). The Court further observes that the City Court rejected the applicant ’ s claim on the ground that the company had derived his rights from the applicant ’ s former wife and that the City Court had previously ruled in her favour in its 2001 judgment. The City Court ’ s 2008 judgment must be considered to have determined the dispute since, following the High Court ’ s refusal to admit the appeal, the result of these proceedings seen as a whole was directly decisive for the right in question (ibid.). Article 6 § 1 was accordingly applicable to those proceedings. In reaching this conclusion, the Court is aware that, as noted in Valchev and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.) nos. 47450/11, 26659/12 and 53966/12, 21 January 2014), there have been cases in which such proceedings were found not to involve a “determination” of the applicant ’ s “civil rights” and the provision was therefore considered inapplicable (ibid., § 72). However, the prevailing approach seems to be that Article 6 § 1 is applicable also to leave-to-appeal proceedings (ibid., §§ 69 ‑ 71; Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 54, Series A no. 115; and Martinie v. France [GC], no. 58675/00, §§ 11 and 53-55, ECHR 2006-VI), and that the manner of its application depends on the special features of the proceedings involved, account being taken of the entirety of the proceedings conducted in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate or cassation court therein ( Monnell and Morris, cited above, § 56)."

In the case that had previously been decided by the City Court on 4 April 2001, the subject-matter of the dispute had been whether the marital agreements from 1990 and 1995 were valid. The subject-matter in the present case was different. Two spouses having completely separate property had the opportunity to conclude a mutual agreement involving an obligation of performance for each party. According to legal doctrine, such a contract was not dependent on any condition as to form.",
                "(b) The contract had been a reality in the present case. Ekheim Invest had purchased the half of the Ekheim estate that had been in Mrs B. ’ s ownership, not the half owned by the applicant, because Mrs B. had had no right to sell the other half. Consequently, Ekheim Invest ought to transfer by deed of conveyance half of the Ekheim estate back to the applicant.",
                "(c) The applicant further submitted that in its 2001 judgment the City Court had not reviewed the validity of the joint ownership agreement. In any event, the legal force of that judgment extended only to the relationship between Mrs B. and the applicant, not between Ekheim Invest and the applicant. The applicant referred to legal doctrine, according to which a judgment as a main rule only had legal force in the relationship between the parties to the proceedings. Moreover, the parties ’ arguments ought to be taken as a starting point in the assessment of whether any new factual circumstances had arisen.",
                "(d) The applicant ’ s argument was that in the period since 2001 the estate had increased so greatly in value that the City Court now had to assess the ownership issue independently of the conclusion reached in the 2001 judgment. At that time the mortgages on the property had clearly exceeded its value and it had therefore been unproblematic to hold that, in light of an on - going bankruptcy at the time, the applicant would not have been in a better position in the absence of the marriage settlement agreements.

In the present case, the judgment of the [High] Court ... does not provide any substantive reason at all as to why the court determined that it was clear that the appeal would not succeed, which puts into question the existence of a substantial review of the author ’ s conviction and sentence. The Committee considers that, in the circumstances of the case, the lack of a duly reasoned judgment, even if in brief form, providing a justification for the court ’ s decision that the appeal would be unsuccessful, impairs the effective exercise of the right to have one ’ s conviction reviewed as required by article 14, paragraph 5, of the Covenant.”",

Firstly, it stressed that reasons must be provided in order to ensure the efficiency of the High Court ’ s review. Omitting to provide reasons “impair[ed] the effective exercise of the right to have one ’ s conviction reviewed”. The requirement of reasons was a necessary safeguard for ensuring a substantial review. By requiring the court to explain why the appeal would not succeed, one could ensure that the decision was reached on the basis of a thorough and sound assessment."

The Supreme Court held that this was relevant for the appellant – the reason for the refusal should enable the appellant to verify that the issues raised in the appeal had been properly assessed. In addition, it was relevant for the superior review body, where such existed. Where the law provided that the decision of the appellate instance could be appealed against to a superior body, the decision of the appellate body ought to be reasoned in such a manner as to enable review of the decision."

Usually, such reasoning could be done summarily, in a brief and succinct form, and be linked to the submissions in the appeal. The reasoning should show that the alleged errors in the first-instance court ’ s decision had been understood and why the appeal clearly would not succeed. This meant that it would be insufficient, as had been done previously, to state the grounds for appeal and paraphrase the statutory requirement for refusing admission of an appeal. In this connection the reasoning should be formulated with a view to enabling the Supreme Court to review the High Court procedure, including whether a substantial review had been carried out as required by Article 14 (5) of the Covenant. The extent of the reasoning required would vary considerably, depending on the nature of the particular case, ranging from a couple of sentences to more extensive reasoning of a legal or factual character."

Whilst a system giving the High Court the final say on questions of law would be at odds with this provision, one that limited the right to appeal against the assessment of evidence would not. However, a filtering system for appeals would not as such be incompatible with Article 88.

The Supreme Court ’ s competence to review the High Court procedure encompassed questions of whether a breach had occurred of expressly stated rules of procedure. The Supreme Court was empowered to fully examine the application of the law and the assessment of the evidence in relation to questions of procedure and, if necessary, determine whether an error of procedure had materialised (see NOU 2001:32 p. 777, Rt. 2008 p. 1317; Rt. 2009 p. 222 and Rt. 2009 p. 411 ).

The Supreme Court could in addition review whether the state of the evidence before the High Court suggested that the subject matter could be adequately dealt with on the basis of the written case-file in a simplified procedure. The majority further emphasised that, in assessing whether in view of the points of law raised in the case was justifiable for the High Court to refuse admission of the appeal, regard could be had to whether the case raised issues of constitutional law or questions regarding Norway ’ s international legal obligations or whether the High Court should have admitted the appeal in the interest of legal unity, clarification or development of the law, with a possibility for lodging an ordinary appeal to the Supreme Court.

The dispute was genuine and serious; it related not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise (ibid.). The Court further observes that the City Court rejected the applicant ’ s claim on the ground that the company had derived his rights from the applicant ’ s former wife and that the City Court had previously ruled in her favour in its 2001 judgment. The City Court ’ s 2008 judgment must be considered to have determined the dispute since, following the High Court ’ s refusal to admit the appeal, the result of these proceedings seen as a whole was directly decisive for the right in question (ibid.). Article 6 § 1 was accordingly applicable to those proceedings. In reaching this conclusion, the Court is aware that, as noted in Valchev and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.) nos. 47450/11, 26659/12 and 53966/12, 21 January 2014), there have been cases in which such proceedings were found not to involve a “determination” of the applicant ’ s “civil rights” and the provision was therefore considered inapplicable (ibid., § 72). However, the prevailing approach seems to be that Article 6 § 1 is applicable also to leave-to-appeal proceedings (ibid., §§ 69 ‑ 71; Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 54, Series A no. 115; and Martinie v. France [GC], no. 58675/00, §§ 11 and 53-55, ECHR 2006-VI), and that the manner of its application depends on the special features of the proceedings involved, account being taken of the entirety of the proceedings conducted in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate or cassation court therein ( Monnell and Morris, cited above, § 56)."

                "(i) The case-law in question was very specific and had been limited to dealing with decisions taken by national supreme- or constitutional courts or similar tribunals of last and final jurisdiction, with inherent features suggesting a more lenient duty to state reasons (see for instance, X v. Germany, (dec.) no. 8769/79, 16 July 1981; Müller -Eberstein v. Germany (dec.), no. 29753/96, 27 November 1996; Immeubles Groupe Kosser v. France (dec.), no. 38748/97, 9 March 1999; Bufferne v.

                "(ii) That case-law had generally concerned situations where the merits of the case had been thoroughly assessed in two lower instances and where a reduced requirement for stating reasons in the last and final instance refusing the appeal had been justified. However, the merits of the present case had not been thoroughly assessed even once. Although the City Court had accepted to hear the case on the merits ( thus accepting that the 2001 proceedings were not legally binding on the 2008 proceedings ), it had considerably restricted the scope of the hearing by not allowing the applicant to examine any witnesses or present any other evidence, thereby generally preventing him from putting forth his arguments. Despite his having pointed to these errors in his appeal (see paragraph 11 above), the High Court had failed to hear oral argument and to take any steps to rectify them. All it did before rejecting the appeal was to obtain one set of written pleadings from the applicant (who was not represented by counsel at the domestic level ). Thus, a strict requirement ought clearly to apply to the High Court ’ s reasoning.",
                "(iii) Whereas the above case-law commonly related to provisions offering a court of last and final jurisdiction the possibility of granting leave to appeal, the present case concerned a situation where the legislator had opted for a provision offering the applicant a right to appeal to the High Court (Article 29-13 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure). This was presumably on the ground that the former type of appeal scheme (which was the rule of appeal to the Supreme Court, see Article 30 ‑ 4 (1) of the Code ) would offer insufficient legal protection where the case had only been reviewed once, at first instance.",
                "(iv) While the said case-law had generally concerned appeals limited to questions of law, as was common for appeals to a court of last and final jurisdiction, an appeal to the High Court, as was the situation here, could concern questions of fact, law and procedure (Article 29-3 (1) of the Code). Since the High Court failed to state any reasons for its decision it was impossible to understand why it had found it “clear that the appeal will not succeed” (Article 29-13 (2) of the Code).",
                "(v) The aforementioned case-law commonly concerned situations where the decision in question could not itself form the subject of a further appeal and the need for reasoning was accordingly more limited. In contrast, in the case at hand, the High Court ’ s decision was one that could be appealed to the Supreme Court under Article 30-1(1) of the Code but, because it stated no reasons, it would be impossible for the appellate court to review it. Since Norwegian law provided that a High Court decision could be appealed, the decision ought to be reasoned in such a manner as to enable the Appeals Leave Committee of the Supreme Court to carry out a review of the High Court procedure. In this context, the applicant prayed in aid the Hadjianastassiou v. Greece judgment (16 December 1992, § 33, Series A no. 252)."

Even though they represented two different systems of appeal they both served the same filtering purpose and might produce the same results depending on the circumstances.

Regard must also be had the procedural safeguards that applied when a first instance judgment was appealed. In particular, before delivering its decision the High Court had warned the applicant that it envisaged refusing to admit his appeal and had in accordance with Article 20-13(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure given him an opportunity to comment, of which he availed himself. Thus the procedure conducted by the High Court before taking its decision fully complied with the right to an adversarial process guaranteed by the right to a “fair hearing” in Article 6 § 1 ( see Vermeulen v.

Thus, in dismissing an appeal, an appellate court may, in principle, simply endorse the reasons for the lower court ’ s decision (see, mutatis mutandis, the Helle v.

It was recognised that in order to avoid that the parties and the judiciary incur considerable additional costs there was a need to stop clearly unmeritorious appeals to the High Court.

This requirement implied a high degree of certainty that the outcome would remain unaltered after an ordinary appeal hearing. It was not a condition for refusing admission of an appeal that the High Court agreed with the City Court ’ s reasoning or was of the view that its reasoning would stand after the High Court ’ s review of the case. It was sufficient that the High Court found it clear that the outcome would be maintained, possibly on the basis of a different reasoning than that given by the City Court.

While referring to the above-cited Kudla judgment, he invoked this provision in asking the Court to hold that he was “entitled to appropriate remedies”, but without elaborating specifically on the grounds for his request. His claim can be understood to imply an invitation to the Court to indicate to the respondent State what measures, beyond the payment of compensation under Article 41 of the Convention, should be adopted by it to implement the present judgment under Article 46. However, bearing in mind its case-law in this area (see, as a recent authority, Del Rio Prada v. Spain ([GC], no. 42750/09, §§ 137-138 ECHR 2013, with further references), the Court does not find in the concrete circumstances of the present case that the violation found by it is of such a character as to warrant indicating to the respondent State any individual or general measures for its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation and to redress the effects thereof."

Thus, a high number of participants will very probably have an impact on the amount of just satisfaction to be awarded in respect of non-pecuniary damage. Such an approach is based on the fact that the number of individuals participating in common proceedings before the domestic courts is not neutral from the perspective of the non-pecuniary damage that may be sustained by each of them as a result of the length of those proceedings when compared with the non-pecuniary damage that would be sustained by an individual who had brought identical proceedings on an individual basis.

Equally, the grouping together of applications usually enables a court to join related cases and may thus facilitate the proper administration of justice; it may also enable proceedings to be conducted more speedily. Thus, such proceedings offer advantages that need to be taken into consideration ( see, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v. Italy ( No. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 268, ECHR 2006-.. .)."

With regard to those that would entail a reduction in the amount to be awarded, the Court notes, firstly, that the fifty-eight applicants had acted together in bringing the proceedings in issue before the administrative courts in order to challenge the lawfulness of an administrative decision. Thus, they did not lodge separate requests before the competent courts, but were all pursuing the same objective, namely that of obtaining an examination by the Supreme Administrative Court of the lawfulness of the decision which was challenged on each occasion. In addition, in proceedings before the administrative courts to have a decision set aside, the number of claimants has no impact whatsoever on the outcome of the proceedings, which concern exclusively the lawfulness of the contested administrative decision. The Court therefore considers that, in comparison with civil proceedings in which claimants lodge individual claims for compensation simultaneously, the shared objective of the impugned proceedings was such as to alleviate the inconvenience and uncertainty experienced on account of their delay."

Admittedly, the financial stakes for the applicants in the impugned proceedings were merely implicit, rather than direct. The sole purpose of those proceedings was to challenge the legality of the disputed administrative decisions. Nevertheless, according to the applicants'own evaluation, the value of their property which remained blocked amounted to about EUR 24, 000, 000. The Court therefore considers that what was at stake in the impugned proceedings, the outcome of which would directly determine the possibility for the applicants to pursue their own property interests, was such as to exacerbate the prejudice sustained by them on account of the protracted nature of the proceedings."

Having regard to the foregoing, the Court considers that the extension of the impugned proceedings beyond a “reasonable time” undoubtedly caused the applicants non-pecuniary damage which would justify an award. It also takes into consideration the number of applicants, the nature of the violation found and the need to determine the amount in such a way that the overall sum is compatible with the relevant case-law and is reasonable in the light of what was at stake in the proceedings in question. On the basis of the above considerations, and ruling on an equitable basis, the Court awards under this head EUR 4, 000 to each of the applicants listed under nos. 1-9, 12-19, 23, 26-31, 33-40, 42-44, 46-49 and 58, and EUR 2, 500 to each of the applicants listed under nos. 10-11, 20-22, 24-25, 32, 41, 45 and 50-57, plus any tax that may be chargeable."

With regard to public servants employed in the civil service, according to the criteria established in Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, the respondent State cannot rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant to exclude the protection embodied in Article 6 unless two conditions are fulfilled. First, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists a special bond of trust and loyalty between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent State to demonstrate, first, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (ibid., § 62, and Baka, cited above, § 103 )."

It explained that there was a statutory prohibition on indicating where exactly the security risk lay and on specifying the considerations underlying the conclusion that such a risk existed, the reasons and considerations underlying the Authority ’ s decision being based exclusively on classified information. Accordingly, the reasons for the decision had to be limited to a reference to the documents on which it was based and the level of confidentiality of the information used. It went on to observe that, owing to the special nature of proceedings where classified information was concerned, not all the applicant ’ s procedural rights could be guaranteed but that the non-disclosure of the exact reasons underlying the decision to revoke security clearance was counterbalanced by the guarantee that the administrative courts had unlimited access to the classified documents. The Supreme Administrative Court pointed out that the report on the result of the investigations carried out by the intelligence service, included in the file under no. 77, contained specific, comprehensive and detailed information concerning the conduct and lifestyle of the applicant on the basis of which the court was satisfied in the present case as to its relevance for determining whether the applicant posed a national security risk.

The request for the ruling concerned the interpretation of Article 30(2) of the amending Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004, on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, read in particular in the light of Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The context was a dispute between a person with dual French and Algerian nationality and the United Kingdom immigration authorities regarding the latter ’ s decision refusing him admission, on public security grounds, to the United Kingdom. The CJEU replied, in substance, that where, in exceptional cases, a national authority refused, on grounds of State security, to provide precise and full disclosure to the person concerned of the grounds which constituted the basis of a decision refusing entry, it was necessary for a court to be entrusted with verifying whether those reasons stood in the way of precise and full disclosure of the grounds on which the decision in question was based and of the related evidence. With regard to proof that State security would in fact be compromised by disclosure to the person concerned of those grounds, it observed that there was no presumption that the reasons invoked by a national authority existed and were valid (§ 61 of the judgment). It observed, further, that if the court in question concluded that State security did not preclude disclosure to the person concerned of the precise and full grounds on which a decision refusing entry was based, it gave the competent national authority the opportunity to disclose the missing grounds and evidence to the person concerned. If that authority did not authorise their disclosure, the court proceeded to examine the legality of such a decision on the basis of solely the grounds and evidence which had been disclosed (§ 63) and if it turned out that State security did stand in the way of disclosure of the grounds to the person concerned, judicial review of the legality of a decision taken must be carried out in a procedure which struck an appropriate balance between the requirements flowing from State security and the requirements of the right to effective judicial protection whilst limiting any interference with the exercise of that right to that which was strictly necessary. It held in particular :",
                "“65. In this connection, first, in the light of the need to comply with Article 47 of the Charter, that procedure must ensure, to the greatest possible extent, that the adversarial principle is complied with, in order to enable the person concerned to contest the grounds on which the decision in question is based and to make submissions on the evidence relating to the decision and, therefore, to put forward an effective defence. In particular, the person concerned must be informed, in any event, of the essence of the grounds on which a decision refusing entry ... is based, as the necessary protection of State security cannot have the effect of denying the person concerned his right to be heard and, therefore, of rendering his right of redress ineffective ....",
                "66. Second, the weighing up of the right to effective judicial protection against the necessity to protect the security of the Member State concerned – upon which the conclusion set out in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment is founded – is not applicable in the same way to the evidence underlying the grounds that is adduced before the national court with jurisdiction. In certain cases, disclosure of that evidence is liable to compromise State security in a direct and specific manner, in that it may, in particular, endanger the life, health or freedom of persons or reveal the methods of investigation specifically used by the national security authorities and thus seriously impede, or even prevent, future performance of the tasks of those authorities.",

In that context, the national court with jurisdiction has the task of assessing whether and to what extent the restrictions on the rights of the defence arising in particular from a failure to disclose the evidence and the precise and full grounds on which the decision ... is based are such as to affect the evidential value of the confidential evidence.",

Accordingly, it is incumbent upon the national court with jurisdiction, first, to ensure that the person concerned is informed of the essence of the grounds which constitute the basis of the decision in question in a manner which takes due account of the necessary confidentiality of the evidence and, second, to draw, pursuant to national law, the appropriate conclusions from any failure to comply with that obligation to inform him.”"

According to the Chamber, the decision-making procedure had “as far as possible” complied with the requirements of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms and incorporated adequate safeguards to protect the applicant ’ s interests, with the result that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see paragraphs 72, 75-76 and 79 of the judgment).",

Likewise, at the relevant time it had not been possible to infer the existence of a subjective right to the undisturbed performance of public office where a person had already been appointed to the post in question because, by law, a public servant could be removed from office at will by the person empowered to appoint him or her, which did not mean, however, that the employment relationship with the employer was thus terminated, as only the job position changed."

Article 6 § 1 does not guarantee any particular content for “rights and obligations” in the substantive law of the Contracting States: the Court may not create by way of interpretation of Article 6 § 1 a substantive right which has no legal basis in the State concerned (see, for example, Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, § 65, Series A no. 294 ‑ B; Roche, cited above, § 119; and Boulois, cited above, § 91)."

There can be no doubt about the fact that there is a right within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 where a substantive right recognised in domestic law is accompanied by a procedural right to have that right enforced through the courts. The mere fact that the wording of a legal provision affords an element of discretion does not in itself rule out the existence of a right (see Camps v. France (dec.), no. 42401/98, 24 October 2000, and Ellès and Others v. Switzerland, no. 12573/06, § 16, 16 December 2010; and, conversely, Boulois, cited above, § 99, and Miessen v.

Indeed, Article 6 applies where the judicial proceedings concern a discretionary decision resulting in interference in an applicant ’ s rights (see Pudas v.

The same situation arises where a person ’ s rights under the domestic legislation are limited to a mere hope of being granted a right, with the actual grant of that right depending on an entirely discretionary and unreasoned decision of the authorities (see Masson and Van Zon, cited above, §§ 49-51; Roche, cited above, §§ 122-25; and Ankarcrona v.

Immunity is to be seen here not as qualifying a substantive right but as a procedural bar on the national courts ’ power to determine the right (see Al-Adsani v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97, § 48, ECHR 2001 ‑ XI, and Cudak v.

With regard to public servants employed in the civil service, according to the criteria established in Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, the respondent State cannot rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant to exclude the protection embodied in Article 6 unless two conditions are fulfilled. First, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists a special bond of trust and loyalty between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent State to demonstrate, first, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (ibid., § 62, and Baka, cited above, § 103 )."

In his submission, the only means of verifying that information was to assess the facts referred to in it, and a court was unable to do this if a party targeted in the report was absent. Domestic case-law authority according to which a judicial review must also, in order to comply with the provisions of section 133 of Law no. 412/2005, be carried out beyond the grounds relied on by one of the parties to the proceedings, did not alter anything in this respect as the courts could not verify the truth and accuracy of the contents of the evidence.

He conceded that in some circumstances State security interests defined by law took precedence over the interests of a person seeking protection from the courts in proper adversarial proceedings. He observed that in the present case, however, his right to a fair trial or to a position of equality before the law should not have been restricted because the statutory conditions under Czech law for such a procedure to be followed had not been met. The author of document no. 77, which the applicant had not been allowed to consult, had classified the report and the information contained in it in the lowest category of secrecy, namely, “restricted”. In the light of section 3(5)(e) of Law no. 412/2005, the author of the report had considered that information thus classified compromised certain intelligence operations in progress. However, under section 133(3) of that Law, in order for the courts to be able to exclude part of a document from examination by a party, there had to be a risk of interference in the activities of the intelligence services and that interference had to pose a major risk, as evidenced by the terms “endanger or seriously compromise”, which, by virtue of the law, required it to be classified at least in the “secret” category. According to the applicant, the legislature had sought to limit the application of the special procedure strictly to situations in which facts were referred to that had to be kept secret. In his view, the statutory conditions for limiting his procedural rights indicated in section 133(3) of Law no. 412/2005 had not been met because the information appearing in the report could not be such as to justify recourse to the special procedure."

He concluded that the only basis for the courts ’ decisions had therefore been the report in which the contents of the file had been summarised. According to him, the courts and their decisions could not be deemed to be independent and impartial where they were not in a position to verify the authenticity and accuracy of evidence produced by the parties. Even if the courts reviewed the facts of the case exercising their “full jurisdiction”, that did not in itself guarantee a fair hearing because even the most unbiased judge could be manipulated in a situation where he could not objectively assess the relevant evidence. Consequently, in his view, the balance between his right to a fair trial and the State ’ s interest in keeping certain information confidential had not been maintained, contrary to section 133(3) of Law no. 412/2005, in so far as the report that had served as the basis of the unfavourable decision had been classified in the lowest category of confidentiality."

A different approach had been adopted for certain very specific proceedings whose salient feature was a close link to the vital interests of national security. That approach applied to judicial review proceedings in such fields as cross-border trade with military equipment, entrance to aerodrome premises subject to increased protection and to proceedings issuing and revoking security clearance. For those proceedings the principles concerning a party ’ s access to confidential documents applied mutatis mutandis. Only exceptionally, as a last resort, where intelligence services ’ or the police ’ s activities could otherwise be jeopardised or seriously disrupted, did the law permit the application of more restrictive rules providing that, in extreme cases, a party could be completely denied access to such evidence. Moreover, in those exceptional cases the judicial authorities were required to be particularly vigilant and compensate effectively any disadvantage caused to the opposing party by their own course of action so as to forestall any arbitrariness or abuse of process in the authorities ’ decision-making."

That being said, having regard to the confidentiality of the documents, recognised as such by the various judicial bodies examining the case, the latter could hardly, in their respective decisions, have explained in detail the extent of the review they had carried out without compromising the secrecy of the information in their possession."

The Court acknowledges that the intelligence service ’ s report, which served as a basis for the decision revoking the applicant ’ s security clearance, had been classified in the lowest category of confidentiality, namely, the “restricted” category (see paragraphs 15 and 38 above). However, it considers that that fact did not deprive the Czech authorities of the right not to disclose the contents to the applicant. It can be seen from the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s case-law, although it postdates the judgment in the present case (see paragraph 65 above), that, contrary to the applicant ’ s submission, Law no. 412/2005, and particularly section 133(3) of that Law, is applicable to any information classified as confidential and not limited to data of a higher degree of confidentiality. Accordingly, the application of section 133(3) of Law no. 412/2005 by the domestic courts does not appear to be arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable."

The relevant passages of the Federal Supreme Court ’ s judgment read as follows:",
                "“It must first be considered whether the Swiss courts have jurisdiction to examine the action.",
                "3.1 As Tunisia is not a party to the Convention of 16 September 1988 on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Lugano Convention, RS 0.275.11), there exists no convention rule between the two States governing the question of forum, which must therefore be examined in the light of the LDIP (sections 1(1)(a) and 1(2) LDIP).",
                "3.2 In this instance, the jurisdiction of the Swiss authorities cannot be derived from the general rule concerning the international jurisdiction of the State of domicile of the defendant contained in section 2 of the LDIP, since the respondents are not domiciled in Switzerland. The cantonal court was, moreover, right in finding that the criteria, set out in section 129 of the LDIP, for establishing jurisdiction over actions in respect of wrongful acts were not met in so far as the defendants had neither their domicile nor their place of habitual residence or business in Switzerland (section 129(1) LDIP), and neither the wrongful act nor the resultant injury occurred in Switzerland (section 129(2) LDIP).",
                "3.3 In the absence of an ordinary forum, the problem must be addressed under section 3 of the LDIP, which concerns the forum of necessity ... Under the latter provision, where no forum is provided for in Switzerland by the LDIP and where proceedings in another country prove impossible or one cannot reasonable require that they be brought in that country, the Swiss judicial or administrative authorities of the locality with which the case has a sufficient connection have jurisdiction.",
                "The application of this rule for assigning jurisdiction thus calls for three cumulative conditions to be met: firstly, the Swiss authorities do not have jurisdiction under another provision; secondly, legal proceedings in another country are impossible or cannot reasonably be required; and, thirdly, the case in question has a sufficient connection with Switzerland. In the present case, the first condition is indisputably fulfilled. Fulfilment of the second condition appears more problematic, but in the light of the third condition, which merits more extensive discussion, it is not necessary to elaborate further on this question.",
                "3.4 Section 3 of the LDIP, which must be interpreted restrictively ... represents a safety valve, intended to avoid denials of justice ... in the event of a negative conflict of jurisdiction.",
                "In this connection, the Federal Council, in its authoritative interpretation of this provision, noted that “there are cases that have such a tenuous connection with Switzerland that it is not appropriate to set in motion the entire judicial system in order to resolve them. However, section 3 lays down an exception to this principle. The Swiss authorities must assume jurisdiction even in cases where the connection with our country is very tenuous, where it is impossible to bring proceedings or to lodge an appeal abroad. It is for the claimant or the appellant to demonstrate this impossibility. Where this evidence has been adduced, jurisdiction reverts to the authority of the locality with which the case has a sufficient connection. Where there are several competing fora in Switzerland, it is the first authority before which an action is brought that has jurisdiction. Clearly, the impossibility of bringing and pursuing proceedings abroad can only be examined in the light of the tangible circumstances and of the possible consequences for the individual concerned in the particular case; it will ultimately be for the court to recognise, or not, its jurisdiction” .....",
                "Although section 3 LDIP may thus seem innately paradoxical in so far as proceedings for which there is no basis for connection with an ordinary forum in Switzerland are, ipso facto, lacking in any particular connection with this country, in such a way that determining a “sufficient connection” may prove challenging, and the aim pursued by the law – to prevent a formal denial of justice – difficult to achieve, this legal provision has not in practice been without effect; the cantonal courts in particular have recognised its applicability in the areas of family law, inheritance and proceedings on debt-enforcement and bankruptcy....",
                "Moreover, legal writers have noted that a subsidiary forum must necessarily be recognised in situations of political persecution... However, neither the case-law nor legal opinion provide much in the way of guidance concerning civil actions for compensation in respect of damage resulting from crimes against humanity, life and physical integrity, committed abroad, by foreign perpetrators.",
                "3.5 That being stated, it is necessary to consider what is meant by “case” [“cause” in the French version] in section 3 LDIP.",
                "It is settled case-law that the law must, in the first instance, be interpreted literally. An interpretation which deviates from the literal meaning of a text expressed in clear terms is allowable only where there are objective reasons for considering that the text fails to convey the true meaning of the provision concerned. Such reasons may derive from the drafting history, from the aim and sense of the provision concerned and from the structure and layout of the law. If the text is not absolutely clear, if it can be interpreted variously, the approach must be to seek out the true import of the provision having regard to all relevant factors, including in particular the drafting history, the intention pursued by the rule, the spirit and values on which it is based or again its relationship with other legal provisions. The Federal Supreme Court does not favour any one method of interpretation but adopts a pragmatic plurality in its search for the true meaning of the rule; in particular, it takes as a basis a literal understanding of the text only where this offers, with no ambiguity, a solution that is substantively just (ATF 133 III 175 § 3.3.1, V 57 § 6.1; 132 III 226 § 3.3.5 and the judgments cited therein).",
                "In itself, the meaning to be attributed to the term “ cause ” is uncertain in the sense that it does not have a general definition in the laws of civil procedure of the French-speaking cantons (see, however, Bertossa/Gaillard/Guyet/ Schmidt, Commentaire de la loi de procedure civile genevoise, vol. I, Geneva 2002, n.10 ad Article 99/LPC/GE, concerning the force of res judicata, in which the authors consider that identical claims, in terms of their content, based on the same arguments and the same combination of alleged facts, constitute the objective limit of res judicata; that identity is determined by the complete set of legal considerations which formed part of the first application and were adjudicated upon; this was how “cause” was to be understood in former Article 99(2); the alleged facts of the case determine an overall situation [“ Sachverhalt ”, “ Prozessstoff ”] which it is for the court to assess) but would appear to equate to “ procédure ” or “ demande en justice ” or in German to “Rechtsstreit”, “ Rechtssache ”, “ Prozess ”, “ Angelegenheit ”, “ causa litigandi ” or “ Streitgrund ”. At all events, “cause” is not the literal and unambiguous translation of the terms “ Sachverhalt ” or “ fattispecie ” used in the German and Italian versions of section 3 of the LDIP. It should be borne in mind, at this point, that the latter terms are usually translated in French as “ énoncé ” or “ exposé des faits ” or “ état des faits ”.",
                "As the versions of the law drafted in the three official languages have the same standing, the question arises whether the difference between the French wording and that of the other two versions results from an error in the legislative process, from a difference in meaning which becomes apparent only in the context of specific cases according to a varying understanding of the legal provision in each of the languages, or, lastly, from a linguistic difference attributable either to the non-translatability knowingly taken into account in the drafting or to uncertainty on the part of the legislator as to the meaning to be conveyed (see Schubarth, Die Auslegung mehrsprachiger Gesetzestexte, in Rapports suisses présentés au XVIIe Congrès international de droit comparé, Zurich 2006, p. 11 et seq., especially p. 12 s.).",
                "It seems clear that the first of these possibilities can be ruled out. To distinguish between the second and third possibilities the understanding of the term “cause” in legal French terminology must be considered. In this regard, the “cause” of the action is the basis of the claim [“ base de la prétention ”] ( ‘ Streitgrund ” rather than “ Sachverhalt ”), though it should be noted that the legal writers are in some disagreement as to the content and scope of that basis. Some argue that the “cause” must be seen as a legal concept allowing the claim to be defined, while for others the “cause” comes down to a set of facts giving rise to the legal issues in debate or the legal interest invoked (see Vincent/Guinchard, Procédure civile, 24th edition, Paris 1996, n. 519 p. 386 et seq., who conclude that the “cause” of the action is constituted by a legally characterised set of facts).",
                "In the case in point, it must be acknowledged that a comparison with the German and Italian versions assists in the interpretation of the French text, supporting the view that the term “ cause ” should be assigned the restricted meaning of “set of facts” or, to take a literal translation of “ Sachverhalt ” and “ fattispeccie ”, “ exposé ” or “ état de faits ” and not “ procédure ”. In other words, it is the “cause” – which concerns the set of facts and the legal argumentation – rather than the person of the applicant which must have a sufficient connection with Switzerland.",

All of the specific features of the case come back to Tunisia, except for the fact of residence in Italy at the relevant time. The facts of the case thus have no connection with Switzerland, so that the question of whether or not the link with this country is sufficient does not arise. In those circumstances, it is not possible to recognise the jurisdiction of the Swiss courts, short of disregarding the clear text of s[ection] 3 of the LDIP [see paragraph 37 below]. The fact that the claimant then chose to come to Switzerland cannot change anything, since it is a fact subsequent to the events of the case and, moreover, does not form part of it.",

The Swiss authorities are bound to declare themselves competent even in cases presenting a highly tenuous connection with our country where it is impossible to bring an action or lodge an appeal abroad.

The Committee recalls its general comment No. 3 (2012) on the implementation of article 14 by States parties, in which it considers that ‘ the application of article 14 is not limited to victims who were harmed in the territory of the State party or by or against nationals of the State party ’ and that ‘ article 14 requires States parties to ensure that all victims of torture and ill-treatment are able to access remedy and obtain redress ’. However, the Committee observes that, in the specific circumstances of this case, the State party is unable to establish jurisdiction over officials of another State for alleged acts committed outside the State party ’ s territory. Accordingly, the Committee considers that, in the case under review, the complainant ’ s claim to redress and compensation is inadmissible.”",

Admittedly, it is evident that the obligation to put in place a compensation system lies on the State responsible for acts of torture, and on the State in which such acts were prepared or on the territory of which the torturers have attempted to obtain refuge. However, the system recommended by the Convention against Torture does not impose on a State an obligation to provide reparation in respect of acts having no connection with that State or for victims whose protection does not fall within its sphere of interest, whether that is expressed in terms of jurisdictional criteria, political stakes, or in any other manner. In other words, the Convention does not require that a State endow its courts with universal civil jurisdiction.",

This international criminal jurisdiction is not universal, although it might be thought that its effects appear to be so. However, even if this were correct, one cannot assign a similar scope to Article 14 on the obligation to provide redress, which is worded in terms that are significantly more general and thus less binding on the States Parties. Nor does this difference in the texts allow for the conclusion that the system for civil jurisdiction ought to be defined in parallel with the grounds for criminal jurisdiction; a mere affirmation that these two systems for redress would be complementary is insufficient to overcome the difference between them as that was intended by the authors of the Convention.”",

It seems, however, that this forum is primarily applied in the areas of family law or contract law.

Identification of the relevant connection and of its effective existence is carried out in the specific circumstances of the case by the domestic court before which it is brought.

The Court further notes that in those States and territories with a legal system based on the Anglo-American tradition, the question of a forum of necessity is not posed in the same terms. The broad scope of judicial power leads the courts to set limits on it. These limits are the equivalent of the grounds of jurisdiction in the civil-law tradition, in that they determine the cases that may be heard and determined by the courts. In the majority of cases, therefore, the aim is not to resolve a conflict as to proper jurisdiction by allowing for an additional or exceptional forum, but, conversely, to prevent too broad an exercise of judicial power at international level. To this end, an exception known as the forum non conveniens has been developed. Under this exception “a national court can decline jurisdiction on the grounds that a court with equal jurisdiction, situated in another State, would, objectively speaking, be a more appropriate forum for examining a dispute, that is, before which the dispute could be suitably settled, for the interests of all parties and for the ends of justice” (see House of Lords judgment in Spiliada Maritime Corporation/Cansulex Ltd, [1987] AC 460, esp. p. 476).

On receipt of this request, the police immediately contacted the hospital, which informed them that A.K. had indeed been a patient there, but that he had left the hospital on 11 February 2001 and had subsequently left Switzerland. The decision to discontinue the proceedings was not challenged by the applicant.

Lastly, these “rights and obligations” must be “civil” ones within the meaning of the Convention, although Article 6 does not itself guarantee any particular content for them in the substantive law of the Contracting States (see, for example, Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others v.

This concept cannot be interpreted solely by reference to the respondent State ’ s domestic law; it is an “autonomous” concept deriving from the Convention. Article 6 § 1 of the Convention applies irrespective of the parties ’ status, the character of the legislation which governs how the “dispute” is to be determined, and the character of the authority which has jurisdiction in the matter (see, for example, Georgiadis v. Greece, 29 May 1997, § 34, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ III). Whether or not a right is to be regarded as civil within the meaning of that term in the Convention must be determined by reference not only to its legal classification but also to its substantive content and effects under the domestic law of the State concerned (see Perez v.

He alleged that, by interpreting the concept of “the case” as being restricted to the facts at the origin of the legal action, namely to the torture, the Federal Supreme Court had closed the door to any possibility for the applicant to obtain the reparation to which he laid claim. In so doing, that court had refused the possibility of conducting a genuine balancing exercise of all the interests at stake, between the possible legitimate aims justifying a restriction on the one hand and the fact that the case concerned reparation for an international crime and his connections with Switzerland on the other."

He submitted that Article 14 of the Convention against Torture imposed an obligation on the States Parties not to interpret their domestic legal provisions in such a way as to negate the right of the victims of torture to obtain reparation. He referred to General Comment no. 3 (2012) of the United Nations Committee against Torture (§ § 52-53 above), which stated that “[t]he Committee consider[ed] that the application of article 14 [was] not limited to victims who [had been] harmed in the territory of the State party or by or against nationals of the State party ... This [was] particularly important when a victim [was] unable to exercise the rights guaranteed under article 14 in the territory where the violation took place” (General comment no. 3 (2012), § 22). Thus, the applicant submitted that Article 14 of the Convention against Torture enshrined an obligation on all the States Parties to the Convention against Torture. He added that the ICJ had specified, with regard to obligations erga omnes partes, that “each State party ha[d] an interest in compliance with them in any given case” ( Questions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite ( Belgium v. Senegal ), judgment, ICJ Reports 2012, § 68). With regard to torture, he also pointed out that the ICJ had held that by establishing the jurisdiction of their courts to prosecute crimes of torture, “the States parties ensure[d] that their legal systems [would] operate to that effect and commit themselves to coordinating their efforts to eliminate any risk of impunity” (ibid., § 75)."

He pointed out that Article 2 of this Resolution set out the right to enjoy effective access to justice in order to be able genuinely to seek and obtain this reparation. The same Article set out in detail the conditions which must guide the Swiss courts in establishing their jurisdiction over claims for reparation in respect of international crimes. The applicant concluded that recourse to Article 2 of the IIL Resolution would have made it possible to interpret section 3 of the LDIP in such a way as to fully safeguard his right to an appropriate forum.

This proposal had been intended to encourage the adoption of rules of private international law to ensure the fair and effective resolution of questions arising in civil litigation in respect of human-rights violations.

He added that, on this point, the Federal Supreme Court had assigned the concept of “case” solely to the factual situation underlying the claim, namely the criminal act (torture), while refusing the idea that facts concerning the claimant ’ s person could constitute admissible elements in interpreting the concept of sufficient connection with Switzerland (he referred to point 3.5, § 6 of the Federal Supreme Court ’ s judgment; see paragraph 30 above). According to the applicant, however, the place of residence of one of the parties (the victim) could not be left out of the constituent elements of the “facts of the case”. Regarding, more specifically, civil liability, as in the present case, he submitted that if the facts occurred abroad it would never be possible to provide an ordinary forum under section 3 of the LDIP and, in consequence, the Federal Supreme Court ’ s interpretation ruled out all possibility of providing a forum of necessity. In other words, the Federal Supreme Court ’ s restrictive interpretation of the concept of “the case” had negated the very purpose of that provision, which was to prevent denials of justice."

The applicant further observed that recognition of a forum in Switzerland was currently subject to conditions that were stricter in a case of torture than those existing in other areas of law; this was completely incompatible with the purpose of section 3 of the LDIP, which was to reserve a forum of last resort for exceptional cases, such as for crimes of international law. In this regard, he specified that Swiss practice contained numerous legal or case-law examples substantiating the notion that the “case” [“ cause ”] could not be confined solely to the set of facts which gave rise to the legal question to be determined. In respect of those situations, the legislature or the courts had taken the view that if the action could not be brought in the forum to which it would ordinarily have been assigned, or if it could not reasonably be required that it be brought there, an alternative forum had to be provided in Switzerland where there existed a further connection, which might range from the nationality of one of the parties to the mere fact of property having been attached by the courts. In none of these situations was the fact that the legal basis for the action was to be found in another country regarded as inconsistent with recognition of an appropriate forum in Switzerland."

In other words, the interpretation provided by the Federal Supreme Court, in a case in which the action concerned reparation following acts of torture, was in direct conflict with the thrust of the legislation and case-law developments in cases concerning, inter alia, termination of proceedings, confirmation of attachment of property, divorce, the general effects of marriage, and parent-child relationships established by birth or adoption."

According to the applicant, it was thus incomprehensible that the Chamber had not concluded that the Federal Supreme Court ’ s judgment was diametrically opposed to its own conclusion, given that it failed to take any account of such connections with Switzerland and focused only on the fact that the elements relating to the legal basis of the dispute were located abroad."

Sweden (no. 22302/10, 1 March 2016), the Court had recently found a violation of the right of access to a court in a situation in which the domestic courts had denied the existence of a Swedish forum in a case concerning a television programme, the content and aim of which were exclusively directed at Sweden and adversely affected the reputation of Swedish nationals living in Sweden. He added that the situation had been such that the refusal by the Swedish court to accept jurisdiction had left the applicant with little choice but to apply to a foreign court, whose jurisdiction was not in dispute but which was manifestly inappropriate. The mere fact that the programme was broadcast by a British company operating on the territory of the United Kingdom did not in itself constitute a legitimate reason for maintaining that the appropriate forum was in the United Kingdom. The applicant submitted that the Arlewin judgment was important for the present case in so far as it had upheld the right of access to a (Swedish) court when it would also have been possible to bring the case before a court in the United Kingdom.

The Government also submitted that none of the international instruments invoked by the applicant recognised this jurisdiction, particularly Article 16 of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees, and that no rule of customary international law provided for it. They added that the text of Article 14 of the Convention against Torture contained no indication of any extraterritorial application of this rule, and that several judgments delivered by the domestic courts confirmed that Article 14 of the Convention against Torture contained no obligation to introduce universal civil jurisdiction for victims of torture (they referred, in particular, to UK House of Lords, Jones v. Ministry of Interior Al-Mamlaka Al-Arabiya as Saudiya and others [2006] UKHL 26, and Court of Appeal for Ontario, Bouzari v. Iran, cited above (see paragraph 73 ).

In many cases the aim of legal action was to influence an existing factual situation and the question of which elements constituted the case related to the situation as it stood when the action was initiated. However, where an action concerned a set of circumstances which had ended before that action was initiated, the elements of the case had to be examined as they had stood at the material time, prior to the proceedings.

The Court notes that the possibility of joining a compensation claim to ongoing criminal proceedings presents fewer practical difficulties, given that such a claim can rely on the advantages inherent in the criminal proceedings, such as the institution and pursuit of the proceedings, of its own motion, by the competent prosecuting authority, or the centralised establishment and assessment of the facts and evidence as part of the investigation carried out by that authority. It is therefore natural and legitimate for the States to accept more easily such a procedure, namely joining the proceedings as a civil party, without however recognising universal jurisdiction in the context of autonomous civil proceedings.

With regard firstly to the text of this provision, it must be observed that Article 14, which enshrines in a general manner the right of victims of torture to obtain redress, is silent on how this right is to be implemented effectively and on the geographical scope of the States Parties ’ obligations to that end.

Having studied the matter itself, the Grand Chamber shares this opinion. Admittedly, the proposal by the Netherlands to include the words “committed in any territory under its jurisdiction” had disappeared when the Convention was adopted. However, the reasons for this omission remain unknown (see Manfred Nowak/Elizabeth McArthur, op.cit ., paragraph 49 above). In those circumstances, it is difficult to attach decisive importance to it.

It cannot be ruled out that, faced with a text which makes no mention of this scenario and with travaux préparatoires which are almost silent on the subject, the States simply did not envisage the possibility of universal jurisdiction and, accordingly, did not feel obliged to enter reservations to Article 14 in order to exclude such jurisdiction from its scope."

As to the criteria laid down by the Swiss legislature for the implementation of section 3 of the LDIP in a given case, the comparative ‑ law study referred to above indicates that in all the States which do recognise the forum of necessity, it is applied only exceptionally and subject to two cumulative conditions, namely the absence of another forum with jurisdiction, and the existence of a sufficient connection between the case and the State which assumes jurisdiction (see paragraphs 88-89 above). The same two conditions are also found in the European Union law referred to above (see paragraphs 91-93). With regard to the connecting link, the Court observes that the relevant texts do not lay down the criteria to be used, leaving this task to the domestic courts. In this respect, therefore, section 3 of the LDIP corresponds fully to the notions prevailing in this area."

Turning now to the margin of appreciation of the domestic courts, the Court reiterates that in those States which recognise the forum of necessity, the courts enjoy considerable discretion in defining the connecting links and applying them on a case-by-case basis. In so doing the domestic courts most frequently take account of the nature of the dispute or the identity of the parties (see paragraph 89 above). It is on the basis of these elements that the Court will examine whether the Federal Supreme Court exceeded its margin of appreciation in the present case when interpreting section 3 of the LDIP."

The applicant criticises, first and foremost, the fact that the Federal Supreme Court considered that it had to have regard to matters as they stood at the material time, namely in 1992, in assessing whether it had jurisdiction. He considers that the Federal Supreme Court was wrong in failing to take account of the ties subsequently formed by him with Switzerland."

In other words, it is the alleged facts – and not the person of the claimant which must have a sufficient connection with Switzerland (see the judgment of 22 May 2007, point 3.5, paragraph 30 above). With regard to the case and the application of section 3 of the LDIP, the Government also argued that the appropriateness of creating a general forum of necessity, accessible also to foreigners who had no connection with Switzerland, had been discussed when drafting this section, but it had been decided not to pursue that option."

Where an action concerned a set of circumstances which had ended before that action was initiated, the elements of the case must be examined as they stood at the material time, before the proceedings had begun. In consequence, when an element of the case was altered after the decisive set of circumstances ceased to exist, that change was not part of the “case” and could thus no longer create a sufficient connection to warrant a forum of necessity."

Having regard to the wide margin of appreciation granted to the national courts in this area and in the light of the relevant practice of the Swiss courts as described above (see paragraphs 40-44), the Court perceives no arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable elements in the Federal Supreme Court ’ s interpretation of section 3 of the LDIP in the present case. Although certain court rulings seem to indicate that the decisive date for application of section 3 of the LDIP is the point at which the action was lodged, these do not, in the Court ’ s view, enable any decisive conclusions to be drawn. The domestic case-law on this question is relatively limited and concerns very diverse cases, including continuing situations that cannot be compared with the applicant ’ s case."

Sweden (cited above) in support of his argument that the refusal to examine his action was disproportionate (see paragraph 142 above), the Court considers that there were several clear and strong connecting links between the claim brought by the applicant in the Arlewin case and Sweden. It concerned defamation proceedings brought in respect of a television programme, the content of which focused exclusively on Sweden and which adversely affected the reputation of Swedish nationals who were resident in Sweden. The question of a possible forum of necessity did not therefore arise. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicant, whose action for damages involved no connection with Switzerland at the time of the relevant events, cannot usefully rely on that case."

That being so, it should be reiterated that this conclusion does not call into question the broad consensus within the international community on the existence of a right for victims of acts of torture to obtain appropriate and effective redress, nor the fact that the States are encouraged to give effect to this right by endowing their courts with jurisdiction to examine such claims for compensation, including where they are based on facts which occurred outside their geographical frontiers. In this respect, the efforts by States to make access to a court as effective as possible for those seeking compensation for acts of torture are commendable."

                "“... My starting point is that the Acts in question are all concerned to establish an administrative system designed to promote the social welfare of the community. The welfare sector involved is one of peculiar sensitivity, involving very difficult decisions how to strike the balance between protecting the child from immediate feared harm and disrupting the relationship between the child and its parents. In my judgment in such a context it would require exceptionally clear statutory language to show a parliamentary intention that those responsible for carrying out these difficult functions should be liable in damages if, on subsequent investigation with the benefit of hindsight, it was shown that they had reached an erroneous conclusion and therefore failed to discharge their statutory duties. ...",
                "When one turns to the actual words used in the primary legislation to create the duties relied upon in my judgment they are inconsistent with any intention to create a private law cause of action.”"

                "46. As regards the claims that the local authority owed a duty of care to the applicants pursuant to the tort of negligence, Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated, inter alia :",
                "“I turn then to consider whether, in accordance with the ordinary principles laid down in Caparo [1990] 2 AC 605, the local authority ... owed a direct duty of care to the plaintiffs. The local authority accepts that they could foresee damage to the plaintiffs if they carried out their statutory duties negligently and that the relationship between the authority and the plaintiffs is sufficiently proximate. The third requirement laid down in Caparo is that it must be just and reasonable to impose a common law duty of care in all the circumstances ...",
                "The Master of the Rolls took the view, with which I agree, that the public policy consideration that has first claim on the loyalty of the law is that wrongs should be remedied and that very potent counter considerations are required to override that policy (see [1994] 4 AER 602 at 619). However, in my judgment there are such considerations in this case.",
                "First, in my judgment a common law duty of care would cut across the whole statutory system set up for the protection of children at risk. As a result of the ministerial directions contained in 'Working Together' the protection of such children is not the exclusive territory of the local authority's social services. The system is inter-disciplinary, involving the participation of the police, educational bodies, doctors and others. At all stages the system involves joint discussions, joint recommendations and joint decisions. The key organisation is the Child Protection Conference, a multi-disciplinary body which decides whether to place the child on the Child Protection Register. This procedure by way of joint action takes place, not merely because it is good practice, but because it is required by guidance having statutory force binding on the local authority. The guidance is extremely detailed and extensive: the current edition of 'Working Together' runs to 126 pages. To introduce into such a system a common law duty of care enforceable against only one of the participant bodies would be manifestly unfair. To impose such liability on all the participant bodies would lead to almost impossible problems of disentangling as between the respective bodies the liability, both primary and by way of contribution, of each for reaching a decision found to be negligent.",
                "Second, the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with children at risk is extraordinarily delicate. Legislation requires the local authority to have regard not only to the physical well-being of the child but also to the advantages of not disrupting the child's family environment. ... In one of the child abuse cases, the local authority is blamed for removing the child precipitately; in the other for failing to remove the children from their mother. As the Report of the Inquiry into Child Abuse in Cleveland 1987 (Cmnd. 412) ('Cleveland Report 1987') said, at p. 244:",
                "'... It is a delicate and difficult line to tread between taking action too soon and not taking it soon enough. Social services whilst putting the needs of the child first must respect the rights of the parents; they also must work if possible with the parents for the benefit of the children. These parents themselves are often in need of help. Inevitably a degree of conflict develops between those objectives.'",
                "Next, if liability in damages were to be imposed, it might well be that local authorities would adopt a more cautious and defensive approach to their duties. For example, as the Cleveland Report makes clear, on occasions the speedy decision to remove the child is sometimes vital. If the authority is to be made liable in damages for a negligent decision to remove a child (such negligence lying in the failure properly first to investigate the allegations) there would be a substantial temptation to postpone making such a decision until further inquiries have been made in the hope of getting more concrete facts. Not only would the child in fact being abused be prejudiced by such delay, the increased workload inherent in making such investigations would reduce the time available to deal with other cases and other children.",
                "The relationship between the social worker and the child's parents is frequently one of conflict, the parent wishing to retain care of the child, the social worker having to consider whether to remove it. This is fertile ground in which to breed ill-feeling and litigation, often hopeless, the cost of which both in terms of money and human resources will be diverted from the performance of the social service for which they were provided. The spectre of vexatious and costly litigation is often urged as a reason for not imposing a legal duty. But the circumstances surrounding cases of child abuse make the risk a very high one which cannot be ignored.",
                "If there were no other remedy for maladministration of the statutory system for the protection of children, it would provide substantial argument for imposing a duty of care. But the statutory complaints procedures contained in section 76 of the 1980 Act and the much fuller procedures now available under the 1989 Act provide a means to have grievances investigated though not to recover compensation. Further, it was submitted (and not controverted) that the local authorities Ombudsman would have power to investigate cases such as these.",
                "Finally, your Lordships' decision in Caparo [1990] 2 AC 605 lays down that in deciding whether to develop novel categories of negligence the court should proceed incrementally and by analogy with decided categories. We were not referred to any category of case in which a duty of care has been held to exist which is in any way analogous to the present cases. Here, for the first time, the plaintiffs are seeking to erect a common law duty of care in relation to the administration of a statutory social welfare scheme. Such a scheme is designed to protect weaker members of society (children) from harm done to them by others. The scheme involves the administrators in exercising discretion and powers which could not exist in the private sector and which in many cases bring them into conflict with those who, under the general law, are responsible for the child's welfare. To my mind, the nearest analogies are the cases where a common law duty of care has been sought to be imposed upon the police (in seeking to protect vulnerable members of society from wrongs done to them by others) or statutory regulators of financial dealing who are seeking to protect investors from dishonesty. In neither of these cases has it been thought appropriate to superimpose on a statutory regime a common law duty of care giving rise to a claim in damages for failure to protect the weak against the wrongdoer. ... In my judgment, the courts should proceed with great care before holding liable in negligence those who have been charged by Parliament with the task of protecting society from the wrong doings of others.”"

Having regard to the fact that common law duty of care would cut across the whole statutory set up for the protection of children at risk, that the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with such children was extraordinarily difficult and delicate, that local authorities might adopt a more defensive approach to their duties if liability in damages were imposed, that the relationship between parents and social workers was frequently one of conflict and that the plaintiff children's injuries were compensatable under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, it was not just and reasonable to do so. It followed that no duty of care was owed to the plaintiff parents who in any event were secondary victims in respect of their claim for psychiatric illness ...",

Accordingly, since in the instant case, the plaintiff children were not children for whom the council had carried out any immediate caring responsibilities under the child welfare system but were living at home with their parents, and express assurances had been given that a sexual abuser would not be placed in their home, their claim should proceed ...”"

The local authority had applied to strike out the case as disclosing no cause of action. The House of Lords, upholding the plaintiff's appeal, unanimously held that the judgment in X and Others v.

                "“(1) Although the word 'immunity' is sometimes incorrectly used, a holding that it is not fair, just and reasonable to hold liable a particular class of defendants whether generally or in relation to a particular type of activity is not to give immunity from a liability to which the rest of the world is subject. It is a prerequisite to there being any liability in negligence at all that as a matter of policy it is fair, just and reasonable in those circumstances to impose liability in negligence. (2) In a wide range of cases public policy has led to the decision that the imposition of liability would not be fair and reasonable in the circumstances, e.g. some activities of financial regulators, building inspectors, ship surveyors, social workers dealing with sex abuse cases. In all these cases and many others the view has been taken that the proper performance of the defendant's primary functions for the benefit of society as a whole will be inhibited if they are required to look over their shoulder to avoid liability in negligence. In English law the decision as to whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a liability in negligence on a particular class of would-be defendants depends on weighing in the balance the total detriment to the public interest in all cases from holding such class liable in negligence as against the total loss to all would-be plaintiffs if they are not to have a cause of action in respect of the loss they have individually suffered. (3) In English law, questions of public policy and the question whether it is fair and reasonable to impose liability in negligence are decided as questions of law. Once the decision is taken that, say, company auditors though liable to shareholders for negligent auditing are not liable to those proposing to invest in the company (see Caparo Industries plc v. Dickman [1990] 1 All ER 568, [1990] 2 AC 605), that decision will apply to all future cases of the same kind. The decision does not depend on weighing the balance between the extent of the damage to the plaintiff and the damage to the public in each particular case.”"

It achieved those aims without inhibiting claimants' rights to present any arguments in their favour to a court.

It may be noted that in subsequent cases the domestic courts have further defined this area of law concerning the liability of local authorities in child-care matters, holding that a duty of care may arise in other factual situations, where, for example, a child has suffered harm once in local authority care, or a foster family has suffered harm as a result of the placement in their home by the local authority of an adolescent with a history of abusing younger children (see W. and Others v.

As pointed out above, such a hearing would have served no purpose, unless a duty of care in negligence had been held to exist in their case. It is not for this Court to find that this should have been the outcome of the striking-out proceedings since this would effectively involve substituting its own views as to the proper interpretation and content of domestic law."

The tort of negligence was held not to impose a duty of care on the local authority in the exercise of its statutory powers. Their experiences were described as “horrific” by a psychiatrist (see paragraph 40 above) and the Court has found that they were victims of a violation of Article 3 (see paragraph 74 above). Yet the outcome of the domestic proceedings they brought is that they, and any children with complaints such as theirs, cannot sue the local authority in negligence for compensation, however foreseeable – and severe – the harm suffered and however unreasonable the conduct of the local authority in failing to take steps to prevent that harm. The applicants are correct in their assertions that the gap they have identified in domestic law is one that gives rise to an issue under the Convention, but in the Court's view it is an issue under Article 13, not Article 6 § 1."

The Court emphasises that the object and purpose underlying the Convention, as set out in Article 1, is that the rights and freedoms should be secured by the Contracting State within its jurisdiction. It is fundamental to the machinery of protection established by the Convention that the national systems themselves provide redress for breaches of its provisions, the Court exerting its supervisory role subject to the principle of subsidiarity. In that context, Article 13, which requires an effective remedy in respect of violations of the Convention, takes on a crucial function. The applicants' complaints are essentially that that they have not been afforded a remedy in the courts for the failure to ensure them the level of protection against abuse to which they were entitled under Article 3 of the Convention. The domestic courts referred to “the public-policy consideration that has first claim on the loyalty of the law” as being that “wrongs should be remedied” (see paragraph 46 above). As far as Convention wrongs are concerned, that principle is embodied in Article 13 (see, inter alia, Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI). It is under Article 13 that the applicants' right to a remedy should be examined and, if appropriate, vindicated."

While the remedy required by Article 13 need not always be judicial in character, in their case a judicial determination was required. This was because the tort of negligence was the only remedy in national law capable of determining the substance of their complaint and which (but for the alleged immunity) would closely match the requirements of the Convention. Also the accountability of public officials, central to both Articles 3 and 13, required a right of access to a court whereby the individual could hold the responsible officials to account in adversarial proceedings and obtain an enforceable order for compensation if the claim was substantiated. The wording of Article 13 also prohibited the creation of immunities for public officials and any such immunity must be regarded as contrary to the object and purpose of the Convention."

This included the payment of compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (CICB), the possibility of complaining to the Local Government Ombudsman, and the complaints procedure under the Children Act 1989. However, the Government accepted that in the particular circumstances of this case, the remedies were insufficient, alone or cumulatively, to satisfy the requirements of Article 13. They conceded that there had been a serious violation of one of the most important Convention rights, that the CICB could only award compensation for criminal acts, not for the consequences of neglect, and that any recommendation by the Ombudsman would not have been legally enforceable. They had been under the obligation, in this case, to ensure that some form of compensation was made available for damage caused by the breach of Article 3, whether by a broader statutory compensation scheme, an enforceable Ombudsman's award, or through the courts.

As the Court has stated on many occasions, Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. Article 13 thus requires the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although the Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 also varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law (see, among other authorities, Aydın v.

Turkey, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, pp. 330-31, § 107). These cases, however, concerned alleged killings or infliction of treatment contrary to Article 3 involving potential criminal responsibility on the part of security force officials. Where alleged failure by the authorities to protect persons from the acts of others is concerned, Article 13 may not always require that the authorities undertake the responsibility for investigating the allegations. There should, however, be available to the victim or the victim's family a mechanism for establishing any liability of State officials or bodies for acts or omissions involving the breach of their rights under the Convention. Furthermore, in the case of a breach of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, which rank as the most fundamental provisions of the Convention, compensation for the non-pecuniary damage flowing from the breach should in principle be part of the range of available remedies."

                "(i) Z was described as having made a recovery from the serious depressive illness suffered at the time of her removal into care. While she was no longer suffering from any psychiatric illness, she had emotional, social and practical difficulties far beyond those normally affecting a girl of her age and was statistically vulnerable to anxiety and perhaps depressive illness in adult life. Her problems were classified as being of moderate severity. It was estimated that she would need psychotherapeutic treatment, outside the National Health Service, estimated at 60 to 100 sessions costing 70 to 90 pounds sterling (GBP) per session, to cope with her vulnerability, particularly at periods of transition. She was likely to remain vulnerable on the labour market, though it was anticipated that she would be able to take on further education, sustain her own mental health and enter the workforce. On her behalf, her representatives claimed GBP 9,000 for the cost of future psychiatric treatment, and GBP 40,000 to offset her handicap on the labour market, a total of GBP 49,000.",

She had, however, interviewed him on behalf of the local authority in May 1993 and had some records concerning his past treatment and problems. On that basis, she concluded that he was suffering from long-term psychiatric illness and had a poor prognosis for recovery. His chances of fitting into the normal school system remained very poor. He was prone to aggressiveness and had difficulty with everyday tasks. He was currently suffering from a reactive attachment disorder, resulting directly from severe parental neglect and abuse. The prognosis for the future was extremely bleak and he was likely to require intermittent hospitalisation. He was seriously handicapped on the labour market and was unlikely ever to be able to hold down a job. Assuming that he might otherwise have been able to obtain low-paid manual employment earning GBP 15,000 per year, and a normal working life to age 65, and taking into account uncertainties and early settlement, he claimed GBP 150,000 in loss of future earnings. As he had a substantial and continuing need for psychiatric treatment outside the National Health Service (NHS), he claimed GBP 50,000 as a minimum estimate for future treatment. This made a total of GBP 200,000.",
                "(iii) B was still suffering from untreated post-traumatic stress disorder and a chronic, generalised anxiety disorder. He had horrific nightmares and, if left untreated, was likely to continue in the same disturbed emotional state. He required open-ended psychiatric treatment into adult life, outside the limited provision of the NHS. This was estimated at a cost of GBP 50,000 minimum. He is vulnerable in terms of both schooling and employment opportunities because of a chronic psychiatric disorder and limited social skills. His prospects of future employment were not as bleak as those of A, but he was likely to have substantial interruptions in his employment. On the assumption of six gaps of one year, on an average labourer's wage of GBP 15,000 per year, he claimed GBP 90,000. This made a total of GBP 140,000.",
                "(iv) C was described as happy in her adoptive home, though carrying a substantial burden about her origins and reminders of them. She was recurrently angry and anxious about her natural mother. She had some remaining behavioural problems which were likely to be containable with good substitute parenting. She was, however, more liable than other children to anxiety and there was a statistical risk of depression in adult life. She did not currently require psychiatric treatment although provision should be made for treatment in adolescence and adulthood. At a recommended 30 to 50 sessions at GBP 70 to 90, a claim was made for GBP 4,500 for future psychiatric treatment. GBP 10,000 was claimed for loss of future earnings, making a total of GBP 14,500.",

In A's case, his difficulties had been exacerbated by this lack of help while appropriate psychiatric, educational and environmental help might have substantially improved his prognosis. In B's case, more psychotherapeutic help could have reduced his current vulnerability and given a less gloomy prognosis. The reports also deplored that the psychotherapeutic referrals recommended for A and B in 1993 (for both) and 1998 (for B) had not been pursued by the local authority on their behalf, and noted that one of the social workers had been told that there was no time or money for this work to be done."

That decision was upheld by the Płock Self-Government Board of Appeal ( Kolegium Odwoławcze przy Sejmiku Samorządowym ) on 27 January 1993.

It consequently found that their conduct had amounted to a serious breach of the rule of law. The court further held that the authorities had arbitrarily refused the zoning approval sought by the applicant and that, by their refusal, they had flagrantly infringed the master plan requirements. It added that they had misinterpreted the master plan, made wrong findings of fact and that they had, in particular, without any basis whatsoever, established that the applicant’s intended project would not conform to the relevant class of land use.

The fair, public and expeditious characteristics of judicial proceedings are indeed of no value at all if such proceedings are not first initiated.

Indeed, after that claim was accepted for examination in those proceedings, on 6 April 2004 the Regional Court awarded the applicant BGN 10,000 in damages, plus default interest (see paragraph 14 above). However, that decision was later on quashed and the Court of Appeal discontinued the examination of the applicant ’ s claim, on the grounds that it was inadmissible, as it had not been lodged within the time-limit provided for in Article 61 § 4 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure. That decision was upheld by way of a final decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 15-16 above). In the subsequent civil proceedings, the courts found that the applicant ’ s claim was time-barred, without taking any decision on its merits (see paragraphs 18-20 above). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicant did not have the merits of her claim determined by a court, and that her access to a court was restricted."

Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, § 82, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII). This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature (see Baničević v. Croatia (dec.), no. 44252/10, § 30, 2 October 2012). The Court ’ s own task is to assess whether the effects of this interpretation were compatible with the Convention requirements as to the permissible restrictions to the right to access to a court (see Atanasova v.

In 2001, before the expiry of that time-limit, the applicant brought a tort claim in the criminal proceedings, but it was eventually found to be inadmissible by the criminal courts, and the civil courts, seised by her in 2007, held that the bringing of such an inadmissible claim could not have interrupted the running of the applicable limitation period, which had therefore expired already in 2002."

The 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, applicable at the time, stated expressly that any civil claim had to be brought before the commencement of the examination of the case by the court of first instance, and the domestic case-law reiterated that requirement (see paragraph 22 above). While, indeed, there is also case-law accepting that in situations where the case has been sent back to the prosecution authorities the victims of the respective offence can validly lodge a civil claim after the case reaches once again the courts (see paragraph 23 above), it is scarce, and the parties have not specified whether the national courts have reached such conclusions on any constant basis. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicant should have been aware, in 2001 when she brought her civil action in the criminal proceedings only after a remittal of the case, that, at the least, she ran a risk to have that action declared inadmissible. Pursuant to section 116(b) of the Obligations and Contracts Act (see paragraph 30 above), this would in turn mean that the bringing of the action in 2001 could not have interrupted the running of the limitation period.

She has presented no explanation for this failure, and has not in particular referred to any obstruction on her right to access to a court at that time. Bringing an action in the context of the criminal proceedings in 1998 clearly was an available and advantageous avenue (see paragraph 25 above) – a conclusion illustrated by the fact that the other victims ’ claims, brought at that time, were accepted for examination by the criminal courts and allowed, and their admissibility was apparently not challenged (see paragraphs 7 and 14-15 above)."

Even though the examination of such a claim would have been stayed to await the conclusion of the criminal proceedings as to H.H. ’ s guilt (see paragraph 27 above), it has not been argued that the delay thus incurred would, in itself, impermissibly restrict the applicant ’ s right to access to a court, nor that the civil courts would in any way be prevented from examining the merits of the applicant ’ s claim."

Once the claim was accepted for examination in the criminal proceedings the applicant was prevented under Article 95 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure from bringing the same claim before the civil courts (see paragraph 26 above). That claim remained pending before the criminal courts until 2007, and it was only after it had been found inadmissible in the criminal proceedings by way of a final decision (see paragraphs 15-16 above), long after the date on which the limitation period was eventually considered to have expired, that the applicant was able to initiate separate civil proceedings. If the Regional Court had refused to accept the claim for examination, or it had been declared inadmissible on an earlier date, or had the criminal courts transferred it to the civil courts following the procedure under Article 93 § 1 of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 28 above), the applicant could have been able to bring her claim before the civil courts in due time and have it examined on merits."

                "26. As regards the criterion set out in the Court ’ s case-law that the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, the Court had previously held in cases concerning recruitment or promotion procedures that in so far as the proceedings would not result in the applicant ’ s appointment or promotion but in the annulment of a third person ’ s appointment or promotion, they had only remote consequences for the applicant and, therefore, Article 6 was not applicable (see Revel and Mora v. France (dec.), no. 171/03, 15 November 2005, and Tencheva ‑ Rafailov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 13885/04, 5 January 2010). However, the Court later considered that an applicant who possessed all the necessary qualifications for a post and could legitimately expect to obtain it, could invoke Article 6 as the outcome of the proceedings would be directly decisive for his or her right to participate in a recruitment procedure conducted in compliance with the principles of legality and transparency, where such right was arguably recognised under the domestic law (see Fiume v. Italy, no. 20774/05, § 35, 30 June 2009; see also Majski v. Croatia (no. 2), no. 16924/08, § 50, 19 July 2011 and Juričić, cited above, § 52, in which the Court found Article 6 applicable in relation to the right to equal participation in a competition for public office and implicitly rejected the Government ’ s objection that the proceedings were not directly decisive for the right in question). Similarly, in Tsanova-Gecheva v. Bulgaria (no. 43800/12, § 84, 15 September 2015), the Court held that the proceedings were decisive for the applicant ’ s right to a lawful and fair promotion procedure in so far as they could have ended in the annulment of the contested procedure and the organisation of a new competition for the post, if the domestic courts had granted the applicant ’ s appeal (see also Dzhidzheva-Trendafilova cited above, § 43 ).",

As regards the existence of a right in the present case, the Court notes that the domestic proceedings concerned the applicant ’ s complaint as regards the ministerial decision to appoint some individuals to the vacant posts of educational coordinators, for which posts the applicant had also applied. In particular, the applicant questioned the legality of the procedure followed, in connection with the omission of the Administration to publish the ranking of the relevant candidates, and the way in which she had been graded, on the grounds that the Administration had breached the principles of sound administration and of protection of legitimate expectations."

                "28. The Court observes that neither Article 6 nor any other provision of the Convention or its Protocols guarantees, as such, a right to appointment or promotion in the civil service (see Glasenapp v. Germany, 28 August 1986, §§ 48-49, Series A no. 104; Kosiek v. Germany, 28 August 1986, §§ 34-35, Series A no. 105; Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, § 43, Series A no. 323; and Wille v. Liechtenstein [GC], no. 28396/95, §§ 40-41, ECHR 1999-VII). The Court has, however, accepted, in circumstances similar to those of the present case, that the right to a lawful and fair promotion procedure ( see Dzhidzheva-Trendafilova, cited above, § 43, Fiume, cited above, § 35, and Penttinen v. Finland (dec.), no 9125/07, 5 January 2010) or to equal participation in a competition for public office ( Juričić, cited above, § 52) could be considered as recognised rights in domestic law, at least arguably where the domestic courts had recognised their existence and had examined the relevant complaints of the applicants ( see Tsanova-Gecheva, cited above, § 84)."

This appears to be the case in the present application, since domestic law gave the candidates who fulfilled the formal requirements specified in the relevant provisions the right to apply to be appointed as educational coordinators, a post which the applicant had occupied in the past. It should also be noted that domestic law provided judicial remedies against decisions not to appoint applicants to certain posts. As a result, the applicant had the right to challenge before the domestic courts the fact that she had not been chosen for the posts and the legality of the procedure followed. Additionally, the Court of Appeal did not reject the applicant ’ s complaints against the decision on the grounds of the non-existence of a right, but merely because the contested act had expired and, in their view, there was no longer any reason to adjudicate on the validity of the contested act."

                "32. As regards the first condition of the Eskelinen test, that is, whether national law “expressly excluded” access to a court for the post or category of staff in question, the Court notes that in the present case the applicant had had the right to contest the procedure under which educational coordinators were appointed, in so far as her name had been omitted. The above consideration is not affected by the fact that the domestic court did not ultimately pronounce on the legality of the act for reasons other than the exclusion of access to a court for the specific post. In the light of the foregoing, it cannot be concluded that national law “expressly excluded access to a court” for a claim based on the alleged unlawfulness of the appointment procedure. Therefore, the first condition of the Eskelinen test has not been met. Given that the two conditions for excluding the application of Article 6 must be fulfilled, the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine whether the second condition of the Eskelinen test was met (see Baka, cited above, § 118)."

The applicant complained that the failure of the domestic courts to consider her application for annulment on time had violated her right of access to a court, as she had been prevented from having a judgment on the merits of the case. This failure was partly due to the Administration ’ s delay in providing their views on the invoked grounds for annulment, which, pursuant to Article 24 of Presidential Decree no. 18/1989, constituted a disciplinary offence, and partly due to the domestic courts ’ inaction. For her part, the applicant had used all the possibilities provided for by domestic law in order to accelerate the proceedings and had drawn the domestic courts ’ attention on many occasions to the risk of the contested act expiring before they had a chance to consider it. She was not to blame for having exercised her procedural right to have submitted additional grounds for annulment, as she had done so within the deadlines provided for by law, that is to say a month before the scheduled hearing of 5 March 2010."

While that legal provision served the legitimate aim of not conducting trials when the contested act had ceased to exist, its application in the circumstances of the present case, in conjunction with the above-mentioned delays, had violated her right of access to a court. In particular, the applicant had duly lodged an application for annulment within the time-limit, had complied with all the procedural rules and had paid the relevant court fees in order to have her case examined. Therefore, the termination of the trial in application of Article 32 § 2 of Presidential Decree no. 18/1989 had been disproportionate, as the domestic courts had failed to take into account the specific facts of the case and the conduct of the applicant, who had not contributed to the delay and the subsequent termination of the proceedings. The applicant stressed that in the end she had been forced to bear the burden of the Administration ’ s and domestic courts ’ inactivity."

The applicant also complained about the dismissal of her arguments concerning her continued interest in pursuing the application for annulment, arguing that it constituted a traditional method used in Greek courts to dispose of applications, thus creating a large category of administrative acts which escaped judicial review. Relying on the Court ’ s judgment in N.T. Giannousis and Kliafas Brothers S.A. v. Greece (no. 2898/03, 14 December 2006), the applicant claimed that the Court had already criticised the broad interpretation and application of the said domestic provision.

The applicant was no longer in need of judicial protection as the contested act no longer had any unfavourable consequences for her. In this regard they stressed the legitimate aim pursued by Article 32 § 2 of Presidential Decree no. 18/1989, which was the avoidance of the conduct of unnecessary trials, and claimed that that provision complied with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in view of the fact that the person concerned was no longer in need of judicial protection. If that person could prove that he or she was still affected by the expired administrative act, then the law allowed him or her to pursue his or her application.

The applicant had failed to demonstrate that that act would have continued to generate unfavourable consequences for her in the future or that the unfavourable consequences would have been maintained, and therefore the domestic court had been right to reject her application. In addition, they rejected the applicant ’ s argument that there was an established practice in the domestic courts of dismissing applications without reviewing the essence of the dispute, and adduced two judgments of the Supreme Administrative Court which had held that even though the contested acts had expired the applicants had proved a special legal interest and, accordingly, their applications had been examined."

The Court reiterates that the right of access to a court – that is, the right to institute proceedings before the courts in civil matters – constitutes an element which is inherent in the right set out in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which lays down guarantees as regards both the organisation and composition of the court and the conduct of the proceedings. The combination of all these safeguards makes up the right to a fair trial secured by Article 6 § 1 (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 36, Series A no. 18). However, the right of access to the courts is not absolute and may be subject to limitations that do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, § 120, 23 June 2016, and Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others v. Romania [GC], no. 76943/11, § 89, 29 November 2016)."

The Court has additionally held that significant and recurring delays in the administration of justice are a particularly worrying phenomenon that could undermine public confidence in the effectiveness of the judicial system. Thus, in principle, it cannot be ruled out that, in exceptional cases, the maintenance of a pending procedure for an excessive period may affect even the right of access to a court. In particular, the unjustified absence of a decision by the trial court for a particularly prolonged period may inevitably amount to a denial of justice; the remedy exercised by the person concerned may be deprived of all its effectiveness, when the court concerned fails to settle the dispute in due time, as required by the circumstances and the issue of each particular case (see Vassilios Athanasiou and Others v. Greece, no. 50973/08, § 52, 21 December 2010)."

                "45. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that the applicant duly submitted her application for annulment which was scheduled for hearing on 13 November 2009. The contested act, by its nature, called for a speedy examination of its validity as its duration was for a period of two years, and was therefore liable to expire soon, a fact which the applicant ’ s representative stressed with his two memoranda, submitted on 16 July 2009 and 28 May 2010. However, adjournments took place on 13 November 2009, 5 March, 4 June, 17 September and 8 October 2010, until the case was finally heard on 10 December 2010. With the exception of the first adjournment, on which no information has been provided to the Court, it appears that the sole reason for those adjournments was the delay of the Administration in adducing their views on the additional grounds for annulment lodged by the applicant on 3 February 2010. The Court takes note of the Government ’ s argument that the applicant contributed significantly to the delays because she submitted additional grounds for annulment. It recalls however that it has consistently held that applicants cannot be blamed for making full use of the remedies available to them under domestic law (see Golha v. the Czech Republic, no. 7051/06, § 59, 26 May 2011). On the contrary, it is for the Contracting States to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts are able to guarantee the right of everyone to obtain a final decision on disputes concerning civil rights and obligations within a reasonable time (see Comingersoll S.A. v. Portugal [GC], no. 35382/97, § 24, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV, and Vassilios Athanasiou and Others, cited above, § 26)."

In this regard, the Court takes note of both parties ’ arguments relating to the above-mentioned legal provision. However, it reiterates that its task is not normally to review the relevant law and practice in abstracto, but to determine whether the manner in which they were applied to, or affected, the applicant gave rise to a violation of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, § 164, ECHR 2015, and N.C. v. Italy [GC], no. 24952/94, § 56, ECHR 2002 ‑ X)."

In the present case, the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the courts would decide, either favourably or unfavourably, on her application for annulment. However, by adjourning the case on multiple occasions, despite its imminent expiration, and subsequently by applying Article 32 § 2 of Presidential Decree no. 18/1989, the Administrative Court of Appeal evaded its obligation to provide an answer to the question submitted concerning the legality of the contested act, which constitutes the very heart of the jurisdictional function (see N.T.

The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 55, ECHR 1999-II, and Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, § 44, ECHR 1999-V)."

The Court reiterates that an interference must achieve a “fair balance” between the demands of the general interest and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights. The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole, and therefore also in its second paragraph. There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 75, ECHR 1999-III, and Immobiliare Saffi, cited above, § 49)."

The limitation on the applicant's right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions is not in itself open to criticism, particularly in view of the legitimate aim pursued and the margin of appreciation afforded by the second paragraph of Article 1. However, the risk with such a system is that it may unreasonably restrict an applicant's ability to deal with his possessions, particularly if the proceedings are protracted, as they were in the instant case in which they lasted fourteen years and eight months. The Government attributed the delays in the proceedings to the failure of the attempts to sell the applicant's house at auction and to the applicant's conduct.",
                "Thus, while it is true that several attempts were made, albeit unsuccessfully, to sell the applicant's house at auction (on unspecified dates in 1985 and 1991 and on 10 January 1995), the Court notes that the bankruptcy authorities failed to take the slightest action during the intervals of approximately six years (from 1985 to 1991) and four years (from 1991 to 10 January 1995) between successive sale attempts.",
                "As regards the applicant's conduct, the Court acknowledges that he sought a composition with the creditors (on an unspecified date), applied for a referral to the Constitutional Court (on 5 April 1996), applied for a stay of execution of the order for sale (on 17 April 1996) and appealed to the Court of Cassation (on 3 May 1996) against the refusal of a stay. However, it finds that those actions did not significantly slow down the bankruptcy proceedings because, apart from the request for a composition with the creditors (the date of which has not been given), all the applications were made in or after 1996 and were decided expeditiously by the courts concerned (for instance, the application for a referral to the Constitutional Court was decided within twelve days and the application for a stay of the order for sale within one day).",
                "Furthermore, the Court notes that there were periods of judicial inactivity, in particular, between 2 June 1989 and 15 May 1991 (approximately two years), 28 April 1992 and 4 July 1993 (approximately one year and two months) and 7 July 1997 and 25 September 1998 (approximately one year and two months).",
                "Consequently, the Court finds that there was no justification for restricting the applicant's right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions for the full duration of the proceedings, since, while in principle it will be necessary to deprive the bankrupt of the right to administer and deal with his or her possessions in order to achieve the aim pursued, the necessity will diminish with the passage of time.

The Government added that the bankrupt was in any event represented in court by the trustee in bankruptcy.

It reiterates that Article 6 § 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way it embodies the “right to a court”, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, pp. 17-18, §§ 35-36). This right extends only to disputes (“ contestation ”) over “civil rights and obligations ” which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law (see, inter alia, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, pp. 46-47, § 81, and Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, pp. 16-17, § 36)."

However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce a person's access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired; lastly, such limitations will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if they do not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Levages Prestations Services v. France, judgment of 23 October 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, p. 1543, § 40 )."

The Court considers that the purpose of the restriction on the applicant's capacity to take legal proceedings is to assign the role of representing the bankrupt in court in respect of issues arising over the bankrupt's pecuniary rights to the trustee in bankruptcy as, once the bankruptcy order has been lodged, he is responsible for the administration of the bankrupt's assets. Indeed, it is self-evident in the Court's view that disputes over such matters may have major repercussions on the assets and liabilities of the bankrupt estate. The Court consequently finds that the restriction is intended to protect the rights and interests of others, namely those of the bankrupt's creditors.

Further, it appears from the materials referred to above (see paragraph 19) that the trend may primarily refer to “insurable” personal injury, that is incidents arising out of ordinary road traffic accidents, rather than matters relating to the core area of State sovereignty such as the acts of a soldier on foreign territory which, of their very nature, may involve sensitive issues affecting diplomatic relations between States and national security. Certainly, it cannot be said that Ireland is alone in holding that immunity attaches to suits in respect of such torts committed by acta jure imperii or that, in affording this immunity, Ireland falls outside any currently accepted international standards. The Court agrees with the Supreme Court in the present case (see paragraph 15 above) that it is not possible, given the present state of the development of international law, to conclude that Irish law conflicts with its general principles."

At 11 p.m. on 4 March 1991, when off-duty, the applicant and two passengers, in a private car (described in subsequent police reports as a “jeep”) towing a van on a trailer, crossed from Northern Ireland into Ireland at a United Kingdom permanent vehicle checkpoint in County Derry. Precisely what occurred that night is disputed between the parties. It is not, however disputed that the applicant accidentally drove his car into the checkpoint barrier. The check-point was manned by armed British soldiers, one of whom, a corporal in the British Royal Military Police, approached the applicant after the accident. The Government contend that he asked the applicant to stop and was ignored. The applicant alleges that he did stop and that the soldier then waved him on. In any event, it would appear that the soldier moved towards the car and was hit by the vehicle being towed. He was thrown forward on to the tow-bar and dragged for a short distance until he managed to pull himself up into a standing position on the tow-bar. The applicant maintains that he was unaware of the soldier’s position and continued driving into Ireland. According to the report completed by the Irish Police in April 1991 following their investigation into the incident (see paragraph 9 below), the soldier fired six shots, one of which entered the car’s exhaust pipe, another of which went through the back windscreen and exited through the roof. The Government claim that some, at least, of these shots were fired in Northern Ireland. According to the applicant he heard the shots and, fearing a terrorist attack, continued driving until he reached a police station, where he considered he would be safe. He stopped the car about two miles from the border, in the village of Muff, in County Donegal, Ireland. According to the police report, at this stage the soldier, described by witnesses as in a state of “blind panic”, ordered the applicant and the two passengers to get out of the car and stand against the wall with their hands in the air. The applicant alleges that he turned to face the soldier, intending to explain that he was a police officer and that there was no cause for alarm. Again, according to the applicant, the soldier then aimed his gun at him and pulled the trigger twice, although the shots did not fire because the gun jammed."

The facts alleged by the applicant did not relate to any commercial activity, and it was not established that, as a principle of public international law, immunity no longer applied in respect of personal injuries caused by the tortious act of a foreign State’s servant or agent acting within the sphere of sovereign activity (“ de jure imperii ”).

In support of such submission, counsel for the plaintiff referred in particular to the United Kingdom State Immunity Act 1978; the Canadian State Immunity Act 1982; the Australian Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act 1985 and the European Convention on State Immunity 1972. ... The plaintiff relies on these statutes as indicative of a recognised principle of public international law. ... Distinction must be drawn between the provisions of legislation in a number of states and the provisions of public international law, and the principles set forth in individual state legislation cannot be regarded as establishing principles of public international law. The provisions of statutes cannot be used as evidence of what international law is: statutes are evidence of the domestic law in the individual states and not evidence of international law generally. Article 11 of the European Convention on State Immunity provides that:- ‘A Contracting Party cannot claim immunity from the jurisdiction of a court of another contracting party in proceedings which relate to redress for injury to the person or damage to tangible property, if the facts which occasioned the injury or damage occurred in the territory of the State of forum, and if the author of the injury or damage was present in that territory at the time when those facts occurred.’ I do not have to decide, in the circumstances of this case, whether the terms of the Convention are part of the domestic law of this State because even if it were, the plaintiff’s claim herein would fail by virtue of the terms of Article 31 of the said Convention, which provides that:- ‘Nothing in this Convention shall affect any immunities or privileges enjoyed by a Contracting Party in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by, or in relation to its armed forces when on the territory of another Contracting State.’ The terms of Article 31 recognise that, as a matter of international law, immunities and privileges in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by or in relation to armed forces, when on the territory of another Contracting State, exist. ... Despite the Herculean efforts of the plaintiff’s legal advisers in making available to the court copies of all relevant decisions, articles and draft Conventions, and the cogent arguments of counsel, I am not satisfied that it is a principle of public international law that the immunity granted to sovereign states should be restricted by making them liable in respect of tortious acts, committed on their behalf by their servant or agent, causing personal injuries to the person affected by such act or omission, when such act or omission is committed jure imperii and I would dismiss the appeal on this point ...”"

Further, it appears from the materials referred to above (see paragraph 19) that the trend may primarily refer to “insurable” personal injury, that is incidents arising out of ordinary road traffic accidents, rather than matters relating to the core area of State sovereignty such as the acts of a soldier on foreign territory which, of their very nature, may involve sensitive issues affecting diplomatic relations between States and national security. Certainly, it cannot be said that Ireland is alone in holding that immunity attaches to suits in respect of such torts committed by acta jure imperii or that, in affording this immunity, Ireland falls outside any currently accepted international standards.

It was prepared provisionally to accept that the Government were vicariously responsible for conduct that would qualify as torture under international law. However, international law could be used only to assist in interpreting lacunae or ambiguities in a statute, and when the terms of a statute were clear, the statute had to prevail over international law. The clear language of the 1978 Act bestowed immunity upon sovereign States for acts committed outside the jurisdiction and, by making express provision for exceptions, it excluded as a matter of construction implied exceptions. As a result, there was no room for an implied exception for acts of torture in section 1(1) of the 1978 Act. Moreover, the court was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the State of Kuwait was responsible for the threats made to the applicant after 17 May 1991.

Despite this, in what [counsel] for the Plaintiff acknowledges is a bold submission, he contends that that section must be read subject to the implication that the State is only granted immunity if it is acting within the Law of Nations. So that the section reads: ‘A State acting within the Law of Nations is immune from jurisdiction except as provided ...’",

The argument is ... that international law against torture is so fundamental that it is a jus cogens, or compelling law, which overrides all other principles of international law, including the well-established principles of sovereign immunity. No authority is cited for this proposition. ... At common law, a sovereign State could not be sued at all against its will in the courts of this country. The 1978 Act, by the exceptions therein set out, marks substantial inroads into this principle. It is inconceivable, it seems to me, that the draughtsman, who must have been well aware of the various international agreements about torture, intended section 1 to be subject to an overriding qualification.",

The courts in the United Kingdom are open to all who seek their help, whether they are British citizens or not. A vast number of people come to this country each year seeking refuge and asylum, and many of these allege that they have been tortured in the country whence they came. Some of these claims are no doubt justified, others are more doubtful. Those who are presently charged with the responsibility for deciding whether applicants are genuine refugees have a difficult enough task, but at least they know much of the background and surrounding circumstances against which the claim is made. The court would be in no such position. The foreign States would be unlikely to submit to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom court, and in its absence the court would have no means of testing the claim or making a just determination. ...”",

In the judgment it was emphasised, however, that in so far as any liability under the Convention might be incurred in such circumstances, it would be incurred by the expelling Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which had as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment (op. cit., pp. 35-36, § 91)."

Notwithstanding the special character of the prohibition of torture in international law, the Court is unable to discern in the international instruments, judicial authorities or other materials before it any firm basis for concluding that, as a matter of international law, a State no longer enjoys immunity from civil suit in the courts of another State where acts of torture are alleged.

The Court does not, however, find that either of these developments provides it with a firm basis on which to conclude that the immunity of States ratione personae is no longer enjoyed in respect of civil liability for claims of acts of torture, let alone that it was not enjoyed in 1996 at the time of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in the present case."

That criterion was “objective” and was applied without any examination of the merits of the appeal. Its purpose was to avoid legal aid being granted in cases where the appeal was manifestly bound to fail. Thus, in the instant case, the letters sent by the applicant to the Legal Aid Office showed that he intended to challenge the factual findings of the trial courts, an issue that could not be raised before the Court of Cassation. In short, the authorities who dealt with the applicant's application had not examined the merits of his appeal on points of law in detail, such that the circumstances of the present case were distinguishable from those in the case of Aerts v. Belgium (judgment of 30 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-V), in which similar bodies had ruled on the issue whether the applicant's appeal was “[currently] well-founded”. In addition, the Legal Aid Office was composed of judges, lawyers, civil servants and members of the public, thus avoiding any bias or risk of the applicant's being unfairly deprived of access to the Court of Cassation. That safeguard was reinforced by the fact that applicants for legal aid could appeal to the President of the Court of Cassation against decisions of the Legal Aid Office.",

Whilst Article 6 § 1 guarantees to litigants an effective right of access to the courts for the determination of their “civil rights and obligations”, it leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used towards this end and only compels the State to provide for the assistance of a lawyer when such assistance proves indispensable for an effective access to court either because legal representation is rendered compulsory or by reason of the complexity of the procedure or of the case (see the Airey v.

The applicant's conduct, particularly towards personnel from the child-welfare service, had been disturbing for his son and provided additional justification for the restrictions imposed on the applicant's right to contact in the child's best interest (as was attested by the conclusions of the psychiatric reports of 20 September 1993, 7 June 1994 and 12 November 1998)."

                "56. C. was taken into care in January 1992 by order of the children's judge on the ground that he was “at risk” in the “family home”. By a judgment of 12 February 1992, the children's judge placed C. and his brothers in the care of the ASE for a period of one year, holding in particular that “... the domestic situation is difficult and the children are in danger; ... their removal from home is necessary to enable relations with the father to become less conflictual and to make the children feel more secure by helping them to resolve their personal difficulties”. In a judgment of 23 March 1992, the Special Minors' Division of the Lyons Court of Appeal upheld all the provisions of that judgment. With regard to C.'s placement, it noted, inter alia : “... whatever the origin of the injuries, it [did] not appear that Mr Gnahoré offer[ed] the material and educative guarantees necessary to ensure the child's health and safety ...”",
                "The Court need only note that C. was taken into care shortly after the applicant was charged with wounding his son with intent and placed under court supervision. In view of the obviously paramount interest of protecting the child from a parent suspected of conduct of that sort, it considers that such a measure cannot be impugned under Article 8. The same reasoning applies to the suspension of the applicant's right to contact and to the restrictions imposed on that right during the relevant period.",

                "57. The judicial authorities justified the renewal of the care order on the ground that the father's “inability to tend to [ C.'s ] ... educative needs” disqualified him from having care of C. They found that his dominant personality was stifling the child's personality and putting his health and safety at risk (see the decision of the Special Minors' Division of the Lyons Court of Appeal of 10 May 1993, the judgment of the children's judge of 15 October 1993 and the decisions of the Special Minors' Division of the Lyons Court of Appeal of 24 January 1994 and 9 December 1996). They relied in their decisions on the reports of various experts who had reached the same conclusions (see the reports of 26 February 1993, September 1993 and 7 June 1994, and the psychiatric report of 12 November 1998 ). They also noted that the child was making “positive” progress in his foster home (see the judgment of 18 April 1995, the order of 12 July 1996 and the judgment of 10 July 1998 ). Lastly, the judgment of 9 December 1996 referred to the father's inability to tend to the child's material needs and the child's wish to stay in his foster home.",
                "Those were undoubtedly valid reasons for keeping the child in care and all the evidence indicates that the decisions were indeed taken in the interest of the child, which was paramount.",
                "The Court further notes that the children's judge did not confine himself to implementing the proposals of the experts who examined the father and the child: he met the applicant and heard evidence from him, had regard to the family environment in which C. had been brought up, monitored the child's progress in the foster home and listened to the views of the child and of the child-welfare service in charge."

                "58. Consequently, regard being had to their margin of appreciation, the authorities' view that it was necessary for the child to remain in care was not unreasonable. Article 8 of the Convention has not, therefore, been infringed on that account.",

                "59. The Court emphasises that in cases of this type the child's interest must come before all other considerations. However, when properly analysed, that interest is seen to comprise two limbs.",
                "On the one hand, the interest clearly entails ensuring that the child develops in a sound environment and that under no circumstances can a parent be entitled under Article 8 to have measures taken that would harm the child's health and development (see the Johansen judgment cited above, p. 1008, § 78, and E.P. v. Italy, no. 31127/96, § 62, 16 November 1999, unreported).",
                "On the other hand, it is clear that it is equally in the child's interest for its ties with its family to be maintained, except in cases where the family has proved particularly unfit, since severing those ties means cutting a child off from its roots. It follows that the interest of the child dictates that family ties may only be severed in very exceptional circumstances and that everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, if and when appropriate, to “rebuild” the family.",
                "In the interest not only of the parent concerned, but also of the child, the ultimate aim of any “care order” must be to “ reunit [e] the ... parent with his or her child” (see the following judgments: Olsson (no. 1) and Johansen, cited above, pp. 36-37, § 81, and pp. 1008-09, § 78, respectively; and E.P. v. Italy cited above, § 64). Indeed, that is the spirit of the provisions of the Civil Code (Articles 375 et seq.) governing the care order made in respect of the applicant's son and the measures relating to the applicant's right to contact: under Article 375-2 of the Civil Code and the case-law of the French courts a minor may be removed from his “present home” as part of an educative assistance measure only in exceptional circumstances."
            ],
            [
                "60. In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant and his son have been separated for more than eight years and that during that period contact between them has been very sporadic. Indeed, since June 1993 they have seen each other only three times.",
                "The result has been that the chances of their being reunited have diminished with the passage of time, despite the applicant's retaining parental authority and there apparently being no question of his forfeiting it. C. was taken into care at the age of 4 and is now 12 years old, having spent a large part of his childhood without any real contact with his father with the result that rebuilding the family unit would probably be too traumatic an experience for him to adjust to. In other words, a situation that should have been temporary has become permanent, thus creating an insurmountable obstacle to the reunion of the applicant with his son.",
                "The issue therefore is whether the authorities concerned can be held responsible for that situation. More particularly, what will be decisive is whether the national authorities have made such efforts to arrange the necessary preparations for reunion as can reasonably be demanded (see the following judgments: Olsson (no. 2) cited above, pp. 35-36, § 90; Hokkanen cited above, p. 22, § 58; and Ignaccolo-Zenide cited above, § 96)."
            ],
            [
                "61. In that connection, the Court notes that the applicant's right to contact was initially suspended pending the results of psychiatric reports on the child, on the ground that the child was disturbed at the thought of meeting his father (see the order of 16 June 1993) and subsequently on the ground that he did not wish to see him (see the order of 15 September 1993).",
                "Subsequently, by a judgment of 15 October 1993, the children's judge suspended the applicant's rights to contact for eighteen months (that is until 15 April 1995 ), on the ground that the aforementioned psychiatric report confirmed “the need for [C.] to be protected from the invasive presence of his father”. On appeal, the Special Minors' Division of the Lyons Court of Appeal appointed an expert, inter alia, to assess whether there should be contact between the applicant and his son and, if so, to make the necessary arrangements. It adjourned the examination of the case on this point (see the judgment of 24 January 1994 ). On 4 July 1994, relying on the conclusions of the report – which was lodged on 7 June 1994 –, the Special Minors' Division further adjourned its decision regarding contact until 10 October 1994 and invited the applicant to undergo psychotherapy, which he declined to do. It appears that, in a judgment of 24 November 1994, it upheld all the provisions of the judgment of 15 October 1993.",
                "Subsequently, the children's judge made contact conditional on arrangements being made for “joint counselling for the father and the child” (see the order of 12 July 1996 ). On appeal, the Special Minors' Division of the Lyons Court of Appeal ordered in connection with the investigative and educative counselling measure that “attempts should be made to arrange contact at a neutral location through a specialist counselling service” for one and a half hours every fortnight until 31 March 1997. It specified that “the [designated centre] may, in the event of serious incident, terminate the measure immediately, provided it informs the President of the Minors' Division without delay” (judgment of 9 December 1996 ). The applicant thus saw his son three times: in December 1996, January 1997 and March 1997.",
                "On 21 March 1997 the educative action centre sent a record of the visits to the Special Minors' Division, in which it concluded: “It does not appear desirable for the meetings between father and son to continue in these circumstances, since [C.] remains at risk when with his father, whose pathology makes it impossible for him to consider his son otherwise than as a part of himself, such that there is no room for the independent existence of this small boy.” In view of the applicant's behaviour, both the children's judge (on 2 December 1999 ) and the Director of the Children's Service of the Territorial Unit (in January 2000) turned down his requests for new visits to be arranged."
            ],
            [
                "62. Thus, as from July 1994, the authorities envisaged re-establishing contact between father and son and attempted to set a process in motion that would gradually allow the child's return home. However, they were thwarted in their attempts by the applicant's behaviour. The applicant refused to submit to the therapy ordered by the Special Minors' Division of the Lyons Court of Appeal, that being the only condition with which he had to comply for visits to resume. In the light of the reports of the experts appointed by the courts, the Division's reluctance to expose the child to visits which he would find disturbing is quite understandable. Furthermore, refusing to accept his son's placement even in principle, the applicant had flown into a rage on several occasions at the caseworkers of the body responsible for the child and for organising the visits and had generally shown himself disinclined to cooperate with it in arranging contact with his son. In that connection, the Court notes that, notwithstanding the applicant's refusal to undergo the therapy that had been recommended for him, the Special Minors' Division of the Lyons Court of Appeal ordered on 9 December 1996 that “attempts should be made to arrange contact at a neutral location” at regular intervals until 31 March 1997. The three visits which did take place went badly owing to the applicant's attitude and the authorities did not therefore renew the experience."
            ],
            [
                "63. The failure of the parent concerned to cooperate does not constitute an absolutely decisive factor (see the Olsson (no. 1) judgment cited above, pp. 36-37, §§ 81 and 83), since it does not relieve the authorities from the duty to implement such measures as will be apt to enable the family link to be maintained (see, mutatis mutandis, the Olsson (no. 2) judgment cited above, pp. 36-37, § 91). The Court is, however, bound to say that in the instant case the relevant authorities made genuine efforts to achieve that objective and the failure of the measures which they implemented to that end was due solely to the applicant's behaviour.",
                "Admittedly, it might be considered that, in order to facilitate the reunion of father and son, the authorities could have taken other initiatives and adopted other measures – they may still do so – such as appointing a mediator between themselves and the applicant as recommended in the expert's report of 7 June 1994. The fact that to date they have confined themselves to taking the measures described in paragraph 61 above does not, however, suffice to justify finding that they have infringed the rights guaranteed by Article 8. In that connection, the Court reiterates that it is not its role to substitute its assessment for that of the relevant national authorities regarding the measures which should have been taken. The authorities are in principle better placed to carry out such an assessment, in particular as they have direct knowledge of the context of each case and the parties concerned (including, in the instant case, C.).",
                "In these circumstances, and noting also that the authorities sought the child's view and had regard to his interest at all times, the Court cannot but conclude that the authorities took all the measures that could reasonably be demanded of them to facilitate the family's reunion.",

As the competent court had lacked jurisdiction to rehear the evidence and had therefore been unable to determine a crucial issue of fact, the Court found a violation of Article 6 on the ground that the central issue had not been determined by a tribunal that was independent of the parties.

It is beyond doubt that, in order to address that issue, the CSM had to exercise its discretionary powers. That authority has specific responsibility under the Constitution (see paragraph 70 above) for the autonomous management of the judiciary, and in particular for disciplinary matters concerning judges, with the wider aim of guaranteeing the independence of the justice system (see, mutatis mutandis, Tsanova ‑ Gecheva, cited above, § 100, regarding the power of the Bulgarian Supreme Judicial Council to appoint the President of a court). The Court therefore recognises the particular importance of the CSM ’ s responsibilities under the Constitution in a key area from the perspective of the rule of law and the separation of powers. As a body specifically set up to interpret and apply the rules governing the disciplinary conduct of judges, the CSM has the task of contributing to the smooth operation of the justice system. However, in the instant case, the assessment of the facts and the review of the disciplinary sanctions imposed did not require specialised knowledge or specific professional experience, but could have come within the jurisdiction of any court. This was not a classic exercise of administrative discretion in a specialised area of law (see, conversely, Sigma Radio Television Ltd, cited above, § 161)."

It considers, firstly, that the review of a decision imposing a disciplinary penalty differs from that of an administrative decision that does not entail such a punitive element. Secondly, it notes that the disciplinary proceedings in question concerned a judge. In that connection the Court stresses that, even if they do not come within the scope of Article 6 of the Convention under its criminal head, disciplinary penalties may nevertheless entail serious consequences for the lives and careers of judges. The accusations against the applicant were liable to result in her removal from office or suspension from duty, that is to say, in very serious penalties which carried a significant degree of stigma (see, mutatis mutandis, Grande Stevens and Others v. Italy, nos. 18640/10 and 4 others, § 122, 4 March 2014). In accordance with the general principles set forth above and taking into account the policy objectives pursued by the legislation in this sphere (see paragraph 180 above), the Court considers that the judicial review carried out must be appropriate to the subject-matter of the dispute, that is to say, in the instant case, to the disciplinary nature of the administrative decisions in question. This consideration applies with even greater force to disciplinary proceedings against judges, who must enjoy the respect that is necessary for the performance of their duties. When a member State initiates such disciplinary proceedings, public confidence in the functioning and independence of the judiciary is at stake; in a democratic State, this confidence guarantees the very existence of the rule of law. Furthermore, the Court has stressed the growing importance attached to the separation of powers and to the necessity of safeguarding the independence of the judiciary (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, § 34, Series A no. 313; Kudeshkina v. Russia, no. 29492/05, § 86, 26 February 2009; and Stafford, § 78; Kleyn, § 193; and Baka, § 165, all cited above).",

Hence, any appeal will be aimed at obtaining a declaration that the impugned act is null and void or non - existent, rather than a fresh assessment of the criteria employed by the administrative body or of the question whether those criteria were applied correctly, with particular regard to the establishment of the key facts ... The position taken by the Judicial Division is that, although the Supreme Court has the power to assess and sanction a failure to take necessary and relevant steps in disciplinary proceedings, it cannot take the place of the competent administrative body – the CSM – in gathering the evidence ( aquisição da matéria instrutória ) or establishing the key facts. Its task is solely to set aside the impugned decision, if appropriate, in order for that body to carry out or order a particular investigative measure in the proceedings and re ‑ examine the case accordingly ...",

The Supreme Court may only assess the reasonable and coherent nature of the relationship between the facts as established by the authority [whose decision is contested] and the evidence on which its decision was based ...",

In other words, it is not the task of the Supreme Court to deliver a fresh judgment after assessing the evidence, but solely to verify whether the evidence was valid and lawful and whether the facts were reasonably and coherently established.

The content and scope of the “case” referred to the Grand Chamber are therefore delimited by the Chamber ’ s decision on admissibility (see K. and T. v.

Cyprus [GC], no. 56679/00, § 32, ECHR 2004-III). This means that the Grand Chamber must examine the case in its entirety in so far as it has been declared admissible; it cannot, however, examine those parts of the application which have been declared inadmissible by the Chamber.

Thus, even at the merits stage the Court may reconsider a decision to declare an application admissible if it concludes that it should have been declared inadmissible for one of the reasons given in the first three paragraphs of Article 35 of the Convention (see Blečić v.

                "“39. The six-month time-limit provided for by Article 35 § 1 has a number of aims. Its primary purpose is to maintain legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are examined within a reasonable time, and to prevent the authorities and other persons concerned from being kept in a state of uncertainty for a long period of time (see P.M. v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 6638/03, 24 August 2004). It also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised (see O ’ Loughlin and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 23274/04, 25 August 2005) and facilitates the establishment of facts in a case, since with the passage of time, any fair examination of the issues raised is rendered problematic (see Nee v. Ireland ( dec. ), no. 52787/99, 30 January 2003).",
                "40. That rule marks out the temporal limit of the supervision exercised by the Court and signals, both to individuals and State authorities, the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see Walker v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 34979/97, ECHR 2000 ‑ I). The existence of such a time-limit is justified by the wish of the High Contracting Parties to prevent past judgments being constantly called into question and constitutes a legitimate concern for order, stability and peace (see De Becker v. Belgium ( dec. ), no. 214/56, 9 June 1958).",
                "41. Article 35 § 1 contains an autonomous rule which has to be interpreted and applied in such a manner as to ensure to any applicant claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the Contracting Parties of one of the rights set forth in the Convention and its Protocols the effective exercise of the right of individual petition pursuant to Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (see Worm v. Austria ( dec. ), no. 22714/93, 27 November 1995).",
                "42. The Court reiterates that with regard to procedure and time-limits, legal certainty constitutes a binding requirement which ensures the equality of litigants before the law. That principle is implicit in all the Convention ’ s Articles and constitutes one of the fundamental elements of the rule of law (see, among other authorities, Beian v. Romania (no. 1), no. 30658/05, § 39, ECHR 2007 ‑ V (extracts)).”"

As regards complaints that were not included in the initial communication, the running of the six-month period is not interrupted until the date when such complaints are first submitted to the Court (see Allan, cited above)."

Greece ( dec. ), no. 41867/98, 15 June 2000; Ekimdjiev v. Bulgaria ( dec. ), no. 47092/99, 3 March 2005; and Majski v. Croatia, no. 33593/03, § 34, 1 June 2006). The Court reiterates that the principle ne eat judex ultra et extra petita partium (“not beyond the request”) is one of the fundamental principles of procedure under international and domestic (civil and administrative) law, it being understood that the petitum is the complaint submitted by the applicant. It follows that the scope of a case “referred to” the Court in the exercise of the right of individual application is determined by the applicant ’ s complaint or “claim” (see Radomilja and Others, cited above, §§ 108-09 and 120-22). Allegations made after the expiry of the six-month time-limit can only be examined by the Court if they constitute legal submissions relating to, or particular aspects of, the initial complaints that were introduced within the time-limit (see Kurnaz and Others v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 36672/97, 7 December 2004; Sâmbata Bihor Greco-Catholic Parish v. Romania ( dec. ), no. 48107/99, 25 May 2004; and Fábián, cited above, § 94).",

In the course of that review it could verify the validity of the evidence, whether the facts had been adequately and coherently established, and whether the penalty imposed had been reasonable and proportionate.

For that reason, in the Chamber ’ s view, the case was to be likened to situations in which the national courts had been unable or had refused to examine a key issue in the dispute because they had considered themselves bound by the findings of fact or of law made by the administrative authorities and could not examine the relevant issues independently. In the instant case the Supreme Court had confined itself to conducting a review of lawfulness with regard to the establishment of the facts and had thus not properly addressed important arguments advanced by the applicant concerning questions of fact that were crucial to the disciplinary proceedings against her.",

The Chamber concluded from this that the Supreme Court adopted a restrictive approach to the extent of its own jurisdiction to review the disciplinary activities of the CSM, and that the review carried out in the cases concerning the applicant had therefore been insufficient."

The protection of the applicant ’ s dignity had not been an issue, as she herself had requested a public hearing. Moreover, the reasons given by the Supreme Court had been insufficient to justify the refusal to examine the witness whom the applicant wished to have called and whose evidence, in the Chamber ’ s view, had been relevant to the case. That refusal had led ultimately to a limitation of the applicant ’ s ability to defend her case and had undermined the transparency which that procedural act would have lent to the disciplinary proceedings against her.",

It further noted that the facts had been contested and that the penalties which the applicant had been liable to incur carried a significant degree of stigma and were likely to adversely affect her professional honour and reputation. Accordingly, a public hearing, open and accessible to the applicant, had been necessary in the present case.",

Referring to the case of Oleksandr Volkov (cited above, §§ 92-95), they maintained that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had not related to a criminal charge. Reiterating essentially their submissions to the Chamber, the Government stressed that the above-mentioned proceedings had been administrative in nature and that the offences in question related to a breach of professional obligations and were not criminal in character.

Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, §§ 104-05, ECHR 2016, and Paluda v. Slovakia, no. 33392/12, §§ 33-34, 23 May 2017 ).",

Belgium, 10 February 1983, § 30, Series A no. 58), and given the scope of the applicant ’ s complaints under Article 6 § 3 (a) and (b), the Grand Chamber considers, unlike the Chamber, that it should assess whether the above-mentioned Article is also applicable under its criminal head."

                "122. The Court reiterates that the concept of a “criminal charge” in Article 6 § 1 is an autonomous one. The Court ’ s established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the “Engel criteria”, to be considered in determining whether or not there was a “criminal charge” (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 82, Series A no. 22). The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative, and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, among other authorities, Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, § 30-31, ECHR 2006-XIV, and Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § 82, ECHR 2003-X). The fact that an offence is not punishable by imprisonment is not by itself decisive for the purposes of the applicability of the criminal limb of Article 6 of the Convention since, as the Court has stressed on numerous occasions, the relative lack of seriousness of the penalty at stake cannot deprive an offence of its inherently criminal character (see Nicoleta Gheorghe v. Romania, no. 23470/05, § 26, 3 April 2012)."

In the present case, as regards the first of the Engel criteria – the domestic classification of the offences – the Court observes that the administrative instruments applied in the context of the proceedings in question form part of the disciplinary rules applicable to judges (see, mutatis mutandis, Moullet, cited above). The fact that these are applied, as appropriate, in conjunction with the provisions of the Criminal Code or the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 71 and 72 above) does not alter this finding. Furthermore, the proceedings were conducted by a management and disciplinary body – the CSM – subject to the subsequent supervision of the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court, and neither the prosecuting authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Brown, cited above ) nor the criminal courts were involved in determining the cases (see, mutatis mutandis, Müller- Hartburg, cited above, § 43)."

As to the second criterion – the very nature of the offence – the Court observes that the statutory provisions authorising the imposition of penalties were not aimed at the public in general but at a specific category, namely judges. Such provisions are designed to protect the profession ’ s honour and reputation and to maintain public trust in the judiciary (see, mutatis mutandis, Müller- Hartburg, cited above, § 45). Hence, the offences of which the applicant was accused were purely disciplinary rather than criminal in nature."

With regard to the third criterion – the degree of severity of the penalty – the Court notes that all the sanctions that the applicant could have incurred are purely disciplinary in nature (see, mutatis mutandis, Moullet, cited above, and Müller- Hartburg, cited above, § 47). Although the amount of the fine may be substantial and it is therefore punitive in nature, in the present case the severity of the sanction in itself does not bring the offence into the criminal sphere (see Müller- Hartburg, cited above, § 47)."

In that case the Court found as follows:",

                "159. In Oleksandr Volkov, in addition to the fact that the judges of the Higher Administrative Court were under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Ukrainian High Council of Justice, a number of serious issues had been identified. These problems related firstly to structural shortcomings in the procedure before the HCJ, notably the inclusion of the Minister of Justice and of the Prosecutor General as ex officio members of that body and the fact that the great majority of its non-judicial members were appointed directly by the executive and legislative authorities. Secondly, the Court took into account the appearance of bias on the part of some members of the HCJ who had determined the applicant ’ s case. It observed that the members of the Ukrainian HCJ who had carried out the preliminary inquiries in the applicant ’ s case and submitted requests for his dismissal had subsequently taken part in the decisions to remove him from office. Moreover, one of them had been appointed President of the HCJ and had presided over the hearing of the applicant ’ s case. The Court therefore found that the proceedings before the HCJ had been incompatible with the principles of independence and impartiality set forth in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 117). The subsequent determination of the applicant ’ s case by Parliament, the legislative body, had not remedied the structural defects of a lack of “independence and impartiality” but rather had served to contribute to the politicisation of the procedure and to aggravate the inconsistency of the procedure with the principle of the separation of powers (ibid., § 118). In those circumstances, according to the Court ’ s case-law, it was extremely important for the Ukrainian Higher Administrative Court to afford the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention in order to be able to remedy any lack of independence and impartiality."

It also takes note of the reasons that prompted the Portuguese legislative authorities to choose the current system whereby jurisdiction over appeals against decisions of the CSM is assigned to the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court, reasons that have been endorsed on several occasions by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 82 above)."

Furthermore, it goes without saying that the fact that judges are subject to the law in general, and to the rules of professional discipline and ethics in particular, cannot cast doubt on their impartiality. As noted by the Government and not disputed by the applicant, the judges of the Supreme Court, who are highly qualified and often in the final stages of their careers, are no longer subject to performance appraisals or in search of promotion, and the CSM ’ s disciplinary authority over them is in reality rather theoretical (see paragraph 142 above). The Court also notes the absence of any specific evidence of a lack of impartiality, such as, for instance, the existence of pending disciplinary proceedings against one of the members of the benches that examined the applicant ’ s appeals. In more general terms the Court considers it normal that judges, in the performance of their judicial duties and in various contexts, should have to examine a variety of cases in the knowledge that they may themselves, at some point in their careers, be in a similar position to one of the parties, including the defendant. However, a purely abstract risk of this kind cannot be regarded as apt to cast doubt on the impartiality of a judge in the absence of specific circumstances pertaining to his or her individual situation. Even in the context of disciplinary cases a theoretical risk of this nature, consisting in the fact that judges hearing cases are themselves still subject to a set of disciplinary rules, is not in itself a sufficient basis for finding a breach of the requirements of impartiality."

There was no possibility of effectively re-examining the establishment of the facts, which, in her submission, had been established by the CSM on the basis of insufficient evidence. Likewise, the Supreme Court had not carried out a proper assessment of her disciplinary conduct. Lastly, with regard to the disciplinary penalties imposed, despite finding that it was empowered to examine the severity of each penalty, the Supreme Court had in reality omitted to examine this point on account of the wide discretion afforded to the administrative authorities. While it was true that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention did not guarantee a right of appeal, she had not had access to any level of jurisdiction, as a single administrative entity had been responsible for establishing the facts and determining the disciplinary penalty.

Proceedings conducted in that way cannot in principle be regarded as compatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, for example, Diennet and Göç, cited above): other than in wholly exceptional circumstances, litigants must at least have the opportunity of requesting a public hearing, though the court may refuse the request and hold the hearing in private on account of the circumstances of the case and for the aforementioned reasons.”"

The subject-matter of the impugned decisions of the CSM (see paragraph 179 (a) above), which the applicant challenged by means of special administrative actions ( ação administrativa especial, see paragraphs 64 and 80 above) as they existed under Portuguese law at the relevant time, was the issue whether the applicant had breached her professional obligations. It is beyond doubt that, in order to address that issue, the CSM had to exercise its discretionary powers. That authority has specific responsibility under the Constitution (see paragraph 70 above) for the autonomous management of the judiciary, and in particular for disciplinary matters concerning judges, with the wider aim of guaranteeing the independence of the justice system (see, mutatis mutandis, Tsanova ‑ Gecheva, cited above, § 100, regarding the power of the Bulgarian Supreme Judicial Council to appoint the President of a court). The Court therefore recognises the particular importance of the CSM ’ s responsibilities under the Constitution in a key area from the perspective of the rule of law and the separation of powers. As a body specifically set up to interpret and apply the rules governing the disciplinary conduct of judges, the CSM has the task of contributing to the smooth operation of the justice system. However, in the instant case, the assessment of the facts and the review of the disciplinary sanctions imposed did not require specialised knowledge or specific professional experience, but could have come within the jurisdiction of any court. This was not a classic exercise of administrative discretion in a specialised area of law (see, conversely, Sigma Radio Television Ltd, cited above, § 161)."

            [
                "196. The Court further observes that the CSM ’ s decisions were challenged by means of administrative-law appeals to the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court. It considers, firstly, that the review of a decision imposing a disciplinary penalty differs from that of an administrative decision that does not entail such a punitive element. Secondly, it notes that the disciplinary proceedings in question concerned a judge. In that connection the Court stresses that, even if they do not come within the scope of Article 6 of the Convention under its criminal head, disciplinary penalties may nevertheless entail serious consequences for the lives and careers of judges. The accusations against the applicant were liable to result in her removal from office or suspension from duty, that is to say, in very serious penalties which carried a significant degree of stigma (see, mutatis mutandis, Grande Stevens and Others v. Italy, nos. 18640/10 and 4 others, § 122, 4 March 2014). In accordance with the general principles set forth above and taking into account the policy objectives pursued by the legislation in this sphere (see paragraph 180 above), the Court considers that the judicial review carried out must be appropriate to the subject-matter of the dispute, that is to say, in the instant case, to the disciplinary nature of the administrative decisions in question. This consideration applies with even greater force to disciplinary proceedings against judges, who must enjoy the respect that is necessary for the performance of their duties. When a member State initiates such disciplinary proceedings, public confidence in the functioning and independence of the judiciary is at stake; in a democratic State, this confidence guarantees the very existence of the rule of law. Furthermore, the Court has stressed the growing importance attached to the separation of powers and to the necessity of safeguarding the independence of the judiciary (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, § 34, Series A no. 313; Kudeshkina v. Russia, no. 29492/05, § 86, 26 February 2009; and Stafford, § 78; Kleyn, § 193; and Baka, § 165, all cited above).",

As to the procedural safeguards applied by that body, the Court is prepared to accept that, as the Government argued, the proceedings conducted in the present case afforded the applicant the opportunity to mount a defence. The applicant was notified of the indictment drawn up by the judicial investigator (see paragraphs 16, 19, 37 and 52 above) and filed defence pleadings (see paragraphs 17, 21, 37 and 53 above). She was also able to consult the final report and had a period of time in which to submit possible observations, although these were examined by the same judicial investigator (see paragraphs 17, 39 and 57 above)."

Firstly, as the Government acknowledged, the CSM is not authorised by law to hold public hearings, and, secondly, in the third set of proceedings it refused the applicant ’ s request for such a hearing on the grounds, inter alia, that there was no legal basis for the case to be heard in public before the CSM sitting in plenary (see paragraph 56 above). Furthermore, the applicant did not have an opportunity to make oral representations, either on the factual issues and the penalties or on the various legal issues. Likewise, the plenary formation of the CSM did not hear any evidence from witnesses, although it was not only the applicant ’ s credibility that was at stake but also that of crucial witnesses, in particular the judicial inspector H.G. and the judicial investigator F.M.J.

Thus, the Court must take into account, firstly, the issues covered by the review carried out by the competent domestic court and, secondly, the method of review adopted by the latter, while addressing the question of the right to a hearing.

It considers that the establishment of the facts is especially important in the case of proceedings that entail the imposition of penalties, and in particular disciplinary penalties against judges, as the latter must enjoy the respect that is necessary for the performance of their duties, so as to ensure public confidence in the functioning and independence of the judiciary as such (see paragraph 196 above).",

In that regard it should be noted that the establishment of the facts had been the subject of disagreement among the members of the CSM (see paragraph 26 above). Like the Chamber, the Grand Chamber regards these facts as “decisive”. The accusations against the applicant were liable to result in her removal from office or suspension from duty, that is to say, in very serious penalties which carried a significant degree of stigma (see paragraph 196 above) and which were apt to have irreversible repercussions on her life and career.

The present application poses the fundamental question of what legal effect must be given – in implementing Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001, and in particular in determining the non-pecuniary damage arising out of the breach of the reasonable length of proceedings requirement – to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, whether considered generally as interpretative guidelines which the said Court has laid down with regard to the consequences of the said violation, or with reference to a specific case in which the European Court has already had occasion to give a judgment on the delay in reaching a decision. ...",
                "As stipulated in section 2 ( 1 ) of the said Law, the legal fact which gives rise to the right to the just satisfaction that it provides for is constituted by the ‘ violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, on account of a failure to comply with the “ reasonable time ” requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention ’. In other words, Law no. 89/2001 identifies the fact constituting the right to compensation by reference to a specific provision of the European Convention on Human Rights. This Convention instituted a Court (the European Court of Human Rights, with its seat in Strasbourg ) to ensure compliance with the provisions contained therein (Article 19). Accordingly, the competence of the said Court to determine, and therefore to interpret, the significance of the said provisions must be recognised.",
                "As the fact constituting the right conferred by Law no. 89/2001 consists of a violation of the Convention, it is for the Strasbourg Court to determine all the elements of such a legal fact, which thus ends by being ‘ brought into conformity ’ by the Court, whose case-law is binding on the Italian courts in so far as the application of Law no. 89/2001 is concerned.",
                "It is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between the Convention and the internal judicial system, which the Advocate-General [ Procuratore Generale ] has amply discussed in court. Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of the Convention in the context of the sources of domestic law, it is certain that the direct implementation in the Italian judicial system of a provision of the Convention, established by Law no. 89/2001 (that is, by Article 6 § 1 in the part relating to ‘ reasonable time ’ ), cannot diverge from the interpretation which the European Court gives to the same provision.",
                "The opposite argument, which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to Law no. 89/2001 in the national system and the interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court to the right to the reasonable length of proceedings, would deprive the said Law no. 89/2001 of any justification and cause the Italian State to violate Article 1 of the Convention, according to which ‘ The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention ’ (including the said Article 6, which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable time).",
                "The reason behind the enactment of Law no. 89/2001 was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings, so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of the Strasbourg Court, expressly provided for by the Convention (Article 35: ‘ The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted ... ’ ). The European system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity. From it derives the duty of the States which have ratified the Convention to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by the Convention, above all in their own internal order and vis-à-vis the organs of the national judicial system. And this protection must be ‘ effective ’ (Article 13 of the Convention ), that is, of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to the Strasbourg Court.",
                "The domestic remedy introduced by Law no. 89/2001 did not previously exist in the Italian system, with the consequence that applications against Italy in respect of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention had ‘ clogged ’ (the term used by rapporteur Follieri in the sitting of the Senate of 28 September 2000) the European Court. The Strasbourg Court observed, prior to Law no. 89/2001, that the said failures on the part of Italy to comply ‘ reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy. This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention ’ ( see the four judgments of the Court delivered on 28 July 1999 in Bottazzi, Di Mauro, Ferrari and A.P .).",
                "Law no. 89/2001 constitutes the domestic remedy to which a ‘ victim of a violation ’ ( as defined by Article 34 of the Convention) of Article 6 (failure to comply with the reasonable - time requirement ) must have recourse before applying to the European Court to claim the ‘ just satisfaction ’ provided for in Article 41 of the Convention, which, when the violation exists, is only awarded by the Court ‘ if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made ’. Law no. 89/2001 has therefore allowed the European Court to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it ( including before the Act was passed) and aimed at obtaining the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the Convention for the excessive length of proceedings ( see Brusco v. Italy, decision of 6 September 2001).",
                "This mechanism for implementation of the Convention and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of the European Court of Strasbourg does not operate, however, in cases in which the Court holds that the consequences of the established violation of the Convention have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only ‘ partially ’, because in such an event the said Article 41 provides for the intervention of the European Court to protect the ‘ victim of the violation ’. In such cases an individual application to the Strasbourg Court on the basis of Article 34 of the Convention is admissible ( see Scordino v. Italy, decision of 27 March 2003 ) and the Court acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law.",
                "The judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is, obviously, the European Court, whose duty it is to apply Article 41 of the Convention to ascertain whether, in the presence of a violation of a provision of the Convention, the internal law has been able to redress fully the consequences of this violation.",
                "The argument whereby, in applying Law no. 89/2001, the Italian courts may follow a different interpretation from that which the European Court has given to the provisions of Article 6 of the Convention ( violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law) implies that the victim of the violation, if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by the European Court, must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the Convention from the latter Court. This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in Italian law by Law no. 89/2001 and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of the Strasbourg Court.",
                "It is therefore necessary to concur with the European Court of Human Rights, which, in the above-mentioned decision on the Scordino application ( concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the Italian courts in implementing Law no. 89/2001), affirmed that ‘ it follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must, where possible, interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention ’.",
                "... The preparatory documents of Law no. 89/2001 are even more explicit. In the report concerning the bill of Senator Pinto (proceedings of the Senate no. 3 813 of 16 February 1999) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative (and then adopted by the Act) secures for the applicant ‘ a protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court ’, as the direct reference to Article 6 of the Convention makes it possible to transfer to domestic level ‘ the limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level, limits which depend essentially on the State and on the development of the case-law of the Strasbourg authorities, especially that of the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits ’.",
                "6. The considerations expounded in sections 3 to 5 of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of the European Court on the implementation of Law no. 89/2001 with regard to reparation for non-pecuniary damage.",
                "In this particular instance, however, any possibility for the national court to exclude non-pecuniary damage (despite having found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention) must be considered as non-existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of the European Court which, with reference to the same proceedings, had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non-pecuniary damage for the applicant, which the Court itself redressed for a limited period. From such a decision of the European Court it follows that, once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision, the applicant has continued to suffer non-pecuniary damage, which must be compensated for in application of Law no. 89/2001.",
                "It cannot therefore be maintained – as the Rome Court of Appeal has done – that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question. Such reasoning, apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that the European Court has already ruled that non-pecuniary damage had been sustained because of a delay in the same action, is in any case incorrect, because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non- compliance with reasonable time - limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non-pecuniary damage, given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it.",

Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 35, ECHR 2004-IX). The Court has reaffirmed this principle in Broniowski ( cited above, § 182), in the context of the country ’ s transition towards a democratic regime, and has specified that rules regulating ownership relations within the country “ involving a wide-reaching but controversial legislative scheme with significant economic impact for the country as a whole ” could involve decisions restricting compensation for the taking or restitution of property to a level below its market value. The Court has also reiterated these principles regarding the enactment of laws in “ the exceptional context of German reunification ” ( see Von Maltzan and Others v. Germany (dec.)

It will, in particular, be easier for the domestic courts to refer to the amounts awarded at domestic level for other types of damage – personal injury, damage relating to a relative ’ s death or damage in defamation cases, for example – and rely on their innermost conviction, even if that results in awards of amounts that are lower than those fixed by the Court in similar cases."

It might appear paradoxical that, by imposing various taxes – payable prior to the lodging of an application or after the decision – the State takes away with one hand what it has awarded with the other to repair a breach of the Convention. Nor should the costs be excessive and constitute an unreasonable restriction on the right to lodge such an application and thus an infringement of the right of access to a tribunal.

Emphasising that the improvement of remedies at national level, particularly in respect of repetitive cases, should also contribute to reducing the workload of the Court, the Committee of Ministers recommended that member States review, following Court judgments which point to structural or general deficiencies in national law or practice, the effectiveness of the existing domestic remedies and, “where necessary, set up effective remedies, in order to avoid repetitive cases being brought before the Court”."

Furthermore, the measures taken must be such as to remedy the systemic defect underlying the Court ’ s finding of a violation, so that the system established by the Convention is not compromised by a large number of applications arising out of the same cause. Such measures must therefore include a mechanism for providing injured persons with compensation for the violation of the Convention established in the present judgment concerning the applicants.

The Government admitted that the judgment had not been enforced in a timely manner, as the enforcement had taken place six years and one month after it had become final and enforceable.

In particular, he had not submitted the warrant of execution to the bailiffs'service until 28 April 2002, that is two years and four months after the judgment of 17 December 1999 came into effect.

However, the subsequent delay, which started on 25 March 2003, when the domestic court of last instance reversed the decision of 8 January 2003 to discontinue the enforcement proceedings, and continued until the enforcement of the judgment in January 2006, was again attributable to the applicant since he had failed to re - apply for the warrant of execution necessary to proceed with the enforcement.

However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 (see Burdov v.

                "33. As regards the conduct of the parties, the Court observes that the State authorities were aware of the applicant's claim, and that as soon as the judgment in the applicant's favour came into effect it was incumbent on them to comply with it. It is true that the enforcement proceedings were initiated by the applicant after a delay (see paragraph 11 above ). However, the applicant cannot be considered responsible, since the court would not have issued him with a warrant of execution until 28 April 2002 in any event. As soon as the applicant had obtained the warrant, he lodged it with the bailiffs'service. As to the Government's allegation regarding the applicant's failure to re-apply for a warrant of execution after the decision of 8 January 2003 to discontinue the enforcement proceedings was quashed on appeal, the national legislation did not, in fact, require the applicant to take any action since the resumption of the enforcement proceedings was within the bailiff service's responsibility. In any event, as has emerged from the materials before the Court, the only reason for the non- compliance was the authorities'reluctance to act in accordance with the order of the court (see paragraph 10 above ). Therefore, whether the bailiffs were involved in the enforcement proceedings or not did not change the situation. Moreover, a person who has obtained an enforceable judgment against the State as a result of successful litigation cannot be required to resort to enforcement proceedings in order to have it executed (see Metaxas v. Greece, no. 8415/02, § 19, 27 May 2004; Gorokhov and Rusyayev v. Russia, cited above, § 33; Koltsov v. Russia, no. 41304/02, § 16, 24 February 2005; and Petrushko v. Russia, no. 36494/02, § 18, 24 February 2005 ). The Court therefore concludes that the whole period between 27 December 1999, when the judgment of 17 December 1999 became final and enforceable, and 19 January 2006, when the water supply company finally removed the obstacles which had prevented the applicant from operating his saw-mill, should be considered as a delay in execution for which the State authorities are responsible."

That compensation was sufficient to debar the applicant from continuing to claim to be the victim of a violation (if any) of his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.

He also emphasised that it had never been his wish to give up the property in question in return for compensation and that in any event the amount of the proposed compensation was derisory in view of the value of the house.

It is the settled case-law of the Court that the word “victim” in the context of Article 34 of the Convention denotes the person directly affected by the act or omission in issue, the existence of a violation of the Convention being conceivable even in the absence of prejudice; prejudice is relevant only in the context of Article 41. Consequently, a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a “victim” unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see, among other authorities, the Lüdi v. Switzerland judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 18, § 34).",

Although the decisions already delivered in the course of those proceedings – which are not in themselves the subject of complaint before the Court – tend somewhat to ameliorate the applicant’s position by returning part of the house in question to him and compensating him for the part not returned, and although it is not impossible that the applicant’s claim to have the whole house returned to him may eventually succeed, the fact remains that the basis of those proceedings was precisely the situation created by the Supreme Court of Justice’s judgment, namely the acceptance that the house had become State property again. As a result, those proceedings cannot in any event entirely efface the consequences of the Supreme Court of Justice’s judgment for the applicant’s enjoyment of his right of property, since if the house is returned to him this will be done under different legal provisions from those underlying the complaint now before the Court.",

The applicant may unquestionably claim to be a victim owing to the quashing of a judicial decision which was in his favour – a decision which had become final – and to the ruling that the courts had no jurisdiction to entertain actions for recovery of possession such as the one he had brought. It remained impossible to bring actions for recovery of possession before the courts for several years.",

The Court recalls that in determining whether there has been a deprivation of possessions within the second “rule”, it is necessary not only to consider whether there has been a formal taking or expropriation of property but to look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of. Since the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are “practical and effective”, it has to be ascertained whether the situation amounted to a de facto expropriation (see the Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, pp. 24-25, § 63, and the Vasilescu judgment cited above, p. 1078, § 51)."

The Court notes that, in the present case, the judgment of the Court of First Instance, ordering the administrative authorities to return the house to the applicant, became final and irrevocable and that, in compliance with the judgment, the mayor of Bucharest ordered the house to be returned to the applicant, an order which was given effect by the C. company in May 1994. The Court further notes that, as of that date, the applicant ceased to pay rent on the flat he was occupying in the house and that from April 1994 until April 1996 the applicant paid land tax on the house. The Court observes that the effect of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice was to deprive the applicant of all the fruits of the final judgment in his favour by holding that the State had demonstrated its title to the house under the nationalisation decree. Following that decision, the applicant was informed that the house would again be classified as State property with effect from April 1996. In consequence of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice, the applicant was accordingly deprived of the rights of ownership of the house which had been vested in him by virtue of the final judgment in his favour. In particular, he was no longer able to sell, devise, donate or otherwise dispose of the property. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the effect of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice was to deprive the applicant of his possessions within the meaning of the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Moreover, any interference with the property must also satisfy the requirement of proportionality. As the Court has repeatedly stated, a fair balance must be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights, the search for such a fair balance being inherent in the whole of the Convention. The Court further recalls that the requisite balance will not be struck where the person concerned bears an individual and excessive burden (see the Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment cited above, pp. 26-28, §§ 69-74)."

The court considered that the agreement between the parties of 20 August 1997 (on which the earlier determination of the outstanding arrears had been based) was to be considered in law as a contract of supply. However, it had not contained all the elements required for such a contract and thus had to be declared invalid.

Following the examination of a request for reopening of a case on the basis of newly- discovered circumstances, a court has the following options: to uphold the judgment ( decision ) which the claimant has sought to have reviewed; to quash it; or to amend it.

More specifically, it must be determined, under the objective test, whether, quite apart from the judges ’ personal conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to their impartiality (see Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98 et seq., § 191, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI)."

In its report of 31 August 1998 that taskforce stated a need for verification of the amount of arrears. Subsequently, on 14 September 1998, the First Deputy Prime Minister instructed certain ministries and State agencies to undertake an audit with a view to verifying the amount of the debt. As a result, in its report of 15 April 2000, the Lugansk Regional Audit Department concluded that the HAC ’ s findings in its ruling of 2 July 1998 concerning the outstanding debt owed to the applicant company had been wrong and in contradiction of the applicable legislation, and that LyNOS ’ s debt was in fact equal to UAH 36,401,894, instead of UAH 216,150,544 as had been established on 2 July 1998. LyNOS relied on that conclusion as a newly-discovered circumstance warranting revision by the courts of the previously established amount of debt, and its application for review was granted. As result, the courts reconsidered and reduced the finally established debt of UAH 216,150,544 to UAH 97,406,920 and subsequently to UAH 90,983,077 (see, in particular, paragraphs 41 and 77 above)."

                "46. Although there is in principle no right under the Convention to hold a public post entailing the administration of justice (see Dzhidzheva ‑ Trendafilova v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 12628/09, § 38, 9 October 2012, and Harabin v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 62584/00, 29 June 2004), such a right may exist at the domestic level. In Regner ( cited above ) the Court reiterated that there can be no doubt about the fact that there is a right within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 where a substantive right recognised in domestic law is accompanied by a procedural right to have that right enforced through the courts. The mere fact that the wording of a legal provision affords an element of discretion does not in itself rule out the existence of a right. Indeed, Article 6 applies where the judicial proceedings concern a discretionary decision resulting in interference in an applicant ’ s rights (ibid., § 102). In some cases, national law, while not necessarily recognizing that an individual has a subjective right, confers the right to a lawful procedure for examination of his or her claim, involving matters such as ruling whether a decision was arbitrary or ultra vires or whether there were procedural irregularities. This is the case regarding certain decisions where the authorities have a purely discretionary power to grant or refuse an advantage or privilege, with the law conferring on the person concerned the right to apply to the courts, which, where they find that the decision was unlawful, may set it aside. In such a case Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is applicable, on condition that the advantage or privilege, once granted, gives rise to a civil right (ibid., § 105). While access to employment and to the functions performed may constitute in principle a privilege that cannot be legally enforced, this is not the case regarding the continuation of an employment relationship or the conditions in which it is exercised (ibid., § 117). In Baka, for instance, the Court recognised the right of the President of the Supreme Court to serve his full term of six years under Hungarian law (see Baka, cited above, §§ 107-11).",

                "47. Applying these principles to the present case, the Court observes, first of all, that there was a “dispute” concerning the exercise of the right to hold the position of president of a court. As regards the issue of whether such a “right” could be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised in domestic law, it has to be noted that the applicant was appointed to the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal for a five ‑ year term (see paragraph 13 above) and his appointment for such tenure was not disputed at the domestic level. The applicant was provided with specific remuneration for his service as president of the court and his dismissal from this position was subject to certain substantive and procedural conditions. In the light of the above, and given that there was no dispute between the parties as to the existence of the right in question, there is no ground for considering that the applicant ’ s right to serve in that administrative position was not recognised under domestic law. Despite his appointment for a five-year period, the applicant ’ s right to hold the position of president of the court was limited in time by the fact that he was due to reach the retirement age in 2013, before the expiry of that period (see Article 126 of the Constitution cited in paragraph 26 above)."

Moreover, the dispute was “serious”, having regard to the role of the president of a court (see section 29 of the Judiciary and Status of Judges Act, cited in paragraph 28 above) and to the direct pecuniary consequences for the applicant resulting from his removal from that administrative position. In that regard the Government ’ s argument that the reduction in salary was insignificant for the applicant is not convincing. The applicant ’ s calculation of pecuniary damage in his domestic claim was limited only to the short period (see paragraph 22 above) which had elapsed at that stage, because the principal purpose of the claim was to secure his reinstatement in the position of president of the court. However, the pecuniary consequences were not insignificant from the perspective of the whole period which remained for the applicant to serve as president."

                "51. In this connection it has to be noted that the scope of the “civil” concept in Article 6 is not limited by the immediate subject matter of the dispute. Instead, the Court has developed a wider approach, according to which the “civil” limb has covered cases which might not initially appear to concern a civil right but which may have direct and significant repercussions on a private pecuniary or non-pecuniary right belonging to an individual. Through this approach, the civil limb of Article 6 has been applied to a variety of disputes which may have been classified in domestic law as public-law disputes. These examples include disciplinary proceedings concerning the right to practise a profession (see Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, 23 June 1981, §§ 47 and 48, Series A no. 43, and Philis v. Greece (no. 2), 27 June 1997, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV), disputes involving the right to a healthy environment (see Taşkın and Others v.

Ukraine, no. 38773/05, §§ 143-45, 2 6 July 2012), disputes regarding the non-inclusion of a conviction in a criminal record (see Alexandre v. Portugal, no. 33197/09, §§ 54 and 55, 20 November 2012), proceedings for the application of a non-custodial preventive measure (see De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, § 154, ECHR 2017 (extracts)), and the revocation of a civil servant ’ s security clearance within the Ministry of Defence (see Regner, cited above, §§ 113-27)."

Besides the above -mentioned development of the case-law, the scope of the “civil” limb has been substantially extended in relation to public - employment disputes, a field which is directly relevant to the present case. In Vilho Eskelinen and Others (cited above) the Court, having regard to the existing state of affairs in the Contracting States and in view of non-discrimination considerations in relation to civil servants as compared to private employees, established a presumption that Article 6 applied to “ordinary labour disputes” between a civil servant and the State and that it would be for the respondent Government to show that a civil servant did not have a right of access to a court under national law and that this exclusion of the rights under Article 6 was justified (ibid., § 62). On the basis of the principles set out in Vilho Eskelinen and Others, Article 6 has been applied to employment disputes involving judges who were dismissed from judicial office (see, for example, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § § 91 and 96; Kulykov and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 5114/09 and 17 others, §§ 118 and 132, 19 January 2017; Sturua v. Georgia, no. 45729/05, § 27, 28 March 2017; and Kamenos v.

Slovakia, no. 33392/12, § 34, 23 May 2017). It has also been applied to employment disputes involving civil servants who had lost a remote-area allowance which had been added to their salaries as a bonus (see Vilho Eskelinen, cited above, §§ 40 and 41) or who had been transferred to another office or post against their will, resulting in a decrease in salary (see Zalli v. Albania, no. 52531/07, 8 February 2011, and Ohneberg v. Austria, no. 10781/08, 18 September 2012). Furthermore, in Bayer v. Germany (no. 8453/04, 16 July 2009), which concerned the removal from office of a State-employed bailiff following disciplinary proceedings, the Court held that disputes about “salaries, allowances or similar entitlements” were only non-exhaustive examples of “ordinary labour disputes” to which Article 6 should in principle apply under the Vilho Eskelinen test (ibid., § 38; see also Regner, cited above, § 108).",

As shown above, a public-law dispute may bring the civil limb into play if the private-law aspects predominate over the public-law ones in view of the direct consequences for a civil pecuniary or non-pecuniary right. Furthermore, the Court follows the criteria set out in Vilho Eskelinen and Others and applies a general presumption that such direct consequences for civil rights exist in “ordinary labour disputes” involving members of the public service, including judges (ibid., § 62 and Baka, cited above, § 104 )."

Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 119, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports 1996 ‑ III)."

On the contrary, the HCJ was empowered to carry out its own assessment of the facts, provide its own legal characterisation of the matter and adopt a binding decision after holding a hearing and assessing the evidence.

In these circumstances the Court must examine whether the HCJ and the HAC satisfied the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. However, if the HCJ did not meet those requirements, an issue under Article 6 would arise only if the HAC failed to provide a “sufficient review” in compliance with Article 6 (compare Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere, cited above, §§ 51 and 54, and Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, §§ 108, 123 and 130). Accordingly, in the present case the Court is called upon to examine firstly whether the requirements of an “independent and impartial tribunal” were complied with by the HCJ. Secondly, if those requirements were not satisfied at that stage, it is necessary to determine whether the review of the case by the HAC was “sufficient” to remedy the shortcomings identified.

                "68. In its Oleksandr Volkov judgment (cited above) the Court set out a number of criteria for examining whether the HCJ as a disciplinary body of judges complied with the requirements of independence and impartiality. In doing so, the Court relied on its previous case-law and took into account relevant international texts, notably the opinions and recommendations of other bodies of the Council of Europe. First, it emphasised the need for substantial representation of judges within such a body, specifying that where at least half of the membership of a tribunal was composed of judges, including the chairman with a casting vote, this would be a strong indicator of impartiality (ibid., § 109). Second, in view of the importance of reducing the influence of political organs on the composition of the disciplinary body, it was relevant to assess the manner in which judges were appointed to that body, having regard to the authorities which delegated them and the role of the judicial community in that process (ibid., § 112). Third, it was relevant to establish whether the members of the disciplinary body worked on a full-time basis or continued to work and receive a salary outside; given that the latter case would inevitably involve their material, hierarchical and administrative dependence on their primary employers, this would endanger their independence and impartiality (ibid., § 113). Fourth, attention had to be paid to the participation of representatives of the prosecution authorities in the composition of the disciplinary body for judges; the inclusion of the Prosecutor General ex officio and the other members delegated by the prosecution authorities raised concerns as to the impartiality of the disciplinary body of judges in view of the functional role of prosecutors in domestic judicial proceedings (ibid., § 114). Fifth, where the members of the disciplinary body played a role in the preliminary inquiry in a disciplinary case and subsequently participated in the determination of the same case by the disciplinary body, such a duplication of functions could cast objective doubt on the impartiality of those members (ibid., § 115)."
            ],
            [
                "69. The Court found in Oleksandr Volkov that the composition of the HCJ, as provided for by the Constitution, had disclosed a number of structural shortcomings which had compromised the requirements of independence and impartiality. Under these constitutional rules, the majority of the HCJ had consisted of non-judicial staff appointed directly by the executive and the legislative authorities, with the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutor General being ex officio members. The decision to dismiss the applicant in Oleksandr Volkov had been taken by sixteen members of the HCJ, only three of whom were judges. Furthermore, only four out of the twenty members of the HCJ worked there on a full-time basis, while the other members continued to work and receive a salary outside the HCJ. The membership and presence of the Prosecutor General and other representatives of the prosecution system within the HCJ raised further concerns in terms of impartiality, given the functional role of the prosecutor ’ s office in domestic court proceedings. Moreover, there were two members of the HCJ who had brought disciplinary charges against the applicant, based on the results of their own preliminary inquiries, and subsequently decided on the merits of his case (ibid., §§ 110-15)."
            ],
            [
                "70. Those findings are entirely pertinent to the present application. The HCJ was formed and functioned under the same constitutional rules as in Oleksandr Volkov. Therefore, the same concerns arise as regards the compliance of the proceedings before the HCJ with the standards of independence and impartiality. The applicant ’ s case was heard and determined by eighteen members of the HCJ, of whom only eight were judges. The non-judicial members therefore constituted a majority capable of determining the outcome of the proceedings. Moreover, there remained issues both with the manner in which the judicial members were delegated to the HCJ by the executive and legislative authorities, limiting the number of judges in the HCJ elected by their peers, and also with the fact that the majority of the HCJ ’ s members were not employed there full time and that the Prosecutor General was a member."

This preliminary involvement cast objective doubt on Judge K. ’ s impartiality when he subsequently took part in the decision of the HCJ on the merits of the applicant ’ s case (compare Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 115; Poposki and Duma v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 69916/10 and 36531/11, § 48, 7 January 2016; and Sturua, cited above, § 35)."

                "74. In Oleksandr Volkov the Court specifically found that the HAC had not provided a sufficient review of a case concerning a judge ’ s dismissal from office. Firstly, the Court observed that the HAC had powers to declare the impugned decisions unlawful, but that it was unable to quash them and take any further appropriate steps if deemed necessary. Even though no legal consequences arose from a decision being declared unlawful, the HAC ’ s inability to quash the impugned decision, together with the absence of rules as to the further progress of the disciplinary proceedings (in particular, the steps that had to be taken by the authorities involved after the impugned decisions had been declared unlawful and the time-limits for those steps to be taken), produced serious uncertainty about the real legal consequences of such judicial declarations. Judicial practice suggested, moreover, that there was no automatic reinstatement in the event of a positive declaration by the HAC, because the judges concerned had to institute new proceedings for reinstatement (ibid., §§ 125 and 126). The Court also examined the manner and the actual scope of the HAC ’ s review and concluded that these were likewise inappropriate to provide a “sufficient review” (ibid., §§ 127 and 128)."

Firstly, in its decision the HAC considered that the applicant had not contested the facts forming the grounds for his dismissal and therefore those facts were taken as established. This conclusion is not consistent with the grounds of the applicant ’ s claim before the HAC, in which he clearly contested those facts. The applicant argued in particular that the findings of the HCJ were too general and that in order to substantiate its conclusions the HCJ should have referred to the specific circumstances and their time frame."

Secondly, the HAC made no genuine attempt to examine another important argument by the applicant alleging a lack of independence and impartiality in the proceedings before the HCJ (see paragraph 21 above). Having mentioned its competence to review whether the impugned decision had been taken in a manner compatible with a number of criteria, notably the requirement of impartiality, the HAC reached a general conclusion that the HCJ had not violated the Constitution or the laws of Ukraine. However, the HAC failed to assess whether the proceedings before the HCJ had complied with the principles of independence and impartiality. It provided no reasons in that regard."

As to the guarantees of independence and impartiality under Article 6 § 1 to be provided by the reviewing judicial body, such a review was performed in the present case by the judges of the HAC, who were also under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the HCJ. This means that those judges could also be the subject of disciplinary proceedings before the HCJ. The fact that judges of the HAC were subject to disciplinary law and were bound by rules of judicial discipline and ethics is not in itself a reason to put in doubt their independence and impartiality in relation to the authority empowered to implement disciplinary rules. The question of compliance with the fundamental guarantees of independence and impartiality may arise, however, if the structure and functioning of the disciplinary body raises serious issues in this regard. The present case does indeed disclose serious issues of this kind on the part of the HCJ, in particular structural deficiencies and the appearance of personal bias (see paragraphs 70-72 above). Secondly, the HCJ was not merely a disciplinary authority; it was in reality an authority with extensive powers with respect to the careers of judges (appointment, disciplining and dismissal). On the basis of those factors and having regard to the specific context of the Ukrainian system at the time, the Court, in the light of Oleksandr Volkov (cited above, § 130), finds that the judges of the HAC considering the applicant ’ s case, in which the HCJ participated, were not able to demonstrate the “independence and impartiality” required by Article 6 of the Convention."

Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, § 83, 7 February 2012 ). In Gillberg (cited above) the Grand Chamber did not limit this rule to reputational damage and expanded it to a wider principle that any personal, social, psychological and economic suffering could be foreseeable consequences of the commission of a criminal offence and could not therefore be relied on in order to complain that a criminal conviction in itself amounted to an interference with the right to respect for “private life” (ibid., § 68).

It is, after all, in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant opportunity to develop relationships with the outside world (see Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, § 29, Series A no. 251 ‑ B; Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 165; and Bărbulescu, cited above, § 71).

Other types of cases have concerned restrictions on access to employment in the public service (see Naidin v.

In Özpınar (cited above), proceedings for the applicant ’ s dismissal as a judge fell under Article 8 of the Convention because they concerned not only her professional performance but also targeted aspects of her private life, in particular her close private relationships, the clothes and make-up she wore and the fact that she lived separately from her mother (ibid., §§ 43 and 47). In another case the applicant ’ s transfer to a less important post within the public service raised an issue under “private life” given that such a measure amounted to a disguised penalty and had been prompted by reasons relating to the applicant ’ s beliefs and his wife ’ s clothing (see Sodan, cited above, §§ 47-49 )."

Where a private company dismissed an employee on the basis of monitoring of his correspondence by his employer in the workplace, such a measure fell within the ambit of Article 8 in so far as it concerned the “correspondence” and because it encroached upon the reasonable possibility of enjoying any “private life” in the workplace (see Bărbulescu, cited above, §§ 81 and 127)."

In this connection the Court has taken into account negative consequences as regards (i) impact on the individual ’ s “inner circle”, in particular where there are serious material consequences, (ii) the individual ’ s opportunities “to establish and develop relationships with others”, and (iii) the impact on the individual ’ s reputation."

The dismissal also had a negative impact on the applicant ’ s “inner circle” in view of his loss of earnings, and it also affected his reputation (see Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 166). The refusal to allow an applicant who was a foreigner to sit for the Bar examinations in Greece fell within the scope of Article 8 because it affected her personal choice as to the way she wished to pursue her professional and private life (see Bigaeva, cited above, §§ 24 and 25). The entry of an applicant ’ s name in the bankruptcy register entailed a series of legal restrictions on the exercise of her professional activities and civil rights. It therefore affected the applicant ’ s opportunities to develop relationships with the outside world and fell within the sphere of her private life (see Campagnano, cited above, § 54).

The Court has addressed the issue of the seriousness or severity of the alleged violation in several contexts. Notably, it has done so when assessing the “significant disadvantage” under Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention as an explicit admissibility requirement for the whole system of the Convention rights (see, for example, Giusti v.

The Court has also consistently applied a threshold of severity in cases concerning Article 3 of the Convention (see, for example, Jalloh v.

In environmental cases, in particular, an arguable claim under Article 8 may arise where an environmental hazard attains a level of severity resulting in significant impairment of the applicant ’ s ability to enjoy his or her home or private or family life. The Court has ruled that the assessment of this minimum level in such cases is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance and its physical or mental effects on the individual ’ s health or quality of life (see Fadeyeva v.

According to that principle, where the negative effects complained of are limited to the consequences of the unlawful conduct which were foreseeable by the applicant, Article 8 cannot be relied upon to allege that such negative effects encroach upon private life. It has to be noted that in Gillberg the fact of the applicant ’ s unlawful conduct was largely undisputed (see Gillberg, cited above, § 71), whereas in the present case the applicant contested the very existence of any misconduct, thus implying that the measure involving his legal liability – his dismissal – could not have been a foreseeable consequence of his conduct in the position of president of a court of appeal.

Even though the pecuniary element of the dispute has been considered significant for the purpose of the applicability of Article 6 under its civil head, this conclusion does not automatically bring the issue within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention. In the present case the applicant has not provided any evidence to suggest that the ensuing reduction in his monthly remuneration (see paragraph 22 above) seriously affected the “inner circle” of his private life.

Since then he had examined four other defamation cases brought by Mr Stepaniuc against the applicant newspaper and had found in all of them for Mr Stepaniuc and awarded the maximum amount possible under the law. According to the applicant it was a strange coincidence that the President of the court should himself have examined the majority of the defamation actions brought by Mr Stepaniuc. This is moreover strange since he had never examined defamation proceedings against Flux brought by “ordinary” plaintiffs. In all the cases the actions had been upheld even though Mr Stepaniuc had failed to pay the court fees, an omission which was a formal ground for inadmissibility under the Code of Civil Procedure. Mr Stepaniuc had not even appeared before the court and all of his actions had been examined in his absence, usually at the first hearing. Judge I.M. never put questions to the defendant but kept advancing reasons which were in support of the plaintiff's position, reasons which had never been advanced by the plaintiff himself. This was proof of the “special care” shown by Judge I.M. towards Mr Stepaniuc.",

The applicant did not adduce any evidence to show that Judge I.M. had been subject to any form of influence or pressure from the executive or legislature.

The applicant then asked the HAC to take into account the fact that his judicial career had exceeded thirty-five years, that he had held positions of president at several courts for twenty-five years, that he had been given awards for his judicial service and that during the initial period of his presidency of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal that court had moved from a demolished military barracks to premises in the city centre with proper equipment and a sufficient number of hearing rooms."

The HAC stated that the applicant had not contested the facts forming the grounds for his dismissal and therefore those facts had been taken as established. The HAC then reiterated the failings attributed to the applicant and concluded that the HCJ ’ s decision had been lawful and that the applicant ’ s right to participate in the proceedings in person had not been violated because the HCJ had taken all the necessary measures to inform him about the hearings and the applicant had not had any valid reason for being absent from the hearings.

Hungary [GC], no. 56665/09, § 62, ECHR 2017, and Regner, cited above, § 100 ).

                "46. Although there is in principle no right under the Convention to hold a public post entailing the administration of justice (see Dzhidzheva ‑ Trendafilova v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 12628/09, § 38, 9 October 2012, and Harabin v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 62584/00, 29 June 2004), such a right may exist at the domestic level. In Regner ( cited above ) the Court reiterated that there can be no doubt about the fact that there is a right within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 where a substantive right recognised in domestic law is accompanied by a procedural right to have that right enforced through the courts. The mere fact that the wording of a legal provision affords an element of discretion does not in itself rule out the existence of a right. Indeed, Article 6 applies where the judicial proceedings concern a discretionary decision resulting in interference in an applicant ’ s rights (ibid., § 102). In some cases, national law, while not necessarily recognizing that an individual has a subjective right, confers the right to a lawful procedure for examination of his or her claim, involving matters such as ruling whether a decision was arbitrary or ultra vires or whether there were procedural irregularities. This is the case regarding certain decisions where the authorities have a purely discretionary power to grant or refuse an advantage or privilege, with the law conferring on the person concerned the right to apply to the courts, which, where they find that the decision was unlawful, may set it aside. In such a case Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is applicable, on condition that the advantage or privilege, once granted, gives rise to a civil right (ibid., § 105). While access to employment and to the functions performed may constitute in principle a privilege that cannot be legally enforced, this is not the case regarding the continuation of an employment relationship or the conditions in which it is exercised (ibid., § 117). In Baka, for instance, the Court recognised the right of the President of the Supreme Court to serve his full term of six years under Hungarian law (see Baka, cited above, §§ 107-11).",

                "47. Applying these principles to the present case, the Court observes, first of all, that there was a “dispute” concerning the exercise of the right to hold the position of president of a court. As regards the issue of whether such a “right” could be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised in domestic law, it has to be noted that the applicant was appointed to the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal for a five ‑ year term (see paragraph 13 above) and his appointment for such tenure was not disputed at the domestic level. The applicant was provided with specific remuneration for his service as president of the court and his dismissal from this position was subject to certain substantive and procedural conditions. In the light of the above, and given that there was no dispute between the parties as to the existence of the right in question, there is no ground for considering that the applicant ’ s right to serve in that administrative position was not recognised under domestic law. Despite his appointment for a five-year period, the applicant ’ s right to hold the position of president of the court was limited in time by the fact that he was due to reach the retirement age in 2013, before the expiry of that period (see Article 126 of the Constitution cited in paragraph 26 above)."

Moreover, the dispute was “serious”, having regard to the role of the president of a court (see section 29 of the Judiciary and Status of Judges Act, cited in paragraph 28 above) and to the direct pecuniary consequences for the applicant resulting from his removal from that administrative position. In that regard the Government ’ s argument that the reduction in salary was insignificant for the applicant is not convincing. The applicant ’ s calculation of pecuniary damage in his domestic claim was limited only to the short period (see paragraph 22 above) which had elapsed at that stage, because the principal purpose of the claim was to secure his reinstatement in the position of president of the court. However, the pecuniary consequences were not insignificant from the perspective of the whole period which remained for the applicant to serve as president."

                "51. In this connection it has to be noted that the scope of the “civil” concept in Article 6 is not limited by the immediate subject matter of the dispute. Instead, the Court has developed a wider approach, according to which the “civil” limb has covered cases which might not initially appear to concern a civil right but which may have direct and significant repercussions on a private pecuniary or non-pecuniary right belonging to an individual. Through this approach, the civil limb of Article 6 has been applied to a variety of disputes which may have been classified in domestic law as public-law disputes. These examples include disciplinary proceedings concerning the right to practise a profession (see Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, 23 June 1981, §§ 47 and 48, Series A no. 43, and Philis v. Greece (no. 2), 27 June 1997, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV), disputes involving the right to a healthy environment (see Taşkın and Others v. Turkey, no. 46117/99, § 133, ECHR 2004 ‑ X), prisoners ’ detention arrangements (see Ganci v. Italy, no. 41576/98, § 25, ECHR 2003 ‑ XI, and Enea v. Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, § 103, ECHR 2009), the right of access to investigation documents (see Savitskyy v. Ukraine, no. 38773/05, §§ 143-45, 2 6 July 2012), disputes regarding the non-inclusion of a conviction in a criminal record (see Alexandre v. Portugal, no. 33197/09, §§ 54 and 55, 20 November 2012), proceedings for the application of a non-custodial preventive measure (see De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, § 154, ECHR 2017 (extracts)), and the revocation of a civil servant ’ s security clearance within the Ministry of Defence (see Regner, cited above, §§ 113-27)."

Besides the above -mentioned development of the case-law, the scope of the “civil” limb has been substantially extended in relation to public - employment disputes, a field which is directly relevant to the present case. In Vilho Eskelinen and Others (cited above) the Court, having regard to the existing state of affairs in the Contracting States and in view of non-discrimination considerations in relation to civil servants as compared to private employees, established a presumption that Article 6 applied to “ordinary labour disputes” between a civil servant and the State and that it would be for the respondent Government to show that a civil servant did not have a right of access to a court under national law and that this exclusion of the rights under Article 6 was justified (ibid., § 62). On the basis of the principles set out in Vilho Eskelinen and Others, Article 6 has been applied to employment disputes involving judges who were dismissed from judicial office (see, for example, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § § 91 and 96; Kulykov and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 5114/09 and 17 others, §§ 118 and 132, 19 January 2017; Sturua v. Georgia, no. 45729/05, § 27, 28 March 2017; and Kamenos v. Cyprus, no. 147/07, § 88, 31 October 2017 ), removed from an administrative position without the termination of their duties as a judge (see Baka, cited above, §§ 34 and 107-11 ) or suspended from judicial office (see Paluda v. Slovakia, no. 33392/12, § 34, 23 May 2017). It has also been applied to employment disputes involving civil servants who had lost a remote-area allowance which had been added to their salaries as a bonus (see Vilho Eskelinen, cited above, §§ 40 and 41) or who had been transferred to another office or post against their will, resulting in a decrease in salary (see Zalli v. Albania, no. 52531/07, 8 February 2011, and Ohneberg v. Austria, no. 10781/08, 18 September 2012). Furthermore, in Bayer v. Germany (no. 8453/04, 16 July 2009), which concerned the removal from office of a State-employed bailiff following disciplinary proceedings, the Court held that disputes about “salaries, allowances or similar entitlements” were only non-exhaustive examples of “ordinary labour disputes” to which Article 6 should in principle apply under the Vilho Eskelinen test (ibid., § 38; see also Regner, cited above, § 108).",

As shown above, a public-law dispute may bring the civil limb into play if the private-law aspects predominate over the public-law ones in view of the direct consequences for a civil pecuniary or non-pecuniary right. Furthermore, the Court follows the criteria set out in Vilho Eskelinen and Others and applies a general presumption that such direct consequences for civil rights exist in “ordinary labour disputes” involving members of the public service, including judges (ibid., § 62 and Baka, cited above, § 104 )."

In doing so, the Court relied on its previous case-law and took into account relevant international texts, notably the opinions and recommendations of other bodies of the Council of Europe. First, it emphasised the need for substantial representation of judges within such a body, specifying that where at least half of the membership of a tribunal was composed of judges, including the chairman with a casting vote, this would be a strong indicator of impartiality (ibid., § 109). Second, in view of the importance of reducing the influence of political organs on the composition of the disciplinary body, it was relevant to assess the manner in which judges were appointed to that body, having regard to the authorities which delegated them and the role of the judicial community in that process (ibid., § 112). Third, it was relevant to establish whether the members of the disciplinary body worked on a full-time basis or continued to work and receive a salary outside; given that the latter case would inevitably involve their material, hierarchical and administrative dependence on their primary employers, this would endanger their independence and impartiality (ibid., § 113). Fourth, attention had to be paid to the participation of representatives of the prosecution authorities in the composition of the disciplinary body for judges; the inclusion of the Prosecutor General ex officio and the other members delegated by the prosecution authorities raised concerns as to the impartiality of the disciplinary body of judges in view of the functional role of prosecutors in domestic judicial proceedings (ibid., § 114). Fifth, where the members of the disciplinary body played a role in the preliminary inquiry in a disciplinary case and subsequently participated in the determination of the same case by the disciplinary body, such a duplication of functions could cast objective doubt on the impartiality of those members (ibid., § 115)."

The Court found in Oleksandr Volkov that the composition of the HCJ, as provided for by the Constitution, had disclosed a number of structural shortcomings which had compromised the requirements of independence and impartiality. Under these constitutional rules, the majority of the HCJ had consisted of non-judicial staff appointed directly by the executive and the legislative authorities, with the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutor General being ex officio members. The decision to dismiss the applicant in Oleksandr Volkov had been taken by sixteen members of the HCJ, only three of whom were judges. Furthermore, only four out of the twenty members of the HCJ worked there on a full-time basis, while the other members continued to work and receive a salary outside the HCJ. The membership and presence of the Prosecutor General and other representatives of the prosecution system within the HCJ raised further concerns in terms of impartiality, given the functional role of the prosecutor ’ s office in domestic court proceedings. Moreover, there were two members of the HCJ who had brought disciplinary charges against the applicant, based on the results of their own preliminary inquiries, and subsequently decided on the merits of his case (ibid., §§ 110-15)."

The applicant ’ s case was heard and determined by eighteen members of the HCJ, of whom only eight were judges. The non-judicial members therefore constituted a majority capable of determining the outcome of the proceedings. Moreover, there remained issues both with the manner in which the judicial members were delegated to the HCJ by the executive and legislative authorities, limiting the number of judges in the HCJ elected by their peers, and also with the fact that the majority of the HCJ ’ s members were not employed there full time and that the Prosecutor General was a member."

Firstly, the Court observed that the HAC had powers to declare the impugned decisions unlawful, but that it was unable to quash them and take any further appropriate steps if deemed necessary. Even though no legal consequences arose from a decision being declared unlawful, the HAC ’ s inability to quash the impugned decision, together with the absence of rules as to the further progress of the disciplinary proceedings (in particular, the steps that had to be taken by the authorities involved after the impugned decisions had been declared unlawful and the time-limits for those steps to be taken), produced serious uncertainty about the real legal consequences of such judicial declarations. Judicial practice suggested, moreover, that there was no automatic reinstatement in the event of a positive declaration by the HAC, because the judges concerned had to institute new proceedings for reinstatement (ibid., §§ 125 and 126). The Court also examined the manner and the actual scope of the HAC ’ s review and concluded that these were likewise inappropriate to provide a “sufficient review” (ibid., §§ 127 and 128)."

                "76. Moreover, looking into the content of the dispute at stake in the present case, there are serious mismatches between the advanced and actual grounds of review. Firstly, in its decision the HAC considered that the applicant had not contested the facts forming the grounds for his dismissal and therefore those facts were taken as established. This conclusion is not consistent with the grounds of the applicant ’ s claim before the HAC, in which he clearly contested those facts. The applicant argued in particular that the findings of the HCJ were too general and that in order to substantiate its conclusions the HCJ should have referred to the specific circumstances and their time frame."

Secondly, the HAC made no genuine attempt to examine another important argument by the applicant alleging a lack of independence and impartiality in the proceedings before the HCJ (see paragraph 21 above). Having mentioned its competence to review whether the impugned decision had been taken in a manner compatible with a number of criteria, notably the requirement of impartiality, the HAC reached a general conclusion that the HCJ had not violated the Constitution or the laws of Ukraine. However, the HAC failed to assess whether the proceedings before the HCJ had complied with the principles of independence and impartiality. It provided no reasons in that regard."

As to the guarantees of independence and impartiality under Article 6 § 1 to be provided by the reviewing judicial body, such a review was performed in the present case by the judges of the HAC, who were also under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the HCJ. This means that those judges could also be the subject of disciplinary proceedings before the HCJ. The fact that judges of the HAC were subject to disciplinary law and were bound by rules of judicial discipline and ethics is not in itself a reason to put in doubt their independence and impartiality in relation to the authority empowered to implement disciplinary rules. The question of compliance with the fundamental guarantees of independence and impartiality may arise, however, if the structure and functioning of the disciplinary body raises serious issues in this regard. The present case does indeed disclose serious issues of this kind on the part of the HCJ, in particular structural deficiencies and the appearance of personal bias (see paragraphs 70-72 above). Secondly, the HCJ was not merely a disciplinary authority; it was in reality an authority with extensive powers with respect to the careers of judges (appointment, disciplining and dismissal). On the basis of those factors and having regard to the specific context of the Ukrainian system at the time, the Court, in the light of Oleksandr Volkov (cited above, § 130), finds that the judges of the HAC considering the applicant ’ s case, in which the HCJ participated, were not able to demonstrate the “independence and impartiality” required by Article 6 of the Convention."

His dismissal from that position had damaged his peers ’ perceptions of his personal authority and competence. Furthermore, the reason for his dismissal, namely breaches of laws relating to the organisation of the justice process, had affected his professional standing generally and his future career and promotion prospects.

In the assessment of whether or not a private-life issue under Article 8 of the Convention is raised in such a case, there is a strong tie between the questions of applicability and the merits. Once a measure is found to have seriously affected the applicant ’ s private life, that conclusion means that the complaint is compatible ratione materiae with the Convention and, at the same time, that the measure constituted an “interference” with the “right to respect for private life” for the purpose of the three-limb merits test under Article 8 ( assessment of the lawfulness, the legitimate aim and the necessity of such “ interference ” ).

In Gillberg (cited above) the Grand Chamber did not limit this rule to reputational damage and expanded it to a wider principle that any personal, social, psychological and economic suffering could be foreseeable consequences of the commission of a criminal offence and could not therefore be relied on in order to complain that a criminal conviction in itself amounted to an interference with the right to respect for “private life” (ibid., § 68).

In Özpınar (cited above), proceedings for the applicant ’ s dismissal as a judge fell under Article 8 of the Convention because they concerned not only her professional performance but also targeted aspects of her private life, in particular her close private relationships, the clothes and make-up she wore and the fact that she lived separately from her mother (ibid., §§ 43 and 47). In another case the applicant ’ s transfer to a less important post within the public service raised an issue under “private life” given that such a measure amounted to a disguised penalty and had been prompted by reasons relating to the applicant ’ s beliefs and his wife ’ s clothing (see Sodan, cited above, §§ 47-49 )."

Where a private company dismissed an employee on the basis of monitoring of his correspondence by his employer in the workplace, such a measure fell within the ambit of Article 8 in so far as it concerned the “correspondence” and because it encroached upon the reasonable possibility of enjoying any “private life” in the workplace (see Bărbulescu, cited above, §§ 81 and 127)."

The refusal to allow an applicant who was a foreigner to sit for the Bar examinations in Greece fell within the scope of Article 8 because it affected her personal choice as to the way she wished to pursue her professional and private life (see Bigaeva, cited above, §§ 24 and 25). The entry of an applicant ’ s name in the bankruptcy register entailed a series of legal restrictions on the exercise of her professional activities and civil rights.

In the recent case of Erményi the Court found that the applicant ’ s dismissal from the administrative position of Vice-President of the Supreme Court constituted an interference with his right to respect for private life (see Erményi, cited above, § 31). Even though the Court did not elaborate on this point, in the absence of the parties ’ submissions in that regard, it implied that the impugned measure had seriously affected the applicant ’ s private life. That finding cannot be read as presuming that the applicant ’ s dismissal had “automatically” generated an issue in the sphere of private life. In that regard the Court reiterates that the threshold of severity occupies an important place in cases where the existence of a private - life issue is examined according to the consequence-based approach."

As the Grand Chamber has held, applicants are obliged to identify and explain the concrete repercussions on their private life and the nature and extent of their suffering, and to substantiate such allegations in a proper way (see Gillberg, cited above, §§ 70-73). According to the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies, such allegations have to be sufficiently raised at the domestic level.",

                "115. The Court concludes from the above case-law that employment - related disputes are not per se excluded from the scope of “private life” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. There are some typical aspects of private life which may be affected in such disputes by dismissal, demotion, non-admission to a profession or other similarly unfavourable measures. These aspects include (i) the applicant ’ s “inner circle”, (ii) the applicant ’ s opportunity to establish and develop relationships with others, and (iii) the applicant ’ s social and professional reputation. There are two ways in which a private-life issue would usually arise in such a dispute: either because of the underlying reasons for the impugned measure ( in that event the Court employs the reason-based approach) or – in certain cases – because of the consequences for private life ( in that event the Court employs the consequence-based approach)."

It is for the applicant to show convincingly that the threshold was attained in his or her case. The applicant has to present evidence substantiating consequences of the impugned measure. The Court will only accept that Article 8 is applicable where these consequences are very serious and affect his or her private life to a very significant degree."

                "117. The Court has established criteria for assessing the severity or seriousness of alleged violations in different regulatory contexts. An applicant ’ s suffering is to be assessed by comparing his or her life before and after the measure in question. The Court further considers that in determining the seriousness of the consequences in employment-related cases it is appropriate to assess the subjective perceptions claimed by the applicant against the background of the objective circumstances existing in the particular case. This analysis would have to cover both the material and the non-material impact of the alleged measure. However, it remains for the applicant to define and substantiate the nature and extent of his or her suffering, which should have a causal connection with the impugned measure. Having regard to the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, the essential elements of such allegations must be sufficiently raised before the domestic authorities dealing with the matter.",

The explicit reasons for the applicant ’ s dismissal from the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal were strictly limited to his performance in the public arena, namely his alleged managerial failings, which were said to undermine the proper functioning of the court. Those reasons related only to the applicant ’ s administrative tasks in the workplace and had no connection to his private life. In the absence of any such issues in the reasons given for his dismissal, it has to be determined whether, according to the evidence and the substantiated allegations put forward by the applicant, the measure had serious negative consequences for the aspects constituting his “private life”, namely ( i ) his “inner circle”, ( ii ) his opportunities to establish and develop relationships with others, or ( iii ) his reputation."

When it comes to the consequences of the applicant ’ s dismissal, the first question which arises is whether there can be any scope for an issue under Article 8 in the light of the Gillberg exclusionary principle (see paragraph 98 above). According to that principle, where the negative effects complained of are limited to the consequences of the unlawful conduct which were foreseeable by the applicant, Article 8 cannot be relied upon to allege that such negative effects encroach upon private life. It has to be noted that in Gillberg the fact of the applicant ’ s unlawful conduct was largely undisputed (see Gillberg, cited above, § 71), whereas in the present case the applicant contested the very existence of any misconduct, thus implying that the measure involving his legal liability – his dismissal – could not have been a foreseeable consequence of his conduct in the position of president of a court of appeal. In these circumstances the present case is distinguishable from Gillberg and the Court cannot follow this approach."

                "122. As to the consequences of the applicant ’ s dismissal for his “inner circle”, he contended that his removal had resulted in a reduction in his salary and in his prospective pension benefits. This argument has to be viewed as relating to the worsening of the material well-being of the applicant and his family. Even though the pecuniary element of the dispute has been considered significant for the purpose of the applicability of Article 6 under its civil head, this conclusion does not automatically bring the issue within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention. In the present case the applicant has not provided any evidence to suggest that the ensuing reduction in his monthly remuneration (see paragraph 22 above) seriously affected the “inner circle” of his private life. In the absence of such evidence, it would be speculative to assume the contrary. There are no other indications that the “inner circle” of the applicant ’ s private life was affected by the impugned measure."

As to establishing and maintaining relationships with others, the applicant ’ s dismissal from the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal did not result in his removal from his profession. He continued to work as an ordinary judge and he remained at the same court alongside his colleagues. The applicant did not put forward any other allegations in this respect. It follows that, even if his opportunities to establish and maintain relationships, including those of a professional nature, might have been affected, there are no factual grounds for concluding that such effects were substantial. After all, it appears inappropriate to measure the extent and quality of relationships in private life in terms of administrative positions and roles."

The question remains whether or not the impugned measure encroached upon the applicant ’ s reputation in such a way that it seriously affected his esteem among others, with the result that it has a serious impact on his interaction with society. The Court will look at this issue in terms of professional and social reputation."

                "125. As regards the applicant ’ s professional reputation, the Court notes that his principal professional function was that of a judge. The profession of judge required him to possess specific knowledge, educational qualifications, skills and experience. In recompense for his service in this capacity, the applicant was paid the predominant part of his salary. At the same time, the successful performance of a presidential or administrative function in a court is not, strictly speaking, a characteristic of the judicial profession. Therefore, in objective terms, the judicial function constituted the applicant ’ s fundamental professional role. His position as president of a court, however important and prestigious it might be in the judicial sphere and however it might have been subjectively perceived and valued by the applicant, did not relate to the principal sphere of his professional activity."

In the proceedings at issue, at no point did the domestic authorities examine the applicant ’ s performance as a judge or express any opinion as to his judicial competence and professionalism. The decisions in the applicant ’ s case concerned only his managerial skills, while his professional role as a judge was not touched upon. This limited area of scrutiny and criticism cannot be regarded as relating to the core of the applicant ’ s professional reputation. In that regard the present case differs in substance from Oleksandr Volkov (cited above), in which the applicant was criticised and received a disciplinary sanction for his performance as a judge."

Next, the Court takes note of the applicant ’ s argument that, after he had occupied positions as president of a court over a period of twenty ‑ five years, the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal had represented the apex of his legal career and his dismissal had undermined his peers ’ opinion of his competence. However, the applicant did not specify how this alleged loss of esteem, even assuming that it affected the core of his professional reputation, had caused him serious prejudice in his professional environment. In any event, the Court does not have sufficient material to conclude that the alleged loss of esteem reached the high degree of seriousness required by Article 8 of the Convention, as discussed in paragraphs 116 and 117 above."

The Court notes that the applicant ’ s dismissal did not preclude his reappointment, even though this latter consideration may have been purely theoretical, because of his advanced age. In any event, the measure did not have a significant effect as to its duration because it was limited by the applicant ’ s remaining period of service in the judiciary before he was due to reach the retirement age, about two years later (see Article 125 of the Constitution cited in paragraph 26 above)."

The applicant ’ s moral values were not called into question and no reproaches of this nature can be identified in the impugned decisions (contrast Lekavičienė v.

                "“39. The six-month time-limit provided for by Article 35 § 1 has a number of aims. Its primary purpose is to maintain legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are examined within a reasonable time, and to prevent the authorities and other persons concerned from being kept in a state of uncertainty for a long period of time (see P.M. v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 6638/03, 24 August 2004). It also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised (see O ’ Loughlin and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 23274/04, 25 August 2005) and facilitates the establishment of facts in a case, since with the passage of time, any fair examination of the issues raised is rendered problematic (see Nee v. Ireland ( dec. ), no. 52787/99, 30 January 2003).",
                "40. That rule marks out the temporal limit of the supervision exercised by the Court and signals, both to individuals and State authorities, the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see Walker v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 34979/97, ECHR 2000 ‑ I). The existence of such a time-limit is justified by the wish of the High Contracting Parties to prevent past judgments being constantly called into question and constitutes a legitimate concern for order, stability and peace (see De Becker v. Belgium ( dec. ), no. 214/56, 9 June 1958).",
                "41. Article 35 § 1 contains an autonomous rule which has to be interpreted and applied in such a manner as to ensure to any applicant claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the Contracting Parties of one of the rights set forth in the Convention and its Protocols the effective exercise of the right of individual petition pursuant to Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (see Worm v. Austria ( dec. ), no. 22714/93, 27 November 1995).",
                "42. The Court reiterates that with regard to procedure and time-limits, legal certainty constitutes a binding requirement which ensures the equality of litigants before the law. That principle is implicit in all the Convention ’ s Articles and constitutes one of the fundamental elements of the rule of law (see, among other authorities, Beian v. Romania (no. 1), no. 30658/05, § 39, ECHR 2007 ‑ V (extracts)).”"

The Court reiterates that the principle ne eat judex ultra et extra petita partium (“not beyond the request”) is one of the fundamental principles of procedure under international and domestic (civil and administrative) law, it being understood that the petitum is the complaint submitted by the applicant. It follows that the scope of a case “referred to” the Court in the exercise of the right of individual application is determined by the applicant ’ s complaint or “claim” (see Radomilja and Others, cited above, §§ 108-09 and 120-22). Allegations made after the expiry of the six-month time-limit can only be examined by the Court if they constitute legal submissions relating to, or particular aspects of, the initial complaints that were introduced within the time-limit (see Kurnaz and Others v.

Regarding the existence of a “right”, it observed that the proceedings in question had been decisive for the applicant ’ s rights in so far as they could have led to the setting-aside of the disciplinary sanctions imposed by the CSM if the domestic courts had allowed her appeals. As to the “civil” nature of such a right, the Chamber found that the first condition of the test established in the judgment in Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, § 62, ECHR 2007-II) had not been met, as domestic law – in the form of section 168 of the Act (see paragraph 71 above) – made provision for persons with an interest in bringing proceedings to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court challenging the lawfulness of a decision by the CSM to impose a disciplinary penalty on a judge. The applicant had in fact made use of that option. Accordingly, the Chamber held that Article 6 was applicable under its civil head. In view of that finding, the Chamber did not consider it necessary to ascertain whether that provision was applicable in the present case under its criminal head, and decided not to examine the complaints submitted in that regard."

With regard to the extent of the review conducted by the Supreme Court, the Chamber noted that the latter had been empowered to review the lawfulness of the CSM ’ s decisions imposing disciplinary penalties on the applicant. In the course of that review it could verify the validity of the evidence, whether the facts had been adequately and coherently established, and whether the penalty imposed had been reasonable and proportionate. It could therefore set aside the decision on several grounds of unlawfulness linked to the procedural or substantive requirements laid down by law and refer the case back to the CSM for a fresh ruling in conformity with any instructions issued by the Supreme Court regarding possible irregularities.",

Furthermore, it could not reconsider the penalty imposed, but could only determine whether the penalty had been appropriate to the offence and proportionate to it. For that reason, in the Chamber ’ s view, the case was to be likened to situations in which the national courts had been unable or had refused to examine a key issue in the dispute because they had considered themselves bound by the findings of fact or of law made by the administrative authorities and could not examine the relevant issues independently. In the instant case the Supreme Court had confined itself to conducting a review of lawfulness with regard to the establishment of the facts and had thus not properly addressed important arguments advanced by the applicant concerning questions of fact that were crucial to the disciplinary proceedings against her.",

The Chamber concluded from this that the Supreme Court adopted a restrictive approach to the extent of its own jurisdiction to review the disciplinary activities of the CSM, and that the review carried out in the cases concerning the applicant had therefore been insufficient."

The protection of the applicant ’ s dignity had not been an issue, as she herself had requested a public hearing. Moreover, the reasons given by the Supreme Court had been insufficient to justify the refusal to examine the witness whom the applicant wished to have called and whose evidence, in the Chamber ’ s view, had been relevant to the case. That refusal had led ultimately to a limitation of the applicant ’ s ability to defend her case and had undermined the transparency which that procedural act would have lent to the disciplinary proceedings against her.",

                "122. The Court reiterates that the concept of a “criminal charge” in Article 6 § 1 is an autonomous one. The Court ’ s established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the “Engel criteria”, to be considered in determining whether or not there was a “criminal charge” (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 82, Series A no. 22). The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative, and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, among other authorities, Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, § 30-31, ECHR 2006-XIV, and Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § 82, ECHR 2003-X). The fact that an offence is not punishable by imprisonment is not by itself decisive for the purposes of the applicability of the criminal limb of Article 6 of the Convention since, as the Court has stressed on numerous occasions, the relative lack of seriousness of the penalty at stake cannot deprive an offence of its inherently criminal character (see Nicoleta Gheorghe v. Romania, no. 23470/05, § 26, 3 April 2012)."

The fact that these are applied, as appropriate, in conjunction with the provisions of the Criminal Code or the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 71 and 72 above) does not alter this finding. Furthermore, the proceedings were conducted by a management and disciplinary body – the CSM – subject to the subsequent supervision of the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court, and neither the prosecuting authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Brown, cited above ) nor the criminal courts were involved in determining the cases (see, mutatis mutandis, Müller- Hartburg, cited above, § 43)."

Such provisions are designed to protect the profession ’ s honour and reputation and to maintain public trust in the judiciary (see, mutatis mutandis, Müller- Hartburg, cited above, § 45).

In such circumstances, in the applicant ’ s submission, the aforementioned ad hoc division was not, and could not appear to the public to be, separate from the CSM."

Contrary to the provisions of the Constitution (see Article 212 § 3 of the Constitution, paragraph 70 above), which required disputes concerning administrative acts to be determined by the administrative courts, the disciplinary decisions of the CSM were subject to appeal before an ad hoc division of the Supreme Court. Thus, the appraisal, appointment and promotion of Supreme Court judges, and disciplinary proceedings concerning them, came within the remit of the CSM, in other words the body whose decisions were submitted to those judges for review. Accordingly, in the applicant ’ s view, it would have been wiser for the appeals in question to be adjudicated by the Supreme Administrative Court, whose members came under the authority of the High Council of the Administrative and Fiscal Courts rather than that of the CSM."

Secondly, the composition of the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court was determined by law on the basis of objective criteria such as judges ’ seniority and their membership of a particular division, and was therefore not dependent on the wishes of the President of the Supreme Court. Furthermore, the members were formally appointed by the most senior Vice-President of the Supreme Court. The President did not participate in sittings at which appeals against CSM decisions were being examined."

Its members were highly qualified judges in the final stages of their careers, who were no longer subject to performance appraisals or in search of promotion. Furthermore, the Supreme Court enjoyed administrative autonomy. The only issue that could arise in practice concerned the CSM ’ s – purely theoretical – power to open disciplinary proceedings against the judges of the Judicial Division."

Fifthly, the appropriateness, coherence and proper functioning of the system in place in Portugal were demonstrated by the fact that, over the period from 16 November 2009 to 31 December 2015, the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court had delivered sixty-one judgments on appeal against disciplinary decisions of the CSM. The CSM ’ s decision had been upheld in fifty-three cases and overturned in eight."

In order to establish whether a tribunal can be considered to be “independent” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of guarantees against outside pressures and the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence (see Findlay v. the United Kingdom, 25 February 1997, § 73, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I, and Tsanova-Gecheva, cited above, § 106, 15 September 2015). The Court observes that the notion of the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary has assumed growing importance in its case-law (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 78, ECHR 2002-IV). However, neither Article 6 nor any other provision of the Convention requires States to comply with any theoretical constitutional concepts regarding the permissible limits of the powers ’ interaction (see Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98 and 3 others, § 193, ECHR 2003-VI)."

According to the Court ’ s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to a subjective test where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge, that is, whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and also according to an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, for example, Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 118, ECHR 2005-XIII, and Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, § 93, ECHR 2009)."

France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 75, 2 3 April 2015 ). However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test) (see Kyprianou, cited above, § 119). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports 1996-III)."

                "147. As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge ’ s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Micallef, cited above, § 96, and Morice, cited above, § 76)."
            ],
            [
                "148. The objective test mostly concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other protagonists in the proceedings (see Micallef, cited above, § 97). It must therefore be decided in each individual case whether the relationship in question is of such a nature and degree as to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the tribunal (see Pullar, cited above, § 38)."

Belgium, 26 October 1984, § 26, Series A no. 86). What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public. Thus, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw (see Castillo Algar v. Spain, 28 October 1998, § 45, Reports 1998-VIII, and Micallef, cited above, § 98)."

In particular, it is not established that those judges were specially appointed with a view to adjudicating her case (see, mutatis mutandis, Pereira da Silva v. Portugal, no. 77050/11, §§ 59-60, 22 March 2016).

With regard to the second aspect of the complaint, the Court observes that in the case of Oleksandr Volkov (cited above), it previously examined a similar issue concerning the impartiality and independence of the Higher Administrative Court (HAC), whose task it was to examine appeals against decisions of the Ukrainian High Council of Justice (HCJ). In that case the Court found as follows:",
                "“130. The Court observes that the judicial review was performed by judges of the HAC who were also under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the HCJ. This means that these judges could also be subjected to disciplinary proceedings before the HCJ. Having regard to the extensive powers of the HCJ with respect to the careers of judges (appointment, disciplining and dismissal) and the lack of safeguards for the HCJ ’ s independence and impartiality ( as examined above), the Court is not persuaded that the judges of the HAC considering the applicant ’ s case, to which the HCJ was a party, were able to demonstrate the ‘ independence and impartiality ’ required by Article 6 of the Convention.”"

In the Court ’ s view, regard being had to the arguments advanced by the Chamber which examined the case of Oleksandr Volkov, these findings should be regarded as a criticism based on the circumstances of the case and applicable in a system with serious structural deficiencies or an appearance of bias within the disciplinary body for the judiciary, as was the case in the specific context of the Ukrainian system at the time, rather than as a general conclusion."

                "159. In Oleksandr Volkov, in addition to the fact that the judges of the Higher Administrative Court were under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Ukrainian High Council of Justice, a number of serious issues had been identified. These problems related firstly to structural shortcomings in the procedure before the HCJ, notably the inclusion of the Minister of Justice and of the Prosecutor General as ex officio members of that body and the fact that the great majority of its non-judicial members were appointed directly by the executive and legislative authorities. Secondly, the Court took into account the appearance of bias on the part of some members of the HCJ who had determined the applicant ’ s case. It observed that the members of the Ukrainian HCJ who had carried out the preliminary inquiries in the applicant ’ s case and submitted requests for his dismissal had subsequently taken part in the decisions to remove him from office. Moreover, one of them had been appointed President of the HCJ and had presided over the hearing of the applicant ’ s case. The Court therefore found that the proceedings before the HCJ had been incompatible with the principles of independence and impartiality set forth in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 117). The subsequent determination of the applicant ’ s case by Parliament, the legislative body, had not remedied the structural defects of a lack of “independence and impartiality” but rather had served to contribute to the politicisation of the procedure and to aggravate the inconsistency of the procedure with the principle of the separation of powers (ibid., § 118). In those circumstances, according to the Court ’ s case-law, it was extremely important for the Ukrainian Higher Administrative Court to afford the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention in order to be able to remedy any lack of independence and impartiality."

The Court emphasises at the outset the importance of the guarantees listed at paragraph 153 above, in particular the principle of independence of the judiciary in Portugal, which is protected both under the Constitution (see paragraph 70 above) and by other provisions of domestic law (see paragraph 71 above). It also takes note of the reasons that prompted the Portuguese legislative authorities to choose the current system whereby jurisdiction over appeals against decisions of the CSM is assigned to the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court, reasons that have been endorsed on several occasions by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 82 above)."

Furthermore, it goes without saying that the fact that judges are subject to the law in general, and to the rules of professional discipline and ethics in particular, cannot cast doubt on their impartiality. As noted by the Government and not disputed by the applicant, the judges of the Supreme Court, who are highly qualified and often in the final stages of their careers, are no longer subject to performance appraisals or in search of promotion, and the CSM ’ s disciplinary authority over them is in reality rather theoretical (see paragraph 142 above). The Court also notes the absence of any specific evidence of a lack of impartiality, such as, for instance, the existence of pending disciplinary proceedings against one of the members of the benches that examined the applicant ’ s appeals. In more general terms the Court considers it normal that judges, in the performance of their judicial duties and in various contexts, should have to examine a variety of cases in the knowledge that they may themselves, at some point in their careers, be in a similar position to one of the parties, including the defendant. However, a purely abstract risk of this kind cannot be regarded as apt to cast doubt on the impartiality of a judge in the absence of specific circumstances pertaining to his or her individual situation. Even in the context of disciplinary cases a theoretical risk of this nature, consisting in the fact that judges hearing cases are themselves still subject to a set of disciplinary rules, is not in itself a sufficient basis for finding a breach of the requirements of impartiality."

Referring to various extracts from the Supreme Court ’ s judgments, she highlighted the nature of appeals to that court, which entailed a review of lawfulness rather than a review by a body with full jurisdiction. There was no possibility of effectively re-examining the establishment of the facts, which, in her submission, had been established by the CSM on the basis of insufficient evidence. Likewise, the Supreme Court had not carried out a proper assessment of her disciplinary conduct. Lastly, with regard to the disciplinary penalties imposed, despite finding that it was empowered to examine the severity of each penalty, the Supreme Court had in reality omitted to examine this point on account of the wide discretion afforded to the administrative authorities. While it was true that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention did not guarantee a right of appeal, she had not had access to any level of jurisdiction, as a single administrative entity had been responsible for establishing the facts and determining the disciplinary penalty.

In adopting this approach the Convention organs have had regard to the fact that it is often the case in relation to administrative-law appeals in the member States of the Council of Europe that the extent of judicial review over the facts of a case is limited, and that it is characteristic of review proceedings that the competent authorities review the previous proceedings rather than taking factual decisions. It can be derived from the relevant case-law that it is not the role of Article 6, in principle, to guarantee access to a court which can substitute its own assessment or opinion for that of the administrative authorities. In this regard, the Court has placed particular emphasis on the respect which must be accorded to decisions taken by the administrative authorities on grounds of expediency and which often involve specialised areas of law (see Sigma Radio Television Ltd, cited above, § 153, and the case-law cited therein)."

The Court considered that the independence of judgment in relation to the finding of primary fact was liable to be impaired in a manner which could not be adequately scrutinised or rectified by judicial review. As the competent court had lacked jurisdiction to rehear the evidence and had therefore been unable to determine a crucial issue of fact, the Court found a violation of Article 6 on the ground that the central issue had not been determined by a tribunal that was independent of the parties. In other words, in that case, the impossibility of re-examining a decisive factual issue had prevented the appellate court from remedying the lack of independence from one of the parties to the dispute that had been found at first instance."

By rendering the administration of justice visible, publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 § 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Axen v.

Article 6 § 1 does not, however, prohibit courts from deciding, in the light of the special features of the case submitted to them, to derogate from this principle: in accordance with the actual wording of this provision, ‘ ... the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice ’; holding proceedings, whether wholly or partly, in camera must be strictly required by the circumstances of the case (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, Diennet v.

It is beyond doubt that, in order to address that issue, the CSM had to exercise its discretionary powers. That authority has specific responsibility under the Constitution (see paragraph 70 above) for the autonomous management of the judiciary, and in particular for disciplinary matters concerning judges, with the wider aim of guaranteeing the independence of the justice system (see, mutatis mutandis, Tsanova ‑ Gecheva, cited above, § 100, regarding the power of the Bulgarian Supreme Judicial Council to appoint the President of a court). The Court therefore recognises the particular importance of the CSM ’ s responsibilities under the Constitution in a key area from the perspective of the rule of law and the separation of powers. As a body specifically set up to interpret and apply the rules governing the disciplinary conduct of judges, the CSM has the task of contributing to the smooth operation of the justice system. However, in the instant case, the assessment of the facts and the review of the disciplinary sanctions imposed did not require specialised knowledge or specific professional experience, but could have come within the jurisdiction of any court. This was not a classic exercise of administrative discretion in a specialised area of law (see, conversely, Sigma Radio Television Ltd, cited above, § 161)."

It considers, firstly, that the review of a decision imposing a disciplinary penalty differs from that of an administrative decision that does not entail such a punitive element. Secondly, it notes that the disciplinary proceedings in question concerned a judge. In that connection the Court stresses that, even if they do not come within the scope of Article 6 of the Convention under its criminal head, disciplinary penalties may nevertheless entail serious consequences for the lives and careers of judges. The accusations against the applicant were liable to result in her removal from office or suspension from duty, that is to say, in very serious penalties which carried a significant degree of stigma (see, mutatis mutandis, Grande Stevens and Others v. Italy, nos. 18640/10 and 4 others, § 122, 4 March 2014). In accordance with the general principles set forth above and taking into account the policy objectives pursued by the legislation in this sphere (see paragraph 180 above), the Court considers that the judicial review carried out must be appropriate to the subject-matter of the dispute, that is to say, in the instant case, to the disciplinary nature of the administrative decisions in question. This consideration applies with even greater force to disciplinary proceedings against judges, who must enjoy the respect that is necessary for the performance of their duties. When a member State initiates such disciplinary proceedings, public confidence in the functioning and independence of the judiciary is at stake; in a democratic State, this confidence guarantees the very existence of the rule of law. Furthermore, the Court has stressed the growing importance attached to the separation of powers and to the necessity of safeguarding the independence of the judiciary (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, § 34, Series A no. 313; Kudeshkina v. Russia, no. 29492/05, § 86, 26 February 2009; and Stafford, § 78; Kleyn, § 193; and Baka, § 165, all cited above).",

As to the procedural safeguards applied by that body, the Court is prepared to accept that, as the Government argued, the proceedings conducted in the present case afforded the applicant the opportunity to mount a defence. The applicant was notified of the indictment drawn up by the judicial investigator (see paragraphs 16, 19, 37 and 52 above) and filed defence pleadings (see paragraphs 17, 21, 37 and 53 above).

Firstly, as the Government acknowledged, the CSM is not authorised by law to hold public hearings, and, secondly, in the third set of proceedings it refused the applicant ’ s request for such a hearing on the grounds, inter alia, that there was no legal basis for the case to be heard in public before the CSM sitting in plenary (see paragraph 56 above). Furthermore, the applicant did not have an opportunity to make oral representations, either on the factual issues and the penalties or on the various legal issues.

It considers that the establishment of the facts is especially important in the case of proceedings that entail the imposition of penalties, and in particular disciplinary penalties against judges, as the latter must enjoy the respect that is necessary for the performance of their duties, so as to ensure public confidence in the functioning and independence of the judiciary as such (see paragraph 196 above).",

As to the extent of the review carried out by the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court regarding the establishment of the facts, the Court notes that the Judicial Division took care to set out in detail its powers of review in disciplinary cases as established by Portuguese law, including its own case-law (see paragraphs 29 and 45 above). It stated expressly that it did not have full jurisdiction in the matter but was called upon solely to review the lawfulness of the decisions under challenge. In particular, it stressed that it did not have jurisdiction when it came to “gathering the evidence ( aquisição da matéria instrutória ) or establishing the key facts” (see paragraph 29 above).",
                "It appears therefore that, in view of the limits imposed on it by the legislation and by its own case-law, the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court was not empowered to examine the decisive points in the proceedings, namely the content of the applicant ’ s conversations with the judicial inspector H.G. and with Judge F.M.J. It could only “examine any contradictions, inconsistencies and insufficiency in the evidence and any manifest errors in the assessment thereof, in so far as these defects [were] apparent” (see paragraph 29 above). According to the definition in its own case-law, a “manifest” error “must not just be serious (a gross error, in that it is manifestly contrary to reason, common sense or the truth, or demonstrates inadequate knowledge); it must also be flagrant (manifest)” (see paragraph 81 above)."

Having found that it did not have jurisdiction to re ‑ examine the facts and the evidence, even on the basis of the material in the file sent to it, the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court accordingly refused the applicant ’ s request for a public hearing (see paragraph 64 above). In the Court ’ s view, the dispute as to the facts and the repercussions of the disciplinary penalties on the applicant ’ s reputation made it necessary in the present case for the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court to perform a review that was sufficiently thorough to enable it firstly to determine, for instance, whether the applicant had made certain remarks during her telephone conversation with the judicial inspector H.G. or her private meeting with the judicial investigator F.M.J., and, secondly, to form its own impression of the applicant by affording her an opportunity to explain her version of the situation orally (see, mutatis mutandis, Malhous, § 60; Göç, § 51; Miller, § 34 in fine; Olujić, § 80; and Andersson, § 57, all cited above)."

As the Government argued that a public hearing in the case served no purpose given the limited jurisdiction of the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court regarding the establishment of the facts and the assessment of the evidence (see paragraph 173 above), the Court must examine the necessity of holding a public hearing in the present case. It reiterates in that regard that no hearing was held before the CSM (see paragraph 198 above) and that the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court was the first and only judicial body to examine the applicant ’ s appeals against the CSM ’ s decisions."

In that connection the Court reiterates that, notwithstanding the technical nature of some discussions and depending on what is at stake in the proceedings, public scrutiny may be viewed as a necessary condition for transparency and for the protection of litigants ’ rights. It is true that it has previously found that holding disciplinary proceedings in private with the consent of the person concerned is not contrary to the Convention (see Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere, cited above, § 59). However, in the present case the applicant had requested a public hearing. She should therefore have had the possibility of obtaining a public hearing before a body with full jurisdiction for the purposes of the Convention (see, for example, Martinie, cited above, §§ 43-44, and Vernes v. France, no. 30183/06, § 32, 20 January 2011).

The Judicial Division of the Supreme Court, whose task it was to rule on whether such a measure was necessary, did not declare the applicant ’ s request inadmissible for lack of a legal basis, as the CSM had done, but nevertheless refused it, citing as reasons the scope of its jurisdiction and the supposed irrelevance of the evidence which the applicant wished to have examined (see Jussila, cited above, § 48, and paragraphs 64 and 76 above)."

In view of what is at stake, namely the impact of the possible penalties on the lives and careers of the persons concerned and their financial implications, the Court considers that, in the context of disciplinary proceedings, dispensing with an oral hearing should be an exceptional measure and should be duly justified in the light of the Convention institutions ’ case-law."

On the contrary, the applicant ’ s appeals concerned important factual and legal issues (see paragraph 206 above). Even if the Supreme Court considered that it was not its task to conduct a re-examination of the evidence, it nevertheless had a duty to ascertain whether the factual basis for the decisions taken by the CSM was sufficient to support the latter ’ s conclusions. In such a situation, the importance for the parties of obtaining an adversarial hearing before the body performing the judicial review should not be underestimated (see, mutatis mutandis, Margaretić, cited above, § 128).

Nevertheless, it was empowered to set aside a decision wholly or in part in the event of a “gross, manifest error”, and in particular if it was established that the substantive law or procedural requirements of fairness had not been complied with in the proceedings leading to the adoption of the decision. Thus, it could refer the case back to the CSM for the latter to give a fresh ruling in conformity with any instructions issued by the Judicial Division regarding possible irregularities (see, conversely, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, §§ 125-26, and Kingsley, cited above, § 32).",

                "Rule 13 secures for the judge against whom proceedings are brought all the rights provided for in Article 12 § 5 of the Constitution for persons who are charged with a criminal offence. That constitutional provision secures the well-known rights that an accused has in a criminal trial and are identical to those secured under Articles 6 §§ 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was ratified by the House of Representatives by law in 1962 ( Law 39/62). Furthermore, the provisions of Article 30 of our Constitution, which are the equivalent to those of Article 6 of the Convention, are also applicable.",
                "At no stage did the Supreme Council of Judicature function as a public prosecutor against Mr Kamenos. The President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature did not put a single question to the witnesses who were listed on the charge sheet, or to those summoned on behalf of Mr Kamenos, which might have been construed as cross-examination for the purpose of contesting the witnesses ’ allegations. On the contrary, the President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature asked very few questions, and they were solely for the purpose of clarification; special reference will be made to some of those questions at the appropriate stage. Not a single question was put to Mr Kamenos. The Supreme Council of Judicature was not seeking to pursue a procedure of prosecution against Mr Kamenos in the form of a confrontation between prosecution and defence. For that reason, and despite having such powers under Rule 16, the relevant provision of the Constitution on the judicial process and the procedure to be followed in investigating disciplinary cases, it did not assign the duties of prosecutor to the judge-investigator or to any other judicial official. In that way, which was the declared intention of the Supreme Council of Judicature, more rights were secured for Mr Kamenos than those which he had under the aforementioned Articles of the Constitution and the Rule. That was precisely the aim of the procedure followed by the Supreme Council of Judicature, which essentially remained an audience for the witnesses ’ statements.",
                "It follows that this is the appropriate moment to refer to the suggestion made by Mr Kamenos ’ s lawyer in his final address. Its subject relates directly and absolutely to what we have just said. The lawyer alleged that the Supreme Council of Judicature had functioned in a dual capacity, given that it had judged the case and simultaneously exercised the duties of prosecutor. Clarifying his position, he said that that is inferred from the fact that the President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature put questions to the witnesses. In our opinion, that suggestion is unfounded and unjustifiable. It is unfounded for the reasons which we explained above, and unjustifiable because it conflicts with what the lawyer said to us at the beginning of the proceedings, when he ... spoke in praise of the powers invested by the Constitution in the Supreme Council of Judicature, describing its work as difficult and important [in those instances] when it is called upon to decide whether a judge displayed misconduct and is obliged, again in accordance with the Constitution, to terminate the latter ’ s services in the event of conviction. In brief, Mr Efstathiou not only accepted but also praised as correct the competence, arising from the Constitution, of the Supreme Council of Judicature, which is made up of the full bench of the Members of the Supreme Court, the highest judicial authority in the State.",
                "[The applicant ’ s lawyer ] asked many witnesses to express an opinion on the extent to which they considered that Mr Kamenos ’ s decisions were correct. Most of them, including the lawyers, gave the right reply, namely, that it was not for them to judge Mr Kamenos ’ s decisions. In the same way, the Supreme Council of Judicature is not judging the correctness of Mr Kamenos ’ s decisions. We do not have such competence. That belongs to the Supreme Court. The competence of the Supreme Council of Judicature is only to decide whether the charges of improper behaviour (misconduct) are proved, which [behaviour] in the case we are examining and according to the particulars of the charges, is continuous ( κατά συρροή, διαρκής ) and directly refers to the function of Mr Kamenos as the President of the Industrial Disputes Court.",
                "We previously stated that certain witnesses called by Mr Kamenos, evidently in an endeavour to tone down or explain what the witnesses listed on the charge sheet had testified to and who touched on Mr Kamenos ’ s behaviour in the course of the hearing, in essence confirmed what those witnesses had said. Several examples follow ...",
                "From the evidence that we have analysed above, we find that the charges have been proved.",
                "We wish to clarify that the purpose of this procedure is not to punish Mr Kamenos but to protect the public by adopting of a strict standard of judicial behaviour in order to preserve public confidence in the integrity, prestige and independence of the judicial system. We borrow and adopt the above principle from the decision (Investigation concerning Judge Bruce Van Voorhis, No. 165) given in February 2003 by the Commission of Judicial Performance of the State of California, in the United States of America, which concerned a procedure against a specific judge whose services were also terminated for misconduct, with facts and particulars similar to the case before us. In essence, we translate the principle which that Commission adopted and recorded on page 31 of the decision. The principle is based, as stated in the decision, on what was said by the Supreme Court of the State, that the purpose of the procedure was not to punish judges who have erred but to protect the judicial system and those who are subject to the formidable power exercised by judges.",
                "Evaluating the above with great care, caution and, we would say, anxiety, we are led to the conclusion that everything imputed to Mr Kamenos as stated in the two charges has been proved. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution, which are referred to in our decision, the proof of a charge of misconduct against a judge leads to the termination of his services.”"

                "32. The dissenting judge found in his decision that the evidence was not sufficient to prove such a serious charge as misconduct. As regards the procedure, the judge noted, inter alia, that the Supreme Council of Judicature had asked the witnesses very few questions and that they had been for the purposes of clarification. Furthermore, with regard to the investigation and the object of the hearing, he observed:",
                "“A judicial official with the duties of prosecutor was not appointed, a possibility which is referred to in Rule 16, and we adopted the following approach: every witness read his statement to the investigating officer out loud and, immediately after, was cross-examined by Mr Kamenos ’ s lawyer. During the cross-examination or subsequently members of the Supreme Council of Judicature asked the witnesses a few questions for clarification purposes. This is also exactly what happened in the case of Mr Kamenos and the 36 witnesses called by him.",
                "Before referring to the evidence, it is useful if we outline the methodology which led to the taking of statements by the Investigating Officer. He did not himself take the initiative of collecting evidence in view of the accusation, as he explains in his report. The persons who signed the accusation did not have any personal knowledge of the circumstances and statements were taken from all those they ... named, and from others subsequently named by those who had been initially summoned. The investigation into the manner in which Mr Kamenos exercised his duties in general was therefore not systematic and that is also the reason for not taking statements from a number of other persons whom Mr Kamenos himself indicated. Besides, as we have seen, of the 28 statements which the Investigating Office took, only 15 were attached to the charge sheet, with a further reduction to 10 in the course of the hearing. They did not include statements which, as the Investigating Officer reported, not only expressed no complaints but stated that Mr Kamenos ’ s conduct had been irreproachable in all respects. Consequently, as is in any case self-evident, the object of the hearing is [to determine] whether, on the basis of the evidence of those ten witnesses, the charge has been substantiated as formulated. That is to say, whether, from each individual ’ s evidence and the correlation between them, to the extent possible, there arises conduct as cumulatively stated on the charge sheet, [and] in the case of the second charge “with the result that, owing to the agitation and disruption they were caused, the entire proceedings were diverted from their proper course ”. This (was the wording), without any specification on the charge sheet of a definite, specific incident at a specific time, ... in relation to a specific person in the context of a specific case. The witnesses who remained on the charge sheet (whose statements I shall of course return to), as lay members of the court, or as lawyers or witnesses, did not submit a complaint there and then about what they considered to be objectionable conduct. ... Nor did the litigants in any specific case which could be related to the charge sheet make a complaint at the time, or appeal or employ any other legal means so that any objectionable conduct would be examined also from the aspect of its effect on the final outcome. That was what occurred in the cases of Athanasiou v. Reana Manuf. & Trade Co.Ltd and others (2001) 1 C.L.R. 1635, and Fanos N. Epiphaniou Ltd v. Melarta and others (2002) 1 C.L.R.654, in which the Supreme Court annulled decisions issued by the Industrial Disputes Tribunal under the presidency of Mr Kamenos, using strong language about the degree of his intervention in the proceedings and the appearance of partiality to which it could give rise. Of course, the charge sheet does not extend to those cases and does not concern the issue of interventions as such ... The core of the charge is the conduct attributed to Mr Kamenos at the expense of lay members of the court, lawyers, litigants and witnesses, and it is in the light of such considerations that I shall go on to examine the evidence adduced.”"

The Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) (“ Law no. 33/1964 ” ) was enacted in order to address an emergency situation and to set up the necessary judicial machinery for the continued administration of justice. By virtue of that law, the two highest courts were merged into one, the Supreme Court, to which the jurisdiction and powers of the two earlier courts were transferred. The establishment and operation of the new Supreme Court was held to be in conformity with the Constitution on the basis of the recognised principles of the law of necessity ( the Attorney-General of the Republic v.

It ruled that the Constitution entrusted the appointment of judicial officers exclusively to the SCJ (Article 157 § 2 of the Constitution ). Judicial appointments were closely, even inextricably, interwoven with the exercise of the judicial function; more precisely, they constituted a precondition for the exercise of that function. Entrusting the appointment of judicial officers to the judicial function itself was an aspect of the independence of the judiciary and an expression of the autonomy of that function. Law no. 33/64 had been based on that premise and reflected the constitutional order. The complainant then filed a communication with the United Nations Human Rights Committee ( OP-ICCPR), which was declared inadmissible on 25 July 2005 ( communication no. 1182/2003; decision on admissibility UN.

The offence of misconduct is a disciplinary offence and is limited and linked to the exercise of judicial functions. It does not belong to the criminal sphere.

They submitted that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had not constituted a determination of his civil rights and obligations within the meaning of Article 6 § 1. First, no “right” had existed in the present case: there had been no right to remain as a judge or as President of the IDC and there had been no right not to be dismissed from his post. The applicant did not have arguable grounds on which to claim such a right. Secondly, even if such a right was deemed to exist, it was not “civil” in nature as the two conditions established in the case of Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, § 62, ECHR 2007 ‑ II) had been fulfilled. As to the first condition, the Government observed that the applicant had not had a right of access to a court in order to challenge his removal. Although neither the Constitution nor the applicable procedural rules concerning the exercise of the SCJ ’ s disciplinary authority expressly excluded access to a court in order to challenge the removal of a judge from his post, the Supreme Court had expressly ruled in the cases of Kourris and Karatsis (cited above) that the acts, decisions or omissions of the SCJ could not be challenged by way of a recourse under Article 146 of the Constitution (see paragraphs 43 and 44 above). The applicant had therefore not had access to a court in order to challenge his dismissal."

            [
                "56. As to the second condition set out in Vilho Eskelinen, the Government pointed out that the Court had acknowledged that a judge had specific responsibilities in the field of the administration of justice, which was a sphere in which States exercised sovereign power. A judge participated directly in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and performed duties designed to safeguard the general interest of the State (relying on Serdal Apay v. Turkey (dec.), no. 3964/05, 11 December 2007; Muammer Yilmazoǧlu v. Turkey (dec.), no. 36593/97, 12 June 2003 and Pitkevich v. Russia (dec.), no. 47936, 8 February 2001). The exclusion from access to court by domestic law was justified on objective grounds and in the State ’ s interests. In the Karatsis case the Supreme Court had highlighted that judicial appointments were inextricably interwoven with the exercise of the judicial function and, more precisely, constituted a precondition for the exercise of that function. Entrusting the appointment of judicial officers to the judicial function itself constituted an aspect of the independence of the judiciary and was an expression of the autonomy of its function (see paragraph 44 above). In the present case, the applicant, as a judge at the IDC, and even more so as its president, had occupied a post of the highest rank in the field of the administration of justice. He had had powers conferred by public law and had assumed duties to safeguard the general interests of the State. The applicant ’ s misconduct had eroded public confidence in the integrity and independence of the judicial function as a whole. As stated by the SCJ in its decision in the present case, the purpose of the procedure had not been to punish the applicant, but rather to protect the public by adopting a strict standard of judicial conduct so as to preserve the public ’ s trust in the integrity, reputation and independence of the judicial system (see paragraph 31 above). Preventing the applicant from having access to a court had therefore been justified on objective grounds and the subject matter of the dispute had been related to the exercise of State power."

Any public ‑ law features of a disciplinary nature in the case did not exclude the proceedings from the scope of Article 6 since their outcome had been severe and far-reaching : the applicant had been dismissed from his post, affecting his career and professional activities. The fact that Articles 12 § 5 and 30 of the Constitution, which contained equivalent guarantees to Article 6 of the Convention, had been applicable to the disciplinary proceedings were indicative of the civil nature of the right at stake."

It emerged clearly from the Court ’ s judgment in Vilho Eskelinen (cited above) that only the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question could justify not applying Article 6. Such a case would have to involve a particular portion of sovereignty being given to the civil servant, creating a special bond of trust. That had not been the case in the present application."

The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 § 1 into play (see, among many authorities, Regner v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 35289/11, § 99, 19 September 2017; Károly Nagy v.

In so far as the “civil” nature of the right is concerned, in cases concerning employment disputes concerning civil servants the Court, applies a two-tier test which it established in its Grand Chamber judgment in Vilho Eskelinen (cited above - hereinafter referred to as the “ Eskelinen test ” ). In order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. First, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, a “special bond of trust and loyalty” between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond (ibid., §§ 102-103). Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question (ibid., § 103). There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified ( ibid. , § 103 )."

However, it emerges from many of those cases that the existence of the possibility of review is not per se a sine qua non in order for the first condition of the Eskelinen test to be fulfilled. So in Saghatelyan v. Armenia (no. 7984/06, § § 32-35, 20 October 2015), in which the applicant had been dismissed as a judge on the basis of a presidential decree following a recommendation by the Council of Justice, the Court considered that the first condition of the test had not been satisfied. It observed in that regard, first, that the Government had not mentioned a particular provision of the law which expressly excluded judicial protection in connection with disciplinary proceedings against judges and, second, that although at the material time it had not been possible to challenge a presidential decree, as this applied to all individuals, national law did not rule out access to court for the applicant based on her status as a holder of public power. In Harabin v. Slovakia ( no. 58688/11, 20 November 2012), disciplinary proceedings were brought against the applicant, who was the President of the Supreme Court, before the Constitutional Court. It found him guilty of a serious disciplinary offence and imposed a disciplinary sanction (§§ 36-37). The decision was final, there being no remedy against the Constitutional Court ’ s decisions (§ 54). In applying the Eskelinen test, the Court observed that the Constitutional Court was a tribunal with powers to determine the relevant issues. National law therefore did not exclude a judicial examination of the relevant points and the applicant had actually had access to a court (§ 123). The Court thus took the approach that even though the disciplinary proceedings brought against the applicant were only examined at one level of jurisdiction, that qualified as “access to court” for the purposes of the first condition of the Eskelinen test."

The Court highlighted that in the context of the first condition, it was not prevented from categorising a particular domestic body, outside the domestic judiciary, as a “court” for the purposes of the Eskelinen test. In that connection, it reiterated that for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention a tribunal need not be a court of law integrated with the standard judicial machinery since a tribunal, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, was characterised in the substantive sense of the term by its judicial function, that is to say, the determining of matters within its competence on the basis of rules of law and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner. Consequently, a non-judicial body, for example an administrative or parliamentary body, may qualify as a “court” in the substantive sense of the term if it performed judicial functions ( see also Savino and Others v. Italy, nos. 17214/05 and 2 others, § § 72-75, 28 April 2009 )."

It noted that the proceedings before the National Judicial Council followed the rules of criminal procedure, which included, inter alia, all the guarantees provided by Article 6 of the Convention and enabled the accused to submit a defence. When ruling in disciplinary proceedings against judges, the National Judicial Council was empowered to establish the facts of a given case, hold hearings, hear witnesses and assess other evidence and decide on all the questions of fact and law. It therefore concluded that in that case the National Judicial Council had exercised judicial powers in determining the applicant ’ s disciplinary responsibility and thus that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had been conducted before a tribunal for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

In that regard, it observed that the High Council of Justice had determined all the questions of fact and law after holding a hearing and assessing the evidence, the Parliamentary Committee had been empowered to hold its own deliberations and conduct additional inquiries, if deemed necessary, which could end with a recommendation to dismiss or retain the judge and that the plenary of Parliament had subsequently approved dismissing the applicant based on the HCJ ’ s submissions and the Parliamentary Committee ’ s recommendation."

The decisions were then reviewed by the Supreme Court of Georgia. The Court observed that the disciplinary bodies that had conducted the proceedings had clearly performed a judicial function and that the Disciplinary Council of Judges clearly represented “a tribunal” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In Di Giovanni v. Italy ( no. 51160/06, § 37, 9 July 2013) the Court observed that the first - instance body – the disciplinary section of the Supreme Judicial Council ­ – had full jurisdiction to examine all the questions raised in the case. The fact that the decision could be appealed against before the Court of Cassation ( Sezioni Unite ) was an additional factor. Similarly, in several recent judgments against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Court observed in the context of the first condition that the first - instance disciplinary body, the State Judicial Council, determined all questions of facts and law after holding hearings and assessing evidence ( Poposki and Duma v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 69916/10 and 36531/11, § 37, 7 January 2016; Gerovska Popčevska v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 48783/07, § 58, 7 January 2016; Jakšovski and Trifunovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 56381/09 and 58738/09, § 32, 7 January 2016; and Mitrinovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 6899/12, § 29, 30 April 2015 )."

The Government pointed out that the Court had held in cases concerning criminal proceedings that the test to be applied was whether in a given case there was a legitimate reason to fear that a tribunal lacked impartiality and that the standpoint of the accused was important but not decisive. The Court looked at whether there were objective reasons for the applicant to fear that the tribunal in question would display bias or prejudice with regard to the decision that it was required to reach. Therefore a situation which might occasion misgivings on the part of the accused could not necessarily be treated as objectively justified (relying on Hauschildt v. Denmark, 24 May 1989, § 4 9, Series A no. 154). This depended on the circumstances of the particular case (ibid.). The mere fact that the same court had also made pre-trial decisions in a case was not in itself sufficient to justify fears as to its impartiality ( relying on Jasiński v.

There had been no objective reasons for him to fear that the SCJ, which had appointed him as a judge and had also promoted him to the post of President of the IDC, would display bias or prejudice with regard to the decision that it was required to reach in the proceedings on account of the fact that it had previously decided in its capacity as the Supreme Court that the matter of the applicant ’ s conduct should be further dealt with in disciplinary proceedings and had framed the “charges” against him. The Court has reiterated that its task is not to review the relevant law and practice in abstracto."

The Government observed that the Procedural Rules referred to “prosecution”, to the framing and hearing of “charges” and used other terminology pertinent to criminal proceedings when misconduct or the commission of disciplinary offences by judges of lower courts were concerned. However, in reality the actual proceedings had been disciplinary and not criminal in nature and had not been aimed at punishing the applicant but maintaining the public ’ s trust in the integrity, prestige and independence of the judicial system through the adoption of strict standards of judicial conduct. In dealing with the investigation material submitted to it by the investigating judge, the Supreme Court ’ s role had been to examine whether, based on the statements that had been made, the conduct allegedly exhibited by the applicant had raised a disciplinary issue which needed to be determined in trial proceedings conducted with procedural safeguards. Under domestic law therefore, the Supreme Court ’ s function at that phase had not been to weigh the witness statements, including those of the applicant, to assess their veracity or to assess or determine in any way whether they had pointed to guilt or to any suspicion of guilt. It had also not had the function of assessing whether there was a prima facie case against the applicant as that could only be determined by the SCJ, which heard the case. It had therefore not dealt with the same issues that had been subsequently examined by the SCJ. The Supreme Court ’ s assessment that the investigation material had justified referring the applicant for trial had not been such as to convey a conviction that the applicant had been guilty of misconduct as alleged, and could not therefore be considered as amounting to a finding of guilt."

The core issue in the disciplinary proceedings, and the one on which the SCJ ’ s decision had been based, had been whether the witnesses had been honest as the applicant ’ s defence all along had been that they had not told the truth. The Supreme Court had not dealt with that issue and had not interviewed any of the persons who had been interviewed by the investigating judge. The witnesses had not given particulars in their statements of specific IDC proceedings in which the applicant ’ s misconduct had allegedly arisen, nor had the files or records of such proceedings been before the Supreme Court when it had taken its decision."

Under domestic law the applicant had had the right to be heard, and to cross-examine and question witnesses before a decision was made as to whether there was a prima facie case against him and to bring witnesses in his defence. It was also evident from the SCJ ’ s judgment and the record of the disciplinary proceedings that the SCJ had not assumed any role in the proceedings analogous to that of a prosecuting authority but had maintained its role of an adjudicating disciplinary body, refraining from any questioning analogous to that of the examination in chief of witnesses testifying against the applicant or to that of the cross-examination of witnesses testifying in his defence.",

According to the Court ’ s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to a subjective test where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge, that is, whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and also according to an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 73, ECHR 2015, with further references)."

            [
                "97. As to the subjective test, the principle that a tribunal must be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long-established in the case-law of the Court. The personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary. As regards the type of proof required, the Court has, for example, sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or ill will for personal reasons (ibid., § 74)."

                "98. In the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues the Court has focused on the objective test. However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (ibid., § 75)."

As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge ’ s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified ( ibid., § 7 6)."

In the instant case likewise, such intervention cannot suffice to establish that the right asserted by the applicant did not have this character.",

As evidence of this, the Government cited in particular the monopoly of the right of audience; the possibility of being officially assigned by the court in both criminal and civil proceedings; the duty in some cases to stand in for judges and members of Crown prosecutors ’ departments; and the duty of the Council of the Ordre to set up a Legal Advice and Defence Office to assist persons of limited means.",

This attachment is not decisive, however. It does not preclude the practice of the profession of avocat, as such, from having a civil character. Moreover, there is no concomitant joint or individual subordination to the country ’ s courts. On the contrary, in virtue of its traditional independence, the Bar has complete responsibility for its roll, on the one hand, and for discipline, on the other. Under the Judicial Code, which enshrines the Court of Cassation ’ s case-law on the subject, the Council of the Ordre draws up the roll, and no appeal lies from its decisions in this matter (see paragraph 27 above). The power of determining appeals against disciplinary decisions by the Council of the Ordre has been vested since 1967 in disciplinary appeals boards consisting of the President of the Court of Appeal and four avocats; previously it had been vested in the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 29 above)."

                "(a) To begin with, the profession of avocat has traditionally been treated as one of the independent professions in Belgium. According to the terms of Article 444 of the Judicial Code,\" avocats perform the duties of their office freely in the interests of justice and truth\". Once entered on the roll of the Ordre, a member of the Bar is free to practise or not. Unless officially assigned to a case by the court, he has clients whom he chooses voluntarily and directly, without any intervention by a public authority; he can refuse to act if his conscience so dictates and even for other reasons. The instructions to act which bind him to his client are revocable at will by either party and constitute a private-law relationship. As to fees, the avocat fixes them himself \"with the judiciousness to be expected of [his] office\" (Article 459 of the Judicial Code) and subject to the client ’ s agreement, except that the Council of the Ordre may intervene on grounds of excessive charging (ibid.).",
                "(b) In the second place, the chambers and clientèle of an avocat constitute property interests and as such come within the ambit of the right of property, which is a civil right within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van Marle and Others judgment of 26 June 1986, Series A no. 101, p. 13, § 41).",
                "(c) It may also be noted that while avocats enjoy an exclusive right of audience in the courts, they perform numerous important duties out of court, acting as advisers, conciliators and even arbitrators. These duties, which sometimes take up a great deal of time, are a traditional and normal feature of the profession. Yet they often have no connection with judicial proceedings.

Thus neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) prevents an avocat from waiving, of his own free will and in an unequivocal manner, the entitlement to have his case heard in public; conducting disciplinary proceedings of this kind in private does not contravene the Convention (loc. cit., p. 19, § 35).",

France, 16 December 1992, § 32, Series A no. 253 ‑ B ). The rationale behind dispensing with a personal service is that this type of proceedings may involve large numbers of creditors and parties.

They are precluded from doing so at a later stage, including by appealing against the decision on the distribution (see paragraph 52 above).

The Court sees no reason why the applicant should not have trusted the receiver, in particular bearing in mind the rather low number of creditors in the proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, De Geouffre de la Pradelle, cited above, § 33).

The Court referred in this judgment (ibid., §§ 64-65), among other authorities, to J.J. v. the Netherlands relied on by the Chamber in its reasoning. Although it is true that the Court found no violation of Article 6 § 1 on the facts in Kress, it must be stressed that the circumstances of the instant case are different. In Kress, the Court noted that the Government Commissioner made his submissions for the first time orally at the public hearing of a case before the Conseil d'Etat and that the parties to the proceedings, the judges and the public all learned of their content and the recommendation made in them on that occasion (ibid., § 73). Furthermore, in Kress it was not contested that a lawyer who so wishes can ask the Government Commissioner, before the hearing, to indicate the general tenor of his submissions and reply to the Commissioner's submissions by means of a memorandum and in the event of the latter raising orally at the hearing a ground not raised by the parties the presiding judge would adjourn the case to enable the parties to reply (ibid., § 76).

It appears to the Court that this requirement is not secured in domestic law. The Government have contended that the applicant's lawyer should have known that consultation of the case file was possible as a matter of practice. However, the Court considers that to require the applicant's lawyer to take the initiative and inform himself periodically on whether any new elements have been included in the case file would amount to imposing a disproportionate burden on him and would not necessarily have guaranteed a real opportunity to comment on the opinion since he was never made aware of the timetable for the processing of the appeal (see, mutatis mutandis, Brandstetter v. Austria, judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 211, pp. 27-28, § 67). It notes in this connection that the opinion was drawn up on 17 October 1996 and submitted to the competent division on 21 October 1996 along with the case file. The division reached its decision on 7 November 1996."

It cannot be denied that a “right” to compensation arose in the circumstances, having regard to the clear language of the provisions of Law no. 466 and to the domestic authorities' finding that the applicant had been detained for two days before being released without charge (see paragraph 23 above). The award of compensation was not at the discretion of the domestic court once it was established that the statutory conditions had been fulfilled (see Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 327-A, p. 19, § 51). Indeed, the Government have not disputed that the applicant had a right to compensation in the circumstances (see paragraph 40 above). As to whether that right was a “civil” right within the meaning of Article 6, it is sufficient, in a case of this nature involving a claim under a statutory compensation scheme, that the subject matter of the applicant's action was pecuniary and that the outcome of the domestic proceedings was decisive for his right to compensation (see, mutatis mutandis and as regards similar statutory compensation schemes, Georgiadis v. Greece judgment of 29 May 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III, p. 958-59, §§ 30-35, and Werner v. Austria, judgment of 24 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p. 2508, § 38)."

However, a hearing was warranted in his case. He was unlawfully deprived of his liberty and had had to spend three days in police custody, during which time he was ill-treated. He was never given the opportunity to explain orally to a court in the context of an adversarial procedure the injustice which had been done to him and to his family. According to the applicant, had he been given the opportunity to state his case to the domestic courts, they would have been persuaded of the reality of the suffering which he and his family endured and of the harm caused to his reputation. In the event, he was awarded a derisory amount of compensation.",

The only issue before the domestic courts was the amount of compensation to be awarded to him. The facts of the case, including the length of the detention, and the legal provisions to be applied were clear. Significantly, the applicant did not on appeal seek to adduce any new evidence in his favour, simply confining himself to a request for increased compensation. In the absence of any exceptional circumstances, and the applicant had not alluded to any, an oral hearing was not required. Furthermore, had the domestic courts taken the view that the applicant's claim raised important public-interest considerations, a hearing could have been organised. Quite apart from this possibility, there was nothing to prevent the applicant under the Code of Criminal Procedure from requesting a public hearing before the Court of Cassation or from relying on Article 438 of the Code of Civil Procedure in order to request a hearing before that instance (see paragraph 33 above).",
                "The Government stated that Law no. 466 was intended to provide a speedy means for dealing with compensation claims without the expense and delay of an oral hearing. The legislative scheme was thus consistent with the trend in European countries towards arbitration and mediation in the context of minor disputes and the move away from oral hearings. The Government endorsed the reasons given by Judges Makarczyk and Türmen in their separate opinion, reasons which, they maintained, were firmly supported by the Court's case-law in this area."

The Chamber considered that it was unnecessary to rule on the merits of this complaint since it had concluded that the facts of the case disclosed a breach of the applicant's right to an adversarial procedure. The Grand Chamber, for its part, considers that the two complaints raised by the applicant under Article 6 are distinct and thus merit separate consideration. It is true that the complaints, taken separately, each amount to a criticism of the fairness of the domestic proceedings within the meaning of paragraph 1 of that Article. However, given the fundamental nature of the right to a public hearing, of which the right to an oral hearing is one aspect, the Court is of the view that the applicant's complaint under this head cannot be taken to be absorbed by a finding that his right to an adversarial procedure was breached. The complaint should therefore be considered separately on its merits, the more so as it was the applicant's principal complaint under Article 6."

At no stage was he afforded an opportunity to state his case orally before the domestic courts. Although the Government contend that the applicant could have requested the Court of Cassation under Article 438 of the Code of Civil Procedure to hold a hearing, it is not persuaded that any such request would have had any prospects of success. The Court notes that, although the applicant's claim was civil in nature, the relevant procedure would appear to be governed by the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure with jurisdiction entrusted to the criminal courts. Even assuming that Article 438 of the Code of Civil Procedure could have provided the basis for a request for a hearing before the Court of Cassation, the crucial issue is whether the applicant should have been afforded an oral hearing before the Karşıyaka Assize Court, the tribunal which was responsible for establishing the facts of the case and assessing the amount of compensation to be awarded to the applicant. To the extent that the Government imply this, the applicant cannot be considered to have waived his right to an oral hearing by failing to request one before the Court of Cassation since that court did not have full jurisdiction to substitute its own view of the amount of compensation which should be awarded to the applicant for that of the first-instance court (see, mutatis mutandis, Diennet v.

The Government have not contended that the Karşıyaka Assize Court made its award with reference to a fixed scale of compensation based solely on the number of days spent in detention before release. On the contrary, the Karşıyaka Assize Court took note of all the complaints set out in the petition lodged by the applicant's lawyer and had regard to a series of personal factors, namely the financial and social status of the applicant and, in particular, the extent of the emotional suffering which he endured during the period of his detention (see paragraph 23 above)."

In the Court's opinion, the applicant should have been afforded an opportunity to explain orally to the Karşıyaka Assize Court the moral damage which his detention entailed for him in terms of distress and anxiety. The essentially personal nature of the applicant's experience, and the determination of the appropriate level of compensation, required that he be heard. It cannot be said that these matters are technical in nature and could have been dealt with properly on the basis of the case file alone. On the contrary, the Court considers that the administration of justice and the accountability of the State would have been better served in the applicant's case by affording him the right to explain his personal situation in a hearing before the domestic court subject to public scrutiny.

The applicant insisted that the role of the Office of the Principal Public Prosecutor cannot be said to be a purely administrative one limited to the verification and technical transmission of the case file to the Court of Cassation, as claimed by the Government. The applicant maintained that the fact that the Principal Public Prosecutor's opinion was accessible to the parties before the Court of Cassation should not be given any decisive weight. In the first place, domestic law did not regulate the stage at which the opinion was to be submitted to the Court of Cassation or how long the case file rested with the first-instance court before it was transferred to the Court of Cassation for the Principal Public Prosecutor's attention. It was also impossible to discover the date on which the competent division of the Court of Cassation considered the opinion and took a decision. These factors, along with the physical distance between İzmir, where the applicant lives, and Ankara, where the court was based, undermined the accessibility argument. The applicant also pointed out that this general ambiguity in the procedure was further compounded by the fact that nothing was stated in Turkish law about the non-participation of the Principal Public Prosecutor in the deliberations of the divisions of the Court of Cassation. For the applicant, what was decisive was that the relevant division of the Court of Cassation read the opinion and rejected his appeal in accordance with the Principal Public Prosecutor's recommendation."

The opinion took the form of a one-page document in which the Principal Public Prosecutor, whose office is independent of the executive and of the parties to the litigation, indicated his view on whether the first-instance decision should be quashed or upheld.",
                "In the applicant's case, the Principal Public Prosecutor advised that the division should reject both the applicant's and the Treasury's appeals against the first-instance judgment. Accordingly, his opinion could not be said to have breached the principle of respect for equality of arms between the opposing parties. The fact that he did not advise the division to increase the award was due to his role in maintaining uniformity of awards in this area. Furthermore, the Principal Public Prosecutor was not entitled to attend the division's deliberations. Thus, he could have had no influence on the decision reached. The Government further maintained with reference to Article 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that the applicant could at any stage have access to the Principal Public Prosecutor's opinion since it was included in the case file before the division of the Court of Cassation. It would have been open to the applicant to file an additional appeal petition in response to the opinion.

The Court observes that the role of the Principal Public Prosecutor before the Court of Cassation was to advise on the merits of the appeals brought by the applicant and the Treasury.

His opinion was accordingly intended to influence the outcome of the Court of Cassation's decision.",

In the Court's opinion, having regard to the nature of the Principal Public Prosecutor's submissions and to the fact that the applicant was not given an opportunity to make written observations in reply there has been an infringement of the applicant's right to adversarial proceedings. That right means in principle the opportunity for the parties to a civil or criminal trial to have knowledge of and comment on all evidence adduced or observations filed, even by an independent member of the national legal service, such as the Principal Public Prosecutor in the instant case, with a view to influencing the court's decision (see, among many other authorities, J.J. v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 March 1998, Reports 1998-II, p. 613, § 43).",

However, while this neutral approach may have ensured equality of arms between the parties at the appeal stage it still remained the case that the applicant disputed the amount of damages awarded by the lower court. He was therefore entitled to have full knowledge of any submissions which undermined his prospects of success before the Court of Cassation."

In endorsing this reasoning, the Court disagrees with the Government's view that its ruling in Kress, cited above, taken together with their argument regarding the accessibility of the Principal Public Prosecutor's opinion should lead to a different conclusion. In Kress the Court reaffirmed its case-law on the scope of the right to an adversarial procedure in circumstances where the submissions of an independent legal officer in a civil or criminal case are not disclosed in advance to the parties and the latter have no possibility of replying to them. The Court referred in this judgment (ibid., §§ 64-65), among other authorities, to J.J. v. the Netherlands relied on by the Chamber in its reasoning. Although it is true that the Court found no violation of Article 6 § 1 on the facts in Kress, it must be stressed that the circumstances of the instant case are different. In Kress, the Court noted that the Government Commissioner made his submissions for the first time orally at the public hearing of a case before the Conseil d'Etat and that the parties to the proceedings, the judges and the public all learned of their content and the recommendation made in them on that occasion (ibid., § 73). Furthermore, in Kress it was not contested that a lawyer who so wishes can ask the Government Commissioner, before the hearing, to indicate the general tenor of his submissions and reply to the Commissioner's submissions by means of a memorandum and in the event of the latter raising orally at the hearing a ground not raised by the parties the presiding judge would adjourn the case to enable the parties to reply (ibid., § 76).

As to the argument that the applicant could have consulted the case file at the Court of Cassation and obtained a copy of the Principal Public Prosecutor's opinion, the Court is of the view that this of itself is not a sufficient safeguard to ensure the applicant's right to an adversarial procedure. In its view, and as a matter of fairness, it was incumbent on the registry of the Court of Cassation to inform the applicant that the opinion had been filed and that he could, if he so wished, comment on it in writing. It appears to the Court that this requirement is not secured in domestic law. The Government have contended that the applicant's lawyer should have known that consultation of the case file was possible as a matter of practice. However, the Court considers that to require the applicant's lawyer to take the initiative and inform himself periodically on whether any new elements have been included in the case file would amount to imposing a disproportionate burden on him and would not necessarily have guaranteed a real opportunity to comment on the opinion since he was never made aware of the timetable for the processing of the appeal (see, mutatis mutandis, Brandstetter v.

The CNEA, which had no separate legal personality, was attached to the school ’ s budget. The headmaster of the school was the director and authorising officer in respect of expenditure, and the applicant, who was appointed general secretary of the centre, was the accountant.

In its judgment, the Regional Audit Office noted that there was no resolution by the board of governors of the Lycée René- Cassin authorising these allowances – whereas that was the only body with power to set up a system of allowances – and, referring to the relevant provisions, pointed out that “the public accountant must satisfy himself that the documents he submits in support of the payments for which he takes charge are issued by the appropriate authority”."

Replying to the Government ’ s submission, with reference to Pellegrin v. France ( [GC], no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ VIII ), that account had to be taken of the fact that the “obligation” in question related to the relationship between public servants exercising powers conferred by public law and the authorities, the Chamber held as follows:",

In their submission, public accountants “ had responsibilities affecting matters of general interest and participated in the exercise of powers conferred by public law, wielding a portion of the sovereign power of the State ”.",

France (no. 53929/00, 1 June 2004), concerning de facto management of public funds, to the purely objective procedure of examining accounts rendered by public accountants. They pointed out that the internal rules of procedure followed by the public finance courts when auditing accounts were distinct from those followed in cases of de facto management of public funds, having regard to the difference in nature and subject of those two types of procedure. In the Government ’ s submission, the position of a public accountant was not comparable to that of a tortfeasor; nor did he incur liability on the basis of obligations comparable to contractual obligations under the civil law. They observed in that connection that judicial audits of accounts were merely intended to check that the accounts rendered were in order.",
                "The Government added that a judicial audit of accounts rendered by a public accountant involved only an indirect pecuniary issue for the public accountant in question. Firstly, his only obligation on a judicial audit of his accounts was to produce proof of the entries in the accounts submitted to the audit office for examination and, secondly, it remained entirely uncertain, after judgment was delivered, that he would be surcharged in respect of the deficit disclosed. On the latter point the Government pointed out that, where applicable, the judgment was limited to noting the expenditure paid by the accountant – or the outstanding sums due and not collected by him – without proper or adequate reasons and requesting him, not to repay the amounts in question, but to put the accounts in order. Making good the deficit recorded in the judgment from the accountant ’ s own assets was only one method of putting the accounts in order. The accountant ’ s financial position was not determined until a later stage, and then not by the public finance courts but by the Minister of Finance, who had a statutory power to discharge accountants in respect of their accounts or grant them remission, on a non-contentious application, in respect of the deficit in the event of force majeure or if there had been no negligence, after assessing any professional failings on the part of the accountant in the exercise of his duties and his ability to contribute to settling the amounts in question. If the Minister decided in the accountant ’ s favour, this amounted to regularisation of the accounts to the extent that the accountant had been discharged of liability or granted remission of the deficit. The Government argued on that basis that it was only at that stage, and not when the accounts were being objectively assessed by the public finance courts, that a civil obligation of the accountant could be regarded as being in issue.",
                "The Government stated that, on the basis both of the foregoing considerations and of their previous observations on admissibility ( see admissibility decision of 13 January 2004, cited above, § 20 ), they still considered that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was inapplicable to the present case."

He laid particular emphasis on the fact that the financial liability of public accountants was akin to contractual obligations under civil law and that the outcome of proceedings relating to a judicial audit of accounts could substantially affect the exercise of property rights by the accountant concerned and his or her assets, since the amount owed corresponded to the capital plus interest. He referred in that connection to the case-law of the Convention institutions ( in particular the opinion of the European Commission of Human Rights in Muyldermans v. Belgium (23 October 1991, Series A no. 214-A) ). In the observations he submitted at the admissibility stage he had also contended that, in accordance with the judgment in Pellegrin, cited above, Article 6 § 1 was applicable to his case because, as a civil servant in the State education service appointed as a school ’ s accountant, his employment had not entailed participating in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and the performance of duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public bodies."

However, this principle of exclusion, the Court observed, had been limited and clarified in a number of cases. In particular, Article 6 § 1 had been considered to apply where the claim in issue related to a “purely economic” or “essentially economic ” right and did not mainly call in question “the authorities ’ discretionary powers ”.",

In its view, “ the only disputes excluded from the scope of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention are those which are raised by public servants whose duties typify the specific activities of the public service in so far as the latter is acting as the depositary of public authority responsible for protecting the general interests of the State or other public authorities ” ( see § 66). “ In practice, the Court will ascertain, in each case, whether the applicant ’ s post entails – in the light of the nature of the duties and responsibilities appertaining to it – direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public authorities ” ( ibid. )."

The Chamber mainly had regard to the special nature of the dispute between the applicant and the State in reaching the conclusion that the obligations on the applicant were “civil” ones within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, with private-law features predominating in this case. In the Grand Chamber ’ s view, in the light of the judgment in Pellegrin regard should rather be had to the applicant ’ s post, the nature of his duties and the responsibilities attached to the post. The case involved a civil servant in the employ of the State education service who had been appointed by the Director of Education as accountant of a school and was responsible, in that capacity, for the accounts of a secondary school and of those of a centre attached to it that had no separate legal personality. Neither the nature of the duties carried out by the applicant, nor the responsibilities attached to them, support the view that he participated “ in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public authorities ”, unless these concepts are to be construed broadly.

They referred to the following in that connection : the fact that the proceedings were in written form (as provided for in Articles L. 140-7 and R. 241-27 of the Financial Judicature Code), which excluded any reference to oral evidence such as interviews or examinations – except on a judicial audit of accounts rendered by de facto accountants – and obliged the court to base its judgment solely on the documents submitted by the accountant in support of the accounts; “the settled principle that a final ruling cannot be adopted unless all the parties have been able to reply in writing to an initial interim ruling (known as the ‘ double judgment ’ rule) within a period of not less than one month; access to the documents on which the final judgment or interim ruling was based, including State Counsel ’ s findings but excluding the investigation report (other than in cases of de facto management)” ( sic ); the statutory obligation, laid down in Article R. 231-5 of the Financial Judicature Code, to set out and examine, in final judgments, the submissions made by the parties concerned by interim rulings ( injunctions, reservations ); the absolute principle that decisions are made collegially (Articles L. 241-13, R. 141-1 and R. 241-1 of the Financial Judicature Code), which prevented the reporting judge from taking a decision alone and obliged him, under Article R. 141-7 of the Code, to put forward reasoned proposals in the light of which the court must rule; and the systematic appointment, before the Court of Audit, of a “counter - reporting” senior judge having, among other duties, the task of giving his opinion on each of the proposals submitted by the reporting judge ( Articles R. 141-7 and R. 141-8 of the Financial Judicature Code ), this being possible in the regional audit offices as well."

The Government acknowledged, nevertheless, that hearings on appeal to the Court of Audit from a judgment of the regional audit office levying a surcharge against a public accountant were not public and that the parties were neither invited to attend nor even notified of the date. They pointed out, however, “as a preliminary point”, that, as the applicant had neither requested that the appeal be heard in public nor sought leave to address the Court of Audit before it ruled on his appeal, he was “not justified in complaining of the lack of an oral hearing on the appeal before the Court of Audit”. Furthermore, the lack of a public hearing on an appeal against a judicial audit of accounts was not, in any event, they argued, contrary to the requirements of Article 6 § 1 given the “objective” and highly technical nature of judicial audits of public accounts (in connection with this point, the Government referred to the following authorities: Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263; Ernst and Others v. Belgium, no. 33400/96, 15 July 2003; and Varela Assalino v. Portugal ( dec. ), no. 64336/01, 25 April 2002). Verification of the voluminous accounts submitted annually by public accountants, and of the existence and validity of the supporting documents produced for every sum spent or unrecovered, was far better dealt with in writing than orally. Moreover, the Government added, compliance with the adversarial character of proceedings was also guaranteed, at first instance, by the aforementioned “double judgment” rule, which protected the rights of the defence in particular. They went on to point out that, generally speaking, the public finance courts did not rule on charges brought against an accountant by a public body, but themselves identified, where applicable, operations that might engage the accountant ’ s liability. They did not reach their decision until the end of adversarial and written proceedings, which placed the parties in a wholly identical position since judgments and interim rulings were served on them in accordance with the same formal requirements and gave them the same opportunity to reply; the public body concerned did not take part in hearings when these were not public either. In short, in the instant case the applicant had not suffered any disadvantage in the presentation of his case before the public finance courts compared with the school of which he was the accountant."

                "With regard to the reporting judge ’ s participation in the deliberations of the Court of Audit, the Government contended that on an appeal to the Court of Audit against a judgment levying a surcharge against a public accountant the Court of Audit judge in whom these functions were vested was the “ officer ” of the bench before which he put forward the submissions relied on by the parties in their pleadings and made proposals on the basis of the file, which were circumscribed by the parties ’ claims. He did not play any part in instigating the proceedings, formulating the complaints or determining the scope of the court ’ s intervention. His role was not in any way comparable to that of an investigating judge: he did not prepare the appeal for examination by the court, this being the task of the Government Commissioner attached to the regional audit office; nor, being bound by the terms of the investigation, did he have the task of making enquiries designed to identify whether an irregularity had been committed and, if so, by whom. Whilst he was invested with powers under Articles R. 141-2 and R. 141-3 of the Financial Judicature Code, these powers were only exceptionally used on appeal, since the file was complete at that stage. Moreover, in the present case there was nothing to suggest that the reporting judge had needed to use those powers before the Court of Audit. Referring, mutatis mutandis, to Didier v. France ( (dec.), no. 58188/00, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII ), the Government asked the Court to hold that the reporting judge ’ s participation in the deliberations did not raise any issue under Article 6 of the Convention."

It was privileged from disclosure and could not therefore be communicated to the parties. In that connection, moreover, it could be seen from the case-law of the Conseil d ’ Etat (14 December 2001, Sté Réflexion, Médiations, Ripostes ) that Principal State Counsel could not be regarded as a party unless he had instituted the proceedings, either by means of a formal application or by exercising his right of appeal, which had not been the case here.",

He argued on that basis that France had already taken note of the need to hold public hearings and respect the principle of adversarial process before that court in cases involving de facto management of public funds or the imposition of a fine. In his submission, nothing absolved it from the duty to apply the same procedural rules to proceedings in which judgment was given levying a surcharge against a public accountant. He added that the double judgment rule relied on by the Government only partially guaranteed an adversarial process since the proceedings continued to be conducted exclusively in writing, and in any event the Court of Audit had not deemed it appropriate to apply it to his appeal."

His task was to ensure that accounts were duly produced by the accountants and “satisfy the court regarding his conception of the application of the law”, and he formulated his written submissions on the basis of the reports communicated to him (Article R.112-8 of the Financial Judicature Code provided that reports relating to a surcharge had to be sent to Principal State Counsel). Once he gave an opinion he became, objectively speaking, an “ally” or “opponent” within the meaning of the judgment in Borgers v. Belgium (30 October 1991, Series A no. 214-B). The fact that, prior to the hearing, the reporting judge ’ s report was sent to him and not to the public accountant concerned was therefore incompatible with the principle of equality of arms. To that should be added not only that Principal State Counsel could participate in division and section hearings and make oral submissions whereas public accountants could not, but also that he had been excluded from deliberations only since the entry into force of Decree no. 2002-1201 of 27 September 2002."

With regard to the reporting judge – an “independent judge” who was not a “party” to the proceedings – his main task, like the counter- reporting judge, was to examine the appeal file ( arguments for and against). He enjoyed very broad powers in that connection, since he could carry out any investigations he deemed necessary, including ordering inquiries and expert reports, submitting requests for information from all those concerned, and visiting departments being audited. His role extended beyond that, since in addition he “formulated complaints”. He then submitted an opinion regarding the appropriate judicial outcome in the case and, if it had been communicated to Principal State Counsel, his report was read out at the beginning of the hearing. Accordingly, since he was in charge of the investigation and expressed in advance an opinion on the merits, his presence at the bench ’ s deliberations was incompatible with the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The recent amendments to the Financial Judicature Code indicated, moreover, that the government had formally noted that difficulty. Henceforth the reporting judge could no longer participate in the deliberations either in cases in which a fine was imposed or in cases of de facto management of public funds (Articles L. 140-7 and R. 141-13 of the Financial Judicature Code).",

In conclusion, whilst it is important not to lose sight of the procedural safeguards referred to by the Government that are available to public accountants who risk being surcharged, the Court considers that there is an imbalance detrimental to public accountants on account of State Counsel ’ s position in the proceedings : unlike the accountant, he is present at the hearing, is informed beforehand of the reporting judge ’ s point of view, hears the latter ’ s submissions (and those of the counter- reporting judge ) at the hearing, fully participates in the proceedings and can express his own point of view orally without being contradicted by the accountant; from that standpoint, it is irrelevant whether State Counsel is or is not regarded as a “party”, since he is in a position, for these reasons together with the authority conferred on him by his functions, to influence the bench ’ s decision whether to levy a surcharge in a manner that may be unfavourable to the accountant. In the Court ’ s view, that imbalance is accentuated by the fact that the hearing is not public and is therefore conducted in the absence of any scrutiny either by the accountant concerned or by the public.",

                "51. The applicant complained, under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, of the participation by the Government Commissioner in the deliberations of the bench of the Conseil d ’ Etat designated to hear his case. He referred in that connection to the following judgments: Kress v. France, cited above; Borgers, cited above; Vermeulen v. Belgium, 20 February 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ I; and Lobo Machado v. Portugal, 20 February 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ I."

                "52. The Government pointed out that, in Kress, the Court concluded that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 on account of the Government Commissioner ’ s “participation” in the deliberations of the bench. In their submission, that judgment called into question only the active presence of the Government Commissioner, whereas, they argued, his “passive presence” was still possible. They pointed out, in particular, in that connection that the Government Commissioner, who was a member of the Conseil d ’ Etat, did not have the role of “State Counsel”, but that of a “ legal adviser ” who expressed his personal opinion before the bench prior to the deliberations.",
                "The Government stated that, in implementing the Kress judgment, the President of the Judicial Division of the Conseil d ’ Etat had issued two directions, on 23 November 2001 and 13 November 2002, according to which the Government Commissioner could be present at deliberations but could not address the court. The second of those directions described him as a “silent witness”. They stated that Decree no. 2005-1586 incorporating the new procedure had been published in the Official Gazette on 20 December 2005, adding in particular Article R. 731-7 to the Administrative Courts Code, according to which “the Government Commissioner shall be present at deliberations[ ;] he shall not participate in them”. It was thus “ only exceptionally and on request, [ that the Government Commissioner could ] be required, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, and as one of the members of the section on the basis of whose report the dispute was examined, having last studied the file, to reply to any question of a technical nature that might arise”; in addition to providing that technical assistance, the Government Commissioner ’ s presence at the deliberations had the advantage of allowing him better to understand the reasons for which the bench concurred with his point of view or, on the contrary, dissented from it. The knowledge thus acquired of the court ’ s reasoning would enable him, in subsequent submissions, to give a faithful account of the case-law or, if the bench had not convinced him, to prepare in future a new line of case-law and thus contribute to ensuring the consistency, continuity and if necessary the development of the case-law, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, which would first and foremost benefit all litigants. They reiterated that, as understood by the Court, the “ doctrine of appearances ” was not based exclusively on the concerns that a litigant might have as to the impartiality of a court : such concerns had to be based on objective factors for there to be a breach of Article 6 § 1. For the reasons stated above, such objective factors were not made out on the basis of the mere presence of the Government Commissioner at the deliberations.",
                "In the Government ’ s submission, it would not be judicious, for the sake of respect for appearances, and where the actual impartiality of the Government Commissioner was not being disputed, to undermine an institution that had singularly proved its worth."
            ],
            [
                "53. The Court points out first of all that, although in the operative provisions (point 2) of the Kress judgment it held that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the Government Commissioner ’ s “participation ” in the Conseil d ’ Etat ’ s deliberations, in the main body of the judgment both that term (see §§ 80 and 87 ) and the term “ presence ” ( title 4 and §§ 82, 84 and 85) are used, or, alternatively, the terms “ assistance ”, “assists” or “attends the deliberations” (see §§ 77, 79, 81, 85 and 86). Nevertheless, it is clear from the facts of the case, the arguments submitted by the parties and the reasons given in the Court ’ s judgment, together with the operative provisions, that the Kress judgment uses these terms as synonyms, and that the mere presence of the Government Commissioner at the deliberations, be it “active” or “ passive ”, is deemed to be a violation. Paragraphs 84 and 85, for example, are particularly enlightening in this respect : examining the Government ’ s argument that the “ presence ” of the Government Commissioner was justified by the fact that, having been the last person to have seen and studied the file, he would be in a position during the deliberations to answer any question which might be put to him about the case, the Court replied that the benefit for the trial bench of this purely technical assistance was to be weighed against the higher interest of the litigant, who had to have a guarantee that the Government Commissioner would not be able, through his “ presence ” at the deliberations, to influence their outcome, and found that that guarantee was not afforded by the French system.",
                "This is, moreover, the sense that must be given to that judgment in the light of the Court ’ s case-law, as the Court has found a violation not only in respect of the participation, in an advisory capacity, of the Advocate-General at the deliberations of the Belgian Court of Cassation ( see Borgers and Vermeulen, cited above ), but also the presence of the Deputy Attorney-General at the deliberations of the Portuguese Supreme Court even though he had no consultative or other type of vote (see Lobo Machado, cited above ), and the mere presence of the Advocate-General at the deliberations of the Criminal Division of the French Court of Cassation ( see Slimane-Kaïd (no. 2), cited above ). That case-law is largely based on the doctrine of appearances and the fact that, like the Government Commissioner before the French administrative courts, the advocates-general and Attorney-General in question express their view publicly on the case prior to the deliberations."

That being so, the Court reiterates that, while it is not formally bound to follow its previous judgments, it is in the interests of legal certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law that it should not depart, without good reason, from precedents laid down in previous cases – even if, the Convention being first and foremost a system for the protection of human rights, the Court must have regard to the changing conditions in Contracting States and respond, for example, to any emerging consensus as to the standards to be achieved ( see, for example, Chapman v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27238/95, § 70, ECHR 2001 ‑ I, and Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 74, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI ).",

The Court reiterates that, according to its established case-law reflecting a principle linked to the proper administration of justice, judgments of courts and tribunals should adequately state the reasons on which they are based. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see the Ruiz Torija v. Spain and Hiro Balani v. Spain judgments of 9 December 1994, Series A nos. 303-A and 303-B, p. 12, § 29, and pp. 29-30, § 27; and the Higgins and Others v. France judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, p. 60, § 42).

Thus, in dismissing an appeal, an appellate court may, in principle, simply endorse the reasons for the lower court’s decision (see, mutatis mutandis, the Helle v. Finland judgment of 19 December 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, p. 2930, §§ 59-60)."

In the present case the Court notes that at first instance judge no. 12 of the Madrid Court of First Instance took into account in his decision the defendant’s statements denying the facts alleged by the applicant in his claim. It held that the evidence of a witness called by the applicant was not conclusive and ruled that the applicant had not proved that he had performed the services for which he was claiming a fee (see paragraph 13 above).",

It went on to say that it likewise endorsed the legal reasoning of the impugned decision in so far as it was not incompatible with its own findings. On that point, it held that there was not the slightest evidence in the case file to prove that the applicant had acted as counsel in summary foreclosure proceedings no. 843/81, although he might have performed non-contentious services. It therefore dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment delivered at first instance (see paragraph 14 above).",

In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see the Schenk v.

The factual and legal reasons for the first-instance decision dismissing his claim were set out at length. In the judgment at the appeal stage the Audiencia Provincial endorsed the statement of the facts and the legal reasoning set out in the judgment at first instance in so far as they did not conflict with its own findings. The applicant may not therefore validly argue that this judgment lacked reasons, even though in the present case a more substantial statement of reasons might have been desirable."

The Court notes that on these two dates, in accordance with the relevant procedural rules, documents before the hearing, in particular social reports updating the information on the child A., reviewing the history of the case and making recommendations, were not disclosed to the second applicant or the first applicant acting as her representative, although the chairman of the hearing did inform them of the substance of the documents (see paragraphs 15, 21 and 57 above). On 4 February 1988 the children ’ s hearing decided that A. did need compulsory measures of care, notably because of the mental health of both applicants, and a supervision requirement was made placing A. under the supervision of the local authority subject to the condition that he reside with foster parents; this supervision requirement being continued at the following hearing on 13 October 1988 (see paragraphs 15, 21 and 58 to 60 above). These were the two sole occasions of such non-disclosure when the second applicant had participated in the proceedings and a decision affecting her civil rights had been taken - other than the decision on 5 September 1989, which was quashed on appeal (see in addition paragraphs 26 and 27 above).",
                "As explained by the Government, the function of determining what measures of care would be in the best interest of the child has been conferred on the children ’ s hearing rather than the ordinary courts because the legislature believed that this function is likely to be exercised more successfully by an adjudicatory body of three specially trained persons with substantial experience of children, following a procedure which is less formal and confrontational than that of the ordinary courts. The Court accepts that in this sensitive domain of family law there may be good reasons for opting for an adjudicatory body that does not have the composition or procedures of a court of law of the classic kind (see, mutatis mutandis, the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, p. 23, para. 53). Nevertheless, notwithstanding the special characteristics of the adjudication to be made, as a matter of general principle the right to a fair - adversarial - trial \"means the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed or evidence adduced by the other party\" (see the Ruiz- Mateos v. Spain judgment of 23 June 1993, Series A no. 262, p. 25, para. 63). In the context of the present case, the lack of disclosure of such vital documents as social reports is capable of affecting the ability of participating parents not only to influence the outcome of the children ’ s hearing in question but also to assess their prospects of making an appeal to the Sheriff Court."

On 4 February 1988 the children ’ s hearing decided that A. did need compulsory measures of care, notably because of the mental health of both applicants, and a supervision requirement was made placing A. under the supervision of the local authority subject to the condition that he reside with foster parents; this supervision requirement being continued at the following hearing on 13 October 1988 (see paragraphs 15, 21 and 58 to 60 above).

The Court accepts that in this sensitive domain of family law there may be good reasons for opting for an adjudicatory body that does not have the composition or procedures of a court of law of the classic kind (see, mutatis mutandis, the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, p. 23, para. 53). Nevertheless, notwithstanding the special characteristics of the adjudication to be made, as a matter of general principle the right to a fair - adversarial - trial \"means the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed or evidence adduced by the other party\" (see the Ruiz- Mateos v. Spain judgment of 23 June 1993, Series A no. 262, p. 25, para. 63). In the context of the present case, the lack of disclosure of such vital documents as social reports is capable of affecting the ability of participating parents not only to influence the outcome of the children ’ s hearing in question but also to assess their prospects of making an appeal to the Sheriff Court."

As regards the Government ’ s first submission, it is true that at the outset, in late 1987 and early 1988, the second applicant denied the first applicant ’ s paternity of A. and that the initial relevant instance of non-disclosure of documents at a children ’ s hearing occurred two weeks before the first applicant ’ s name had been added to A. ’ s birth certificate (4 and 18 February 1988 respectively) (see paragraphs 7, 11, 14, 15 and 18 above). However, the first applicant had claimed paternity on 27 January 1988; and even at the time of this initial children ’ s hearing he was living with the second applicant and was, especially in his capacity as her representative, closely associated in the attempt to obtain access to A. (see paragraphs 7, 13, 14 and 15 above). Thereafter the two applicants acted very much in concert in their endeavour to recover the custody of and have access to A., not only in the framework of the legal proceedings before the children ’ s hearing and the Sheriff Court but also in their dealings with the social work department of the local authority (see paragraphs 18 and 20 to 25 above). During the relevant period taken as a whole they were living together and leading a joint \"family life\", to the extent that that was possible in the light of the second applicant ’ s periodic hospitalisation (see paragraphs 16 and 30 above).",

Thus, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) affords a procedural safeguard, namely the \"right to a court\" in the determination of one ’ s \"civil rights and obligations\" (see the Golder v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, p. 18, para. 36); whereas not only does the procedural requirement inherent in Article 8 (art. 8) cover administrative procedures as well as judicial proceedings, but it is ancillary to the wider purpose of ensuring proper respect for, inter alia, family life (see, for example, the B. v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no. 121-B, pp. 72-74 and 75, paras. 63-65 and 68). The difference between the purpose pursued by the respective safeguards afforded by Articles 6 para. 1 and 8 (art. 6-1, art. 8) may, in the light of the particular circumstances, justify the examination of the same set of facts under both Articles (art. 6, art. 8) (compare, for example, the above-mentioned Golder judgment, pp. 20-22, paras. 41-45, and the O. v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no. 120-A, pp. 28-29, paras. 65-67).",

As explained by the Government, the aim of the relevant legislation, which was enacted in 1986, is to provide a mechanism for identifying \"meritorious\" fathers who might be accorded parental rights, thereby protecting the interests of the child and the mother. In the Court ’ s view, this aim is legitimate and the conditions imposed on natural fathers for obtaining recognition of their parental role respect the principle of proportionality.

France, no. 61517/00, § 27, 31 March 2005). In this context, the Court reiterates that while the independence and impartiality of the prosecutor or similar officer were not open to criticism, the public ’ s increased sensitivity to the fair administration of justice justified the growing importance attached to appearances (see Borgers v.

However, the fact that a similar point of view is defended before a court by several parties does not necessarily place the opposing party in a position of “substantial disadvantage” when presenting his case. It remains to be ascertained whether, in the instant case, in view of the prosecutor ’ s participation in the proceedings, the “fair balance” that ought to prevail between the parties was respected ( ibid. )"

These investments related to a new shed for heifers and bulls, the construction of which would release 40 stands in the existing shed for milch cows and cows in calf.

The Minister discussed the question of the increase in the number of stands and maintained his previous position. He submitted in the alternative that the applicant ’ s investments referable to that increase fell short of the required minimum of NLG 100,000. The Minister estimated that the total investment had been worth NLG 176,608.27 and the price per square metre of the new shed had been NLG 197.23; calculating on the basis of the surface taken up in the old shed by the new stands for milch cows and cows in calf, he concluded that the amount involved in the increase had been NLG 48,406.65 at the most."

He claimed, with reference to a list of the costs concerned drawn up by his accountant, that his total investment had in fact been NLG 215,183.22, and criticised the method of calculation used by the Minister. In his view, 65% of the total investment was referable to cow stands in the new shed for heifers, of which 90% replaced similar stands in the old shed that were now to be used for milch cows and cows in calf; the sum relating to the relevant increase was therefore NLG 125,882."

On 7 July 1987 the President of the Tribunal gave a decision refusing the interim measure requested, holding that it was not prima facie likely that the Tribunal itself would overturn the Minister ’ s decision. In his view, the Minister had not erred in rejecting the applicant ’ s claim. The President did not find it necessary to address the question of the increase in the number of stands for milch cows and cows in calf, since he accepted the Minister ’ s alternative argument concerning the applicant ’ s investment. He rejected the applicant ’ s submission that the Minister was estopped from relying on that ground, holding that section 51 of the 1954 Industrial Appeals Act (Wet administratieve rechtspraak bedrijfsorganisatie, Staatsblad (Official Bulletin) 1954, 416, as amended - \"the 1954 Act\") entitled him to supplement his arguments while the applicant had not only had sufficient possibility of replying to the Minister ’ s alternative submission but had in fact done so. Accepting the method of calculation used by the Minister and the total investment submitted by the applicant, the President arrived at a figure of NLG 55,440 referable to the increase in the number of stands in the old cowshed, and that figure was insufficient."

Like the Minister, he took as his starting-point the investment involved in building the new shed for heifers. Starting from the figure which he gave before the President - NLG 215,183.22 (see paragraph 16 above) - he calculated a price per square metre of NLG 240. On that basis he arrived at a figure of NLG 125,882 for the investment referable to the increase in the number of cow stands for milch cows and cows in calf in the existing cowshed. In the alternative, if the Minister ’ s calculations were to be followed, he submitted that the Minister had based them on incorrect premises; if applied correctly, the Minister ’ s method resulted in a figure referable to the extension of stands for milch cows and cows in calf of NLG 91,200, which was sufficient since the applicant had carried out the physical work involved in building the new cowshed himself (see paragraph 27 below)."

The mother contested the applicant's submissions. She stated that the applicant had always been very generous to her but that he had not paid her any maintenance."

The court observed that Article 1711 § 2 of the Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch ) concerning the father's right to personal contact with his child born out of wedlock (see paragraph 24 below) was conceived as an exemption clause which had to be construed strictly. Thus, the competent court should order such access only if this was advantageous and beneficial for the child's well-being. According to the court's findings, these conditions were not met in the applicant's case. The District Court noted that the child had been heard and had stated that he no longer wished to see his father who, according to the child, was bad and had beaten his mother repeatedly. The mother likewise had strong objections to the applicant which she had imparted to the child, so that the child had no possibility of building an unbiased relationship with his father. The District Court concluded that contacts with the father would not enhance the child's well-being."

                "In so doing, the court referred to its prior decision of 4 December 1992 and found that the conditions under Article 1711 of the Civil Code were not met. It noted that the applicant's relationship with the child's mother was so strained that the enforcement of access rights could not be envisaged as this would not be in the interest of the child's well-being. The child knew about his mother's objections to the applicant and had adopted them. If C. were to be with the applicant against his mother's will, this would put him into a loyalty conflict which he could not cope with and which would affect his well-being. The court added that it was irrelevant which parent was responsible for the tension; it placed particular emphasis on the fact that important tensions existed and that there was a risk that any further contacts with the father would affect the child's undisturbed development in the family of the custodial parent. After two long interviews with the child, the District Court reached the conclusion that his development would be endangered if the child had to take up contact with his father contrary to his mother's will. At these interviews the child had called his father “nasty” or “stupid”, adding that on no account did he wish to see him and said also: “Mummy always says Egbert is not my father. Mummy is afraid of Egbert .”",

In so doing, it first stated that there were doubts on the admissibility of the appeal as the applicant, by letter of 12 January 1994, had informed the court of first instance that he would respect that court's decision, and had requested help in order to reach a friendly settlement. Furthermore, the Regional Court found that the grounds of appeal contained in his submissions did not fully coincide with the request addressed by the applicant to the court of first instance.",
                "The Regional Court, however, left open the question of whether or not the appeal was inadmissible and decided that in any event the applicant's request for access rights had to be dismissed as access was not in the interests of the child's well-being. It was not sufficient that such contacts were compatible with the child's well-being; they had to be advantageous and beneficial ( nützlich und förderlich ), and necessary for the child's equilibrium ( seelisch notwendig ). The question of whether or not these conditions were satisfied had to be decided from the viewpoint of the child's situation and taking into account all circumstances of the case. In this connection, it was necessary to examine, inter alia, the reasons for which the father wished to have contacts with the child, that is, whether his motives were emotional or based on other factors. In this context the relationship between the parents had to be taken into account as well.",
                "The Regional Court concluded, in line with the decision appealed against, that the tensions between the parents had a negative effect on the child, as was confirmed by the hearings with the child held on 9 November 1992 and 8 December 1993, and that contact with his father was not therefore in the child's best interest, even less so because this contact had in fact been interrupted for about two and a half years. It was irrelevant who was responsible for the break-up of life in common. What mattered was that in the present situation contact with the father would negatively affect the child. This conclusion, in the Regional Court's view, was obvious, which was why there was no necessity of obtaining an opinion from an expert in psychology. Moreover, Article 1711 § 2 of the Civil Code did not provide for a psychological therapy to prepare a child for contact with his or her father. The Regional Court finally observed that there was no necessity to hear the parents and the child again since there was no indication that any findings more favourable for the applicant could result from such a hearing."

This provision was not repealed until the entry into force of the amended Law on Family Matters. According to the applicant, the reasoning of the Federal Constitutional Court was still based on Article 1711 of the Civil Code. He maintained that the attitude of the German courts at that time was responsible for the lack of contact between him and his son since 1991. The German courts had allowed the mother to break off contact and permitted his son to be influenced by her, with the result that he then refused any contact with his father. Although the applicant could have filed a new application for access to his son after 1 July 1998, years had been lost by that time and with them the opportunity for meaningful contact between him and his son."

However, it was to be expected that the applicant's son, who at that time was more than thirteen years old, would refuse contact with his father. As a rule, the decisions of the German courts of appeal attached considerable importance to the will of a child of this age, whose opinion had to be taken into account in proceedings concerning parental access, and they were unlikely to grant the father access to the child against the latter's will."

At the second hearing, the child, who was then almost six years old, said: “Mummy always says Egbert is not my father. Mummy is afraid of Egbert .” According to the applicant, this statement was made under the influence of the mother or one of her close acquaintances and with her approval.

The child therefore totally rejected any contact with his father.

For this reason, the decision of the two courts not to appoint an expert, as requested by him and recommended by the Youth Office, was not only a violation of the father's interests but also of those of the child, since contacts with the other parent were in the child's best medium- and long-term interests."

The Court further recalls that the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other's company constitutes a fundamental element of family life, even if the relationship between the parents has broken down, and domestic measures hindering such enjoyment amount to an interference with the right protected by Article 8 of the Convention (see, amongst others, the Johansen v. Norway judgment of 7 August 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, pp. 1001-02, § 52, and the Bronda v. Italy judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1489, § 51)."

The subsequent decisions refusing the applicant access to his son therefore interfered with the exercise of his right to respect for his family life as guaranteed by paragraph 1 of Article 8 of the Convention.

Undoubtedly, consideration of what serves best the interest of the child is of crucial importance in every case of this kind. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned. It follows from these considerations that the Court's task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities regarding custody and access issues, but rather to review, in the light of the Convention, the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see the Hokkanen v.

However, a stricter scrutiny is called for in respect of any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by those authorities on parental rights of access, and of any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life.

It recalls that in the present case the District Court considered it unnecessary to obtain an expert opinion on the ground that the facts had been clearly and completely established for the purposes of Article 1711 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 16 above). In this connection, the District Court referred to the strained relations between the parents and in particular to the mother's objections to the applicant which she imparted to the child. The Court considers that the reasons given by the District Court are insufficient to explain why, in the particular circumstances of the case, expert advice was not considered necessary, as recommended by the Erkrath Youth Office. Moreover, taking into account the importance of the subject matter, namely, the relations between a father and his child, the Regional Court should not have been satisfied, in the circumstances, with relying on the file and the written appeal submissions without having at its disposal psychological expert evidence in order to evaluate the child's statements. The Court notes in this context that the applicant, in his appeal, challenged the findings of the District Court and requested that an expert opinion be prepared to explore the true wishes of his child and to solve the question of access accordingly, and that the Regional Court had full power to review all issues relating to the request for access."

Article 1711 § 2 of the Civil Code struck a reasonable balance between the competing interests involved in all these cases. In this context, the Government observed that the amended Law on Family Matters did not alter this assessment.

However, while under the German legislation the divorced parent was entitled to access unless such access was contrary to the child's well-being, the natural father was only entitled to access if such access was in the interest of the child.

The Regional Court, on appeal, equally based its decision of 21 January 1994 on the finding that contacts would negatively affect the child.

                "“ 48. Article 6 § 1 of the Convention places the “tribunal” under a duty to conduct a proper examination of the submissions, arguments and evidence adduced by the parties, without prejudice to its assessment of whether they are relevant to its decision (see, for instance, Perez v. France [GC], no. 47287/99, § 80, ECHR 2004I; and Van Kück, cited above, § 48). It thereby embodies the principle of equality of arms which, with respect to litigation involving opposing private interests, implies that each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case – including his evidence – under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent (see, for example, Andrejeva v. Latvia [GC], no. 55707/00, § 96, ECHR 2009; and Dombo Beheer, cited above, § 33).",
                "50. In the context of expert evidence, the rules on the admissibility thereof must not deprive the party in question of the opportunity of challenging it effectively. In certain circumstances the refusal to allow further or an alternative expert examination of material evidence may be regarded as a breach of Article 6 § 1 (see Van Kück, cited above, § 55; and, mutatis mutandis, Matytsina v. Russia, no. 58428/10, § 169, 27 March 2014). In particular, where an expert has been appointed by a court, the parties must in all instances be able to attend the interviews held by him or her or to be shown the documents he or she has taken into account. What is essential is that the parties should be able to participate properly in the proceedings before the “tribunal” (see Mantovanelli v. France, 18 March 1997, § 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 - II).",
                "51. It should be also noted that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention guarantees a right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial “tribunal” and does not expressly require that an expert heard by that tribunal fulfil the same requirements (see Sara Lind Eggertsdóttir v. Iceland, no. 31930/04, § 47, 5 July 2007). However, the opinion of an expert who has been appointed by the relevant court to address issues arising in the case is likely to carry significant weight in that court ’ s assessment of those issues. In its case-law the Court has recognised that the lack of neutrality on the part of a court-appointed expert may in certain circumstances give rise to a breach of the principle of equality of arms inherent in the concept of a fair trial (see Bönisch v. Austria, 6 May 1 985, §§ 30-35, Series A no. 92) ... ”"

Malta (dec.), no. 16631/04, 27 September 200 5; Lasmane v. Latvia (dec.), no. 43293/98, 6 June 2002; and Sara Lind Eggertsdóttir v. Iceland, no. 31930/04, § 47, 5 July 2007 ). In this connection, the Court has found that the Convention does not bar the national courts from relying on expert opinions drawn up by specialised bodies to resolve the disputes before them when this is required by the nature of the contentious issues under consideration. What it does require, however, is that the requirement of neutrality on the part of an appointed expert be observed, that the court proceedings comply with the adversarial principle and that the applicant be placed on a par with his or her adversary, namely the State, in accordance with the principle of equality of arms (see Letinčić, cited above, § 61)."

It is true that in its decision the court made certain references to its own observations regarding the applicant ’ s condition (see paragraph 13 above).

In the case under consideration by the Supreme Court, the lower courts had treated the disability commission ’ s opinion as decisive evidence in determining the appellant ’ s ability to work and thereby upheld the decision of the opposing party (that is to say the Institute). The Supreme Court found that in respect of the nature of such opinions it had been inappropriate for the first-instance court to order an additional opinion from the disability commission and to dismiss the appellant ’ s application for the appointment of an independent expert. It further found it unacceptable that the lower courts had relied, in determining the relevant facts, on an opinion of the expert body of one of the parties to the proceedings. Since the claimant had explicitly opposed this and had requested the appointment of an independent expert, the first-instance court should have allowed her request. The Supreme Court also observed that there had been discrepancies in the medical documentation and that the question of what had been the category of the appellant ’ s disability had remained open. In its view, this question had not been properly addressed by the lower courts, which had instead relied on the additional opinion of the disability commission.

In particular, it considered arbitrary the lower courts ’ finding that the disability commissions ’ opinions constituted public certificates ( javne listine ) and that their accuracy was therefore to be presumed until disproved. It also found a violation of Article 22 on account of the lower courts ’ conclusion that the complainant ’ s statements at the hearing and the opinions of the disability commissions had sufficed to establish that there had been no physical impairment. It noted in this connection that the Institute ’ s disability commissions were expert bodies of the Institute, which acted as one of the parties to the proceedings, and could not therefore be considered impartial ( nepristranski ). The Constitutional Court further noted that in the circumstances of the case the medical assessment had played a decisive role and that the lower courts had not had sufficient medical expertise to establish whether a physical impairment existed. Thus, by refusing the complainant ’ s request for the appointment of an independent medical expert the lower courts had divested the applicant of any possibility of an effective defence against the finding of the expert bodies of the opposing parties, which were decisive for the administrative decisions challenged in the domestic proceedings."

                "“ 48. Article 6 § 1 of the Convention places the “tribunal” under a duty to conduct a proper examination of the submissions, arguments and evidence adduced by the parties, without prejudice to its assessment of whether they are relevant to its decision (see, for instance, Perez v. France [GC], no. 47287/99, § 80, ECHR 2004I; and Van Kück, cited above, § 48). It thereby embodies the principle of equality of arms which, with respect to litigation involving opposing private interests, implies that each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case – including his evidence – under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent (see, for example, Andrejeva v. Latvia [GC], no. 55707/00, § 96, ECHR 2009; and Dombo Beheer, cited above, § 33).",
                "50. In the context of expert evidence, the rules on the admissibility thereof must not deprive the party in question of the opportunity of challenging it effectively. In certain circumstances the refusal to allow further or an alternative expert examination of material evidence may be regarded as a breach of Article 6 § 1 (see Van Kück, cited above, § 55; and, mutatis mutandis, Matytsina v. Russia, no. 58428/10, § 169, 27 March 2014). In particular, where an expert has been appointed by a court, the parties must in all instances be able to attend the interviews held by him or her or to be shown the documents he or she has taken into account. What is essential is that the parties should be able to participate properly in the proceedings before the “tribunal” (see Mantovanelli v. France, 18 March 1997, § 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 - II).",
                "51. It should be also noted that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention guarantees a right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial “tribunal” and does not expressly require that an expert heard by that tribunal fulfil the same requirements (see Sara Lind Eggertsdóttir v. Iceland, no. 31930/04, § 47, 5 July 2007). However, the opinion of an expert who has been appointed by the relevant court to address issues arising in the case is likely to carry significant weight in that court ’ s assessment of those issues. In its case-law the Court has recognised that the lack of neutrality on the part of a court-appointed expert may in certain circumstances give rise to a breach of the principle of equality of arms inherent in the concept of a fair trial (see Bönisch v. Austria, 6 May 1 985, §§ 30-35, Series A no. 92) ... ”"

            [
                "47. The Court further notes that the position occupied by the experts throughout the proceedings, the manner in which they perform their functions, and the way the judges assess their opinions are relevant factors to be taken into account in assessing whether the principle of equality of arms has been complied with (see Zarb v. Malta (dec.), no. 16631/04, 27 September 200 5; Lasmane v. Latvia (dec.), no. 43293/98, 6 June 2002; and Sara Lind Eggertsdóttir v. Iceland, no. 31930/04, § 47, 5 July 2007 ). In this connection, the Court has found that the Convention does not bar the national courts from relying on expert opinions drawn up by specialised bodies to resolve the disputes before them when this is required by the nature of the contentious issues under consideration. What it does require, however, is that the requirement of neutrality on the part of an appointed expert be observed, that the court proceedings comply with the adversarial principle and that the applicant be placed on a par with his or her adversary, namely the State, in accordance with the principle of equality of arms (see Letinčić, cited above, § 61)."

In particular, the Court has previously found that while the fact that an expert charged with giving an opinion on a matter in dispute is employed by the same administrative authority as that involved in the case might give rise to a certain apprehension on the part of the applicant, what is decisive is whether the doubts raised by appearances can be held to be objectively justified (see Korošec v. Slovenia, no. 77212/12, § 54, 8 October 2015; Sara Lind Eggertsdóttir, cited above § 48; Brandstetter v. Austria, 28 August 1991, § 44, Series A no. 211; and Galea and Pavia v.

The Court notes at the outset that the present case concerns the reliance by the Ljubljana Labour and Social Court on the opinions of the opposing party ’ s in-house expert bodies – that is to say the Institute ’ s disability commissions. These bodies were not appointed as experts by the court, but had provided the expert opinions for the purpose of the administrative decisions which had subsequently been challenged in the judicial proceedings. The opinions concurred that the applicant did not suffer from a physical impairment within the meaning of the List and was therefore not entitled to a disability allowance (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above)."

            [
                "50. The Ljubljana Labour and Social Court reviewed all aspects of facts and law on which the aforementioned administrative decisions had been based and likewise dismissed the applicant ’ s application for a disability allowance without, however, appointing an independent expert to assess the applicant ’ s condition (see paragraphs 13, 14 and 16 above). It is true that in its decision the court made certain references to its own observations regarding the applicant ’ s condition (see paragraph 13 above). However, since the medical question of whether the applicant had suffered a physical impairment fell, as a matter of principle, outside the area of expertise of judges (see paragraph 33 above; see also Korošec, cited above, § 47, and, mutatis mutandis, Mantovanelli v. France, 18 March 1997, § 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ II ) and since no other expert evidence was produced in the proceedings before the court, it must be considered that the expert opinions provided by the disability commissions had a decisive role in the court ’ s assessment of the merits of the case."

            [
                "51. In the present case the Court finds it understandable that doubts could have arisen in the mind of the applicant as to the impartiality of the medical experts whose opinions were relied on by the courts, given that they were appointed and employed or contracted by the Institute – her opponent in the proceedings. However, while the applicant ’ s apprehensions concerning the impartiality of the experts may be of a certain importance, they cannot be considered decisive as there is nothing objectively justifying any fear that the disability commissions ’ experts lacked neutrality in their professional judgment ( see Letinčić, cited above, § 62, and Krunoslava Zovko v. Croatia, no. 56935/13, § 44, 23 May 2017 ). In this connection, the Court observes that neither the contents of the case file nor the applicant ’ s submissions disclose any evidence that the relevant medical experts lacked the requisite objectivity, and nor did the applicant argue that this might have been so (see, mutatis mutandis, Galea and Pavia, cited above, § 47, and Krunoslava Zovko, cited above, § 45 )."

Therefore, the Court finds it important that the claimants in disputes such as the one at stake in the present case are able to obtain the appointment of an independent expert – which indeed was a possibility under the domestic rules and practice of which the applicant availed herself (see paragraphs 12, 33, 34 and 38 above )."

The Court notes in this respect that in order to decide on the applicant ’ s entitlement to receive a disability allowance, the regional unit of the Institute sought the opinion of medical experts of the first-instance disability commission, who examined both the applicant ’ s medical records and the applicant in person (see paragraph 8 above). Following the applicant ’ s appeal, the applicant ’ s medical file was reviewed by the medical experts of the second-instance disability commission. On the basis of the latter ’ s findings, the Central Office of the Institute dismissed the applicant ’ s appeal, thereby upholding the dismissal of her application for a disability allowance (see paragraph 10 above)."

The role of that court was to check whether the impugned administrative decisions had been issued in a procedure that had complied with the relevant procedural rules and had been based on a proper establishment of the facts and a proper application of the law ( see paragraph 13 above ). The Labour and Social Court held an oral hearing at which the applicant was in a position to put forward her arguments related to, inter alia, the findings of the disability commissions ’ opinions."

She could have submitted specific objections concerning the disability commissions ’ objectivity and its findings and supported her view by submitting an opinion from her general practitioner (see, by contrast, Korošec, cited above, § 8) or any other physician treating her – or any other evidence for that matter (see paragraph 12 above)."

They claimed that the applicant, who had arrived from Georgia, had failed to take any steps to determine her citizenship and to make her residence in Russia lawful, such as confirming her Georgian citizenship or applying for Russian citizenship. They stated that the applicant ’ s situation had been governed by the 1981 USSR Law on the legal status of foreign citizens in the USSR and by the 1991 Rules on the stay of foreign citizens in the USSR. Pursuant to sections 5 and 32 of the 1981 USSR law, the applicant, as a stateless person, should have obtained a residence permit from the Ministry of the Interior. The Government concurrently claimed that, after entry visas had been introduced for Georgian citizens from 5 December 2000, the applicant could only have been lawfully resident in Russia on 25 December 2000 if she had crossed the border with a valid Russian visa in her national passport."

She continued to hold citizenship of the former USSR and had never acquired Georgian citizenship. Consequently, she had not been required to obtain an entry visa as a Georgian citizen. In any event, she had not crossed the Russian border in 2000 or later. As to the Government ’ s reliance on the 1981 USSR Law and the 1991 Rules, section 1 of that Law stated that it did not apply to USSR citizens, which the applicant had remained, and it had therefore not applied to her. In fact, until a new Russian Law on the legal status of foreign citizens was adopted on 25 June 2002, Russia had no legislation imposing an obligation on citizens of the former USSR to obtain residence permits as a condition of their lawful residence in Russia. Thus, at the material time she had been lawfully present in the Russian Federation."

The status of citizens of the former USSR in the Russian Federation had ceased to be recognised only on 31 December 2000. After that date they were to be considered as stateless persons and subjected to the same legal regime as foreign citizens. The third- party intervener noted that before 1 November 2002 there had been no notion of temporary residence permits in Russian legislation, and registration at a permanent place of residence could not by its nature be regarded as such a permit. Failure to register at a place of residence could lead to a fine, but it did not affect the lawfulness of the residence of citizens of the former USSR in Russia per se."

The contention that, as a Georgian citizen, the applicant should have possessed an entry visa appeared for the first time in the comments on the applicant ’ s statement of claim and was subsequently upheld by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 12 et seq. above)."

She denied that she had ever acquired Georgian citizenship. Neither in the domestic proceedings nor before the Court did the Russian authorities produce any evidence in support of their claim that the applicant was a Georgian citizen. The registration of the applicant ’ s residence in Tbilisi dating back to the early 1990s had no automatic bearing on determination of her citizenship under either Russian or Georgian law. As the Government ’ s allegation that the applicant was a Georgian citizen has no evidentiary basis, the denunciation, by the Russian Federation, of the Bishkek Agreement on visa-free movement could not have affected the lawfulness of her residence on Russian territory."

The Government concurrently maintained that the applicant had been a stateless person – having acquired no other citizenship after the collapse of the Soviet Union – and had therefore been required to hold a residence permit in accordance with the 1981 USSR Law on foreign citizens. The Court notes at the outset that this argument first appeared in the Government ’ s observations of 26 March 2004 and that it had not been relied upon in refusing the application for residence registration in the domestic proceedings.

Only after that date were they to be considered stateless persons (see paragraph 24 above). The applicant claimed that she belonged to that category and the Government did not produce any evidence to the contrary. It follows that at the material time, in early December 2000, the requirement to have a residence permit, established in the 1981 USSR Law governing the status of foreign citizens and stateless persons, did not apply to her because she was neither a foreign citizen nor a stateless person (see paragraph 25 above). In any event, both the 1993 Law on the liberty of movement and freedom to choose residence and the Government Resolution of 12 March 1997 established that the procedure for registration of residence of “former USSR citizens” should be the same as that for Russian citizens (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above)."

The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision (see Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 199 4, § 29, Series A no. 303-A). Even though a domestic court has a certain margin of appreciation when choosing arguments in a particular case and admitting evidence in support of the parties ’ submissions, an authority is obliged to justify its activities by giving reasons for its decisions (see Suominen v. Finland, no. 37801/97, § 36, 1 July 2003 ). A further function of a reasoned decision is to demonstrate to the parties that they have been heard. Moreover, a reasoned decision affords a party the possibility to appeal against it, as well as the possibility of having the decision reviewed by an appellate body.

The District Court subsequently directed that the reference to those submissions be added to the hearing record (see paragraph 17 above). It follows that the flat owner ’ s consent was validly produced in the domestic proceedings and its existence was acknowledged by the District Court, which gave no reasons whatsoever for its finding that there existed a dispute between the applicant and the flat owner.

The Court is not convinced that this discrepancy could have been the result of a mere difference in terms because the text of the “treaty on visa-based exchanges” was never produced in the domestic proceedings. The domestic courts appear to have taken the reference to it from the passport department ’ s submissions. Furthermore, the Court finds it anomalous that the District Court relied on a treaty governing the conditions of entry and stay for Georgian citizens without giving any reasons for the assumption that the applicant was a Georgian citizen.

As they had done before the Commission, the Government maintained that the applicants could have challenged the members of the professional disciplinary bodies whom they suspected of bias. Article L. 421 of the Public Health Code taken together with Article 341 of the New Code of Civil Procedure provided such a possibility, in particular with respect to members having “a personal interest in the dispute” or before whom “the case ha[d] earlier come ... as a[n] ... arbitrator or [members having] advised one of the parties”. Article 18 of Decree no. 48 ‑ 1671 of 26 October 1948 added that “members ... who individually or as part of a group have occupational interests in common with each other” could be challenged. The Government referred in particular to a decision of the disciplinary section of the National Council of 22 June 1977 in which it had quashed a decision of a regional council on the ground that one of its members, in respect of whom a challenge had been filed, had failed to stand down even though the challenge had been founded.",

Even if it was accepted, for the sake of argument, that before the hearing the applicants had not been certain of the identity of the members of the bodies concerned, it would have been open to them to exercise their right of challenge at the hearing. The Government added that the fact that the hearing was not held in public and that disciplinary proceedings were confidential did not prevent either the applicants or their counsel being present at the hearing and therefore exercising their right of challenge. Furthermore, if the disciplinary section had rejected their challenges, they could have appealed on points of law to the Conseil d’Etat on the basis of that refusal."

A challenge would have had to have been made before deliberations in the case began, contain a detailed indication of the grounds for challenge and be accompanied by supporting evidence. Yet the confidential nature of the proceedings before the professional disciplinary bodies had prevented the applicants from finding out in such a brief period facts capable of founding a challenge; as they did not have access to previous decisions of those bodies it was not possible for them to establish whether a member of the body that was to hear their case had been a party in or was connected to a party in a similar case. In those circumstances, it was in reality up to the suspect members themselves to stand down.",

Furthermore, lack of impartiality was not a statutory ground for challenge; moreover, the case-law referred to by the Government did not in any way show that such a ground would be likely to succeed before the disciplinary section of the National Council of the ordre or before the Conseil d’Etat.",

Had the applicants had recourse to that procedure in the instant case on the basis of the complaint referred to above, they would have had to challenge all the members of the disciplinary bodies concerned, which would have been equivalent to applying for transfer of the case to another tribunal of the same type on grounds of bias; under the Conseil d’Etat ’s case-law, however, no such application may be made in respect of the disciplinary section of the National Council of the ordre des médecins (see paragraph 23 above).

As for bringing an appeal on points of law on the basis of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, they considered that it would have been pointless because in 1992, notwithstanding the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights on the subject, it was the Conseil d’Etat ’s settled case-law that that provision was inapplicable to disciplinary bodies. Furthermore, because of the confidential nature of the proceedings before the disciplinary bodies of the ordre, the applicants would not have been able to learn of some of the grounds that could have been raised on appeal, such as the “interest” of some of the members of those bodies, until after the time-limit for appealing had expired. Further still, when the Conseil d’Etat quashed a decision of the disciplinary section it was not bound to rule on the merits of the case and could remit it to the same disciplinary section, which was a single entity; it would have been only after a second appeal on points of law that the Conseil d’Etat would have decided the case finally. That system itself did not satisfy the requirements of Article 6 § 1, which also embodied the right of individuals to have their case heard within a “reasonable time”.

Secondly, it should be recalled that the practice of the Conseil d’Etat has been, for a long time and under its settled case-law, to hear complaints of a lack of impartiality on the part of professional disciplinary bodies... It thus scrutinises their independence and impartiality in a way that is wholly consistent with the review effected by the Strasbourg institutions under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention... However, even before complaining to the Conseil d’Etat that certain members of the councils of the ordre were not impartial, the applicants should have exercised their right to challenge one or more members of those councils, seeing that they had doubts on that score... Had the applicants exercised their right to challenge the members of the disciplinary body, they could, if their challenge was rejected, have raised that issue again in their appeal to the Conseil d’Etat. In these circumstances, the French Government consider that the applicants, who failed to exercise their right to challenge those members of the disciplinary bodies they suspected of bias and to bring that complaint before the Conseil d’Etat, which had jurisdiction to hear it, have not satisfied the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies...”",

If, however, it had remitted the case, it could only have done so to the same body without there being any requirement that it be differently constituted; it would only have been after a second appeal on points of law that the Conseil d’Etat would have been required to decide the case finally (see paragraphs 20–21 above). In other words, in order to have their complaint decided by a “tribunal” other than the very one whose impartiality they challenged, the applicants would in all likelihood have had to appeal twice to the Conseil d’Etat.

It was accepted that there was nothing out of the ordinary about the residence application; the gist of the applicant’s argument was that all cases concerning children should be heard in public. He contended, inter alia, that the public had the right to see how decisions were made about children’s lives, and that publicity would serve the interests of justice by encouraging judges, barristers and other professionals involved in such cases to take greater care in their work.

When one is arguing for principle, one should stick to principle, and I think it a draconian measure to bring about the hearing of these cases in public ... in order to chastise judges or expose lax and inadequate preparation by barristers. I would not wish children to be subjected to any form of embarrassment in order, as I say, to chastise the legal profession.",

The rules of court – the Family Proceedings Rules – ... came into force on 14 October 1991, which coincided with the coming into force of virtually the whole of the substantial provisions of the Children Act. I think I must approach this case in this manner. The Children Act itself – the preamble – says that it is an Act to reform the law relating to children. ... It was a consolidating Act, trying to bring together the various legislative Acts which had gone before, but it was a reforming Act in many senses. It took a great deal of time going through Parliament. I have no doubt at all that various interested parties and pressure groups gave evidence to various committees. I have no doubt at all that judges of family experience at the very highest level were consulted. During the course of its going through Parliament it would have been debated not only in the Lower House but in the Upper House, where all their Lordships of the House of Lords would doubtless have voiced an opinion on it. ... Not only was the Act a long time coming to the statute book, it was nearly two years before the bulk of it came into effect. During the course of that gestation period, rules of court were argued about endlessly, and the rules of court appeared virtually at the eleventh hour. They were not made until 1 May 1991. There is a long history to that, which is not relevant to this judgment. I can only assume, sitting here, that the question of whether or not children’s cases should be heard in open court or in camera was and must have been anxiously considered at all levels during the course of the progress of this Act and the rules under the Act through Parliament. I can only read, and I do so read and interpret 4.16(7), which is the rule to which reference has been made, as being a direction – a rule of court – that hearings of family cases shall be heard and shall continue to be heard in chambers. ... I would want chapter and verse as to what should be put before the judge before he otherwise directs a hearing of a case in open court. I am not prepared in the course of this judgment to give myself any guidelines as to the sort of case that that might be.",
                "It therefore follows that, irrespective of the arguments that have been placed before me ..., I have come to the clear conclusion that all of this must have been contemplated by the legislature, and ... if any change is to be made it should be made by the legislature. I assume that the legislature knew what it was doing and wished, despite all arguments to the contrary, to continue to have Children Act cases heard in chambers. I do not feel that I have any power, even if I wished to do, – which I do not – to hear this particular case in open court. I think I would be breaking the law, in the sense that I would be interpreting in a perverse manner the rules of court laid down under the Children Act. Therefore ... I feel I have no alternative but to direct that the hearing of this case shall be in camera ...”"

That was obviously the intention of the Rules Committee and it follows the long-established practice in the hearing of child cases. Sub-rule (7) allows for all or part of the case to be heard in public. In the light of the long established practice it is unlikely that judges will, other than rarely, hear the evidence relating to the welfare of a child in public. The judgment is in a somewhat different position and it may be that the practice of giving judgment in private is partly due to the parties not asking for it to be heard in public and partly because in the county court, where the vast majority of children’s cases are heard, it is less likely that there will be issues of public interest. Where issues of public interest do arise it would seem entirely appropriate to give judgment in open court providing, where desirable in the interests of the child, appropriate directions are given to avoid identification. If the case raises issues of principle or of law, the judgments are increasingly provided to the law reporters and are published in a large number of law reports which report family cases. But the majority of cases are of no interest to anyone beyond the parties and their families.",

The judge was, however, recognising that the existing practice of hearing the case in private was restated in sub-rule (7) unless there were unusual features to the case. This was a run of the mill case and the general practice would seem appropriate to this case. In my judgment, the judge ought not to be criticised for a cautious view of the exercise of his discretion.",

The exercise of discretion remains in the hands of the trial judge and it is a matter for the judge in each case to exercise that discretion if called upon to do so. In the absence of an application to hear the case in open court and unusual circumstances, the normal position would remain, as recognised by the wording of the sub-rule, that the evidence would be heard in private.”"

The Federal Court had moreover regarded the old-age pensions scheme in question as a collective insurance scheme (Gruppenversicherung), under which only the employers were considered to be insured, the employees (Arbeitnehmer) remaining mere beneficiaries (Bezugsberechtigte). Finally, the Federal Court had examined whether the amendment of the Fund ’ s rules had respected the interests of the employees and the principle of \"good faith\" (Treu und Glauben) and had taken the view that the measure in question had checked a development that was unacceptable socially and politically and had put an end to a situation that represented a considerable departure from the aims of the supplementary pensions scheme. In its opinion, the amendment of the rules was intended to consolidate all the old-age pensions schemes in order to meet the problems arising from economic and demographical changes and was based on a decision of principle taken by the employers ’ and employees ’ representatives.",

The objective protection afforded by the right of property is not undermined by the classification of the insurance contract as group insurance, in which the employees are mere beneficiaries, or in the assessment of their individual interests. The argument that the public interest, and notably the interest of all employees in the consolidation of their pensions schemes, called for a reform of those schemes is plausible and is in any event not open to criticism from the point of view of constitutional law. The interests of employees regarded as beneficiaries may be adequately protected by the organisations that represent them. In view of the superior interest of all civil service employees in having a sound and affordable pensions scheme, a collective defence of those interests would seem objectively appropriate, as it is the sole means of ensuring the necessary balancing of interests within the group. Whatever the case may be, the objective substance of the right of property does not require additional protection of the individual beneficiary. The same applies to the assessment of the merits of the new rules. This is based on both the principle of proportionality and the need to protect confidence in the preservation of acquired pension rights.\"",

As the supreme guardian of the Constitution, the task of the Federal Constitutional Court is to ensure that general constitutional law is complied with and not to rule on the \"civil rights and obligations\" of individuals. That is why, the Government contended, the requirements set forth in Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1) could not apply to it. Equally the criterion laid down in the Court ’ s case-law as to the effect of a decision of a Constitutional Court on the outcome of litigation in the ordinary courts was not helpful; it was virtually inconceivable that Constitutional Court decisions should not have an effect on disputes in such courts. Moreover, the present case concerned the length solely of the proceedings in the Federal Constitutional Court and not the length of the whole proceedings. Finally the decision given by the Federal Constitutional Court was of a preliminary nature and was part of proceedings to determine whether the case could be accepted for adjudication; as such it fell outside the scope of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."

The negotiations entered into by the French Government, in the exercise of their sovereign prerogative, with a view to obtaining reparation from Morocco for damage sustained by French nationals whose property had been expropriated undoubtedly fell within the scope of the State ’ s role of affording diplomatic protection. The first paragraph of Article 1 of the Protocol provided: \"The Moroccan Government shall pay the French Government compensation in a single lump sum and the French Government shall be responsible for apportioning that sum among the beneficiaries of this Protocol\" (see paragraph 9 above). The Protocol therefore already proclaimed the principle of the right to compensation of certain categories of expropriated persons, even though it was for the French authorities to determine, through a compensation committee set up by decree, how the compensation was to be apportioned.",

                "23. The applicant submitted that, even though since the judgment of 8 December 1999 in the Pellegrin case ( Pellegrin v. France [GC], no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999-VIII) the nature of the legal relation between an official and the State – whether governed by statutory conditions of service or stipulated in a contract – was not considered to have any bearing on assessment of the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention, it nevertheless provided a valuable indicator as to whether or not a post entailed the exercise of powers conferred by public law. The general framework of rules within which the applicant had carried out his duties therefore had its importance. In that connection, the applicant pointed out that he did not belong to the category of commercial attachés and advisers created by the decree of 19 April 1950, who were the representatives abroad of the Minister for Economic Affairs, or that of the agricultural attachés created by the decree of 3 December 1956. These two texts had public-service overtones, particularly in those clauses which laid down the duties of officials of the Economic Development Department, who were posted to embassies or consulates and were responsible, among other matters, for assisting with the preparation and negotiation of international commercial treaties. However, especially in departments working overseas, the administrative authorities, at least up to the level of officials working in a specific sector (who were therefore technical specialists), sometimes called upon the services of officials working under individual contracts, some established and others not, and even of foreign nationals recruited on the spot whose remuneration and social security arrangements were governed by local law. The applicant belonged to that category, since he was subject to the general terms and conditions of service of officials working overseas under individual contracts, as laid down by the decree of 18 June 1969, which did not give any definition of the precise duties of such officials. Although officials under individual contracts were obviously bound by the constraints of public service too, they did not exercise any powers conferred by public law, their employment could be terminated at any time and there was between them and the administrative authority which employed them no special bond of trust and loyalty. With more particular regard to economic development offices overseas, the applicant submitted that their main role was to inform and advise importers and exporters of French products. The officials concerned did not participate in the performance of diplomatic duties and did not exercise any portion of the State's sovereign power."

The agricultural attaché was responsible to the chief commercial adviser at the Washington office, who was answerable to the ambassador, who took his instructions from the government in Paris. The applicant had no financial responsibilities, did not participate in negotiations concerning commercial treaties and did not represent the Minister for Economic Affairs at trade fairs. For the purposes of the European Commission's communication of 1988, he therefore considered himself a civil servant employed in an administrative capacity rather than a civil servant exercising authority."

To that end, economic development staff carried out economic surveys in their respective geographical areas. They also assisted with the preparation, negotiation and execution of international treaties between France and the country where they were in post. In doing so, they sometimes had to collect and transmit, by encrypted diplomatic telegrams, confidential information intended to be used for the elaboration of French economic strategy, for example when the highest authorities of the State made visits abroad to promote French commercial interests. They thus represented the Minister for Economic Affairs. Secondly, the work of the economic development offices included informing and advising French firms conducting market research with a view to establishing a presence abroad. The information provided for that purpose was related both to the local economic context and to the administrative formalities foreign businesses were required to complete, and the fee charged for this service, in accordance with the public-service philosophy, was well below what would have been charged by a private consultancy firm. In addition, a favourable opinion from the economic development offices was a prerequisite for any business that sought to have a particular commercial risk guaranteed by COFACE ( Compagnie française d'assurances pour le commerce extérieur – the French company for the insurance of foreign trade), a body financed by public funds. Lastly, under the applicable legal rules the staff of the economic development offices formed part of the diplomatic or consular staff, whose premises they often shared moreover, and were placed under the authority of the ambassador or consul."

It further noted that in each country's public-service sector certain posts involved responsibilities in the general interest or participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law, and that the holders of such posts thus wielded a portion of the sovereign power of the State, which therefore had a legitimate interest in requiring of these servants a special bond of trust and loyalty (ibid., § 65)."

A manifest example of such activities is provided by the armed forces and the police.

He assisted the CFCE ( Centre français pour le commerce extérieur – the French Centre for Foreign Trade), a public body of an industrial and commercial nature, by informing it about local conditions for alcohol imports, provided information to American importers of wines and other alcoholic drinks and gave advice to potential French exporters. His job was thus to facilitate and stimulate exports of certain categories of products and to advise and assist official and semi-official bodies and individual exporters or importers.

The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 § 1 into play (see, among many other authorities, Bochan v.

Instead, the courts had opted for a strictly formal understanding of their role, holding that the wishes of the majority ought to apply and that, in consequence, the church building could not be returned. Referring to the above-cited Sâmbata Bihor Greek Catholic Parish v.

Romania, which, in their reading, found that the review by the courts of the joint committees ’ decisions infringed the right of access to a court in that it was limited to ensuring that the criterion of the worshippers ’ wishes had been complied with. However, the Court notes that in the Sâmbata Bihor case it was examining the legislative framework which existed prior to the amendments made to the text of Article 3 of Legislative Decree no. 126/1990 by Ordinance no. 64/2004 and Law no. 182/2005, and thus before the possibility, clearly provided for by these amendments, of bringing legal proceedings based on the provisions of ordinary law became available. Its reasoning at that time was essentially based on the fact that, prior to the said amendments, some domestic courts had considered that they did not have jurisdiction to examine the merits of a decision taken by a joint committee, and had not therefore taken proper account of the protected interests and rights that were at stake. As a result, the judicial review carried out by these courts was held to be insufficient for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The Court nevertheless noted the fact that the amendments to the Legislative Decree made it possible to bring actions before the domestic courts, which by that stage had jurisdiction to rule on disputes concerning places of worship, and welcomed the legislative changes in question, while pointing out that, for the most part, they had been enacted well after the events complained of in the case before it (see Sâmbata Bihor Greek Catholic Parish, cited above, §§ 72-75)."

However, if this interpretation of domestic law, which has varied over time and depending on the court concerned (see paragraphs 48 - 54 above), is one that gives rise to an issue under the Convention, the Court considers that this point should be examined in the light of compliance with the principle of legal certainty, and not that of access to a court."

It noted that the domestic courts were required to rule on disputes concerning the return of places of worship in spite of the absence of a sufficiently clear and foreseeable legislative framework in respect of the interpretation to be given the concept of “ordinary law” referred to in Article 3 of Legislative Decree no. 126/1990 as amended by Law no. 182/2005, and that, as a result, various domestic courts had reached different legal conclusions on the same legal question brought before them. Thus, in examining an action for recovery of possession on the basis of Article 480 of the Civil Code, the domestic courts, including the High Court, had interpreted this concept in two ways: some courts had considered that they ought to examine the action for recovery of possession in the traditional manner, by comparing the title deeds; others, as in the present case, had ruled that they were required to determine the action for recovery of possession by applying the criterion laid down in Legislative Decree no. 126/1990. Nonetheless, the Chamber held that, although the mechanism of an appeal in the interests of the law had not been used, the highest courts of the land, namely the High Court and the Constitutional Court, had resolved this discrepancy by bringing their respective positions into line with regard to the applicable law."

In this connection, they pointed out that the general perception from the debates held in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies at the time of enacting Law no. 182/2005 was that the amendments in question were directed only at recognising access to the courts, and did not introduce a different perspective on the relations between the property rights of the different religious communities."

The development of the domestic case-law demonstrated the capacity of the Romanian legal system to accommodate the initial discrepancy in the case-law, although an appeal in the interests of the law had not been lodged on this point. Thus, the Constitutional Court, from 1995, and the High Court, from 2009, had taken a clear position on the issue of the applicability of the criterion of the worshippers ’ wishes. From 2011 and 2012 onwards, the High Court had, in the majority of the cases brought before it, applied a combination of the provisions of ordinary law and the provisions of Legislative Decree no. 126/1990. According to the Government, revisiting the application of this criterion at this stage would only serve to destabilise a situation in which the national practice was now convergent and the interests of the communities of worshippers were already clearly established. Equally, the mere fact that the impugned decision in the present case had been delivered prior to the harmonisation of the case-law in this area could not in itself undermine the principles of foreseeability and legal certainty, given that the domestic judicial system had succeeded in ending the uncertainty on its own."

                "116. The Court refers at the outset to its judgment in the case of Nejdet Şahin and Perihan Şahin v. Turkey ([GC], no. 13279/05, §§ 49-58 and 61, 20 October 2011), in which it set out the principles applicable to cases concerning conflicting decisions in the case-law. These principles, which pertain to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, may be summarised as follows:",
                "(a) In this type of case, the Court ’ s assessment has always been based on the principle of legal certainty which is implicit in all the Articles of the Convention and constitutes one of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law (see Nejdet Sahin and Perihan Sahin, cited above, § 56). This principle guarantees a certain stability in legal situations and contributes to public confidence in the courts. The persistence of conflicting court decisions can create a state of legal uncertainty likely to reduce public confidence in the judicial system, whereas such confidence is clearly one of the essential components of a State based on the rule of law (see Hayati Çelebi and Others v. Turkey, no. 582/05, § 52, 9 February 2016, and Ferreira Santos Pardal v. Portugal, no. 30123/10, § 42, 30 July 2015).",
                "(b) However, the possibility of conflicting court decisions is an inherent trait of any judicial system which is based on a network of trial and appeal courts with authority over the area of their territorial jurisdiction. Such divergences may also arise within the same court. That, in itself, cannot be considered contrary to the Convention (see Nejdet Sahin and Perihan Sahin, cited above, § 51, and Albu and Others v. Romania, nos. 34796/09 and sixty-three other applications, § 34, 10 May 2012).",
                "(c) The requirements of legal certainty and the protection of the legitimate confidence of the public do not confer an acquired right to consistency of case-law. Case-law development is not, in itself, contrary to the proper administration of justice since a failure to maintain a dynamic and evolutive approach would risk hindering reform or improvement (see Nejdet Sahin and Perihan Sahin, cited above, § 58, and Albu and Others, cited above, § 34).",
                "(d) It is not in principle the Court ’ s function to compare different decisions of national courts, even if given in apparently similar proceedings; it must respect the independence of those courts. Equally, giving two disputes different treatment cannot be considered to give rise to conflicting case-law when this is justified by a difference in the factual situations at issue (see Hayati Çelebi and Others, cited above, § 52, and Ferreira Santos Pardal, cited above, § 42).",
                "(e) The criteria which guide the Court in its assessment of the circumstances in which contradictory decisions by different domestic courts ruling at final instance entail a violation of the right to a fair hearing, enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, consist in establishing, firstly, whether “profound and long-standing differences” exist in the case-law of the domestic courts; secondly, whether the domestic law provides for a mechanism for overcoming these inconsistencies; and, thirdly, whether that mechanism has been applied and, if appropriate, to what effect (see Nejdet Sahin and Perihan Sahin, cited above, § 53; Hayati Çelebi and Others, cited above, § 52; and Ferreira Santos Pardal, cited above, § 42).",

The Court observes that the present case differs from that of Nejdet Şahin and Perihan Şahin (cited above) in that it does not concern alleged disparities between the judgments of two hierarchically unrelated, different and independent supreme courts, but disparities existing primarily in the case-law of the highest domestic court. The Court cannot but note that, in the present case, the conflicting case-law essentially arises from the decisions taken by the High Court (see also Beian v. Romania (no. 1), no. 30658/05, § 38, ECHR 2007-V (extracts); Ferreira Santos Pardal, cited above, § 45; and Hayati Çelebi and Others, cited above, § 54), even if it was then reflected at the level of the lower courts."

As pointed out in paragraph 104 above, the disparity at that time concerned the interpretation to be given to Article 3 of Legislative Decree no. 126/1990 as worded prior to the amendments in 2004 and 2005 and related to the courts ’ very jurisdiction to rule on an action brought by a Greek Catholic parish with regard to a place of worship. The Supreme Court and, consequently, the courts of appeal had interpreted this provision inconsistently, in some cases refusing, and in other cases agreeing, to rule on the disputes brought before them by Greek Catholic parishes. The applicants in the present case experienced the impact of this conflicting case-law in their own case: at the first stage of the proceedings, the appeal lodged by them in 2001 was declared inadmissible (see paragraph 19 above)."

Thus, Article 3 of Legislative Decree no. 126/1990, as amended, provides that if the members of the clergy representing the two denominations fail to reach an agreement within the joint committee, the party with an interest in bringing judicial proceedings may do so under ordinary law."

This time, it was the concept of “ordinary law” which was the source of differing interpretations: some courts assigned it the usual meaning in the area of protection of the right of ownership and dealt with actions for recovery of possession in the traditional manner, on the basis of the provisions of the Civil Code (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above); others considered that it ought to be interpreted in the light of the text of Article 3 § 1 of Legislative Decree no. 126/1990 and that they were required to take into account the wishes of the worshippers. Depending on the interpretation given by the courts to the concept of “ordinary law”, the substantive law applicable to a dispute could thus differ: in the first scenario, the domestic courts compared the title deeds, whilst in the second the courts sought to establish the wishes of the worshippers in the religious community which was in possession of the property when the legal situation of the place of worship was being examined."

However, it notes that, as is clear from the examples of case-law submitted in the case and from paragraph 117 above, the conflicting interpretation of the concept of “ordinary law” existed within the High Court itself, called upon to settle these disputes at last instance. Thus, in a judgment delivered on 29 May 2007, the High Court confirmed the application of the criterion of the wishes of the worshippers as provided for by Legislative Decree no. 126/1990 (see paragraph 52 in fine above); in a final judgment of 25 November 2008, it remitted a case for judgment to the lower courts, indicating that the criterion of the worshippers ’ wishes was applicable only in the procedure before the joint committees (see paragraph 51 above); then, in a judgment of 24 March 2009, it remitted another case for fresh examination on the ground that the criterion provided for in the special law had not been applied (see paragraph 52 above).

In consequence, if conflicting practice develops within one of the highest judicial authorities in a country, that court itself becomes a source of legal uncertainty, thereby undermining the principle of legal certainty and weakening public confidence in the judicial system (see Beian (no. 1), cited above, § 39, and Ferreira Santos Pardal, cited above, § 47)."

The application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention. The prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and Protocols require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Article of the Convention, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide. It is necessary but it is also sufficient for the facts of the case to fall within the ambit of one or more of the Convention Articles (see Biao v.

Article 14 lists specific grounds which constitute “status” including, inter alia, race, national or social origin and birth. However, the list is illustrative and not exhaustive, as is shown by the words “any ground such as” (in French “ notamment ”) and the inclusion in the list of the phrase “any other status” (in French “ toute autre situation ”).

In such circumstances it is legitimate as a temporary expedient to decide on a particular order in which cases will be dealt with, based on their urgency and importance. The urgency of a case, however, increases with time; consequently, if the critical situation persists, such expedients are shown to be insufficient and the State must take other, more effective action to comply with the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see, among other authorities, the Zimmermann and Steiner judgment of 13 July 1983, Series A no. 66, pp. 12-13, para. 29).

Having reviewed the criteria relating to the complexity of the case and to the conduct of the judicial authorities and the parties, the Court must examine the consequences of the trial for the rights and interests at stake. This is one of the factors to be considered, as has often been pointed out by the European Court of Human Rights (Buchholz judgment). In its claim for compensation, the appellant company has given no indication of any consequences of the delay other than the precautionary entry which, in order to cover itself against the outcome of the trial, it had made [in the land register] against security at the time of the civil proceedings, so as to provide for possible compensation of the defendants if they should succeed at trial. Nothing was said about the practical consequences of the length of the trial for the rights and interests of the plaintiff. The latter confined itself in its submissions to noting the aforementioned effect of the precautionary step provided for in section 42 of the Mortgages Act and ‘ non-pecuniary damage ’, about which it remained vague. It thus appears that the time factor was not of primary importance in the instant case. Seeing that only court costs and the amount of the security were involved, it does not seem that this case before the Barcelona court merited any priority. If other, more urgent cases were pending, nothing precluded giving them priority and provisionally postponing the decision which is the subject of the present appeal.",

He stressed the temporary backlog of cases and saw that as one of the reasons for the length of the trial in issue. This Court must consider that factor, just as the European Court of Human Rights has done, which has given judgment, under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, on delays found to have occurred in different types of trial. The Buchholz judgment may be cited as an example.",

The action was brought on 2 May 1979 and judgment given on 17 December 1983. A total duration of more than four and a half years is in principle excessive if we take into account ... the ‘ total time taken up by the trial ’ and particularly if we remember that the trial court did not indicate to us any special feature of the case justifying such dilatoriness. In the absence of any detailed justification, it is likewise not possible ... to consider ‘ what is regarded as the norm in respect of a court ’ s level of activity and output ’. Since normality is what corresponds to the norm and not what departs from it, even if the norm is more often honoured in the breach than in the observance, the traditional slowness of the system of justice cannot be regarded as ‘ normal ’. Furthermore, if the length of trials were to continue to grow longer, if the failure to comply with the norms of ‘ output of the system of justice ’ were to become widespread and if such ‘ abnormal ’, but commonplace, circumstances always had to be taken as a basis for assessing whether or not the right to a trial without undue delay had been respected, the protection of this fundamental right would by that very fact be reduced to nought ...\" (ibid., p. 154).",

                "The Federal Constitutional Court noted that the appeal was inadmissible in so far as it raised for the first time issues of fact or of law that could have been pleaded in the ordinary courts. However, it found the remaining complaints admissible, in particular those relating to the unfair character of the proceedings in the Federal Court and the interference with the applicant ’ s right of property. As the Federal Court had ruled on the issues of fact and law at last instance in its judgments in the test cases of 16 March 1988, it was not necessary to file further appeals to exhaust the remedies in the ordinary courts.",

                "1. There had been no violation of the applicant ’ s right to be heard in a court (Recht auf Gewährung rechtlichen Gehörs). In particular there was nothing to suggest that the tribunals had not taken due account of evidence concerning the amendment of the Fund ’ s rules. The decisions were essentially based on two reports drawn up by expert commissions in September 1975 and November 1983. It had not been necessary to take additional evidence.",
                "2. Even if it were accepted that pension rights came within the ambit of the constitutional right of property, there was nothing to indicate that there had been an infringement of that right. It was lawful to reduce pension rights by amending the rules which were of a private-law character.",
                "The Federal Court had held that the pensions under the scheme administered by the Fund were a matter of private law and this view had not been contested by the applicant. The Federal Court had moreover regarded the old-age pensions scheme in question as a collective insurance scheme (Gruppenversicherung), under which only the employers were considered to be insured, the employees (Arbeitnehmer) remaining mere beneficiaries (Bezugsberechtigte). Finally, the Federal Court had examined whether the amendment of the Fund ’ s rules had respected the interests of the employees and the principle of \"good faith\" (Treu und Glauben) and had taken the view that the measure in question had checked a development that was unacceptable socially and politically and had put an end to a situation that represented a considerable departure from the aims of the supplementary pensions scheme. In its opinion, the amendment of the rules was intended to consolidate all the old-age pensions schemes in order to meet the problems arising from economic and demographical changes and was based on a decision of principle taken by the employers ’ and employees ’ representatives.",
                "The Federal Constitutional Court concluded its reasoning in the following terms:",
                "\"This application of the civil law does not infringe any fundamental right. The objective protection afforded by the right of property is not undermined by the classification of the insurance contract as group insurance, in which the employees are mere beneficiaries, or in the assessment of their individual interests. The argument that the public interest, and notably the interest of all employees in the consolidation of their pensions schemes, called for a reform of those schemes is plausible and is in any event not open to criticism from the point of view of constitutional law. The interests of employees regarded as beneficiaries may be adequately protected by the organisations that represent them. In view of the superior interest of all civil service employees in having a sound and affordable pensions scheme, a collective defence of those interests would seem objectively appropriate, as it is the sole means of ensuring the necessary balancing of interests within the group. Whatever the case may be, the objective substance of the right of property does not require additional protection of the individual beneficiary. The same applies to the assessment of the merits of the new rules. This is based on both the principle of proportionality and the need to protect confidence in the preservation of acquired pension rights.\"",
                "Nor, it added, did the reversal of case-law by the Federal Court, which had previously considered employees to be insured under the rules in question, interfere with the right of property, because case-law had no legislative force and could evolve.",
                "Finally, the Federal Constitutional Court observed that the amendment of the Fund ’ s rules did not breach the principle of equality before the law or that of the freedom of association. The applicant ’ s doubts as to the impartiality of the arbitrators were not relevant as the latter were not members of the judiciary, but sat on private-law arbitration tribunals."

Equally the criterion laid down in the Court ’ s case-law as to the effect of a decision of a Constitutional Court on the outcome of litigation in the ordinary courts was not helpful; it was virtually inconceivable that Constitutional Court decisions should not have an effect on disputes in such courts. Moreover, the present case concerned the length solely of the proceedings in the Federal Constitutional Court and not the length of the whole proceedings. Finally the decision given by the Federal Constitutional Court was of a preliminary nature and was part of proceedings to determine whether the case could be accepted for adjudication; as such it fell outside the scope of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."

                "As the fact constituting the right conferred by Law no. 89/2001 consists of a violation of the Convention, it is for the Strasbourg Court to determine all the elements of such a legal fact, which thus ends by being ‘ brought into conformity ’ by the Court, whose case-law is binding on the Italian courts in so far as the application of Law no. 89/2001 is concerned.",
                "It is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between the Convention and the internal judicial system, which the Advocate-General [ Procuratore Generale ] has amply discussed in court. Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of the Convention in the context of the sources of domestic law, it is certain that the direct implementation in the Italian judicial system of a provision of the Convention, established by Law no. 89/2001 (that is, by Article 6 § 1 in the part relating to ‘ reasonable time ’ ), cannot diverge from the interpretation which the European Court gives to the same provision.",
                "The opposite argument, which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to Law no. 89/2001 in the national system and the interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court to the right to the reasonable length of proceedings, would deprive the said Law no. 89/2001 of any justification and cause the Italian State to violate Article 1 of the Convention, according to which ‘ The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention ’ (including the said Article 6, which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable time).",
                "The reason behind the enactment of Law no. 89/2001 was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings, so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of the Strasbourg Court, expressly provided for by the Convention (Article 35: ‘ The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted ... ’ ). The European system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity. From it derives the duty of the States which have ratified the Convention to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by the Convention, above all in their own internal order and vis-à-vis the organs of the national judicial system. And this protection must be ‘ effective ’ (Article 13 of the Convention ), that is, of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to the Strasbourg Court.",
                "The domestic remedy introduced by Law no. 89/2001 did not previously exist in the Italian system, with the consequence that applications against Italy in respect of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention had ‘ clogged ’ (the term used by rapporteur Follieri in the sitting of the Senate of 28 September 2000) the European Court. The Strasbourg Court observed, prior to Law no. 89/2001, that the said failures on the part of Italy to comply ‘ reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy. This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention ’ ( see the four judgments of the Court delivered on 28 July 1999 in Bottazzi, Di Mauro, Ferrari and A.P .).",
                "Law no. 89/2001 constitutes the domestic remedy to which a ‘ victim of a violation ’ ( as defined by Article 34 of the Convention) of Article 6 (failure to comply with the reasonable - time requirement ) must have recourse before applying to the European Court to claim the ‘ just satisfaction ’ provided for in Article 41 of the Convention, which, when the violation exists, is only awarded by the Court ‘ if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made ’. Law no. 89/2001 has therefore allowed the European Court to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it ( including before the Act was passed) and aimed at obtaining the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the Convention for the excessive length of proceedings ( see Brusco v. Italy, decision of 6 September 2001).",
                "This mechanism for implementation of the Convention and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of the European Court of Strasbourg does not operate, however, in cases in which the Court holds that the consequences of the established violation of the Convention have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only ‘ partially ’, because in such an event the said Article 41 provides for the intervention of the European Court to protect the ‘ victim of the violation ’. In such cases an individual application to the Strasbourg Court on the basis of Article 34 of the Convention is admissible ( see Scordino v. Italy, decision of 27 March 2003 ) and the Court acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law.",
                "The judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is, obviously, the European Court, whose duty it is to apply Article 41 of the Convention to ascertain whether, in the presence of a violation of a provision of the Convention, the internal law has been able to redress fully the consequences of this violation.",
                "The argument whereby, in applying Law no. 89/2001, the Italian courts may follow a different interpretation from that which the European Court has given to the provisions of Article 6 of the Convention ( violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law) implies that the victim of the violation, if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by the European Court, must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the Convention from the latter Court. This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in Italian law by Law no. 89/2001 and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of the Strasbourg Court.",
                "It is therefore necessary to concur with the European Court of Human Rights, which, in the above-mentioned decision on the Scordino application ( concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the Italian courts in implementing Law no. 89/2001), affirmed that ‘ it follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must, where possible, interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention ’.",
                "... The preparatory documents of Law no. 89/2001 are even more explicit. In the report concerning the bill of Senator Pinto (proceedings of the Senate no. 3 813 of 16 February 1999) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative (and then adopted by the Act) secures for the applicant ‘ a protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court ’, as the direct reference to Article 6 of the Convention makes it possible to transfer to domestic level ‘ the limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level, limits which depend essentially on the State and on the development of the case-law of the Strasbourg authorities, especially that of the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits ’.",
                "6. The considerations expounded in sections 3 to 5 of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of the European Court on the implementation of Law no. 89/2001 with regard to reparation for non-pecuniary damage.",
                "In this particular instance, however, any possibility for the national court to exclude non-pecuniary damage (despite having found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention) must be considered as non-existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of the European Court which, with reference to the same proceedings, had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non-pecuniary damage for the applicant, which the Court itself redressed for a limited period. From such a decision of the European Court it follows that, once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision, the applicant has continued to suffer non-pecuniary damage, which must be compensated for in application of Law no. 89/2001.",
                "It cannot therefore be maintained – as the Rome Court of Appeal has done – that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question. Such reasoning, apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that the European Court has already ruled that non-pecuniary damage had been sustained because of a delay in the same action, is in any case incorrect, because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non- compliance with reasonable time - limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non-pecuniary damage, given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it.",
                "7. In conclusion the decision appealed against must be quashed and the case remitted to the Rome Court of Appeal, which, in a different composition, will order payment to the applicant of compensation for non-pecuniary damage payable as a result of the violation of the reasonable - time requirement for the period following 16 April 1996 alone, taking as a reference point payments of the same kind of damages by the European Court of Human Rights, from which it may diverge, but only to a reasonable extent (Court HR, 27 March 2003, Scordino v. Italy ). ”",

The manifest object, and the effect, of the impugned provision was in any event to modify the applicable rules relating to compensation, including in the case of judicial proceedings then in progress to which the State was a party ( see Anagnostopoulos and Others v.

It feels it important to point out that the reason it has been led to rule on so many length-of-proceedings cases is because certain Contracting Parties have for years failed to comply with the “reasonable time” requirement under Article 6 § 1 and have not provided a domestic remedy for this type of complaint."

The Court has already had occasion to stress the serious difficulties it has had as a result of Italy ’ s inability to resolve the situation. It has expressed itself on the subject in the following terms :",
                "“The Court next draws attention to the fact that since 25 June 1987, the date of the Capuano v. Italy judgment (Series A no. 119), it has already delivered 65 judgments in which it has found violations of Article 6 § 1 in proceedings exceeding a “reasonable time” in the civil courts of the various regions of Italy. Similarly, under former Articles 31 and 32 of the Convention, more than 1,400 reports of the Commission resulted in resolutions by the Committee of Ministers finding Italy in breach of Article 6 for the same reason.",
                "The frequency with which violations are found shows that there is an accumulation of identical breaches which are sufficiently numerous to amount not merely to isolated incidents. Such breaches reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy.",
                "This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention. ” (see Bottazzi v. Italy [GC], no. 34884/97, § 22, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; Ferrari v. Italy [GC], no. 33440/96, § 21, 28 July 1999; A .P. v. Italy [GC], no. 35265 /97, § 18, 28 July 1999; and Di Mauro v.

Thus the Court, like the Commission, after years of examining the reasons for the delays attributable to the parties under the Italian procedural rules, has had to resolve to standardise its judgments and decisions. This has allowed it to adopt more than 1, 000 judgments against Italy since 1999 in civil length-of-proceedings cases. That approach has made it necessary to establish scales on equitable principles for awards in respect of non-pecuniary damage under Article 41, in order to arrive at equivalent results in similar cases.",
                "All this has led the Court to award higher levels of compensation than those awarded by the Convention institutions prior to 19 99, and which may differ from those applied in the event of a finding of other violations. This increase, far from being a punitive measure, was intended to serve two purposes. On the one hand it encouraged States to find their own, universally accessible, solution to the problem, and on the other hand it allowed applicants to avoid being penalised for the lack of domestic remedies."

Germany, 15 July 1982, §§ 69 et seq., Series A no. 51; Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, § 36, Reports 1996- III; Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, § 44, ECHR 1999- VI; and Jensen v.

The issue as to whether a person may still claim to be the victim of an alleged violation of the Convention essentially entails on the part of the Court an ex post facto examination of his or her situation. As it has already held in other length-of-proceedings cases, the question whether he or she has received reparation for the damage caused – comparable to just satisfaction as provided for under Article 41 of the Convention – is an important issue. It is the Court ’ s settled case-law that where the national authorities have found a violation and their decision constitutes appropriate and sufficient redress, the party concerned can no longer claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention (see Holzinger (no. 1), cited above, § 21 )."

In so far as the parties appear to link the issue of victim status to the more general question of effectiveness of the remedy and seek guidelines on providing the most effective domestic remedies possible, the Court proposes to address the question in a wider context by giving certain indications as to the characteristics such a domestic remedy should have, having regard to the fact that, in this type of case, the applicant ’ s ability to claim to be a victim will depend on the redress the domestic remedy will have afforded him or her."

The Court observes that it has stated on many occasions that Article 6 § 1 imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see, among many other authorities, Süßmann v. Germany, 16 September 1996, § 55, Reports 1996- IV, and Bottazzi, cited above, § 22). Where the judicial system is deficient in this respect, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy of the type provided for under Italian law for example."

It has also stressed the importance of the rules relating to the subsidiarity principle so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that could otherwise, and in the Court ’ s opinion more appropriately, have been addressed in the first place within the national legal system."

Accordingly, where the legislature or the domestic courts have agreed to play their proper role by introducing a domestic remedy, the Court will clearly have to draw certain conclusions from this. Where a State has taken a significant step by introducing a compensatory remedy, the Court must leave a wider margin of appreciation to the State to allow it to organise the remedy in a manner consistent with its own legal system and traditions and consonant with the standard of living in the country concerned. It will, in particular, be easier for the domestic courts to refer to the amounts awarded at domestic level for other types of damage – personal injury, damage relating to a relative ’ s death or damage in defamation cases, for example – and rely on their innermost conviction, even if that results in awards of amounts that are lower than those fixed by the Court in similar cases."

It might appear paradoxical that, by imposing various taxes – payable prior to the lodging of an application or after the decision – the State takes away with one hand what it has awarded with the other to repair a breach of the Convention.

Furthermore, the measures taken must be such as to remedy the systemic defect underlying the Court ’ s finding of a violation, so that the system established by the Convention is not compromised by a large number of applications arising out of the same cause. Such measures must therefore include a mechanism for providing injured persons with compensation for the violation of the Convention established in the present judgment concerning the applicants.

Contrary to the amount awarded in the cases referred to above, the compensation to be determined in the present case will not have to reflect the idea of a total elimination of the consequences of the impugned interference.

In determining the amount of adequate compensation, which does not necessarily have to reflect the full value of the property, the Court must base itself on the criteria laid down in its judgments regarding Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and according to which, without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value, a deprivation of property would normally constitute a disproportionate interference which could not be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see James and Others, cited above, § 54). The Court reiterates that in many cases of lawful expropriation, such as a distinct expropriation of land with a view to building a road or for other purposes “in the public interest”, only full compensation can be regarded as reasonably related to the value of the property (see The former King of Greece and Others ( just satisfaction), cited above, § 78 ). However, legitimate objectives of “public interest”, such as those pursued by measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (ibid. )."

Like the Chamber, the Grand Chamber considers it appropriate to base itself on the value of the property at the time of the expropriation, as stated in the court-ordered expert reports drawn up during the domestic proceedings (165,7 55 Italian lire (ITL) per square metre in 1983 – see paragraphs 32 and 37 above) and on which the applicants based their claims (see paragraphs 24 3-44 above). As the adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value, such as the lapse of a considerable period of time (see Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis, cited above, § 82, and, mutatis mutandis, Motais de Narbonne v. France ( just satisfaction), no. 48161/99, §§ 20-21, 27 May 2003 ), once the amount obtained at domestic level is deducted, and the difference with the market value of the land in 1983 thus obtained, that amount will have to be converted to current value to offset the effects of inflation. Moreover, interest will have to be paid on this amount so as to offset, at least in part, the long period for which the applicants have been deprived of the land. In the Court ’ s opinion the interest should take the form of simple statutory interest applied to the capital progressively adjusted. With regard, lastly, to the 20% tax deducted from the expropriation compensation awarded at domestic level, the Grand Chamber, like the Chamber, has not found the application of that tax to be unlawful as such but has taken account of that factor in assessing the facts ( see paragraph 101 above )."

The two sets of claims were joined by the Garrison Court after supervisory review of the previous court decisions (see para. 13 above ). In view of this situation the Court considers it necessary to calculate the total length separately for each set of claims. Accordingly, the Court observes that the first set of proceedings lasted from 2 October 1998 to 4 August 2004, with exception of the period from 7 December 1998 to 22 May 2001 when the case was subject to supervisory examination and not pending.

The Court further observes that the systemic problem of non-enforcement in Russia has been addressed on numerous occasions both in its own judgments and in the decisions of the Committee of Ministers and concludes that respect for human rights, as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto, does not require examination of the present complaint on its merits.
