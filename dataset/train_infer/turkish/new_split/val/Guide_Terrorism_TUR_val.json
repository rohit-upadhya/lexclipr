In carrying out its assessment of the planning and control phase of the operation from the standpoint of Article 2 of the Convention, the Court must have particular regard to the context in which the incident occurred, as well as to the way in which the situation developed. Its sole concern must be to evaluate whether, given the circumstances, the planning and control of the operation at Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s house showed that the authorities had taken appropriate care to ensure that any risk to his life had been minimised and that they had not been negligent in their choice of action (see Andronicou and Constantinou, cited above, § 181, and Bubbins, cited above, § 141 )."

Some time later, after a telephone call made from the Odzun Medical Centre to the police station of the nearby town of Tumanyan, four police officers, A.A., V.B., A.E. and M.V., arrived at Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s house. As they approached, Seyran Ayvazyan was in the garden and, having seen the police officers, ran towards the house. The police officers started chasing him. As Seyran Ayvazyan entered the house and was about to shut the door, police officer V.B. reached him and started to push the door open. At that moment Seyran Ayvazyan stabbed V.B. in the arm and cheek with the knife, through the half-open door, and managed to shut the door. V.B. was taken by car to hospital, while A.A. and A.E., who remained at the house, called Tumanyan police station and reported the incident. Then they tried to persuade Seyran Ayvazyan to come out, but the latter refused to do so, threatening to kill anybody who tried to approach the house and sharpening his knives in full view. They contacted one of Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s sisters, who lived in the same village, but she refused to come. Having received the call from A.A. and A.E, nine more police officers, including A.S., N.N., G.M., R.M., H.Gev., and H.Gri, led by Major A.B., the chief of Tumanyan police station, arrived at the house and surrounded it. The mayor of Odzun, an ambulance and the fire brigade were also called. Another attempt was made to have Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s relatives, who lived in the same village, come to the scene in order to persuade him to surrender, but they refused to come. Then for about five hours the police officers tried to persuade Seyran Ayvazyan to surrender, but he continued to display the same threatening behaviour as earlier. In the meantime, the police officers contacted the head of Vanadzor Psychiatric Hospital, who told them that it would only be possible to tranquillise Seyran Ayvazyan only in hospital."

After the fire hose had been turned on, six police officers, A.S., N.N., G.M., R.M., H.Gev. and A.A., upon an order from the chief of Tumanyan police station, pushed open the door and entered the house. H.Gev., who was the first to enter, held a small wooden table in front of him as a shield against a knife attack. After the police officers entered, they saw that the way from the corridor into the room had been barricaded with furniture. The police officers decided on the spot to leave the house and the entire group went out. Having seen that the police officers were leaving, Seyran Ayvazyan moved towards them with a knife in each hand, reached H.Gev. by the door to the porch, and stabbed him in the head with one of the knives. H.Gev. immediately fell as a result of the stabbing. As he was lying on the ground, Seyran Ayvazyan tried to stab him again, but at that moment another police officer, H.Gri., who was guarding the entrance, fired a warning shot in the air from his automatic rifle and, seeing that Seyran Ayvazyan was still trying to stab H.Gev., shot at Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s legs. At the same time, and independently of those actions, police officers A.S., A.A. and R.M., seeing that H.Gev. had fallen as a result of the assault and that Seyran Ayvazyan was trying to stab him again, started to shoot with their pistols at Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s legs. A.S. fired eight shots, while A.A. and R.M. fired three shots each. As a result of the shooting, Seyran Ayvazyan was wounded, fell and died."

As they were entering, he proposed that Seyran Ayvazyan come out of the room but he held the knife as if he wanted to throw it and kept threatening to stab him. Realising that it was not possible to remove him from the room and that he could harm someone, A.S. told the other five police officers that they should all go outside and find another way to neutralise Seyran Ayvazyan. They left the house; the last one to leave was H.Gev., who was holding a table to protect himself in case a knife was thrown. A.S. went down from the porch and was already in the yard when those of his colleagues who had gathered there shouted “He has come out and attacked.” H.Gev. was holding a table, defending himself against Seyran Ayvazyan. A.S. ran towards them and saw Seyran Ayvazyan stab H.Gev. in the head, so he shot at Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s legs. Seyran Ayvazyan fell down and, while lying on the ground, he threw the same knife at H.Gev. Then he took out another knife and threw it at the police officers. A.S. fired again in his direction.

They left – that is to say he noticed that the others had already gone out. Realising that he was alone, he tried to leave the house while holding the table. He had not yet reached the door when suddenly Seyran Ayvazyan screamed and ran towards him with a knife in his hand. Seeing this, he tried to move faster towards the door. Seyran Ayvazyan reached him and stabbed him with the knife in the head. This happened in the doorway. Seyran Ayvazyan managed to stab him because he (that is to say Seyran Ayvazyan) was taller, although he (that is to say H.Gev) had managed to a certain extent to push Seyran Ayvazyan back with the table. He fell down on the porch. As he was lying on his side, facing the door and bleeding, he saw Seyran Ayvazyan trying to stab him a second time with the same knife, again in the head. Seyran Ayvazyan was still standing at a distance of one metre away while he (that is to say H.Gev) continued to use the table to defend himself. After Seyran Ayvazyan had tried to stab him for a second time, he heard a number of shots, but could not remember how many. He saw that the shots had hit Seyran Ayvazyan in the legs. Seyran Ayvazyan fell down, with his legs lying next to his own. Seyran Ayvazyan then took out another knife. Seyran Ayvazyan must have thrown the first knife either in his direction or in the direction of those who were behind him, but he could not tell how far away the knife had been thrown. Seyran Ayvazyan subsequently wanted to get up and stab him again, but then he heard other shots.

At that moment the fire engine was spraying water at Seyran Ayvazyan, who had barricaded himself in with a wardrobe and moved the wardrobe to protect himself from the water. Seyran Ayvazyan had also placed an armchair between the two rooms, so that they could not enter the second room. They tried to persuade him to throw down the knife, but he continued to threaten them. As Seyran Ayvazyan was not coming out and was refusing to calm down, A.A. received an order to leave the house in order that an alternative plan could be devised. As the six police officers were leaving, Seyran Ayvazyan unexpectedly ran towards them, screaming loudly. A.A. could not see whether Seyran Ayvazyan had a knife since he (that is to say A.A.) was facing the main entrance. He heard somebody outside say “Careful, he ’ s about to strike”. He then jumped out of the house and over the porch into the yard. Before rolling away, he heard two shots and saw H.Gev. lying in the porch on his back, facing the main entrance. Seyran Ayvazyan was squatting with a knife in his hand and was trying to stab H.Gev., who had already been injured. Thinking that the shots fired earlier had not touched Seyran Ayvazyan and that, if he did not shoot, Seyran Ayvazyan would strike again and kill H.Gev., he took out his weapon, took aim at Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s legs and fired three shots at them.

On 12 September 2007 the Lori Regional Court, relying on the facts, as established by the investigation, examined the complaint and decided to dismiss it, finding that the use of firearms by the police officers had been justified as they had opened fire to prevent, and protect themselves from, Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s unlawful violent actions. It concluded that the police officers had acted in necessary defence, as provided for by Article 42 of the CC, and also in compliance with sections 32 § 2 and 33 of the Police Act. The Regional Court moreover held that there was no need to institute separate criminal proceedings concerning Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s killing, since the investigation into that incident had been carried out within the framework of criminal proceedings instituted in relation to Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s unlawful actions. Separately, the Regional Court found that the complaint against the refusal to institute criminal proceedings had been lodged outside the one-month time-limit prescribed by Article 290 of the CCP."

Turning to the question of compliance with domestic time-limits, it found that the appeal procedure pursued by An.A. was indeed governed by Article 263 § 2, which at the material time had not prescribed any time-limits for contesting the prosecutor ’ s refusal before the courts. However, the one ‑ month time-limit prescribed by Article 290 was applicable to her case. The appeal had only been lodged on 27 June 2007 – namely outside that one-month time ‑ limit. Thus, both the Regional Court and the Court of Appeal had exceeded their temporal jurisdiction by examining the merits of An.A. ’ s complaint. This in itself was sufficient grounds for rejecting the appeal; however, the Court of Cassation found it necessary – taking into account the fact that ( a ) both courts had examined the merits of the case and had reached findings on the merits, and ( b ) it was called upon to ensure uniform application of the law – to express a number of legal positions on the matter, which could provide guidance to lower courts in similar cases."

Referring to Articles 27 § 1, 175 and 182 § § 1 and 2 of the CCP, the Court of Cassation concluded that it was impossible to answer that question unequivocally. In particular, a number of factors suggested that criminal case no. 55200706 had been instituted on account of the acts committed by Seyran Ayvazyan rather than his killing. Firstly, the proceedings had been instituted only under Article 104 § 2 (1), in conjunction with Article 34 of the CC ( namely in respect of attempted murder of two or more persons ) and therefore could not legally be characterised as applying to his killing. Secondly, the wording of the decision to discontinue the proceedings also contained a refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers implicated in his shooting, which confirmed that no criminal proceedings had been instituted on account of that incident."

On the other hand, a number of factors suggested that the proceedings instituted had also been based on the fact that he had been killed, and an investigation had been carried out in that connection. Thus, the descriptive part of the wording of the decision to institute proceedings had mentioned the fact that Seyran Ayvazyan had been taken to hospital and had died. Furthermore, Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s sister, An.A., had been granted victim status in the criminal case by decision of the investigator, moreover, that decision had stated that Seyran Ayvazyan had been deprived of his life “as a result of a crime”. Lastly, certain investigative measures taken in the course of the criminal proceedings had been aimed at obtaining evidence concerning the circumstances of Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s death, including the inspections of the crime scene, of Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s body and of his clothes, the autopsy, the forensic examination of his clothes and the interviews with the police officers who had shot at Seyran Ayvazyan or witnessed the shootings. This suggested that some investigation into his death had nevertheless been carried out.

However, not all the police officers who had witnessed the shooting had been questioned. In particular, two of the six officers who had been present at the time of the shooting, namely G.M. and R.M, had not been questioned. Thus, the investigating authority had failed to secure all the evidence relating to the incident. As regards those officers who had been questioned, H.Gri. had been questioned eight days, N.N. nine days and A.A. ten days after the incident. No measures had been taken in the meantime to isolate them from each other. While there was no evidence to suggest that the police officers had colluded with each other, the fact that no steps had been taken to minimise such risk constituted a significant shortcoming in the investigation. Furthermore, no adequate assessment had been made of the direction of the bullets fired at Seyran Ayvazyan. In particular, no reasonable explanation had been determined by the investigation for the fact that six bullets had been fired at Seyran Ayvazyan from behind."

Furthermore, there were discrepancies between the time-limits prescribed by those Articles; the fact that those discrepancies existed was later confirmed by a decision of the Constitutional Court.

He had not posed a real and immediate danger to anyone ’ s life. Having been surrounded by police officers and other emergency services in his house, he had not been able to harm anyone. If Seyran Ayvazayn had been so close to a police officer as to pose a real threat, that officer would undoubtedly have been harmed by the numerous shots fired at Seyran Ayvazyan. In fact, having been hit in the leg by the first shot fired at him, Seyran Ayvazyan had fallen and could no longer have been dangerous. Furthermore, six of the ten bullets had been fired at Seyran Ayvazyan in a “back to front” direction, meaning that he had been standing with his back to the police officers, who could not have determined from that position whether or not he had had any weapon on him."

The applicant further submitted that four different types of combat weapons had been used during the arrest, in spite of the fact that Seyran Ayvazyan had been armed only with homemade knives. The grenade had been found only after the incident and could not justify the use of force, as Seyran Ayvazyan had never threatened to use it. The police officers had not been sufficiently trained to use such special means as helmets and protective shields in order to be able to arrest him without using combat weapons and threatening his life. They had possessed none of this equipment and had had to use a small table as a protective shield. Furthermore, the police had known that he was suffering from a paranoid type of schizophrenia and had been hospitalised on numerous occasions. Therefore, they should have invited a psychiatrist to neutralise him with special measures. The argument that they “ invited a doctor but he did not come” could not justify the “absolute necessity” of depriving him of his life. The number of shots fired at Seyran Ayvazyan could not be considered as self-defence either. In sum, the deprivation of life had not been “absolutely necessary” within the meaning of Article 2."

No criminal proceedings had been instituted in that respect, while those proceedings that had been instituted had been aimed at investigating the acts committed by him rather than his death. Thus, there had been no investigation whatsoever. While the identity of the people who had shot dead Seyran Ayvazyan had been known to the investigator, none of them had been charged or had stood trial. As regards the investigation conducted within the scope of the instituted proceedings, a number of shortcomings in that investigation, as well as the inadequacy thereof, had been confirmed by the Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 45 - 46 above). The police officers had been the only witnesses and the authorities had failed to take sufficient measures to establish the facts accurately. Furthermore, the investigation had been conducted by an investigator of the Lori Regional Prosecutor ’ s Office and the subsequent prosecutorial review had been carried out by a prosecutor of the same Prosecutor ’ s Office. Thus, the investigation had not been carried out by an independent and objective body. All the complaints by her and her sister against the investigator ’ s actions or inaction had been forwarded for examination to the same prosecutors."

The police officers had initially had no intention of using firearms but had been forced to do so by the exigencies of the situation. The police officers had had to take a speedy decision as there had been a real and immediate threat to police officer H.Gev. ’ s life, and also taking into account the unpredictability of Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s behaviour because of his mental illness. The police officers, having assessed all the risks, had considered the use of force to be reasonable and necessary to eliminate any danger posed by him. Even though Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s knives had been homemade, four persons had sustained injuries of medium severity. The police actions had therefore been in compliance with the domestic law, namely the Police Act. Moreover, the circumstances of this case had been similar to those of Andronicou and Constantinou v. Cyprus (9 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VI), in which a great deal of fire power had similarly been used but no violation had been found."

The Government further referred to all the measures taken by the police officers, arguing that the arrest operation had been executed in such a manner as to minimise the use of any means posing a threat to Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s life. First they had tried for about five hours to persuade him to surrender. For this reason they had called the mayor of Odzun, the chief of Tumanyan police station and Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s relatives. They had also contacted the chief of Vanadzor Psychiatric Hospital to obtain information about Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s mental disorder and how it would be possible to tranquillise him. The ambulance and fire brigade had also been called for safety reasons, while the doctor who had also been called had not refused to come but had simply said that it would be possible to tranquillise Seyran Ayvazyan only in hospital. Having received this information, the police officers had called Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s sister, A.M., who had refused to come, after which they had decided to disarm him by spraying water from the fire engine ’ s hose."

A number of investigative measures had been taken in order to establish the circumstances: an inspection of the crime scene and of Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s body and clothes, an autopsy, a ballistic examination, and the questioning of witnesses and injured parties. The Lori Regional Prosecutor ’ s Office was an authority independent hierarchically, institutionally and practically from the officials implicated in the events. The fact that a number of investigative measures had been taken in order to establish the circumstances of Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s death had also been confirmed by the Court of Cassation. At the same time, as a body called upon to provide guidance for lower courts, it found that there had been some shortcomings in the investigation. Nevertheless, the Court of Cassation had not been able to restore the breached rights and correct the situation because of the applicant ’ s failure to lodge a timely appeal."

Any use of force must be no more than “absolutely necessary” for – and strictly proportionate to – the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, §§ 148-149 and 200, Series A no. 324; Andronicou and Constantinou, cited above, § 171; McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, § 110, ECHR 2001-III; and Wasilewska and Kałucka v.

His actions were deemed to constitute attempted murder, and the only articles of the Criminal Code on which the proceedings were based were those providing punishment for such acts. The Court notes that this may raise a question as to whether any investigation conducted on such a premise could be per se considered as an investigation whose purpose was to investigate truly and fully the circumstances of Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s death and to collect evidence for that purpose."

It appears, however, that a number of investigative measures taken within the scope of that investigation did examine the circumstances of Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s fatal shooting; eventually a decision was taken to refuse to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers involved. The Court accepts that some form of official investigation took place (see Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç v. Turkey [GC], no. 24014/05, § 171, 14 April 2015 ). It remains to be seen if such an investigation was effective within the meaning of Article 2 of the Convention. In this context, the Court agrees with the Court of Cassation that there were a number of serious shortcomings, leading to a conclusion that the investigation into Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s killing was not adequate (see paragraphs 45 - 46 above)."

In particular, none of the seven police officers involved were kept apart after the incident, and only two of them, A.S. and H.Gev., were questioned on the same or the following day. Three others, H.Gri., N.N. and A.A., were questioned with significant delays of eight, nine and ten days respectively (see paragraph 22 above). While there is no evidence to suggest that these officers colluded with each other or with their colleagues in the Tumanyan police force, the mere fact that appropriate steps were not taken to reduce the risk of such collusion amounts to a significant shortcoming in the adequacy of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, § 330, ECHR 2007 ‑ II )."

Thirdly, having regard to the manner in which those interviews which did take place were conducted, the Court observes that the police officers were for the most part simply asked to provide an account of the incident and very few questions were posed to them, despite the numerous apparent contradictions and inconsistencies in their statements (see paragraphs 23 - 28 above). Even those few questions which were asked appear either not to have been sufficiently inquisitorial and detailed or incapable of clarifying the circumstances of the fatal shooting (see paragraph 28 above). A number of highly relevant facts were ignored and, without seeking proper clarification, the investigator merely accepted the accounts of the police officers, who could not have been impartial witnesses. No attempts were made to determine, inter alia, questions such as why six out of the ten bullets fired hit Seyran Ayvazyan in the back and why, if all the police officers were allegedly aiming at the legs, at least one of them ended up shooting much higher – in the area of the chest (see, mutatis mutandis, Karandja v. Bulgaria, no. 69180/01, § 66, 6 October 2010). The interviews in question therefore appear to have been a pure formality and the Court does not regard them as constituting a serious and thorough attempt to establish the circumstances in which the fatal shooting took place."

Fourthly, no statements were taken from any of the persons not belonging to the police force who were apparently in the vicinity of the house during the arrest operation, such as the mayor of the village, the fire fighters and the ambulance doctors. It is true that the Court of Cassation stated that there had been no eyewitnesses to the shooting other than the police officers but it is not clear on what evidence this statement was based. It is undisputed that the incident took place outside on the porch and was visible even to those police officers who did not take part in the arrest operation and the fatal shooting (see paragraph 29 above). None of the persons mentioned above were, however, summoned for questioning for the purpose of clarifying whether and to what extent they had witnessed the incident. Nor did the investigator try to identify the villagers who, according to several police statements (see paragraph 29 above), had gathered at the scene, albeit at a distance, and might possibly have been able to shed some light on its circumstances."

As regards other investigative measures, the Court notes that the authorities failed to establish reliably – through a ballistics test or other means – the exact positions of the officers discharging their firearms at the time of the shootings. Thus, there was a clear contradiction between the statement of police officer H.Gri., who said that police officer A.S. had been next to him at the time of the shooting, and the sketch map of the incident, according to which H.Gri. had been on the porch and police officer S.M. had been next to him (see paragraphs 15 and 28 above). No attempt was made to determine the precise trajectories of the bullets and there was no reconstruction of the incident. Nor did the ballistics test clarify vital information such as who had fired the fatal shot. Furthermore, no confrontations were held between the police officers. Without such investigative measures being undertaken, it was impossible to check the arresting officers ’ accounts of the events. It is also notable that no assessment was made of whether the police officers ’ response to the alleged threat to police officer H.Gev. ’ s life was proportionate; this failure to make an assessment is especially striking given the number of shots fired (fifteen – of which ten hit the target) and the fact that Seyran Ayvazyan was not armed with a firearm but only a knife."

As a general rule, where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court ’ s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and it is for the latter to establish the facts on the basis of the evidence before them. Though the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and remains free to make its own appreciation in the light of all the material before it, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by the domestic courts (see Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, § 180, ECHR 2011 (extracts), and Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç, cited above, § 182 ).

Its sole concern must be to evaluate whether, given the circumstances, the planning and control of the operation at Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s house showed that the authorities had taken appropriate care to ensure that any risk to his life had been minimised and that they had not been negligent in their choice of action (see Andronicou and Constantinou, cited above, § 181, and Bubbins, cited above, § 141 )."

While shouting threats and making threatening gestures through the windows, he did not, however, make any attempts to flee or to launch an attack. This situation lasted for several hours. Thus, the police officers can be said to have had time at their disposal to plan the arrest operation, as opposed to having to deal with a random operation which may have given rise to unexpected developments to which the police may have been called upon to react without prior preparation (see Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, §§ 71-72, CEDH 2000 ‑ XII, and Celniku v. Greece, no. 21449/04, § 56, 5 July 2007 )."

It is not certain that the involvement of such a professional would have produced a different result, but since Seyran Ayvazyan ’ s violent behaviour appears to have been caused by his medical condition, the police officers should have at least tried that option."

While the Police Act required police officers to undergo “special training”, the Government did not provide any details of the training (if any) that the police officers in question had undergone and whether such training had included any techniques for handling situations similar to the one in question. Nor do the police officers appear to have been equipped with any specialised protective uniforms or gear. Thus, they had to make do with whatever they had at hand, thereby increasing significantly the risk of their having to resort to lethal weapons in the event of a possible attack.
