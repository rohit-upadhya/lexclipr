In their view, the manner in which domestic law regulated this matter bred a lack of clarity, led to errors and abuse and had imposed a disproportionate burden on them. It was unclear who was liable to pay the fees: the students, who had no income or property, or their parents. The fees did not pursue any legitimate aim and failed to strike a proper balance between the interests of the individual and the public interest. In Bulgaria, secondary education was a precondition for any sort of employment, and the lack of such education meant that those concerned would be unable to integrate properly or even ensure their livelihood. Under Article 28 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the State had the duty to assist children in their drive to become fully fledged members of society. By erecting insuperable obstacles to the completion of their secondary education, the State was preventing them from developing in that way. The requirement for the applicants to pay fees had been discriminatory because they had been in an identical situation to the rest of their schoolmates. Under the 1991 Constitution, all individuals residing in Bulgaria had the same rights and obligations regardless of their nationality and status. Lastly, it had to be borne in mind that the applicants had been children at the material time and thus entitled to special protection under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was part of domestic law."

The Government further stated that they fully concurred with the reasons given by the Supreme Administrative Court, and asserted that the requirement to pay reasonable amounts for schooling did not amount to discrimination.",

                "48. Article 14 complements the other substantive provisions of the Convention and its Protocols. It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded by those provisions. Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions, there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of the latter (see, among many other authorities, Rasmussen v. Denmark, 28 November 1984, § 29, Series A no. 87 ). The prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and Protocols require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Article of the Convention or its Protocols, which the State has voluntarily decided to provide (see Case “ relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium ” ( merits), 23 July 1968, pp. 33 - 34, § 9, Series A no. 6 (“the ‘ Belgian linguistic ’ case”); Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, §§ 39 and 40, ECHR 2005 ‑ X; E.B. v.

On this point, it should firstly be noted that there is little doubt that secondary education is covered by that provision (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 136, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI). Secondly, although that provision cannot be interpreted as imposing a duty on the Contracting States to set up or subsidise particular educational establishments, any State doing so will be under an obligation to afford effective access to them ( see the “ Belgian linguistic ” case, pp. 30 ‑ 31, §§ 3 and 4, and Leyla Şahin, § 137, both cited above ). Put differently, access to educational institutions existing at a given time is an inherent part of the right set out in the first sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (see Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v. Denmark, 7 December 1976, § 52, Series A no. 23; Mürsel Eren v. Turkey, no. 60856/00, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ II; İrfan Temel and Others v. Turkey, no. 36458/02, § 39, 3 March 2009; and Oršuš and Others, cited above, § 146 ). In the instant case, the applicants had enrolled in and attended secondary schools set up and run by the Bulgarian State (see paragraph 11 above). They were later required, by reason of their nationality and immigration status, to pay school fees in order to pursue their secondary education (see paragraphs 17 ‑ 20, 25 ‑ 28 and 30 above). It follows that their complaint falls within the scope of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1. This is sufficient to render Article 14 of the Convention applicable.",

This was due exclusively to their nationality and immigration status, because under the 1991 National Education Act only Bulgarian nationals and certain categories of aliens are entitled to primary and secondary education free of charge (see paragraph 32 above). The applicants were thus clearly treated less favourably than others in a relevantly similar situation, on account of a personal characteristic.",

The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background (see, among other authorities, Rasmussen, cited above, § 40 ). Thus, the States are usually allowed a wide margin of appreciation when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 52, ECHR 2006 ‑ VI; Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, § 36, 10 May 2007; Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 60 in fine, ECHR 2008; Andrejeva, cited above, § 83; Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 61, ECHR 2010; Clift v. the United Kingdom, no. 7205/07, § 73, 13 July 2010; and J.M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 37060/06, § 54, 28 September 2010 ). On the other hand, very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before the Court could regard a difference of treatment based exclusively on the ground of nationality as compatible with the Convention (see Gaygusuz v. Austria, 16 September 1996, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV; Koua Poirrez v. France, no. 40892/98, § 46, ECHR 2003 ‑ X; Luczak v.

            ],
            [
                "53. The Court would emphasise at the outset that its task in the present case is not to decide whether and to what extent it is permissible for the States to charge fees for secondary – or, indeed, any – education. It has in the past recognised that the right to education by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, and that this regulation may vary in time and place according to the needs and resources of the community (see the “ Belgian linguistic ” case, cited above, p. 32, § 5; Campbell and Cosans v. the United Kingdom, 25 February 1982, § 41, Series A no. 48; Çiftçi v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 71860/01, ECHR 2004 ‑ VI; Mürsel Eren, cited above, § 44; and Konrad v. Germany ( dec. ), no. 35504/03, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII ). The Court must solely determine whether, once a State has voluntarily decided to provide such education free of charge, it may deny that benefit to a distinct group of people, for the notion of discrimination includes cases where a person or group is treated, without proper justification, less favourably than another, even though the more favourable treatment is not called for by the Convention (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 82, Series A no. 94; Ünal Tekeli v. Turkey, no. 29865/96, § 51 in limine, ECHR 2004 ‑ X; Zarb Adami v. Malta, no. 17209/02, § 73, ECHR 2006 ‑ VIII; Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 161 in limine, ECHR 2008; and J.M. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 45 in fine )."

            [
                "54. Having thus clarified the limits of its inquiry, the Court starts by observing that a State may have legitimate reasons for curtailing the use of resource ‑ hungry public services – such as welfare programmes, public benefits and health care – by short ‑ term and illegal immigrants, who, as a rule, do not contribute to their funding. It may also, in certain circumstances, justifiably differentiate between different categories of aliens residing in its territory. For instance, the preferential treatment of nationals of member States of the European Union – some of whom were exempted from school fees when Bulgaria acceded to the Union (see paragraph 32 above) – may be said to be based on an objective and reasonable justification, because the Union forms a special legal order, which has, moreover, established its own citizenship (see, mutatis mutandis, Moustaquim v. Belgium, 18 February 1991, § 49 in fine, Series A no. 193, and C. v. Belgium, 7 August 1996, § 38, Reports 1996 ‑ III)."

                "55. Although similar arguments apply to a certain extent in the field of education – which is one of the most important public services in a modern State – they cannot be transposed there without qualification. It is true that education is an activity that is complex to organise and expensive to run, whereas the resources that the authorities can devote to it are necessarily finite. It is also true that in deciding how to regulate access to education, and in particular whether or not to charge fees for it and to whom, a State must strike a balance between, on the one hand, the educational needs of those under its jurisdiction and, on the other, its limited capacity to accommodate them. However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that, unlike some other public services (see Nitecki v. Poland ( dec. ), no. 65653/01, 21 March 2002, and Pentiacova and Others v. Moldova ( dec. ), no. 14462/03, ECHR 2005 ‑ I, regarding health care; Budina v. Russia ( dec. ), no. 45603/05, 18 June 2009; Carson and Others, cited above, § 6 4; Zeïbek, cited above, §§ 37 - 40; and Zubczewski v. Sweden ( dec. ), no. 16149/08, 12 January 2010, regarding pensions; and Niedzwiecki v. Germany, no. 58453/00, §§ 24 and 33, 25 October 2005; Okpisz v. Germany, no. 59140/00, §§ 18 and 34, 25 October 2005; Weller v. Hungary, no. 44399/05, § 36, 31 March 2009; Fawsie, cited above, §§ 27 - 28; and Saidoun, cited above, §§ 28 ‑ 29, regarding child benefits ), education is a right that enjoys direct protection under the Convention. It is expressly enshrined in Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (see the “ Belgian linguistic ” case, cited above, pp. 30 ‑ 31, § 3). It is also a very particular type of public service, which not only directly benefits those using it but also serves broader societal functions. Indeed, the Court has already had occasion to point out that “[ i ]n a democratic society, the right to education ... is indispensable to the furtherance of human rights [and] plays ... a fundamental role ” (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 137). Moreover, in order to achieve pluralism and thus democracy, society has an interest in the integration of minorities (see Konrad, cited above )."

            [
                "56. In the Court ’ s view, the State ’ s margin of appreciation in this domain increases with the level of education, in inverse proportion to the importance of that education for those concerned and for society at large. Thus, at the university level, which to this day remains optional for many people, higher fees for aliens – and indeed fees in general – seem to be commonplace and can, in the present circumstances, be considered fully justified. The opposite goes for primary schooling, which provides basic literacy and numeracy – as well as integration into and first experiences of society – and is compulsory in most countries (see Konrad, cited above )."
            ],
            [
                "57. Secondary education, which is in issue in the present case, falls between those two extremes. The distinction is confirmed by the difference of wording between sub- paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Article 28 § 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the first of which enjoins States to “[m] ake primary education compulsory and available free to all”, whereas the second and the third merely call upon them to “[e] ncourage the development of different forms of secondary education ... and take appropriate measures such as the introduction of free education and offering financial assistance in case of need” and to “[m] ake higher education accessible to all on the basis of capacity by every appropriate means” (see paragraph 33 above). It is also confirmed by the differentiation between those three levels of education in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (see paragraph 34 above). However, the Court is mindful of the fact that with more and more countries now moving towards what has been described as a “knowledge - based” society, secondary education plays an ever - increasing role in successful personal development and in the social and professional integration of the individuals concerned. Indeed, in a modern society, having no more than basic knowledge and skills constitutes a barrier to successful personal and professional development. It prevents the persons concerned from adjusting to their environment and entails far - reaching consequences for their social and economic well - being."

In assessing that proportionality the Court does not need, in the very specific circumstances of this case, to determine whether the Bulgarian State is entitled to deprive all unlawfully residing aliens of educational benefits – such as free education – which it has agreed to provide to its nationals and certain limited categories of aliens. It is not the Court ’ s role to consider in the abstract whether national law conforms to the Convention (see, among other authorities, McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, § 153, Series A no. 324; Pham Hoang v.

Russia, no. 11751/03, § 39, 8 October 2009). It must confine its attention, as far as possible, to the particular circumstances of the case before it (see, among other authorities, Wettstein v. Switzerland, no. 33958/96, § 41, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and Sommerfeld v. Germany [GC], no. 31871/96, § 86, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII).

On that point, the Court observes at the outset that the applicants were not in the position of individuals arriving in the country unlawfully and then laying claim to the use of its public services, including free schooling (see paragraph 10 above). Even when the applicants found themselves, somewhat inadvertently, in the situation of aliens lacking permanent residence permits (see paragraphs 11 and 13 - 16 above), the authorities had no substantive objection to their remaining in Bulgaria and apparently never had any serious intention of deporting them (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above and the final admissibility decision in the present case; compare also, mutatis mutandis, Anakomba Yula v. Belgium, no. 45413/07, § 38, 10 March 2009 ). Indeed, at the material time the applicants had taken steps to regularise their situation (see paragraphs 13 - 16 above).

Admittedly, the regulation of educational institutions may vary in time and in place, inter alia, according to the needs and resources of the community and the distinctive features of different levels of education. Consequently, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in this sphere, although the final decision as to the observance of the Convention ’ s requirements rests with the Court. In order to ensure that the restrictions that are imposed do not curtail the right in question to such an extent as to impair its very essence and deprive it of its effectiveness, the Court must satisfy itself that they are foreseeable for those concerned and pursue a legitimate aim. However, unlike the position with respect to Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention, it is not bound by an exhaustive list of “legitimate aims” under Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Podkolzina v. Latvia, no. 46726/99, § 36, ECHR 2002 ‑ II ).

There has been extensive discussion on the issue and it continues to be the subject of lively debate in Turkish society. Those in favour of the headscarf see wearing it as a duty and/or a form of expression linked to religious identity. However, the supporters of secularism, who draw a distinction between the başörtüsü ( traditional Anatolian headscarf, worn loosely ) and the türban ( tight, knotted headscarf hiding the hair and the throat ), see the Islamic headscarf as a symbol of a political Islam. As a result of the accession to power on 28 June 1996 of a coalition government comprising the Islamist Refah Partisi, and the centre-right Doğru Yol Partisi, the debate has taken on strong political overtones. The ambivalence displayed by the leaders of the Refah Partisi, including the then Prime Minister, over their attachment to democratic values, and their advocacy of a plurality of legal systems functioning according to different religious rules for each religious community was perceived in Turkish society as a genuine threat to republican values and civil peace (see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v.

It also found that it could not be reconciled with the principle of sexual equality implicit, inter alia, in republican and revolutionary values (see Preamble and Article 174 of the Constitution ).",
                "In their judgment, the Constitutional Court judges explained, firstly, that secularism had acquired constitutional status by reason of the historical experience of the country and the particularities of Islam compared to other religions; secularism was an essential condition for democracy and acted as a guarantor of freedom of religion and of equality before the law. It also prevented the State from showing a preference for a particular religion or belief; consequently, a secular State could not invoke religious conviction when performing its legislative function. They stated, inter alia :",
                "“ Secularism is the civil organiser of political, social and cultural life, based on national sovereignty, democracy, freedom and science. Secularism is the principle which offers the individual the possibility to affirm his or her own personality through freedom of thought and which, by the distinction it makes between politics and religious beliefs, renders freedom of conscience and religion effective. In societies based on religion, which function with religious thought and religious rules, political organisation is religious in character. In a secular regime, religion is shielded from a political role. It is not a tool of the authorities and remains in its respectable place, to be determined by the conscience of each and everyone ...”",
                "Stressing its inviolable nature, the Constitutional Court observed that freedom of religion, conscience and worship, which could not be equated with a right to wear any particular religious attire, guaranteed first and foremost the liberty to decide whether or not to follow a religion. It explained that, once outside the private sphere of individual conscience, freedom to manifest one ’ s religion could be restricted on public-order grounds to defend the principle of secularism.",
                "Everyone was free to choose how to dress, as the social and religious values and traditions of society also had to be respected. However, when a particular dress code was imposed on individuals by reference to a religion, the religion concerned was perceived and presented as a set of values that were incompatible with those of contemporary society. In addition, in Turkey, where the majority of the population were Muslims, presenting the wearing of the Islamic headscarf as a mandatory religious duty would result in discrimination between practising Muslims, non-practising Muslims and non-believers on grounds of dress with anyone who refused to wear the headscarf undoubtedly being regarded as opposed to religion or as non-religious.",
                "The Constitutional Court also said that students had to be permitted to work and pursue their education together in a calm, tolerant and mutually supportive atmosphere without being deflected from that goal by signs of religious affiliation. It found that, irrespective of whether the Islamic headscarf was a precept of Islam, granting legal recognition to a religious symbol of that type in institutions of higher education was not compatible with the principle that State education must be neutral, as it would be liable to generate conflicts between students with differing religious convictions or beliefs."

The freedom afforded by this provision [transitional section 17] is conditional on its not being contrary to ‘ the laws in force ’.

In the instant case, the Vice - Chancellor had not possessed the authority or power, either under the laws in force or the Students Disciplinary Procedure Rules, to refuse students “wearing the headscarf” access to university premises or examination rooms. In addition, the legislature had at no stage sought to issue a general ban on wearing religious signs in schools and universities and there had never been support for such a ban in Parliament, despite the fierce debate to which the Islamic headscarf had given rise. Moreover, the fact that the administrative authorities had not introduced any general regulations providing for the imposition of disciplinary penalties on students wearing the headscarf in institutions of higher education meant that no such ban existed."

It must also be borne in mind that, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, its application involves an inevitable element of judicial interpretation, since there will always be a need for clarification of doubtful points and for adaptation to particular circumstances. A margin of doubt in relation to borderline facts does not by itself make a legal provision unforeseeable in its application. Nor does the mere fact that such a provision is capable of more than one construction mean that it fails to meet the requirement of “ foreseeability ” for the purposes of the Convention. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain, taking into account the changes in everyday practice ( see Gorzelik and Others, cited above, § 65)."

Nor had she created an external restriction on any freedom with the support or authority of the State. Her choice had been based on religious conviction, which was the most important fundamental right that pluralistic, liberal democracy had granted her. It was, to her mind, indisputable that people were free to subject themselves to restrictions if they considered it appropriate.

In Dahlab, which concerned the teacher of a class of small children, the Court stressed among other matters the “powerful external symbol” which her wearing a headscarf represented and questioned whether it might have some kind of proselytising effect, seeing that it appeared to be imposed on women by a religious precept that was hard to reconcile with the principle of gender equality.

It finds that upholding that principle, which is undoubtedly one of the fundamental principles of the Turkish State which are in harmony with the rule of law and respect for human rights, may be considered necessary to protect the democratic system in Turkey. An attitude which fails to respect that principle will not necessarily be accepted as being covered by the freedom to manifest one ’ s religion and will not enjoy the protection of Article 9 of the Convention ( see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 93)."

                "“ ... The Court ... notes the emphasis placed in the Turkish constitutional system on the protection of the rights of women ... Gender equality – recognised by the European Court as one of the key principles underlying the Convention and a goal to be achieved by member States of the Council of Europe (see, among other authorities, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 37- 38, § 78; Schuler- Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, pp. 21 - 22, § 67; Burgharz v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 280-B, p. 29, § 27; Van Raalte v. the Netherlands, judgment of 21 February 1997, Reports 1997 - I, p. 186, § 39 in fine; and Petrovic v. Austria, judgment of 27 March 1998, Reports 1998-II, p. 587, § 37) – was also found by the Turkish Constitutional Court to be a principle implicit in the values underlying the Constitution ...",
                "... In addition, like the Constitutional Court ..., the Court considers that, when examining the question of the Islamic headscarf in the Turkish context, it must be borne in mind the impact which wearing such a symbol, which is presented or perceived as a compulsory religious duty, may have on those who choose not to wear it. As has already been noted (see Karaduman, decision cited above, and Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 95), the issues at stake include the protection of the ‘ rights and freedoms of others ’ and the ‘ maintenance of public order ’ in a country in which the majority of the population, while professing a strong attachment to the rights of women and a secular way of life, adhere to the Islamic faith. Imposing limitations on freedom in this sphere may, therefore, be regarded as meeting a pressing social need by seeking to achieve those two legitimate aims, especially since, as the Turkish courts stated ..., this religious symbol has taken on political significance in Turkey in recent years.",
                "... The Court does not lose sight of the fact that there are extremist political movements in Turkey which seek to impose on society as a whole their religious symbols and conception of a society founded on religious precepts ... It has previously said that each Contracting State may, in accordance with the Convention provisions, take a stance against such political movements, based on its historical experience ( see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 124). The regulations concerned have to be viewed in that context and constitute a measure intended to achieve the legitimate aims referred to above and thereby to preserve pluralism in the university. ”"

Having regard to the above background, it is the principle of secularism, as elucidated by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 3 9 above), which is the paramount consideration underlying the ban on the wearing of religious symbols in universities. In such a context, where the values of pluralism, respect for the rights of others and, in particular, equality before the law of men and women are being taught and applied in practice, it is understandable that the relevant authorities should wish to preserve the secular nature of the institution concerned and so consider it contrary to such values to allow religious attire, including, as in the present case, the Islamic headscarf, to be worn."

Like the Chamber (see paragraph 111 of its judgment), the Grand Chamber notes at the outset that it is common ground that practising Muslim students in Turkish universities are free, within the limits imposed by the constraints of educational organisation, to manifest their religion in accordance with habitual forms of Muslim observance. In addition, the resolution adopted by Istanbul University on 9 July 1998 shows that various other forms of religious attire are also forbidden on the university premises (see paragraph 4 7 above)."

It should also be noted that, when the issue of whether students should be allowed to wear the Islamic headscarf surfaced at Istanbul University in 1994 in relation to the medical courses, the Vice - Chancellor reminded them of the reasons for the rules on dress. Arguing that calls for permission to wear the Islamic headscarf in all parts of the university premises were misconceived and pointing to the public-order constraints applicable to medical courses, he asked the students to abide by the rules, which were consistent with both the legislation and the case-law of the higher courts ( see paragraphs 43-44 above )."

Furthermore, the process whereby the regulations that led to the decision of 9 July 1998 were implemented took several years and was accompanied by a wide debate within Turkish society and the teaching profession ( see paragraph 35 above ). The two highest courts, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court, have managed to establish settled case-law on this issue (see paragraphs 37, 39 and 41 above). It is quite clear that throughout that decision-making process the university authorities sought to adapt to the evolving situation in a way that would not bar access to the university to students wearing the veil, through continued dialogue with those concerned, while at the same time ensuring that order was maintained and in particular that the requirements imposed by the nature of the course in question were complied with."

In that connection, the Court does not accept the applicant ’ s submission that the fact that there were no disciplinary penalties for failing to comply with the dress code effectively meant that no rules existed (see paragraph 81 above). As to how compliance with the internal rules should have been secured, it is not for the Court to substitute its view for that of the university authorities. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the education community, the university authorities are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions or the requirements of a particular course ( see, mutatis mutandis, Valsamis v. Greece, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ VI, p. 2325, § 32). Besides, having found that the regulations pursued a legitimate aim, it is not open to the Court to apply the criterion of proportionality in a way that would make the notion of an institution ’ s “internal rules ” devoid of purpose. Article 9 does not always guarantee the right to behave in a manner governed by a religious belief ( see Pichon and Sajous v. France ( dec .), no. 49853/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ X) and does not confer on people who do so the right to disregard rules that have proved to be justified ( see Valsamis, cited above, opinion of the Commission, p. 2337, § 51)."

However, it is of crucial importance that the Convention is interpreted and applied in a manner which renders its rights practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory. Moreover, the Convention is a living instrument which must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions ( see Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 19, § 41; Airey v. Ireland, judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, pp. 14-15, § 26; and, as the most recent authority, Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 121, ECHR 2005-I ). While the first sentence of Article 2 essentially establishes access to primary and secondary education, there is no watertight division separating higher education from other forms of education. In a number of recently adopted instruments, the Council of Europe has stressed the key role and importance of higher education in the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the strengthening of democracy ( see, inter alia, Recommendation No. R (98) 3 and Recommendation 1353 (1998) – cited in paragraphs 68 and 69 above ). As the Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region (see paragraph 67 above) states, higher education “is instrumental in the pursuit and advancement of knowledge” and “constitutes an exceptionally rich cultural and scientific asset for both individuals and society”."

Latvia, no. 46726/99, § 36, ECHR 2002 ‑ II ).

However, an analysis of the case by reference to the right to education cannot in this instance be divorced from the conclusion reached by the Court with respect to Article 9 (see paragraph 122 above), as the considerations taken into account under that provision are clearly applicable to the complaint under Article 2 of Protocol No. 1, which complaint consists of criticism of the regulation concerned that takes much the same form as that made with respect to Article 9."

In so finding, it relied in particular on the following factors which are clearly relevant here. Firstly, the measures in question manifestly did not hinder the students in performing the duties imposed by the habitual forms of religious observance. Secondly, the decision-making process for applying the internal regulations satisfied, so far as was possible, the requirement to weigh up the various interests at stake. The university authorities judiciously sought a means whereby they could avoid having to turn away students wearing the headscarf and at the same time honour their obligation to protect the rights of others and the interests of the education system. Lastly, the process also appears to have been accompanied by safeguards – the rule requiring conformity with statute and judicial review – that were apt to protect the students ’ interests (see paragraph 95 above)."

This mainly involves questions of expediency on which it is not for the Court to rule and whose solution may legitimately vary according to the country and the era. In particular, the second sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2) does not prevent States from imparting through teaching or education information or knowledge of a directly or indirectly religious or philosophical kind. It does not even permit parents to object to the integration of such teaching or education in the school curriculum, for otherwise all institutionalised teaching would run the risk of proving impracticable. In fact, it seems very difficult for many subjects taught at school not to have, to a greater or lesser extent, some philosophical complexion or implications. The same is true of religious affinities if one remembers the existence of religions forming a very broad dogmatic and moral entity which has or may have answers to every question of a philosophical, cosmological or moral nature.",

The State is forbidden to pursue an aim of indoctrination that might be considered as not respecting parents ’ religious and philosophical convictions. That is the limit that must not be exceeded.",

Legal abortions, for their part, numbered about 4,000 every year and, according to expert opinions, illegal abortions about 15,000 whereas the annual birth rate was hardly more than 70,000."

This method appeared to the committee particularly suited to prevent the subject from becoming delicate or speculative. The report emphasised that instruction in the matter should take the form of discussions and informal talks between teachers and pupils.

Discussions there will provide the opportunity for emphasising the objective of sexual instruction at the school and for making it clear to parents that it is not the school ’ s intention to take anything away from them but rather ... to establish co-operation for the benefit of all parties. It can also be pointed out to parents that the integrated education allows the topic to be taken up exactly where it arises naturally in the other fields of instruction and that, generally, this is only practicable if sex education is compulsory for pupils. ... Besides, through his contacts with the homes the class teacher will be able to learn enough about the parents ’ attitude towards the school, towards their own child and towards its special problems. During discussions about the sex education given by the school, sceptical parents will often be led to realise the justification for co-operation between school and home in this field as well. Some children may have special requirements or need special consideration and it will often be the parents of these children who are difficult to contact. The teacher should be aware of this fact. When gradually the teacher, homes and children have come to know each other, a relationship of trust may arise which will make it possible to begin sex education in a way that is satisfactory to all parties.\""

Paragraph 1 of Rule 47 of the Rules of Court does not apply in the circumstances since its covers solely discontinuance by a \"Party which has brought the case before the Court\", that is to say by an Applicant Contracting State in proceedings before the Court (paragraph (h) of Rule 1). Admittedly paragraph 2 provides that the Court may, subject to paragraph 3, strike out of its list a case brought before it by the Commission, but the former paragraph makes such a decision dependent upon the existence of \"a friendly settlement, arrangement or other fact of a kind to provide a solution of the matter\". However, as the principal delegate of the Commission emphasised at the hearing on the morning of 1 June 1976, this condition has not been fulfilled in the Kjeldsens ’ case. Furthermore, striking the case out of the Court ’ s list - which, moreover, has not been requested by the Government - would be devoid of any practical interest in the circumstances: being limited to application No. 5095/71, it would still leave pending the applications of Mr. and Mrs. Busk Madsen and Mr. and Mrs. Pedersen (nos. 5920/72 and 5926/72 respectively), which raise the same basic problem.",

                "In 1972 and 1973 the Commission accepted the applications insofar as they contested the compatibility of the Act of 27 May 1970, making sex education compulsory in State schools, with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2). The Commission held the applications inadmissible, for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, insofar as they related to \"the directives issued and other administrative measures taken by the Danish authorities\" regarding the manner in which such education should be carried out. At paragraph 141 of its report of 21 March 1975, prior to formulating its opinion on the merits of the case, the Commission indicated that its task was to concern itself with \"the Danish legislation which provides for integrated sex education\" and not with \"the manner in which the instruction is given in different schools\". At paragraph 142, the Commission specified that by legislation it meant Act No. 235 of 27 May 1970, Executive Order No. 274 of 8 June 1971 and Executive Order No. 313 of 15 June 1972. The summary of facts appearing in the report mentioned additionally the \"Guide\" of April 1971 and the Ministerial Circular of 8 June 1971 on sex education in State schools. Similarly, the request instituting proceedings of 24 July 1975 spoke of the \"Danish legislation\" and not of the Act of 27 May 1970 alone. In their memorial of 11 May 1976 and during the hearings of 1 and 2 June 1976, the delegates of the Commission quoted long extracts from the \"Guide\" of April 1971 and from the Executive Orders of 8 June 1971 and 15 June 1972, although their final submissions referred solely to the Act of 27 May 1970. The delegates expressed the opinion that, while the Court has not to take cognisance of \"the specific measures by which sex education was carried out in the respective schools\", that is the steps taken \"by the municipal authorities and by the parents ’ associations\", it \"may ... look into the different measures of a general nature taken by the ... Government\"; they were of the view that the Court ’ s supervision extends to the Executive Orders of 8 June 1971 and 15 June 1972 \"at least insofar as they serve for the interpretation of the Act\" of 27 May 1970. According to the delegates, the Commission and the Government seem to be in agreement on \"this interpretation ... of the decisions on admissibility\", the drafting of which left room for \"certain ambiguities\".",
                "In their memorial of 8 March 1976, the Government inferred from paragraph 141 of the Commission ’ s report \"that an examination of the case must proceed on the basis that the Act\" of 27 May 1970 \"is being implemented in pursuance of the precepts laid down in the Executive Order of 15 June 1972 \". Among \"the material on which the Court must act\", the Government included the Executive Orders and Circulars of 8 June 1971 and 15 June 1972; as a result, the Registrar, acting on instructions from the President of the Chamber, obtained the text of these instruments from the Commission (Order of 20 March 1976). \"To stave off any impact by wrongful ideas about ‘ the manner in which sex education is carried out ’ \", the Government in addition supplied the registry with an English translation of the \"Guide\" of April 1971; their Agent read out a passage from the preface to the \"Guide\" during his oral arguments on 1 June 1976.",
                "Under these conditions, the Court considers that it is called upon to ascertain whether or not the Act of 27 May 1970 and the delegated legislation of general application issued there under contravenes the Convention and Protocol No. 1 (P1), but that the particular measures of implementation decided upon at the level of each municipality or educational institution fall outside the scope of its supervision. Section 1 para. 25 of the Act of 27 May 1970 did no more than supplement the list of compulsory \"integrated\" subjects by adding, among others, sex education. The Minister of Education was entrusted with fixing the manner of implementing the principle thus enacted (paragraph 22 above). The Executive Orders and Circulars of 8 June 1971 and 15 June 1972, issued in pursuance of this enabling clause, therefore form a whole with the Act itself and only by referring to them can the Court make an appraisal of the Act; if it were otherwise, the reference of the present case to the Court would, moreover, hardly have served any useful purpose. It should nevertheless be pointed out, as is done by the Commission (paragraph 145 in fine of the report), that the instant case does not extend to the provisions on the special, optional lessons on sex education (sections 1 para. 2 in fine, 2 para. 1 in fine, 3 para. 2 and 4 para. 2 in fine of the Executive Order of 8 June 1971, and subsequently sections 1 para. 3 in fine, 2 in fine, 3 para. 2 and 4 of the Executive Order of 15 June 1972); it covers solely those provisions concerned with the sex education integrated in the teaching of compulsory subjects.",
                "The \"Guide\" of April 1971, on the other hand, is not a legislative or regulatory text, but a working document intended to assist and advise the local school authorities; while the Executive Order (section 2) and the Circular of 8 June 1971 mentioned it, the same is not true of those of 15 June 1972 (paragraphs 24-25 and 31-32 above). It nevertheless remains in use throughout the whole country and was frequently cited by those appearing before the Court. Consequently, the Court will have regard to the \"Guide\" insofar as it contributes to an elucidation of the spirit of the legislation in dispute.",

In their main submission before the Commission, the Government maintained that the second sentence of Article 2 (P1-2) does not apply to State schools (paragraphs 104-107 of the report and the memorial of 29 November 1973 ), but their arguments have since evolved slightly. In their memorial of 8 March 1976 and at the hearings on 1 and 2 June 1976, they conceded that the existence of private schools perhaps does not necessarily imply in all cases that there is no breach of the said sentence. The Government nevertheless emphasised that Denmark does not force parents to entrust their children to the State schools; it allows parents to educate their children, or to have them educated, at home and, above all, to send them to private institutions to which the State pays very substantial subsidies, thereby assuming a \"function in relation to education and to teaching\", within the meaning of Article 2 (P1-2). Denmark, it was submitted, thereby discharged the obligations resulting from the second sentence of this provision.",
                "The Court notes that in Denmark private schools co-exist with a system of public education. The second sentence of Article 2 (P1-2) is binding upon the Contracting States in the exercise of each and every function - it speaks of \"any functions\" - that they undertake in the sphere of education and teaching, including that consisting of the organisation and financing of public education.",
                "Furthermore, the second sentence of Article 2 (P1-2) must be read together with the first which enshrines the right of everyone to education. It is on to this fundamental right that is grafted the right of parents to respect for their religious and philosophical convictions, and the first sentence does not distinguish, any more than the second, between State and private teaching.",
                "The\" travaux préparatoires \", which are without doubt of particular consequence in the case of a clause that gave rise to such lengthy and impassioned discussions, confirm the interpretation appearing from a first reading of Article 2 (P1-2). Whilst they indisputably demonstrate, as the Government recalled, the importance attached by many members of the Consultative Assembly and a number of governments to freedom of teaching, that is to say, freedom to establish private schools, the\" travaux préparatoires\" do not for all that reveal the intention to go no further than a guarantee of that freedom. Unlike some earlier versions, the text finally adopted does not expressly enounce that freedom; and numerous interventions and proposals, cited by the delegates of the Commission, show that sight was not lost of the need to ensure, in State teaching, respect for parents ’ religious and philosophical convictions.",
                "The second sentence of Article 2 (P1-2) aims in short at safeguarding the possibility of pluralism in education which possibility is essential for the preservation of the \"democratic society\" as conceived by the Convention. In view of the power of the modern State, it is above all through State teaching that this aim must be realised.",
                "The Court thus concludes, as the Commission did unanimously, that the Danish State schools do not fall outside the province of Protocol No. 1 (P1). In its investigation as to whether Article 2 (P1-2) has been violated, the Court cannot forget, however, that the functions assumed by Denmark in relation to education and to teaching include the grant of substantial assistance to private schools. Although recourse to these schools involves parents in sacrifices which were justifiably mentioned by the applicants, the alternative solution it provides constitutes a factor that should not be disregarded in this case. The delegate speaking on behalf of the majority of the Commission recognised that it had not taken sufficient heed of this factor in paragraphs 152 and 153 of the report."

                "The Court does not share this view. Article 2 (P1-2), which applies to each of the State ’ s functions in relation to education and to teaching, does not permit a distinction to be drawn between religious instruction and other subjects. It enjoins the State to respect parents ’ convictions, be they religious or philosophical, throughout the entire State education programme."

Their right thus corresponds to a responsibility closely linked to the enjoyment and the exercise of the right to education.",

This mainly involves questions of expediency on which it is not for the Court to rule and whose solution may legitimately vary according to the country and the era. In particular, the second sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2) does not prevent States from imparting through teaching or education information or knowledge of a directly or indirectly religious or philosophical kind. It does not even permit parents to object to the integration of such teaching or education in the school curriculum, for otherwise all institutionalised teaching would run the risk of proving impracticable. In fact, it seems very difficult for many subjects taught at school not to have, to a greater or lesser extent, some philosophical complexion or implications. The same is true of religious affinities if one remembers the existence of religions forming a very broad dogmatic and moral entity which has or may have answers to every question of a philosophical, cosmological or moral nature.",

The State is forbidden to pursue an aim of indoctrination that might be considered as not respecting parents ’ religious and philosophical convictions. That is the limit that must not be exceeded.",

                "The Danish legislator, who did not neglect to obtain beforehand the advice of qualified experts, clearly took as his starting point the known fact that in Denmark children nowadays discover without difficulty and from several quarters the information that interests them on sexual life. The instruction on the subject given in State schools is aimed less at instilling knowledge they do not have or cannot acquire by other means than at giving them such knowledge more correctly, precisely, objectively and scientifically. The instruction, as provided for and organised by the contested legislation, is principally intended to give pupils better information; this emerges from, inter alia, the preface to the \"Guide\" of April 1971.",
                "Even when circumscribed in this way, such instruction clearly cannot exclude on the part of teachers certain assessments capable of encroaching on the religious or philosophical sphere; for what are involved are matters where appraisals of fact easily lead on to value-judgments. The minority of the Commission rightly emphasised this. The Executive Orders and Circulars of 8 June 1971 and 15 June 1972, the \"Guide\" of April 1971 and the other material before the Court (paragraphs 20-32 above) plainly show that the Danish State, by providing children in good time with explanations it considers useful, is attempting to warn them against phenomena it views as disturbing, for example, the excessive frequency of births out of wedlock, induced abortions and venereal diseases. The public authorities wish to enable pupils, when the time comes, \"to take care of themselves and show consideration for others in that respect\", \"not ... [to] land themselves or others in difficulties solely on account of lack of knowledge\" (section 1 of the Executive Order of 15 June 1972).",
                "These considerations are indeed of a moral order, but they are very general in character and do not entail overstepping the bounds of what a democratic State may regard as the public interest. Examination of the legislation in dispute establishes in fact that it in no way amounts to an attempt at indoctrination aimed at advocating a specific kind of sexual behaviour. It does not make a point of exalting sex or inciting pupils to indulge precociously in practices that are dangerous for their stability, health or future or that many parents consider reprehensible. Further, it does not affect the right of parents to enlighten and advise their children, to exercise with regard to their children natural parental functions as educators, or to guide their children on a path in line with the parents ’ own religious or philosophical convictions.",
                "Certainly, abuses can occur as to the manner in which the provisions in force are applied by a given school or teacher and the competent authorities have a duty to take the utmost care to see to it that parents ’ religious and philosophical convictions are not disregarded at this level by carelessness, lack of judgment or misplaced proselytism. However, it follows from the Commission ’ s decisions on the admissibility of the applications that the Court is not at present seised of a problem of this kind (paragraph 48 above).",
