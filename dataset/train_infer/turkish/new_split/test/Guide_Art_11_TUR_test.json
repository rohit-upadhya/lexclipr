Relying on Articles 7, 9 and 11 of the Convention, the applicants alleged that their conviction had been based on their participation in a religious ceremony, which had consisted of a mere public manifestation of their religious observance.

Having regard, however, to the wording and content of the applicants ’ complaints, it takes the view that the principal question raised by the present case lies in their conviction for participating in a religious ceremony. In those circumstances the Court considers that the complaints should be examined solely under Article 9 of the Convention. That provision reads as follows:",
                "“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.",
                "2. Freedom to manifest one ’ s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”",

                "28. The Government contended that Article 9 of the Convention was not applicable in the present case. In their view, the fact that the premises of a political party had been chosen for a ceremony held following the death of members of a terrorist organisation and the decision to display symbols of that organisation clearly showed that the participants were pursuing a political and not a religious aim.",
                "29. The applicants reiterated their allegations.",
                "30. The Court finds that the question of the applicability of Article 9 of the Convention concerns more specifically the existence of an interference with the applicants ’ right to freedom of religion. It will therefore examine this objection together with the merits of the case.",
                "31. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.",
                "32. The Government stated that the applicants had been convicted on account of their propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation and not for a manifestation of their beliefs. They claimed that the interference complained of by the applicants had been reasonable as, in their submission, its aim had been to prevent disorder or crime.",
                "33. The applicants contested the Government ’ s position and reiterated their allegations.",
                "34. The Court reiterates that, as enshrined in Article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a “democratic society” within the meaning of the Convention. Such freedom is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion ( see, among other authorities, Buscarini and Others v. San Marino [GC], no. 24645/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 ‑ I).",
                "35. The Court further reiterates that, while religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it implies freedom to manifest one ’ s religion not only alone and in private but also in community with others, in public and within the circle of those whose faith one shares. In other words, whether alone or in community with others, in public or in private, everyone is free to manifest his or her beliefs. Article 9 lists a number of forms which manifestation of one ’ s religion or belief may take, namely worship, teaching, practice and observance ( see, mutatis mutandis, Cha ’ are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France [GC], no. 27417/95, § 73, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII).",
                "36. Article 9 does not, however, protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief and does not always guarantee the right to behave in the public sphere in a manner which is dictated by one ’ s religion or beliefs ( see, among other authorities, S.A.S. v. France [GC], no. 43835/11, § 125, 1 July 2014 ).",
                "37. The Court must therefore ascertain whether there has been an interference with the applicants ’ right under Article 9 and, if so, whether that interference was “prescribed by law”, pursued a legitimate aim and was “necessary in a democratic society” within the meaning of Article 9 § 2 of the Convention.",
                "( a) Whether there has been an interference",
                "38. The Court notes that the applicants were convicted for propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation on account of their participation in a religious ceremony ( mevlût ) organised on the premises of a political party in memory of three individuals, members of an illegal organisation, who had been killed by the security forces.",
                "39. The Government rejected the justification for the ceremony as claimed by the applicants ( see paragraphs 28 and 32 above ). In their view, the fact that it had been held following the death of members of a terrorist organisation on the premises of a political party, where symbols of that organisation were also on display, showed that the participants, among whom were the applicants, had been pursuing not only a religious aim but also an aim of political propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation.",
                "40. The Court would observe, firstly, that it is not in dispute between the parties that mevlût is a religious ceremony commonly celebrated by Muslims in Turkey.",
                "41. It further notes that, according to General Comment no. 22 of the United Nations Human Rights Committee ..., the freedom to manifest religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching encompasses a broad range of acts. The concept of worship extends to ritual and ceremonial acts giving direct expression to belief, including ceremonies following deaths. The question whether or not the deceased had been members of an illegal organisation is of little significance for the Court.",
                "42. The mere fact that the ceremony in question was organised on the premises of a political party in which symbols of a terrorist organisation were displayed did not deprive the participants of the protection guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention.",
                "43. In the Court ’ s view, the sentencing of the applicants to a term of imprisonment, pursuant to section 7 ( 2 ) of Law no. 3713, can be regarded as an interference with their freedom to manifest their religion.",
                "44. Such interference is incompatible with Article 9, unless it is “prescribed by law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article and is “necessary in a democratic society” in order to achieve the aim or aims concerned. The Court will therefore first examine whether the interference was “prescribed by law”.",
                "45. The Court notes that, according to the Government, the interference at issue in the present case was based on section 7 ( 2 ) of Law no. 3713.",
                "46. It further notes that, in the applicants ’ view, section 7 ( 2 ) of Law no. 3713, as it had allegedly been applied against them, was not sufficiently foreseeable as a criminal- law provision and did not therefore have the quality of “law”.",
                "47. The expression “prescribed by law” requires, firstly, that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law. Secondly, it refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned, who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him, and compatible with the rule of law. The phrase thus implies, inter alia, that domestic law must be sufficiently foreseeable in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which the authorities are entitled to resort to measures affecting their rights under the Convention ( see Fernández Martínez v. Spain [GC], no. 56030/07, § 117, ECHR 2014).",
                "48. For domestic law to meet these requirements it must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion to be granted in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any such discretion and the manner of its exercise (see, among many other authorities, Sanoma Uitgevers B.V. v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 38224/03, § 82, ECHR 2010).",
                "49. In the present case the Court observes that it is not in dispute that the legal basis of the applicants ’ conviction was section 7 ( 2 ) of Law no. 3713. Under that provision, “[a] nyone who engages in propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of between one and five years”.",
                "50. The Court reiterates that the requirement of “foreseeability” is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation thereof, what acts and omissions will engage his responsibility ( see, mutatis mutandis, S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 35, Series A no. 335 ‑ B).",
                "51. Turning back to the present case, the Court notes that the applicants were found guilty of propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation. In so finding the domestic courts relied on the fact that the persons in whose memory the ceremony in question had been held were members of a terrorist organisation and had been killed during an operation against that organisation. They additionally included in their reasons for the conviction the fact that the premises of a political party, in which symbols of that organisation were displayed, had been chosen as the venue for the ceremony.",
                "52. In this connection the Court reiterates its finding in a previous case that the term propaganda is often understood as the deliberate dissemination of information in one direction to influence the public perception of events, persons or issues. The single-direction nature of the information is not per se a reason to limit freedoms. A limitation may be prescribed, inter alia, to prevent the terrorist indoctrination of individuals and/or groups who are easily influenced, the aim of the indoctrination being to make them act and think in a particular manner. The Court thus accepts that certain forms of identification with a terrorist organisation, and especially apologia for such an organisation, may be regarded as a manifestation of support for terrorism and an incitement to violence and hatred. Similarly, the Court accepts that to disseminate messages praising the perpetrator of an attack, to denigrate the victims of an attack, to raise money for terrorist organisations, or to engage in other similar conduct, may constitute acts of incitement to terrorist violence ( see Yavuz and Yaylalı v. Turkey, no. 12606/11, § 51, 17 December 2013).",
                "53. Moreover, the Court would emphasise the importance of the Guidelines for legislative reviews of laws affecting religion or belief, adopted by the Venice Commission, which state that laws against terrorism should not be used as a pretext to limit legitimate religious activity ...",
                "54. The Court would add that for an act to be characterised as a criminal offence, the perpetrator of the offence in question must carry out an act that is capable of external manifestation.",
                "55. In the present case it notes that neither the reasoning of the national courts nor the Government ’ s observations showed that the applicants had played a role in choosing the venue for the religious service or had been responsible for the presence of the symbols of an illegal organisation on the premises where the ceremony was held. Moreover, the criminal act of which the applicants were convicted was merely their participation in the service, which had been organised following the death of members of an illegal organisation. Having regard to the wording of section 7(2) of the above-mentioned Law and to its interpretation by the Ankara Assize Court and the Court of Cassation when convicting the applicants of the offence of propaganda, the Court takes the view that the interference with the applicants ’ freedom of religion was not “prescribed by law” in the sense that it did not meet the requirements of clarity and foreseeability, since it had not been possible to foresee that mere participation in a religious service would fall within the scope of section 7(2) of the Law on the prevention of terrorism.",
                "56. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court finds that it does not need to pursue the examination of the applicants ’ complaints in order to ascertain whether the interference pursued a “legitimate aim” and was “necessary in a democratic society”. Such an examination is necessary only where the aim of the interference is clearly defined by domestic law.",
                "57. Accordingly, it is appropriate to dismiss the Government ’ s objection as to the applicability of Article 9 of the Convention and to find that there has been violation of that Article."

                "97. However, the applicants ’ conviction was not based on any involvement in or incitement to violence, but on the breach of public order resulting from the roadblocks. The Court further observes that, in the present case, the disruption of traffic cannot be described as a side-effect of a meeting held in a public place, but rather as the result of intentional action by the farmers, who wished to attract attention to the problems in the agricultural sector and to push the government to accept their demands (see also the arguments developed by the Court in paragraphs 169 - 75 below). In the Court ’ s view, although not an uncommon occurrence in the context of the exercise of freedom of assembly in modern societies, physical conduct purposely obstructing traffic and the ordinary course of life in order to seriously disrupt the activities carried out by others is not at the core of that freedom as protected by Article 11 of the Convention (see, for instance, Barraco, cited above, § 39, where the applicant ’ s conviction for his participation in a traffic-slowing operation, consisting in a rolling barricade of vehicles across several lanes of the motorway to slow down the traffic behind, was held to be an interference with his Article 11 rights; see also Lucas v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 39013/02, 18 March 2003, concerning a demonstration during which a public road was blocked in order to protest against the retention of a nuclear submarine, which was considered to fall within the terms of Article 11; Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 92, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, where the Court considered that the physical impediment of activities – a hunt and the construction of a motorway – of which the first and second applicants, respectively, disapproved, constituted expressions of opinion within the meaning of Article 10; and Drieman and Others v. Norway ( dec. ), no. 33678/96, 4 May 2000, where the Court proceeded on the assumption that Articles 10 and 11 could be relied on by Greenpeace activists who had manoeuvred dinghies in such a manner as to obstruct whaling). This state of affairs might have implications for any assessment of “necessity” to be carried out under the second paragraph of Article 11."

The Regional Court observed that the offence of rioting endangered public order, public safety and public health, human dignity and the inviolability of property. The objective aspect of the offence was the organising of a gathering of people for a common goal – namely, to breach public order – and the implementation of their decision which, in the instant case, had been to organise the roadblocks. To constitute an offence, the actions also had to be committed deliberately, that is to say, the persons charged had to understand the unlawfulness of their behaviour. In relation to B.M. and A.K., the Regional Court observed that during the demonstrations the two applicants had told others that it had been decided to block the roads. It had been established that B.M. and A.K. had understood that the roadblocks would be illegal and that they had been warned about their liability as organisers. Even so, they had continued to coordinate the farmers ’ actions and had insisted that the farmers maintain the roadblocks. As a direct result of the actions of B.M. and A.K., on 21 May 2003 a crowd had gone onto the highways and had blocked them, thereby stopping the traffic and breaching the constitutional rights and liberties of others to move freely and without restriction, causing damage to goods carriers and thus seriously breaching public order."

The fact that after the highway had been blocked the police and the drivers had negotiated with the farmers, with the result that some of the drivers had been let through, did not diminish the danger caused by the offence or its unlawfulness.

In providing an explanation as to the substance of the offence of rioting, as defined in Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 62 below), the Supreme Court referred to its classification as an offence against public order, which was the objective aspect of the crime ( nusikaltimo objektas ). In describing the scope of the offence, the aforementioned provision stipulated the following features: the organisation of a gathering with the aim of causing public violence, damaging property or otherwise breaching public order, or the commission of those actions during a gathering. For the Supreme Court, a riot was to be characterised as a situation where a gathering of people deliberately and seriously breached public order, caused public violence, or damaged property. The subjective aspect of the crime was that of direct intent ( kaltė pasireiškia tiesiogine tyčia ).

France ( C ‑ 265/95, judgment of 9 December 1997 – “the Commission case” ), concerning serious incidents which occurred in the south of France. Agricultural products from Spain and Italy had been destroyed by French farmers and acts of violence and vandalism had been committed in the relevant wholesale and retail sectors. The ECJ emphasised that, in accordance with the EC Treaty, the European internal market was characterised by the abolition, between member States, of obstacles to the free movement of goods. Article 30 of the Treaty prohibited, between member States, quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect. Therefore, all barriers, whether direct or indirect, actual or potential, to flows of imports in intra-Community trade had to be eliminated. Article 30, read in conjunction with Article 5 of the Treaty, also applied where a member State abstained from adopting the measures required in order to deal with obstacles to the free movement of goods which were not caused by the State."

                "72. The ECJ accepted that States enjoyed a margin of discretion in determining what measures were more appropriate in this field. It was, however, clear that the acts of violence committed in France against agricultural products originating in other member States created obstacles to intra-Community trade in those products. The incidents in issue had taken place regularly for more than ten years; in certain cases the French authorities had been warned of the imminence of demonstrations by farmers, the disruption had continued for several hours and the acts of vandalism, committed by persons whose faces were often not covered, had been filmed by television cameras. In spite of this, only a very small number of perpetrators had been identified and prosecuted. This was sufficient for the ECJ to come to the conclusion that the measures adopted by the French government were manifestly inadequate to ensure freedom of intra-Community trade in agricultural products on its territory and that France had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 30, taken in conjunction with Article 5 of the EC Treaty. This had created a climate of insecurity which had had a deterrent effect on trade flow as a whole and the difficult situation of French farmers could not justify a failure to apply Community Law correctly, as it had not been shown that implementation of that law would have posed a danger to public order with which the State could not cope. It was true that the threat of serious disruption to public order might, in appropriate cases, justify non-intervention by the police; however, this argument could have been put forward only with respect to a specific incident, and not in a general way covering all the incidents in issue.",

The case originated in the permission implicitly granted by the Austrian authorities to an environmental group to organise a demonstration on the Brenner motorway, the effect of which was to completely close that motorway to traffic for almost thirty hours. In conjunction with a pre-existing, national, generally applicable ban on holiday driving, this caused the Brenner motorway (an essential intra-Community transit route) to be closed to the majority of heavy goods traffic for four consecutive days, with a short interruption of a few hours."

After referring to the principles laid down in the Commission case (see paragraphs 71 - 72 above) regarding the positive obligations of the member States in this area, the ECJ held that the fact of not banning the demonstration complained of amounted to a restriction of the free movement of goods. It went on to consider whether the failure to impose a ban could be objectively justified. It observed that the specific aims of the demonstration were in themselves immaterial to establish the liability of the member State under the EC Treaty, only the objective pursued by the national authorities, namely respect for the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and assembly, being relevant. Both the free movement of goods, one of the fundamental principles of the EC Treaty, and the rights guaranteed by Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention could be subject to certain restrictions for overriding requirements relating to the public interest.

Under these circumstances, Austria was entitled to consider that an outright ban on the demonstration would have constituted unacceptable interference with freedom of peaceful assembly, and stricter conditions concerning the site and/or the duration of the demonstration could have been perceived as excessive restrictions. In this respect, the ECJ stated as follows.",
                "“90. ...

In that regard, the Republic of Austria submits, without being contradicted on that point, that in any event, all the alternative solutions which could be countenanced would have risked reactions which would have been difficult to control and would have been liable to cause much more serious disruption to intra-Community trade and public order, such as unauthorised demonstrations, confrontation between supporters and opponents of the group organising the demonstration or acts of violence on the part of the demonstrators who considered that the exercise of their fundamental rights had been infringed.”"

It reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, is one of the foundations of such a society. Thus, it should not be interpreted restrictively (see Taranenko v. Russia, no. 19554/05, § 65, 15 May 2014). As such this right covers both private meetings and meetings in public places, whether static or in the form of a procession; in addition, it can be exercised by individual participants and by the persons organising the gathering (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, § 56, ECHR 2003-III; Ziliberberg v. Moldova ( dec. ), no. 61821/00, 4 May 2004; and Barraco v. France, no. 31684/05, § 41, 5 March 2009)."

Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, § 77, ECHR 2001-IX). The guarantees of Article 11 therefore apply to all gatherings except those where the organisers and participants have such intentions, incite violence or otherwise reject the foundations of a democratic society ( see Sergey Kuznetsov v. Russia, no. 10877/04, § 45, 23 October 2008; Alekseyev v. Russia, nos. 4916/07 and 2 others, § 80, 21 October 2010; Fáber, cited above, § 37; Gün and Others v.

This is not contested by the applicants. However, the vehicles in issue had not been used to cause bodily harm to the police officers or any members of the public. Even though the farmers and lorry drivers had a few arguments, more serious confrontations had been avoided (see paragraph 28 above).

The possibility of persons with violent intentions, not members of the organising association, joining the demonstration cannot as such take away that right ( see Primov and Others, cited above, § 155 ). Even if there is a real risk that a public demonstration might result in disorder as a result of developments outside the control of those organising it, such a demonstration does not as such fall outside the scope of paragraph 1 of Article 11, and any restriction placed thereon must be in conformity with the terms of paragraph 2 of that provision (see Schwabe and M.G., cited above, § 103, and Taranenko, cited above, § 66 )."

The Court further observes that, in the present case, the disruption of traffic cannot be described as a side-effect of a meeting held in a public place, but rather as the result of intentional action by the farmers, who wished to attract attention to the problems in the agricultural sector and to push the government to accept their demands (see also the arguments developed by the Court in paragraphs 169 - 75 below). In the Court ’ s view, although not an uncommon occurrence in the context of the exercise of freedom of assembly in modern societies, physical conduct purposely obstructing traffic and the ordinary course of life in order to seriously disrupt the activities carried out by others is not at the core of that freedom as protected by Article 11 of the Convention (see, for instance, Barraco, cited above, § 39, where the applicant ’ s conviction for his participation in a traffic-slowing operation, consisting in a rolling barricade of vehicles across several lanes of the motorway to slow down the traffic behind, was held to be an interference with his Article 11 rights; see also Lucas v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 39013/02, 18 March 2003, concerning a demonstration during which a public road was blocked in order to protest against the retention of a nuclear submarine, which was considered to fall within the terms of Article 11; Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 92, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, where the Court considered that the physical impediment of activities – a hunt and the construction of a motorway – of which the first and second applicants, respectively, disapproved, constituted expressions of opinion within the meaning of Article 10; and Drieman and Others v. Norway ( dec. ), no. 33678/96, 4 May 2000, where the Court proceeded on the assumption that Articles 10 and 11 could be relied on by Greenpeace activists who had manoeuvred dinghies in such a manner as to obstruct whaling).

It reiterates that the interference does not need to amount to an outright ban, legal or de facto, but can consist in various other measures taken by the authorities. The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during a gathering and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin, cited above, § 39; Kasparov and Others v. Russia, no. 21613/07, § 84, 3 October 2013; Primov and Others, cited above, § 93; and Nemtsov, cited above, § 73 ). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to an interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities. A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well. So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants, and penalties imposed for having taken part in a rally ( see Kasparov and Others, cited above, § 84, with further references )."

The Court observes that in the present case the applicants were permitted to exercise unhindered their freedom of peaceful assembly, not only at the authorised locations, but also when the demonstrations moved onto the public highways in breach of the terms of the authorisation granted. Indeed, the gatherings, even when the demonstrators resorted to roadblocks, were not dispersed by the police. However, the applicants were subsequently convicted because of their role in the organisation and implementation of the roadblocks during the latter part of the demonstrations. As already indicated above, their conduct in this respect, albeit reprehensible, was not deemed to have been violent in character. The Court is therefore prepared to accept that the applicants ’ conviction for their participation in the demonstrations in issue amounted to an interference with their right to freedom of peaceful assembly. In this connection, it is noteworthy that before the Grand Chamber the Government did not dispute the existence of an interference (see paragraph 89 above)."

B.M. and A.K. insisted that they had not been convicted and sentenced in accordance with the law, but rather for having expressed their opinions at the farmers ’ meeting and for defending those opinions during a peaceful demonstration. The other three applicants – V.M., K.M. and A.P. – claimed that they had been convicted merely for driving their tractors onto the highway and parking them there, even though the highway had already been blocked by the police and the farmers. Accordingly, the criminal conviction had been an excessive measure and their actions should have been treated as an administrative offence, in accordance with Articles 124 1 or 131 of the Code of Administrative Law Offences (see paragraph 66 above), as was the case for the farmer, A.D.

However, the scope of the breach of administrative law provided for in those provisions did not encompass the applicants ’ acts in the instant case. Firstly, the applicants had acted as part of a crowd of people. Secondly, tractors had not only been parked and left unattended, but had also been used to block a highway, thus threatening the rights of others and the normal functioning of State institutions. Lastly, a concrete result had been pursued – the roadblocks. Therefore, the applicants ’ intent had been to commit a serious breach of public order and not merely to contravene a parking regulation."

Experience shows, however, that it is impossible to attain absolute precision in the framing of laws, particularly in fields in which the situation changes according to the prevailing views of society (see, among other authorities, Ezelin, cited above, § 45). In particular, the consequences of a given action need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, while certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances.

They had demanded an increase in milk purchase prices and had organised various actions. Following negotiations between farmers, dairy processors and the government, between March and June 2003 the government had adopted a number of decisions providing subsidies to milk producers in the sum of LTL 52,000,000 (approximately EUR 15,06 7, 000 ). The government had organised and participated in meetings with the farmers ’ representatives and had actively sought possible solutions involving regulation of the dairy sector and of the milk market.

Nonetheless, they had subsequently broken the law through their actions, which had constituted a serious breach of public order, inflicting harm on other persons, impairing the functioning of State institutions and creating a real danger of greater harm.

It had therefore not entailed any ban, even temporary, on the applicants ’ continuing their professional and political activities. One year after their conviction, the applicants had been discharged by the Supreme Court upon the expiry of the term of their suspended sentences ( see paragraph 60 above).

Similar permits were issued for 21 to 23, 24 and 26 to 30 May (see paragraph 15 above). On 8 May 2003 the Pasvalys municipality issued a permit to hold a demonstration for ten days from 15 to 25 May 2003 “ in the car park at the sixty-third kilometre of the Via Baltica highway and next to that highway” ( see paragraph 16 above). Finally, on 19 May 2003, the Klaipėda municipality issued a permit to hold an assembly in an “area in Divupiai village next to, but not closer than twenty-five metres from, the Vilnius- Klaipėda highway” from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. between 19 and 25 May 2003 (see paragraph 17 above)."

As indicated by the Government and not contested by the applicants, these were the country ’ s three major highways. Moreover, between 3 and 4. 30 p.m. on 21 May 2003, the third, fourth and fifth applicants drove tractors onto the Kaunas- Marijampolė - Suvalkai highway and left them there, thus obstructing the flow of traffic (see paragraph 21 (c) above)."

The Court notes that the problems in the agricultural sector and the fall in the wholesale prices of agricultural products were an ongoing situation and the farmers ’ dissatisfaction continued as the government failed in their view to implement Parliament ’ s resolution of 22 April 2003 (see paragraph 13 above). The situation at the heart of the conflict was well known to the applicants and to the authorities even before the issuance of the permits to hold assemblies.

                "169. The Court further sees no reason to doubt the domestic courts ’ findings to the effect that the applicants were aware that the moving of the demonstration from the authorised locations onto the highways and the parking of the tractors on the Kaunas- Marijampolė - Suvalkai highway would provoke a major disruption to traffic. Having examined the material at their disposal, the domestic courts and the Kalvarija and Pasvalys police (see paragraphs 28 and 30 above) came to the conclusion that the roadblocks had created a significant inconvenience for the flow of goods vehicles and private cars, with ensuing traffic jams and long queues of vehicles. These lasted for more than forty-eight hours, as the roadblocks were lifted only on 23 May 2003. It is not normally within the province of the European Court to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for these courts to assess the evidence before them (see, inter alia, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16 December 1992, § 34, Series A no. 247-B; Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, §§ 33-34, Series A no. 235-B; and Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, § 29, Series A no. 269 ). No material has been adduced before this Court which could call into question the findings of the national courts and add weight to the applicants ’ allegations before the Court, disputed by the Government, that on the critical days the flow of goods had been “even better than usual” (see paragraphs 24 and 121 above)."

                "170. As already pointed out in paragraph 97 above, the disruption to ordinary life and traffic was not a side-effect of a demonstration held in a public place. As long as the demonstrations took place in the designated locations, the flow of traffic was not affected. The decision of the farmers to move onto the highways and to use the tractors could not but be an attempt to block or reduce the passage of vehicles and create chaos in order to draw attention to the farmers ’ needs. The intentional roadblocks could not but have been aimed at pressuring the government to accept the farmers ’ demands, as shown by the fact that they were lifted as soon as the demonstrators had been informed of the successful outcome of the negotiations (see paragraphs 22 and 28 above). This feature distinguishes the present case from those in which the Court has observed that demonstrations may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life, including disruption to traffic (see the case-law cited in paragraph 155 above)."

            [
                "171. The Court has already been called upon to examine situations where demonstrators had tried to prevent or alter the exercise of an activity carried out by others. In Steel and Others ( cited above ) the first and second applicants had obstructed a hunt and had impeded engineering work for the construction of a motorway, respectively. In Drieman and Others (cited above ), Greenpeace activists had manoeuvred dinghies in such a way as to physically obstruct whaling, forcing the whalers to abandon their lawful exploitation of the living resources in Norway ’ s exclusive economic zone. In these two cases, the Court considered that the inflicting of sanctions ( in Steel and Others, forty-four hours ’ detention pending trial and sentencing to twenty-eight days ’ imprisonment for the obstruction of the hunt and seventeen hours ’ detention pending trial and sentencing to seven days ’ imprisonment for the protest against the construction of the motorway; in Drieman and Others, two days ’ detention on remand, fines convertible into imprisonment in case of default on payment and confiscation of a dinghy ) was a reaction proportionate to, inter alia, the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others. The Court considers that the same conclusion should a fortiori be reached in the present case, where the actions of the demonstrators had not been directly aimed at an activity of which they disapproved, but at the physical blocking of another activity (the use of highways by goods vehicles and private cars) which had no direct connection with the object of their protest, namely the government ’ s alleged lack of action vis-à-vis the decrease in the prices of some agricultural products."

In this respect, the present case has more similarities with the cases of Lucas (cited above), where the applicant blocked a public road in order to protest against the retention of a nuclear submarine, and Barraco ( cited above ), concerning the applicant ’ s participation in a form of protest resulting in a severe slowing - down of the flow of traffic. As in Steel and Others and Drieman and Others (both cited above), the Court found that the sanctions imposed on the applicants (four hours ’ detention in a police van and a fine of 150 pounds sterling in Lucas, and a three - month suspended prison sentence and a fine of 1,500 euros in Barraco ) were “necessary in a democratic society” within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 of the Convention. The Court further notes that in Barraco the disruption to traffic lasted only five hours (as opposed to more than forty-eight hours in the present case) and that only one highway (as opposed to three) had been affected."

As can be seen from the above case-law, the intentional serious disruption, by demonstrators, to ordinary life and to the activities lawfully carried out by others, which disruption was more significant than that caused by the normal exercise of the right of peaceful assembly in a public place, might be considered a “reprehensible act” within the meaning of the Court ’ s case-law (see paragraph 149 above).

From that moment on, the police confined themselves to ordering the applicants to remove the roadblocks and to warning them of their possible liability (see paragraphs 46 and 52 above). Even when the applicants refused to obey these lawful orders, the police chose not to disperse the gatherings. The farmers only decided to stop demonstrating when their demands had been met by the government (see paragraph 22 above). Moreover, when tensions arose between the farmers and the lorry drivers, the police urged the parties to the conflict to calm down in order to avoid serious confrontations ( see paragraph 28 above). Finally, the authorities tried to redirect the traffic onto secondary, neighbouring roads with a view to reducing the traffic jams."

Moreover, they attempted to balance the interests of the demonstrators with those of the users of the highways, in order to ensure the peaceful conduct of the gathering and the safety of all citizens, thus satisfying any positive obligation that they might be considered to have had (see the case-law cited in paragraphs 158 - 60 above).",

The applicants were not sentenced to pay fines and the only actual consequence of their conviction was the obligation, lasting one year, to obtain authorisation if they wanted to leave their places of residence for more than seven days (see paragraph 47 above). A similar measure was applied to four of the applicants before their trial from July until October 2003 (see paragraph 33 above). Such inconvenience does not seem disproportionate when compared to the serious disruption of public order provoked by the applicants (see also, by way of comparison, the sanctions applied in Steel and Others and Lucas, both cited above, which were considered proportionate by the Court).

In this regard, it is noteworthy that according to the comparative - law material available to the Court (see paragraphs 78 - 81 above), there is no uniform approach amongst the member States as to the legal characterisation of the obstruction of traffic on a public highway, which is treated as a criminal offence in some States and as an administrative matter in others. Therefore, a wide discretion should be given to the domestic authorities as to the characterisation of the conduct attributed to the applicants.

Although compulsion to join a particular trade union may not always be contrary to the Convention, a form of such compulsion which, in the circumstances of the case, strikes at the very substance of the freedom of association guaranteed by Article 11, will constitute an interference with that freedom (see Gustafsson v.

He alleged that section 2 (2) of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act of 9 June 1982 ( Lov om beskyttelse mod afskedigelse på grund af foreningsforhold ), as amended on 13 June 1990, violated Article 11 of the Convention as it allowed an employer to require an employee to be a member of a specific association in order to obtain employment.

In this judgment it was established that in certain circumstances Article 11 also secured the negative right to freedom of association. In the assessment of whether, subsequent to the Court's recent case-law, the domestic courts should disregard section 2( 2 ) of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act, the starting - point must be taken from the Act of 1992 incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights. According to the preparatory notes, incorporation of the Convention was not intended to change the existing balance between the Danish parliament and the Danish courts. Thus, in the view of the High Court, while taking into account the rights and obligations that may be inferred from the European Convention on Human Rights, Parliament still has considerable discretion when laying down Danish law. In this connection, it is also of importance to note that a decision abolishing or limiting the existing possibility of entering into closed-shop agreements will have far-reaching consequences for the Danish labour market.",

                "( 4 ) the embargo on industrial action, which means that no strikes are lawful during the term of a collective agreement; and",
                "( 5 ) the establishment of a special arbitration tribunal to deal with all violations of the September Agreement.",
                "The September Agreement is unique in that it has formed the basis of all subsequent general agreements between management and labour. Traditionally, the Danish legislature plays a minor role as regards the conditions governing wages, salaries and employment. Therefore, only to a certain extent does the Danish labour market have legislation which does not emanate from European Union directives, examples being the Salaried Employees'Act ( Funktionærloven ) and the Holiday Act ( Ferieloven ). Accordingly, rights imposed by statute in other countries have in Denmark been obtained by means of agreements between the labour - market partners. It is thus a characteristic feature of Danish law that the relationship between employers and employees is basically governed by a combination of agreements (collective and individual), labour-law principles, general statutes and rules laid down in pursuance of statutes. More than 80 % of all employees in Denmark are trade union members.",
                "From figures provided by Statistics Denmark ( Danmarks Statistikbank ) and the Ministry of Employment ( Beskæftigelsesministeriet ), in 2001 the Danish workforce consisted of 2,799,958 persons (inclusive of the unemployed). Of these, 1,611,715 were employed within the private sector and 937,826 within the public sector.",

                "The institution of closed-shop agreements is a long-standing practice in Denmark. Typically, a closed-shop agreement states that an employer has undertaken to hire and employ only members of the trade union that is party to the collective agreement concluded by the employer. Closed-shop agreements are unlawful in the public - sector labour market as they would be in conflict with the principle of equality under Danish administrative law. Also, they are not concluded in the part of the private - sector labour market covered by the general agreement between DA and LO, because DA considers the use of closed-shop provisions to be an interference with employers'managerial rights. Thus, closed-shop agreements are mainly of importance in collective agreements concluded with employers not affiliated to an employers'organisation.",

However, from figures provided by DA and the Christian Trade Union, the Government estimate that approximately 220,000 wage earners are affected in some way by closed-shop agreements – that is, less than 10 % of all Danish employees on the labour market.

The mandate of the committee was to examine the scope of such clauses and other circumstances which required membership of specific associations as a precondition for access to certain professions, and also to assess the compliance of such clauses with Denmark's international commitments. The committee was also asked to draw up recommendations and proposals for initiatives which afforded greater protection of the negative right to freedom of association. The committee submitted a report in June 2002 ( Betænkning nr. 1419, Udvalget om eksklusivbestemmelser ) which proposed changes to the law concerning closed-shop agreements between employees'organisations and employers. The committee pointed out that general developments in society and the labour market could no longer justify, to the same extent as before, the need for closed-shop agreements, since strong and representative trade unions and organisations had now been established on the labour market. The committee further stated that the advantages relating to membership of a trade union should in themselves be strong enough reasons to be a member of a trade union. The committee considered that as closed-shop agreements only existed for a small part of the labour market, a change in the law would have only a marginal impact upon union density rates. The committee further stated that closed-shop agreements could have the effect of reducing the supply of labour, that freedom of contract on the labour market was not an immutable concept, and that restrictions existed in several fields as to the agreements that management and labour could lawfully conclude."

The Employers'Association of Agriculture and Forestry said that the whole market garden area is covered by closed ‑ shop provisions, and argued for changes in all negotiations for collective- bargaining agreements. SID consistently states that there is no price at which the clauses could be eliminated from collective ‑ bargaining agreements, so the question is not open to negotiation. In the market garden area the exclusivity agreements result in a decrease in the number of applicants for apprenticeships, recruitment problems and problems in hiring seasonal workers. In other areas within agriculture and forestry it is also the case that exclusivity agreements are not'for sale'.",

The government consider that there should be freedom for an employee to decide whether to become a member of an association – just as there should be freedom to choose not to become a member of an association – without this leading to a risk of not being recruited or of being dismissed. The government do not consider it reasonable that an employer may lay down requirements as to the candidate's membership or non-membership of an association as a condition for obtaining or keeping a job. Furthermore, the government find it unreasonable that a clause in a collective agreement may prevent an employee who does not wish to be a member of an association or a specific association from obtaining or keeping employment with an employer or may prevent an employer from considering the candidate's qualifications alone. ...",

                "29. In accordance with the Danish Constitution, a bill is read three times before it is adopted. At the first reading, the bill is discussed in general and thereafter, normally, the bill is referred to a committee, which examines the proposal and is free to put questions to the relevant minister. With regard to the bill in question, on 6 February 2003 the Parliamentary Committee on Employment ( Arbejdsmarkedsudvalget ) submitted various questions to the Minister for Employment. As regards two questions (nos. 7 and 8) the latter replied as follows:",
                "“The Minister is requested to explain the impact of the proposed bill in relation to the scope for trade unions to enforce collective ‑ bargaining agreements, especially in relation to non-organised employers. It appears from the annual reports of the Labour Court for the years 1999 and 2000 that during the years in question, 600 and 646 cases respectively were conducted against non-organised employers, which correspond to 77% and 82% respectively of the cases in the Labour Court instigated by employees in those years. All these cases were instigated by LO ... It is the opinion of LO that the removal of closed - shop provisions will to a large extent make the efficient enforcement of collective ‑ bargaining agreements against such employers more difficult. ”",
                "“I find it difficult to see how the annulment of closed - shop provisions in collective ‑ bargaining agreements with non-organised employers, which is estimated to cover around 120,000 employees, should make it more difficult for the organisations to secure the efficient enforcement of collective ‑ bargaining agreements. First and foremost the annulment of a closed - shop provision in a collective ‑ bargaining agreement with a non-organised employer would not change the fact that the collective ‑ bargaining agreement is still valid and must be complied with. That means that the employees or their representatives would still have the possibility of bringing to the attention of the union in question any problems in getting the agreement complied with. The possibilities for the trade union to take action in such a case would therefore be unaffected. If there is a problem in having the terms in a collective ‑ bargaining agreement complied with in a business, due to the fact that the trade union does not have any members in that business, that should be reason enough for the employees to join the trade union and get the trade union to complain of the lack of compliance.",
                "I do not believe that a trade union will get much help in enforcing a collective ‑ bargaining agreement from employees whose membership is not voluntary.",
                "I do believe that if a trade union makes an effort and spreads the message to all the employees in a business covered by a collective ‑ bargaining agreement that it is due to its efforts that there are orderly conditions in the business, some of those employees that are involuntary members today could become voluntary members, and all employees could then stand together to secure compliance with the collective- bargaining agreement. ”",
                "“Under Danish collective- labour law, an employer must comply with the terms of a collective agreement in respect of all employees doing work within the field of the collective-bargaining agreement. Does the Minister believe that it is fair that non ‑ organised employees should, in this way, enjoy benefits to which they have not contributed, and which have been obtained for them by the trade unions?”",
                "“ The principle that a collective ‑ bargaining agreement also applies in relation to the work performed by non-organised employees in a business covered by a collective ‑ bargaining agreement, is a principle which also applies to areas without closed ‑ shop provisions. It is a principle which follows from collective ‑ bargaining agreements themselves, and it is only the organisation which is a party to the collective ‑ bargaining agreement which may raise a claim, not the individual (non-organised) employee.",
                "Furthermore, there is nothing to prevent a collective ‑ bargaining agreement only covering the members of the organisation which is a party to the agreement. I must therefore note that it is the trade unions themselves that have elected to follow this principle both in fields with and without closed - shop provisions. Whether this is fair or not, I will leave to the trade unions in question and to their members to consider.”"

Before the Parliamentary Committee on Employment on 12 March 2003, the Association of Employers in Gardening ( that is to say, the employers'association which has a closed ‑ shop agreement with SID affecting the applicant Rasmussen) and the Danish Landscape Gardeners Employers'Association made the following joint submission :",
                "“ Both the Association of Employers in Gardening and Danish Landscape Gardeners are parties to collective agreements with SID, pursuant to which the employers agree only to employ members of SID.",
                "This provision was agreed more than forty years ago and it is not clear why this was done. Thus, it is not apparent whether it was a mutual deal or whether it was the result of a strong trade union imposing the provision on a group of small employers.",
                "Briefly, the provision entails a number of drawbacks for Danish gardening of which the following may be mentioned:",
                "● It is difficult to get an inflow of apprentices to the trade. We need around 500 apprentices per year, but can only attract around 200. The closed - shop provision scares away young people. At the same time we have difficulty in securing qualified labour, since many capable employees do not want to work under an exclusivity agreement. Some of these may then try to circumvent the provision by establishing a relationship as a sub-contractor instead of as an actual employee.",
                "● The business of market gardening is characterised by seasonal work. Every year we need summer holiday casual workers, workers to pick vegetables, workers for Christmas production and the like. Typically, we are speaking of young students who would like to work for a few months – until the closed ‑ shop provision is mentioned.",
                "● Danish market gardens are in a very tough competitive situation in the European Union. No other country in the Union has closed - shop provisions similar to those for Danish gardeners. Therefore, there is unequal competition at European Union level.",
                "● Closed ‑ shop provisions may be an instrument for securing wages and employment terms in small, non-organised businesses. Danish market gardens are very large businesses (20-250 employees per business) and more than 90% are organised. The closed - shop provision has therefore been overtaken by the structural development of the business. In relation to businesses under the DA, the trade union movement accepts that the closed ‑ shop provisions are unnecessary; see the article in SID's periodical.",
                "● Danish market gardens are organised, from a business point of view, in the same way as Danish agriculture. The businesses in agriculture are not covered by closed ‑ shop provisions, and Danish market gardens should not be either.",
                "● The closed ‑ shop agreement with SID causes daily problems with employees who are members of other trade unions or who wish to join other unions. For example, it frustrates the desire of employees to be transferred to the Danish Association for Managers and Executives, to an organisation of artisans or to another unemployment fund.",
                "● As a labour-intensive export and home market business we need to attract the most competent workforce to Danish market gardens to maintain and expand our markets. The maintenance of the closed ‑ shop provision will inhibit our development, and the most competent employees elect for other professions.",
                "● The collective ‑ bargaining agreements between the Association of Employers in Gardening and Danish Landscape Gardeners respectively and SID will continue to apply for our employees (and be complied with), even if the closed ‑ shop provision is removed by law. The removal of the closed - shop provision would therefore not cause wage-dumping.",
                "● The introduction of closed ‑ shop provisions was not put in place as an equal deal, where both parties gained something. It does not appear anywhere that Danish market gardeners have received any compensation from SID for agreeing in the past to the closed ‑ shop provision. On the contrary, it is our opinion that the employers were forced to enter into the exclusivity agreement under strong pressure and the threat of industrial action.",
                "● In the last many negotiations for collective ‑ bargaining agreements we have tried to persuade SID to drop the exclusivity agreements. In these negotiations it has not been possible to buy ourselves out of the exclusivity agreement. SID has not even wanted to discuss the problem seriously.",
                "Closed ‑ shop agreements do not belong in a modern society. The individual citizen wants to make his own decisions about his relationship to the trade union movement, and must be expected to be able to do so rationally.",
                "Closed ‑ shop provisions arose at the end of the nineteenth century in a period when industrial action was the order of the day.",
                "Circumstances are now quite different, so closed ‑ shop provisions should be removed by law. This would not be State interference with the right of free negotiation on the labour market, but the necessary safeguarding of freedom of association.",

On the basis of the material available, however, the Government estimated that the total number of employed in the gardening and horticultural sector amounted to at least 20,800 persons. The relevant employers'organisations in the private sector had reported that around 11,000 persons were covered by closed-shop agreements, whereas the relevant trade unions had reported that 8,100 persons were covered. Thus, the Government estimated that less than 53 % but more than 39 % of persons were covered by closed ‑ shop agreements.",
                "The applicant Rasmussen submitted that the Government's calculation was misleading and irrelevant to an assessment of the possibility of him finding a job which was not covered by a closed ‑ shop agreement. He stressed that there were three different kinds of gardeners: landscape gardeners; greenhouse gardeners; and production gardeners. It was crucial to distinguish among the three kinds of gardening because job opportunities in the public sector almost exclusively related to landscape gardeners. Moreover, although the applicant Rasmussen possessed the qualifications to obtain a job at a nursery, this did not imply that he would be qualified to work in landscape gardening – be it in the public or private sector. A calculation should be made in respect of each of the three kinds of gardening. The percentages for greenhouse gardening and production gardening would then be seen to be higher, probably 80 % (11,000 employees covered by closed-shop provisions out of 13,700 in the three kinds of gardening in the private sector). Consequently, the percentage would be lower in respect of landscape gardeners. Accordingly, even if the Government were correct in stating that approximately every second job was not covered by closed ‑ shop agreements, it would be more pertinent to say that in the case of the applicant Rasmussen, only one out of five relevant jobs was not covered by a closed ‑ shop agreement.",

First and foremost, it would become difficult – and in many cases impossible – to enforce collective agreements vis-à-vis small, non-affiliated employers. To begin with, this would affect the relatively large number of employees who would lose the rights they had earned under the collective agreements with the consequence that they would risk being underpaid. Similarly, large enterprises could not be sure of peace in the workplace in the same way as when there was only one trade union movement. This might lead to unproductive battles between competing trade unions. Enterprises and employees would both stand to lose from such a situation. Furthermore, trades with special problems could not protect themselves against circumvention of their collective agreements. This was particularly the case for the hairdressing industry in which major problems were predicted. Overall, in the slightly longer term, an unavoidable practical consequence of a complete prohibition on closed ‑ shop clauses would be the impossibility of combating underpayment of employees in a number of areas and peace in the workplace."

                "52. In the somewhat longer term, the consequences of a complete prohibition on closed - shop clauses would be more difficult to predict. This hinged on a number of factors. Potentially, the consequences could be very far-reaching. The lack of possibilities of enforcing collective agreements – as regards small enterprises and special areas – would not only have a negative effect on the employees. This would also be considered unfair competition in relation to enterprises that had and observed collective agreements in force. The harm caused by this would obviously vary from one industry to the next, but in the long term it was certain that some affiliated enterprises, which observed collective agreements, would be unable to resist this unfair competition. If widespread, the consequences would increase. First and foremost, this would create a wage push from within the agreement area. This might have two different outcomes. Firstly, it would become more difficult to negotiate pay increases in connection with collective bargaining. Secondly, pay would – within the scope of the collective agreement – be close to the minimum wage compared with today where many areas are at levels that are considerably above the minimum pay stipulated by the collective agreement. This meant that pay trends would in effect be influenced by the intervention of the legislator – which was in contravention of the fundamental elements of the Danish model under which pay and working conditions evolved through self-regulation among the social partners. In addition, if unfair competition became as widespread as feared, the motivation to be a member of an employers'association would be reduced. It should therefore be considered a reasonable possibility that fewer employers would be affiliated. This would mean lower coverage of collective agreements. Furthermore, this would reduce the employees'motivation to join a trade union since the trade union movement's main service – conditions provided for by collective agreements – could no longer be offered to the same extent. Summarising the consequences of the complete prohibition of closed - shop clauses in the longer term, it became obvious that a regrettable and highly realistic risk existed that : it would affect the enforcement of collective agreements; it would affect the high unionisation rate; it would affect the high coverage of collective agreements; and pay trends would be interfered with."

The sum of these possible consequences meant that the foundation of the Danish model – which had had broad political backing for more than one hundred years – might begin to crumble. If so, to maintain the overall welfare level, Denmark would, within the foreseeable future, have to give up the extensive use of self-regulation and let Parliament handle the regulation of pay and employment conditions to a greater extent. Consequently, a judgment in favour of the applicants might, besides the immediate consequences for a number of employees, result in political intervention in the Danish labour - market model, which would fail to benefit employees, employers and Danish society in general."

The right to form and to join trade unions is a special aspect of freedom of association, and the notion of a freedom implies some measure of freedom of choice as to its exercise (see Young, James and Webster, cited above, § 52 ). Accordingly, Article 11 of the Convention must also be viewed as encompassing a negative right of association or, put in other words, a right not to be forced to join an association (see Sigurður A. Sigurjónsson v. Iceland, 30 June 1993, § 35, Series A no. 264 ). Although compulsion to join a particular trade union may not always be contrary to the Convention, a form of such compulsion which, in the circumstances of the case, strikes at the very substance of the freedom of association guaranteed by Article 11, will constitute an interference with that freedom (see Gustafsson v. Sweden, 25 April 1996, § 4 5, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II; and Young, James and Webster, § 55, and Sigurður A. Sigurjónsson, § 36, both cited above ).",

However, it is difficult to decide this issue in the abstract since it is a matter that can only be properly addressed in the circumstances of a given case. At the same time, an individual cannot be considered to have renounced his negative right to freedom of association in situations where, in the knowledge that trade union membership is a precondition of securing a job, he accepts an offer of employment notwithstanding his opposition to the condition imposed. Accordingly, the distinction made between pre-entry closed ‑ shop agreements and post-entry closed-shop agreements in terms of the scope of the protection guaranteed by Article 11 is not tenable.

Whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty on the State or in terms of interference by a public authority which needs to be justified, the criteria to be applied do not differ in substance. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 144, ECHR 2004 - V, and Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, §§ 98 et seq., ECHR 2003-VIII).",

Sweden, 6 February 19 7 6, § 39, Series A no. 20; Gustafsson, cited above, § 45; Schettini and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 29529/95, 9 November 2000; and Wilson, National Union of Journalists and Others, cited above, § 44).

                "However, where the domestic law of a Contracting State permits the conclusion of closed-shop agreements between unions and employers which run counter to the freedom of choice of the individual inherent in Article 11, the margin of appreciation must be considered reduced. The Court reiterates in this connection that, although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see Young, James and Webster, cited above, § 63, and Chassagnou and Others, cited above, §§ 112- 13). In assessing whether a Contracting State has remained within its margin of appreciation in tolerating the existence of closed-shop agreements, particular weight must be attached to the justifications advanced by the authorities for them and, in any given case, the extent to which they impinge on the rights and interests protected by Article 11. Account must also be taken of changing perceptions of the relevance of closed-shop agreements for securing the effective enjoyment of trade union freedom.",

They were both aware before taking up their respective jobs that an obligation existed to join SID, and that this was a condition for obtaining and retaining their employment. The Government have argued that the applicants'situation differs from those dealt with previously by the Court since the applicants could never have assumed the contrary. In the Court's view, however, the fact that the applicants accepted membership of SID as one of the terms of employment does not significantly alter the element of compulsion inherent in having to join a trade union against their will.

It is speculative whether, if he were to resign his membership of SID, he could find employment elsewhere with an employer who had not entered into a closed-shop agreement. It is certain, however, that should the applicant Rasmussen resign from SID, he would be dismissed without the possibility of reinstatement or compensation since the dismissal would be in accordance with the Danish Freedom of Association Act. Moreover, although closed ‑ shop agreements do not extend to the entire horticultural sector, they are nevertheless very common (see paragraphs 22, 26, 30 and 32 above).

The Government have pointed out that the applicants had the possibility of subscribing to a form of “non-political membership” of SID or of any other trade union pursuant to the Private Contributions to Political Parties and Disclosure of the Accounts of Political Parties Act (see paragraph 21 above). However, it is to be observed that such “non-political membership” does not entail any reduction in the payment of the membership fee to the specific trade union.

The Court further observes that, in the present case, the disruption of traffic cannot be described as a side-effect of a meeting held in a public place, but rather as the result of intentional action by the farmers, who wished to attract attention to the problems in the agricultural sector and to push the government to accept their demands (see also the arguments developed by the Court in paragraphs 169 - 75 below). In the Court ’ s view, although not an uncommon occurrence in the context of the exercise of freedom of assembly in modern societies, physical conduct purposely obstructing traffic and the ordinary course of life in order to seriously disrupt the activities carried out by others is not at the core of that freedom as protected by Article 11 of the Convention (see, for instance, Barraco, cited above, § 39, where the applicant ’ s conviction for his participation in a traffic-slowing operation, consisting in a rolling barricade of vehicles across several lanes of the motorway to slow down the traffic behind, was held to be an interference with his Article 11 rights; see also Lucas v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 39013/02, 18 March 2003, concerning a demonstration during which a public road was blocked in order to protest against the retention of a nuclear submarine, which was considered to fall within the terms of Article 11; Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 92, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, where the Court considered that the physical impediment of activities – a hunt and the construction of a motorway – of which the first and second applicants, respectively, disapproved, constituted expressions of opinion within the meaning of Article 10; and Drieman and Others v. Norway ( dec. ), no. 33678/96, 4 May 2000, where the Court proceeded on the assumption that Articles 10 and 11 could be relied on by Greenpeace activists who had manoeuvred dinghies in such a manner as to obstruct whaling).

The Regional Court observed that the offence of rioting endangered public order, public safety and public health, human dignity and the inviolability of property. The objective aspect of the offence was the organising of a gathering of people for a common goal – namely, to breach public order – and the implementation of their decision which, in the instant case, had been to organise the roadblocks. To constitute an offence, the actions also had to be committed deliberately, that is to say, the persons charged had to understand the unlawfulness of their behaviour. In relation to B.M. and A.K., the Regional Court observed that during the demonstrations the two applicants had told others that it had been decided to block the roads. It had been established that B.M. and A.K. had understood that the roadblocks would be illegal and that they had been warned about their liability as organisers. Even so, they had continued to coordinate the farmers ’ actions and had insisted that the farmers maintain the roadblocks. As a direct result of the actions of B.M. and A.K., on 21 May 2003 a crowd had gone onto the highways and had blocked them, thereby stopping the traffic and breaching the constitutional rights and liberties of others to move freely and without restriction, causing damage to goods carriers and thus seriously breaching public order."

It noted that by driving tractors onto the highway, thus causing traffic congestion and disturbing the work of the State border - control service, and by refusing to obey lawful requests by the police not to park their tractors on the road, the three applicants had seriously breached public order. The fact that after the highway had been blocked the police and the drivers had negotiated with the farmers, with the result that some of the drivers had been let through, did not diminish the danger caused by the offence or its unlawfulness. The Regional Court also emphasised that the blockading of a major highway had had dangerous consequences and could not be considered to have been a mere administrative - law offence such as a traffic violation. As to the applicants ’ argument that their offences were identical to that for which another farmer, A.D., had been given a mere administrative sanction for a traffic violation (see paragraph 49 above), the Regional Court indicated that it was not an administrative tribunal and thus could not comment on the administrative offence."

The incidents in issue had taken place regularly for more than ten years; in certain cases the French authorities had been warned of the imminence of demonstrations by farmers, the disruption had continued for several hours and the acts of vandalism, committed by persons whose faces were often not covered, had been filmed by television cameras. In spite of this, only a very small number of perpetrators had been identified and prosecuted. This was sufficient for the ECJ to come to the conclusion that the measures adopted by the French government were manifestly inadequate to ensure freedom of intra-Community trade in agricultural products on its territory and that France had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 30, taken in conjunction with Article 5 of the EC Treaty. This had created a climate of insecurity which had had a deterrent effect on trade flow as a whole and the difficult situation of French farmers could not justify a failure to apply Community Law correctly, as it had not been shown that implementation of that law would have posed a danger to public order with which the State could not cope. It was true that the threat of serious disruption to public order might, in appropriate cases, justify non-intervention by the police; however, this argument could have been put forward only with respect to a specific incident, and not in a general way covering all the incidents in issue.",

Austria, (C-112/00, judgment of 12 June 2003 – “the Schmidberger case” ), the ECJ gave a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Articles 30, 34 and 36 (now Articles 34, 35 and 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union – TFEU ), read together with Article 5 of the EC Treaty (repealed and replaced in substance by Article 4 § 3 of the Treaty on European Union – TEU) and on the conditions for liability of a member State for damage caused to individuals by a breach of Community Law. The case originated in the permission implicitly granted by the Austrian authorities to an environmental group to organise a demonstration on the Brenner motorway, the effect of which was to completely close that motorway to traffic for almost thirty hours. In conjunction with a pre-existing, national, generally applicable ban on holiday driving, this caused the Brenner motorway (an essential intra-Community transit route) to be closed to the majority of heavy goods traffic for four consecutive days, with a short interruption of a few hours."

After referring to the principles laid down in the Commission case (see paragraphs 71 - 72 above) regarding the positive obligations of the member States in this area, the ECJ held that the fact of not banning the demonstration complained of amounted to a restriction of the free movement of goods. It went on to consider whether the failure to impose a ban could be objectively justified. It observed that the specific aims of the demonstration were in themselves immaterial to establish the liability of the member State under the EC Treaty, only the objective pursued by the national authorities, namely respect for the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and assembly, being relevant. Both the free movement of goods, one of the fundamental principles of the EC Treaty, and the rights guaranteed by Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention could be subject to certain restrictions for overriding requirements relating to the public interest. It remained to be ascertained whether the restrictions to the free movement of goods tolerated by Austria were proportionate to the legitimate objective pursued."

In this connection the ECJ noted that the case in Schmidberger could be distinguished from that in the Commission case in that: (a) the demonstrators had requested an authorisation; (b) the obstacle to the free movement of goods was limited geographically; (c) the aim of the demonstrators was not to restrict trade in goods of a particular type or from a particular source; (d) various administrative and supporting measures (publicity campaign, designation of various alternative routes, security arrangements on the site of the demonstration) had been taken by the competent authorities in order to limit as far as possible the disruption to road traffic; and (e) the demonstration did not give rise to a general climate of insecurity such as to have a dissuasive effect on intra-Community trade flow as a whole. Under these circumstances, Austria was entitled to consider that an outright ban on the demonstration would have constituted unacceptable interference with freedom of peaceful assembly, and stricter conditions concerning the site and/or the duration of the demonstration could have been perceived as excessive restrictions. In this respect, the ECJ stated as follows.",

In that regard, the Republic of Austria submits, without being contradicted on that point, that in any event, all the alternative solutions which could be countenanced would have risked reactions which would have been difficult to control and would have been liable to cause much more serious disruption to intra-Community trade and public order, such as unauthorised demonstrations, confrontation between supporters and opponents of the group organising the demonstration or acts of violence on the part of the demonstrators who considered that the exercise of their fundamental rights had been infringed.”"

In the Court ’ s view, although not an uncommon occurrence in the context of the exercise of freedom of assembly in modern societies, physical conduct purposely obstructing traffic and the ordinary course of life in order to seriously disrupt the activities carried out by others is not at the core of that freedom as protected by Article 11 of the Convention (see, for instance, Barraco, cited above, § 39, where the applicant ’ s conviction for his participation in a traffic-slowing operation, consisting in a rolling barricade of vehicles across several lanes of the motorway to slow down the traffic behind, was held to be an interference with his Article 11 rights; see also Lucas v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 39013/02, 18 March 2003, concerning a demonstration during which a public road was blocked in order to protest against the retention of a nuclear submarine, which was considered to fall within the terms of Article 11; Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 92, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, where the Court considered that the physical impediment of activities – a hunt and the construction of a motorway – of which the first and second applicants, respectively, disapproved, constituted expressions of opinion within the meaning of Article 10; and Drieman and Others v.

A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well.

Secondly, tractors had not only been parked and left unattended, but had also been used to block a highway, thus threatening the rights of others and the normal functioning of State institutions. Lastly, a concrete result had been pursued – the roadblocks. Therefore, the applicants ’ intent had been to commit a serious breach of public order and not merely to contravene a parking regulation."

Experience shows, however, that it is impossible to attain absolute precision in the framing of laws, particularly in fields in which the situation changes according to the prevailing views of society (see, among other authorities, Ezelin, cited above, § 45). In particular, the consequences of a given action need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, while certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, among other authorities, The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 49, Series A no. 30; Rekvényi v.

The domestic authorities did not accuse the applicants of committing acts of violence or of damaging property. They maintained, however, that the applicants had “ otherwise seriously breach [ ed ] public order”. In particular, on the basis of video - recordings, documentary evidence and witness statements, the District Court found that A.K. and B. M. had deliberately organised protests and coordinated the actions of the farmers in order to block the roads (see paragraphs 43 - 44 above) and that the other applicants, V.M., K.M. and A.P., had driven tractors onto the highway and parked them there and refused to obey lawful orders by the police to stop doing so (see paragraph 46 above). These findings were confirmed by the Kaunas Regional Court, which specified that A.K. and B.M. had been warned about their liability as organisers and had understood the unlawfulness of their actions (see paragraph 51 above). Finally, the Supreme Court provided an explanation of the substance of the offence punished under Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code, indicating, inter alia, that a riot was a situation where a gathering of people deliberately and seriously breached public order and that blocking the roads, stopping the traffic and disturbing the work of the State border - control authority was a means of causing such a breach (see paragraphs 56 - 57 above)."

In such circumstances, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly should have prevailed over any resulting minimal disturbances to the free movement of goods.

The farmers themselves had foreseen measures, which were fully implemented, to ensure that traffic was redirected onto secondary roads. According to the applicants, on the critical days the flow of traffic had been “even better than usual”. This was proven by the “data from posts where the roadblocks took place”.

On the contrary, the roadblocks had been symbolic and aimed at attracting the government ’ s attention. B.M. and A.K., who were respected by the farmers, had maintained order among the demonstrators. Moreover, during the roadblocks, selected representatives of the farmers were still negotiating with the government in order to reach a compromise on milk prices. The farmers had acted calmly and had taken no action that would require police special units or the army to intervene to restrain them. Their intention was not to breach public order, but to peacefully demonstrate for social justice. Only one lawsuit for civil damage, in the amount of LTL 1,100 (approximately EUR 290), had been upheld by a court (see paragraph 45 above).

At the same time, the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that a person cannot be subject to a sanction – even one at the lower end of the scale of disciplinary penalties – for participation in a demonstration which has not been prohibited, so long as that person does not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion ( see Ezelin, § 53; Galstyan, § 115; and Barraco, § 44, all cited above ).

In particular, where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Oya Ataman, § 42; Bukta and Others, § 37; Nurettin Aldemir and Others, § 46; Ashughyan, § 90; Éva Molnár, § 36; Barraco, § 43; Berladir and Others, § 38; Fáber, § 47, all cited above; and İzci v.

The method used by the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place or dispersing the demonstration is also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference ( see Primov and Others, cited above, § 119). Thus, the use by the police of pepper spray to disperse an authorised demonstration was found to be disproportionate, even though the Court acknowledged that the event could have disrupted the flow of traffic (see Oya Ataman, cited above, §§ 38-44 )."

Having examined the material at their disposal, the domestic courts and the Kalvarija and Pasvalys police (see paragraphs 28 and 30 above) came to the conclusion that the roadblocks had created a significant inconvenience for the flow of goods vehicles and private cars, with ensuing traffic jams and long queues of vehicles.

In Drieman and Others (cited above ), Greenpeace activists had manoeuvred dinghies in such a way as to physically obstruct whaling, forcing the whalers to abandon their lawful exploitation of the living resources in Norway ’ s exclusive economic zone.

Even when the applicants refused to obey these lawful orders, the police chose not to disperse the gatherings. The farmers only decided to stop demonstrating when their demands had been met by the government (see paragraph 22 above). Moreover, when tensions arose between the farmers and the lorry drivers, the police urged the parties to the conflict to calm down in order to avoid serious confrontations ( see paragraph 28 above). Finally, the authorities tried to redirect the traffic onto secondary, neighbouring roads with a view to reducing the traffic jams."

Moreover, they attempted to balance the interests of the demonstrators with those of the users of the highways, in order to ensure the peaceful conduct of the gathering and the safety of all citizens, thus satisfying any positive obligation that they might be considered to have had (see the case-law cited in paragraphs 158 - 60 above).",

The applicants were not sentenced to pay fines and the only actual consequence of their conviction was the obligation, lasting one year, to obtain authorisation if they wanted to leave their places of residence for more than seven days (see paragraph 47 above). A similar measure was applied to four of the applicants before their trial from July until October 2003 (see paragraph 33 above). Such inconvenience does not seem disproportionate when compared to the serious disruption of public order provoked by the applicants (see also, by way of comparison, the sanctions applied in Steel and Others and Lucas, both cited above, which were considered proportionate by the Court).

In this regard, it is noteworthy that according to the comparative - law material available to the Court (see paragraphs 78 - 81 above), there is no uniform approach amongst the member States as to the legal characterisation of the obstruction of traffic on a public highway, which is treated as a criminal offence in some States and as an administrative matter in others. Therefore, a wide discretion should be given to the domestic authorities as to the characterisation of the conduct attributed to the applicants.

It went on to say that the prohibition was nevertheless justified or even required by the State ’ s positive obligation under Article 9 to protect persons manifesting their religion against deliberate disturbance by others. In arriving at that conclusion, the Constitutional Court had particular regard to the fact that All Saints ’ Day was an important religious holiday on which the population traditionally went to cemeteries to commemorate the dead and that disturbances caused by disputes between members of the assembly organised by the applicant and members of Comradeship IV were likely to occur in the light of the experience of previous years."

They envisaged peaceful and silent means of expressing their opinion, namely the carrying of commemorative messages, and had explicitly ruled out the use of chanting or banners. Thus, the intended assembly in itself could not have hurt the feelings of cemetery - goers.

Accordingly, the responsibility of Contracting States can be involved by acts and omissions of their authorities which produce effects outside their own territory. Of particular significance to the present case the Court held, in conformity with the relevant principles of international law governing State responsibility, that the responsibility of a Contracting Party could also arise when as a consequence of military action – whether lawful or unlawful – it exercises effective control of an area outside its national territory. The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control whether it be exercised directly, through its armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration. ...",

Such control, according to the relevant test and in the circumstances of the case, entails her responsibility for the policies and actions of the 'TRNC' ... Those affected by such policies or actions therefore come within the 'jurisdiction' of Turkey for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention.

It is of course true that in Loizidou the Court was addressing an individual's complaint concerning the continuing refusal of the authorities to allow her access to her property. However, it is to be observed that the Court's reasoning is framed in terms of a broad statement of principle as regards Turkey 's general responsibility under the Convention for the policies and actions of the 'TRNC' authorities. Having effective overall control over northern Cyprus, its responsibility cannot be confined to the acts of its own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but must also be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survives by virtue of Turkish military and other support. It follows that, in terms of Article 1 of the Convention, Turkey's 'jurisdiction' must be considered to extend to securing the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which she has ratified, and that violations of those rights are imputable to Turkey.”"

            ],

                "24. The respondent Government maintained that the applicant had not attempted to exhaust the remedies available to him within the judicial and administrative system of the “TRNC”, as required by Article 35 of the Convention. In this connection they submitted that there were effective and adequate remedies within the judicial system of the “TRNC”, which were easily accessible to the applicant, offered him reasonable prospects of success and were capable of providing him with redress. Affirming the impartiality and independence of the judicial system in the “TRNC”, the respondent Government submitted the following points.",
                "(i) The Constitution of the “TRNC” incorporated provisions for human rights drawn from the 1960 Cypriot Constitution, and also the European Convention on Human Rights, which formed part of the laws of the “TRNC”. Under the Constitution fundamental rights and liberties could only be restricted by law and only for the purposes that were provided for in law. Articles 136 to 155 of the Constitution provided for access to independent courts and for judicial review of administrative action on the grounds of illegality or error of law and excess and/or abuse of power (Article 152) as well as judicial review of legislation by way of reference to the Supreme Constitutional Court (Article 148) and institution of proceedings for annulment of legislation and subsidiary legislation (Article 147). In particular, Article 152 of the Constitution provided that the High Administrative Court had exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate finally on a complaint that a decision, act or omission of any body, authority or person exercising any executive or administrative authority was contrary to any of the provisions of the Constitution, or of any law or subsidiary legislation thereunder, or exceeded or abused the powers vested in such body or authority or person. The applicant could have brought administrative proceedings in the High Administrative Court for annulment of the relevant decision or decisions of the Council of Ministers and/or responsible ministry and/or any authority that had allegedly prevented him from crossing over to southern Cyprus.",
                "(ii) The courts had also adopted certain principles which included, inter alia, the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness and the principles of reasonableness, proportionality and reasoning of administrative acts. In order to take effect in relation to the person concerned, the administrative decision had to have been properly taken and served on the person concerned. Unless this had been done the purported act would have been incomplete and would not have come into operation vis-à-vis the person concerned.",
                "(iii) It would have been very unlikely for any administrative act or decision to be characterised as an “act of State” and to be excluded from judicial review. Judicial review of an administrative act relating to matters of high policy would have been treated just like any other administrative act, subject to principles of administrative law relating to the exercise of discretionary powers granted under legal and constitutional provisions. The alleged refusals by the authorities to permit the applicant to visit southern Cyprus would not have been regarded by the courts in the “TRNC” as a political act outside their competence. Although the authorities might have been held to have had a certain amount of discretion regarding the merits of the issue involved, the court would not have declined jurisdiction if there had been a procedural defect relating, for instance, to the elaboration and service of the relevant administrative act or decision, or the lack of legal provisions allowing the authorities to take the relevant decision, particularly if such a decision were to restrict or limit the exercise of a right or liberty enshrined in the Constitution.",
                "(iv) Under Article 76 of the “TRNC” Constitution there was a right of individual petition to the authorities of the State. Failure by the appropriate authority to reply to a petition made under the above-mentioned provision within a period of thirty days constituted an “omission” of the authorities under Article 152 of the Constitution giving the complainant the right to apply to the High Administrative Court.",
                "(v) It was also possible to submit petitions to the Petitions Committee of the Legislative Assembly of the “TRNC” under the Petitions Law (no. 30/1976);",
                "(vi) In addition, the applicant could have submitted a complaint to the Attorney-General of the “TRNC” about the matter. Under the Constitution the Attorney-General was an independent officer of the State, and if the applicant had complained to him, he could have taken up the matter with the competent bodies of the State.",
                "(vii) In view of the fact that the applicant had been given permission on many occasions to visit southern Cyprus, his argument that he was not required to exhaust domestic remedies due to the existence of an “administrative practice” to refuse applications to visit southern Cyprus was unfounded. Each application was considered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defence on its own merits and, in case of refusal, it was open to the applicant to challenge such refusal on its merits and/or on procedural grounds.",
                "(viii) In the light of the Court's judgment in Cyprus v. Turkey, the applicant's argument that “TRNC” remedies were inherently illegal as they emanated from an illegal situation was unfounded on both legal and factual grounds."

                "25. Finally, the respondent Government maintained that the applicant had by-passed the judicial bodies of the “TRNC” not because of the lack of effective judicial remedies but because he was not willing to avail himself of the available remedies. In this connection, they referred to the significance of the applicant's political motivation as well as the political aspect of the present application. They alleged that the applicant was a person of extreme and provocative views that many Turkish Cypriots might have thought transcended the boundaries of criticism. They stated that his style of writing was reminiscent of similar, if not identical, expressions on the same points that were often used in the four inter-State applications by Cyprus against Turkey. In this connection, they mentioned the reference by the applicant to the International Association for the Protection of Human Rights in Nicosia on his legal-aid form, hinting at Greek-Cypriot involvement, assistance or instigation, and found it surprising that he should denigrate to such an extent the State in which he lived and/or the authorities, including the judiciary, of that State."

                "26. The applicant countered the arguments of the respondent Government with submissions that included the following points.",
                "(i) Although the Court, in its judgment in Cyprus v. Turkey, was not persuaded that the “TRNC” courts were inherently illegal under international law and thus in principle incapable of offering effective remedies, it was nevertheless true under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention that the definition and application of domestic remedies should be in accord with the rules and requirements of international law. These constituted the essential boundaries of the provision which could not be crossed.",
                "(ii) The respondent Government had failed to discharge the burden of proof for Convention purposes (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports 1996-IV). In particular, they had not addressed the key questions of the effectiveness of any of the claimed remedies with regard to the applicant and in the light of the situation. Their observations simply noted generally a range of provisions of the “TRNC” Constitution with no attempt to point to a remedy for the applicant.",
                "(iii) The applicant had never been informed of, and had been entirely unable to discover, any proper legal basis for his treatment. Any effective remedy claimed by the respondent Government had to be seen in this light. The applicant had been prevented in an arbitrary and erratic fashion from carrying out his attempts to establish and further contacts with Greek Cypriots in southern Cyprus with a view to developing friendly relations. He had consistently sought to discover the reasons underlying the refusal to allow him to visit southern Cyprus. There did not appear to be any statutory basis in the law of northern Cyprus regulating contacts between north and south. Requests for permission to cross into the south were always treated arbitrarily, with no proper notice of refusal or no notice at all, and were often dealt with negatively, in that express permission to cross was not sent to the relevant crossing-point, or was refused orally, so that the decision was impossible to challenge in practice. The applicant believed that for political reasons he would not in any event have been treated fairly. He understood that oral decisions concerning him had been taken and he argued that he had not obtained anything in writing apart from veiled threats.",
                "(iv) Article 12 of the “TRNC” Constitution expressly provided that no interpretation could be accepted which implied any right to engage in activities aimed at changing the “rights and status” of the “TRNC”. In this connection, the applicant pointed to a letter from the Directorate of Consular and Minority Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defence of the “TRNC” dated 18 May 1994 that justified the refusal of a permit requested by the applicant on the ground that he engaged in propaganda against the State as well as for reasons pertaining to security and the public interest.",
                "(v) Entry regulations into the “TRNC” (and thus by necessary implication exit and re-entry) and the principles of implementation were based on decisions of the Council of Ministers of the “TRNC” which in the legal system of the “TRNC” were not subject to any judicial review (see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, Commission's report of 4 June 1999, § 109);",
                "(vi) In view of the fact that the “TRNC” courts did not have jurisdiction over the Turkish forces manning the dividing line, no “TRNC” court decision supporting the applicant's claim would have or could have any binding effect upon the relevant Turkish forces, not least because both Turkey and the “TRNC” maintained that they were separate independent States.",
                "(vii) In any event the arbitrary and erratic practices with regard to permission to cross over into southern Cyprus were such as to amount to an administrative practice. As affirmed and accepted by the Court in its judgment in Cyprus v. Turkey, the policy of impeding bi-communal contacts, at least from 1996, amounted to an administrative practice. Unlike the position in the inter-State case, however, the violation of the applicant's Convention rights fell within the period covered by the Commission's admissibility decision of 14 April 1998, so that he was absolved from the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies. The argument was that the practice in question amounted to arbitrarily disrupting and impeding such contacts and not that every single contact was prevented. Such a practice had been maintained throughout the period relevant to his application."
            ],
            [
                "27. The Cypriot Government made observations similar to those of the applicant, disputing the arguments of the respondent Government. In their submissions the Cypriot Government argued that remedies within the “TRNC” judicial system did not constitute effective domestic remedies requiring exhaustion for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. Alternatively, they submitted that the illegality of those remedies in international law amounted to a “special circumstance” absolving the applicant from the requirement of exhaustion. The Cypriot Government disagreed with the decision both of the Commission in its report of 4 June 1999 and of the majority of the Court in its judgment of 10 May 2001 in Cyprus v. Turkey that remedies available within the “TRNC” could be regarded as “domestic remedies”. They also raised the following additional points.",
                "(i) The respondent Government had failed to specify the exact remedies available to the applicant with the requisite degree of certainty within the “TRNC” legal system, being accessible and capable of affording effective redress with reasonable prospects of success. The observations of the respondent Government could only be taken to refer to the possibility of an application for “judicial review” based on the “constitutional” rights referred to; that had not been shown to be effective in practice, or to be sufficiently certain to meet the requirements of Article 35.",
                "(ii) In order to have been effective, any remedy for the present violations would have had to be able to prevent or forestall the violation. No such means could ever have been available since the applicant had never been given formal notification of the decision in advance enabling him to challenge the refusal, but had been notified only at the time it was implemented – by means of a refusal of permission to cross the line. In practical terms, it would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the applicant, or others in the same position, to initiate any process by which an effective remedy, capable of overturning the decision, could have been granted. A challenge mounted after the event would not have been an effective remedy or established a right of passage for the future since each application to cross the Turkish cease-fire lines was separate and resulted in a separate refusal (that was not, however, communicated in advance).",
                "(iii) In view of Article 12 of the “TRNC” Constitution, any political activity, including bi-communal activity, which was aimed at promoting the case for terminating Turkey's illegal occupation of northern Cyprus and for re ‑ establishing the rule of law and thus bringing about “changes” to the perceived “status” of the “TRNC” as an independent State was denied “constitutional” protection, negating consequently the rights to freedom of assembly, association or expression. Thus, it could not be said that a constitutional challenge by the applicant would have enjoyed reasonable prospects of success.",
                "(iv) The evidence established a practice of restricting freedom of movement and thereby suppressing freedom of expression and association and of preventing the involvement of Turkish Cypriots in bi-communal organisations and activities taking place in the south. Thus the situation differed from that before the Court in the inter-State case. In the present case there was evidence of the practice of imposing politically motivated restrictions on freedom of movement in order to prevent Turkish-Cypriot opponents of the regime from travelling to the south in order to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and association (see US State Department Country Reports on Human Rights, 1993, 1994 and 1996; Cyprus v. Turkey, Commission's report cited above). There was direct evidence of the application of this practice to the applicant and others. Despite the scale of this practice, the respondent Government were unable to point to any example of a case where a successful challenge had been brought on comparable facts. The position was essentially the same for other Turkish Cypriots wishing to cross from the north to the south.",
                "(v) Alternatively, even if the Court were to conclude that there was insufficient evidence to establish the existence of an administrative practice, the pattern of repeated violations was still relevant. Where, as here, there was a pattern of politically motivated restrictions on freedom of expression and association, the absence of any clear remedy, or any previous instances of such a remedy being applied for or granted, was plainly relevant to the determination of whether the respondent Government had demonstrated that the suggested remedies were available in practice and had reasonable prospects of success (see Akdivar and Others, cited above).",
                "(vi) The courts of the “TRNC” were neither independent nor impartial when called upon to determine political disputes or disputes involving supporters or opponents of the “TRNC”."

The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies which are available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 § 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used.

Turkey it held that, for the purposes of former Article 26 (current Article 35 § 1), remedies available in the “TRNC” may be regarded as “domestic remedies” of the respondent State and that the question of their effectiveness is to be considered in the specific circumstances where it arises. In this connection Court considers, as it did in the above judgment, that the reliance by the applicant and the Cypriot Government on the illegality of the “TRNC” courts seems to contradict the assertion they make that Turkey is responsible for the violations alleged in northern Cyprus – an assertion which has been accepted by the Court (see paragraphs 21-23 above). In particular the Court stated the following in Cyprus v. Turkey :",
                "“101. ... It appears ... difficult to admit that a State is made responsible for the acts occurring in a territory unlawfully occupied and administered by it and to deny that State the opportunity to try to avoid such responsibility by correcting the wrongs imputable to it in its courts. To allow that opportunity to the respondent State in the framework of the present application in no way amounts to an indirect legitimisation of a regime which is unlawful under international law.”"

As regards the possible remedies cited by the respondent Government, the Court considers that the latter's assertions cannot suffice to justify the objection they have raised at this stage of the proceedings. In their submissions to the Court the respondent Government referred to a number of constitutional provisions with emphasis, firstly, on the judicial review of administrative acts, decisions and omissions of any body, authority or person exercising administrative or executive power; secondly, on the possibility of recourse to the High Administrative Court in the event of failure by the authorities of the “TRNC” to reply to an individual petition within the time allowed; and, thirdly, on the submission of a complaint to the Attorney-General. The Court notes that the respondent Government's submissions regarding this point are very general. The respondent Government have not shown that any of the remedies cited would have afforded redress in any way whatsoever to the applicant. Moreover, the Court does not consider that a remedy before the administrative courts can be regarded as adequate and sufficient in respect of the applicant's complaints, since it is not satisfied that a determination can be made in the course of such proceedings concerning the refusal of the permits at the “green line”. The same applies to the submission of complaints to the Attorney-General of the “TRNC”."

The Commission was referring to the entry into or exit from the “TRNC” of Greek Cypriots and not to the exit from (and entry into) the “TRNC” of Turkish Cypriots, as in the instant case. The respondent Government stated that the body taking the decision as to whether a permit will be granted is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defence of the “TRNC”. In that respect, it seems that a distinction exists between the two situations. The respondent Government have not clarified this point in their submissions.

It was the inability to engage in peaceful discourse and intercourse, to pursue the basic democratic rights of receiving and imparting “information and ideas with those on the island of Cyprus who shared his aims of a peaceful and friendly resolution of the problems of that island without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers” that lay at the heart of his application. In the circumstances of the current situation in Cyprus, he felt that it was only by meetings between Turkish and Greek Cypriots that ideas for a peaceful political settlement could be truly imparted, received and exchanged. However, he stated that such meetings could not be held in northern Cyprus and meetings of equivalent range and quality could not be organised anywhere other than in southern Cyprus. Thus, the lack of a proper system to regulate crossing from north to south and the arbitrary and erratic way in which he alleged he had been prevented from attending various relevant meetings in the south had substantially and adversely affected his Convention rights to freedom of assembly and association as well as expression."

Furthermore, he noted that 15 foreign students (cited above), referred to by the respondent Government in their submissions, was not relevant to the present application or appropriate since that case did not concern freedom of movement."

Moreover, it was submitted by the applicant that, although the case-law to date on the interpretation of the term “assembly” was not extensive and had focused on demonstrations, Article 11 of the Convention covered the right of persons to gather together in order to further their common interests in a peaceful manner, whether in public or private meetings (see Rassemblement jurassien and Unité jurassienne v. Switzerland, no. 8191/78, Commission decision of 10 October 1979, DR 17, p. 93). In this sense, the applicant stated, the actions in relation to him fell within the framework of Article 11 and constituted a violation of its provisions. The activities complained of had had the effect as well as the intention of severely disrupting the possibility afforded by peaceful assembly of furthering attempts at mutual reconciliation and peaceful settlement of a grievous situation in Cyprus. He maintained that the essence of the various meetings held had been to bring together Turkish and Greek Cypriots with the intention of working towards such goals. The actions complained of had resulted in great difficulty in ensuring Turkish-Cypriot participation in such endeavours. The applicant distinguished Cyprus v. Turkey from his own case since the conclusions of the Court in that case under Article 11 of the Convention with regard to Turkish Cypriots had referred to the position of Turkish Cypriots in general and not to the position of a specific person or persons."

Finally the applicant maintained that, in accordance with the principle of protection from arbitrariness in the exercise of authority, the respondent Government, once aware of complaints about the violations of Article 11 of the Convention, were obliged to conduct a prompt and effective investigation (see Kurt v. Turkey, judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, pp. 1184-85, §§ 122, 124, and pp. 1187-88, §§ 133-34, and Osman v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, p. 3159 and 3163, §§ 115 and 123).

In support of this argument, the Cypriot Government stated that the Court had held on a number of occasions that the fact that the subject matter of a particular complaint was addressed in an optional Protocol which the State concerned had not ratified did not prevent consideration of the complaint under a provision of the Convention itself (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 24 April 1985, Series A no. 94, and Guzzardi v.

The Court first observes that the applicant's complaint under Article 11 of the Convention is not limited to the question of freedom of movement, that is, to physical access to the southern part of Cyprus. His complaint, as set out in his submissions, is that the authorities, by constantly refusing to grant him permits to cross the “green line”, have effectively prevented him from meeting Greek Cypriots and from participating in bi ‑ communal meetings, thus affecting his right to freedom of assembly and association, contrary to Article 11 of the Convention. It is this complaint, as formulated above, that was addressed by the applicant as well as the Turkish and the Cypriot Governments in their submissions to the Court. In this connection the Court also refers to its findings and reasoning in Loizidou (merits), rejecting similar arguments raised by the respondent Government regarding freedom of movement (judgment cited above, p. 2237, §§ 60-63)."

The Court observes at the outset that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, is one of the foundations of such a society. Thus, it should not be interpreted restrictively (see G. v. Germany, no. 13079/87, Commission decision of 6 March 1989, DR 60, p. 256; Rassemblement jurassien and Unité jurassienne, cited above, p. 93; and Rai and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 25522/94, Commission decision of 6 April 1995, DR 81-A, p. 146). As such this right covers both private meetings and meetings in public thoroughfares as well as static meetings and public processions; in addition, it can be exercised by individuals and those organising the assembly ( Rassemblement jurassien and Unité jurassienne, cited above, p. 119, and Christians against Racism and Fascism v. the United Kingdom, no. 8440/78, Commission decision of 16 July 1980, DR 21, p. 138, at p. 148)."

Lastly, the Court considers that, although the essential object of Article 11 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the exercise of the rights protected, there may in addition be positive obligations to secure the effective enjoyment of these rights (see Christians against Racism and Facism, cited above, p. 148).",

The Court's jurisdiction ratione temporis only permits it to consider the period from the above date until 14 April 1998, the latter being the date of the admissibility decision, that is, a period of six years and one month.

Although the applicant was allowed to cross over the “green line” and attend some meetings, these were very few in comparison with the number of times he was not permitted to cross over. In particular, during the period under consideration, only six out of forty-six requests were granted. The Court notes that in some of these instances permits were granted to other persons who had submitted requests, but not to the applicant. In this connection the Court also reiterates its findings in Cyprus v. Turkey in relation to the rigorous approach taken by the “TRNC” authorities to bi-communal contacts after the second half of 1996 by the imposition of restrictions and, indeed, prohibitions (§§ 368-69). In the instant case, between 2 February 1996 and 14 April 1998, the applicant was refused a permit every time he requested to cross over to southern Cyprus for the purpose of attending bi-communal meetings (ten in total)."

Thus, irrespective of the form they took and by whom they were organised, their aim was the same, namely, to bring into contact Turkish Cypriots living in the north and Greek Cypriots living in the south with a view to engaging in dialogue and exchanging ideas and opinions with the hope of securing peace on the island. In the light of this objective, whether or not the applicant was to participate in these meetings as the Turkish-Cypriot coordinator of the Movement for an Independent and Federal Cyprus is irrelevant for determining the question of freedom of assembly, given the ambit of the right guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention."

In view of the above, the Court considers that the refusals to grant permits to the applicant in order to cross into southern Cyprus in effect barred his participation in bi-communal meetings there, preventing him consequently from engaging in peaceful assembly with people from both communities.

An unqualified ban on services of worship in public places had been disproportionate. He further argued that the authority's apprehension that the peaceful assembly might disturb public order was unsubstantiated. In 1998 the church had held services in public in the town of Chekhov which had not caused any disturbances.

Greece, judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260 - A, p.18, § 33).

Turkey, no. 20652/92, § 56, ECHR 2003 ‑ III, and Kokkinakis, cited above, p. 17, § 31). As has been stated many times in the Court's judgments, not only is democracy a fundamental feature of the European public order but the Convention was designed to promote and maintain the ideals and values of a democratic society. Democracy, the Court has stressed, is the only political model contemplated in the Convention and the only one compatible with it. By virtue of the wording of the second paragraph of Article 11, and likewise of Article 9 of the Convention, the only necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of the rights enshrined in those Articles is one that may claim to spring from a “democratic society” (see Christian Democratic People's Party v.

In view of the essential nature of freedom of assembly and association and its close relationship with democracy there must be convincing and compelling reasons to justify an interference with this right (see Ouranio Toxo v.

The Court welcomes the amendment in 2004 of the law on public assemblies, to which the Government referred, whereby the requirement of prior authorisation was replaced by simple notification of the intended assembly. The Court notes, however, that these developments occurred after the events at issue in the present case. At the material time the conduct of public assemblies was regulated by the 1988 Decree, which gave the authorities power to ban assemblies deemed to be a threat to public order or the security of citizens. In the instant case the Town Council made use of that power and denied permission for the applicant's assembly. The Court accepts that the interference was “prescribed by law” and that it pursued “a legitimate aim” within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Articles 9 and 11, that of preventing disorder. It remains to be determined whether it was “necessary in a democratic society”."

The Court is not convinced by that argument."

In that context, it has held that although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of the majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, § 90, 17 February 2004 ). The Court further reiterates that in a democratic society, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place restrictions on the “freedom to manifest one's religion or belief” in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone's beliefs are respected. However, in exercising its regulatory power in this sphere and in its relations with the various religions, denominations and beliefs, the State has a duty to remain neutral and impartial. What is at stake here is the preservation of pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy, and the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others v. Moldova, no. 45701/99, § § 115 and 116, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII, with further references)."

In the light of the above principles, the Court emphasises that the mere fact that the Evangelical Christian religion was practised by a minority of the town residents was not capable of justifying an interference with the rights of followers of that religion (see, mutatis mutandis, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v. Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, § 89, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX ). It would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority. Were it so a minority group's rights to freedom of religion, expression and assembly would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective as required by the Convention (see Artico v. Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 15-16, § 33)."

There was no evidence that any of the participants would incite or resort to violence. Public disorder could thus only be caused by those members of the town population who were prepared to oppose forcefully the meeting of the Evangelical Christians in the town park and to force the followers of that religion out of the public arena by means of threats and violence. The Court stresses in this connection that freedom of assembly as enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention protects a demonstration that may annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote (see Stankov, cited above, § 90). The participants must be able to hold the demonstration without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents. It is thus the duty of Contracting States to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful demonstrations to proceed peacefully (see Plattform “Ärzte für das Leben” v. Austria, judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 139, p. 12, § § 32 and 34)."

However, there is no indication that an evaluation of the resources necessary for neutralising the threat was part of the domestic authorities'decision-making process. Instead of considering measures which could have allowed the applicant's religious assembly to proceed peacefully, the authorities imposed a ban on it. They resorted to the most radical measure, denying the applicant the possibility of exercising his rights to freedom of religion and assembly. It moreover appears from the wording of the refusal that the applicant's requests for permission to hold a service of worship in public had already been rejected on many occasions without detailed reasons (see paragraph 8 above). Such a comprehensive ban cannot be considered justified."

Finally, the Court is not convinced by the Government's argument that it was necessary to restrict the applicant's right to freedom of assembly and religion for the protection of those whom he was allegedly trying to convert. Under Article 9, freedom to manifest one's religion includes the right to try to convince one's neighbour, failing which, moreover, “ freedom to change one's religion or belief ”, enshrined in that Article, would be likely to remain a dead letter (see Kokkinakis, cited above, p. 17, § 3 1). It has not been shown that unlawful means of conversion, infringing the rights of others, have been or were likely to be employed by the applicant ( compare Stankov, cited above, § 105).

In 1878, when Bulgaria was partially liberated from Turkish dominance, the Berlin Peace Treaty left the region of Macedonia within the borders of Turkey. Between 1878 and 1913 the Bulgarian population of Macedonia organised five unsuccessful uprisings seeking liberation from Turkish rule and union with Bulgaria. There followed massive refugee migrations from the region to the Bulgarian motherland. Hundreds of thousands of Macedonian Bulgarians settled in Bulgaria.",

Before that no reliable historical source had ever mentioned any Slavic population in the region other than the Bulgarian population. After the Second World War the Communist power in Yugoslavia proclaimed the concept of a separate Macedonian nation. A separate language and alphabet were created and imposed by decree of 2 August 1944. A massive assimilation campaign accompanied by brutalities was launched in Yugoslavia. For a short period of time the Bulgarian Communist Party – inspired by the idea of creating a Bulgarian-Yugoslav federation – also initiated a campaign of forcible imposition of a ‘Macedonian’ identity on the population in the region of Pirin Macedonia. In the 1946 and 1956 censuses individuals living in that region were forced to declare themselves ‘Macedonians’. The campaign was abandoned in 1963, partly due to the refusal of the population to change their identity.",
                "In those parts of the geographical region of Macedonia which were in Yugoslavia the realities of the bi-polar cold-war world – where the relations between Yugoslavia and the socialist block dominated by the USSR were tense – exacerbated the population’s feeling of doom and exasperation and their fear that unification with Bulgaria proper would never be possible. The forcible imposition of a Macedonian identity by the Tito regime also played a decisive role.",

Were this so, a minority group's rights to freedom of religion, expression and assembly would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective as required by the Convention (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37, and Barankevich, cited above, § 31)."

Having noted that the Federal Law on Assemblies, Meetings, Demonstrations, Marches and Picketing ( “ the Assemblies Act ” ) did not provide for the possibility of banning the event, she stated that the authorities could suggest changing the venue or time or that, if the event turned out to be a real public threat, it could be interrupted.

It also noted that a public event could be held at any suitable venue unless it threatened to cause the collapse of buildings or constructions or entailed safety risks for its participants ( section 8). It then noted the organisers'right to hold the event at the venue and time indicated in the notice to the authorities, or at the venue and time agreed with the authorities if they had suggested a change, and stated that it was prohibited to hold the event if the notice had not been submitted on time or if the organisers had failed to agree to a change of venue or time proposed by the authorities ( section 5). Finally, the court noted that the organisers, officials or other individuals were prohibited from interfering with the expression of opinion by the participants in the public event unless they breached public order or contravened the format of the event ( section 18). It concluded on the basis of these provisions that the authorities could ban a public event on safety grounds and that it was for the organisers to submit a notice suggesting a change of venue and time for consideration by the authorities. It considered that the refusal to hold the event in the present case had legitimate grounds and that the applicant's right to hold assemblies and other public events had not been breached."

In the present case, the Government asserted that they could not have avoided banning the event, because no other measure could have adequately addressed the security risks.

They further noted that in the case of Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria (20 September 1994, §§ 52 and 56, Series A no. 295 ‑ A) the Court had recognised the great role of religion in people's everyday life, which should be taken into account in order to prevent religious beliefs from becoming the subject of unreasonable and insulting accusations. They concluded on that basis that the State must take into account the requirements of the major religious associations and that “the democratic State must protect society from destructive influence on its moral fundamentals, and protect the human dignity of all citizens, including believers ”. In the present case, the ideas of the event organisers were not neutral to the rest of society, but had actually encroached on the rights, lawful interests and human dignity of believers."

According to them, “[s]uch relations are allowed in some countries, in other countries they are considerably restricted”. For this reason they claimed that the domestic authorities were better informed as to what might insult believers in the respective communities. To illustrate this point they referred to the case of Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom (22 October 1981, §§ 56-58, Series A no. 45), in which the Court had discussed the diversity of moral and cultural values in the context of criminal liability for homosexual conduct, which had existed at the material time in Northern Ireland, while stressing that they did not adhere to the conclusion arrived at by the Court in that case. They also cited at length the case of Müller and Others v. Switzerland (24 May 1988, Series A no. 133), where the Court had upheld measures by the authorities restricting general access to an exhibition of paintings depicting “ crude sexual relations, particularly between people and animals”. They suggested that gay parades should be viewed from the same standpoint, taking into account the interests of involuntary spectators, especially children. In their opinion, any form of celebration of homosexual behaviour should take place in private or in designated meeting places with restricted access. They added that such clubs, bars and entertainment facilities existed aplenty in Moscow (listing twenty-four examples of such places) and were well frequented, their operation not being hindered by the authorities."

In the Government's view, in Moscow the public was not yet ready to accept the holding of gay parades in the city, unlike in Western countries, where such celebrations were regular occurrences. It was thus the authorities'duty to demonstrate sensitivity to the existing public resentment of any overt manifestation of homosexuality. To that end they quoted a Russian celebrity performer, whose stage image capitalised on exaggeration of homosexual stereotypes, as saying that gay parades should not be conducted. They also referred to a statement apparently made by an organisation called “The Union of Orthodox Citizens”, which promised to conduct a mass protest “should the homosexuals try to hold the march in Moscow ”. Likewise, the Orthodox Church was quoted as objecting to the gay parade as propaganda promoting sin, as had the Supreme Mufti for Russia, who had threatened mass protests by Muslims of Russia “as well as by all normal people” should the parade go ahead. They also quoted, although referring to his statement as extreme, the head Muslim authority of Nizhniy Novgorod, who had said that “as a matter of necessity, homosexuals must be stoned to death ”."

First, he disagreed that the ban on the public events he had sought to hold had been imposed in accordance with the law. He pointed out that neither the Assemblies Act nor any other legislative instrument provided for a ban on public events. The restrictions set out in section 8 ( 1 ) of the Act on holding events in venues which were unsuitable for safety reasons required the authorities to suggest another venue, as set out in section 12 of the Act, and not to ban the event. In any case, even if the Court were to accept that the alleged impossibility of avoiding public disorder at any venue could provide a justification for the ban under domestic law, the applicant maintained that the ban did not comply with two other requirements of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention, in that it had failed to pursue a legitimate aim and had not been necessary in a democratic society."

As regards the three legitimate aims referred to by the Government, namely the protection of public safety and the prevention of disorder, the protection of morals and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, the applicant considered all of them inapplicable. He argued that the reference to the protection of morals was not justified because the Government's definition of “morals” included only attitudes that were dominant in public opinion and did not encompass the notions of diversity and pluralism. Moreover, the events at issue could not by their nature affect morals because they had been intended as a demonstration in favour of human rights and civil liberties for the protection and equality of sexual minorities. No intention to demonstrate nudity or sexually explicit or provocative behaviour or material had ever been expressed by the organisers in their applications or public statements. The Government had not shown that any harm would have been caused to society or third persons by the proposed events. On the contrary, the applicant argued, the events would have been of benefit to Russian society by advocating the ideas of tolerance and respect for the rights of the lesbian and gay population."

As regards the potential riots to be caused by the counter-demonstrators, the Government had not at any stage assessed the scale of possible clashes with the events'opponents and therefore their argument of inability to provide sufficient protection to the gay parades was unsubstantiated. In the three reference years the applicant had submitted numerous applications suggesting different formats and venues for the events, and the authorities had never given reasons as to why it was not possible to make security arrangements for any of them."

He referred to the Court's established case - law, stating that the mere possibility of confusing and even shocking part of society could not be regarded as a sufficient ground for such a sweeping measure as a total ban on the events in question ( he referred to Bączkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, § 64, ECHR 2007 ‑ VI). He submitted that the measure repeatedly taken in the present case was gravely disproportionate to the aims allegedly pursued by the authorities and was incompatible with the notion of a democratic society which was “pluralistic, tolerant and broadminded” (ibid., § 63). He argued that the authorities had failed even to attempt to comply with their obligation under Article 11 to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful demonstrations to proceed peacefully. They had banned the events, which in their view were likely to be attacked, instead of protecting them. Moreover, they had endorsed the disapproval expressed by the events'opponents, claiming that they were immoral and thus depriving the minority of a lawful right to hold a peaceful demonstration, a right that was inherent in a society striving to be democratic."

There is accordingly no doubt that there has been an interference with the exercise of the applicant's freedom of peaceful assembly guaranteed by Article 11 § 1 of the Convention.

To the extent that these issues are relevant to the assessment of the proportionality of the interference they will be addressed in paragraphs 78-79 below (see Christian Democratic People's Party v.

As has been stated many times in the Court's judgments, not only is democracy a fundamental feature of the European public order but the Convention was designed to promote and maintain the ideals and values of a democratic society. Democracy, the Court has stressed, is the only political model contemplated in the Convention and the only one compatible with it. By virtue of the wording of the second paragraph of Article 11, and likewise of Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Convention, the only necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of the rights enshrined in those Articles is one that may claim to spring from a'democratic society'(see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, §§ 86-89, ECHR 2003-II, and Christian Democratic People's Party, [cited above] ).",
                "62. While in the context of Article 11 the Court has often referred to the essential role played by political parties in ensuring pluralism and democracy, associations formed for other purposes are also important to the proper functioning of democracy. For pluralism is also built on genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs and artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, § 92, ECHR 2004 -I ).",
                "63. Referring to the hallmarks of a'democratic society', the Court has attached particular importance to pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness. In that context, it has held that although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of the majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, § 63, and Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/95 and 28443/95, § 112, ECHR 1999-III).",

Austria (24 November 1993, § 38, Series A no. 276) the Court described the State as the ultimate guarantor of the principle of pluralism. Genuine and effective respect for freedom of association and assembly cannot be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere; a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the purpose of Article 11 nor with that of the Convention in general. There may thus be positive obligations to secure the effective enjoyment of these freedoms (see Wilson and the National Union of Journalists and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 306 68/96, 30671/96 and 30678/96, § 41, ECHR 2002-V, and Ouranio Toxo v Greece, no. 74989/01, § 37, ECHR 2005-X ).

Their first argument, which also formed the ground on which the events were banned by the domestic authorities, related to concerns for the participants'safety and to the prevention of disorder. They alleged that the Moscow authorities, having received numerous protest petitions, had realised that any such event would cause a large-scale controversy with various groups who objected to any demonstrations supporting or promoting the interests of lesbians, gays or other sexual minorities. The petitions cited by the Government (paragraph 62 above), however, were not all of identical gist. Some petitioners, such as the Orthodox Church, simply expressed their objection to the events and to the general idea of people being homosexual and identifying themselves as such. Others, such as the Supreme Mufti, informed the authorities of their intention to hold a protest against the events, whereas the senior Muslim authority in Nizhniy Novgorod threatened violence."

Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, § 86, ECHR 2001-IX). The participants must be able to hold the demonstration without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents.

The first group of petitions, calling for the events to be prohibited because the petitioners considered them immoral, without a threat of immediate counteraction at the site of the events, were irrelevant to safety considerations. They could only be taken into account for the purpose of restrictions to be imposed for the protection of morals, an issue that will be specifically addressed below."

The next group of petitions, indicating the authors'intention to engage in protest actions at the site of the events because they found them objectionable, should, on the contrary, have been carefully assessed from the standpoint of security arrangements. As a general rule, where a serious threat of a violent counter-demonstration exists, the Court has allowed the domestic authorities a wide discretion in the choice of means to enable assemblies to take place without disturbance (see Plattform “Ärzte für das Leben”, loc. cit. ). However, the mere existence of a risk is insufficient for banning the event: in making their assessment the authorities must produce concrete estimates of the potential scale of disturbance in order to evaluate the resources necessary for neutralising the threat of violent clashes (see Barankevich, cited above, § 33). In the present case, no preliminary assessment of the risks posed by counter-demonstrations had been carried out. The subsequent events revealed that there was a potential total of about a hundred counter-protesters, a figure that is significant but by no means overwhelming on the scale of a city such as Moscow. The Court observes, moreover, that only a few of the petitions cited by the Government expressed determination on the part of the counter- protesters to proceed by unlawful means. The Government did not make any submissions as to whether any of the petitioners had attempted to give notice of their counter- demonstration. Had they done so, the authorities could have made arrangements to ensure that both events proceeded peacefully and lawfully, allowing both sides to achieve the goal of expressing their views without clashing with each other. It was for the Moscow authorities to address potential counter-protesters – whether by making a public statement or by replying to their petitions individually – in order to remind them to remain within the boundaries of the law when carrying out any protest actions."

However, it does not appear that the authorities in the present case reacted to the cleric's call for violence in any other way than banning the event he condemned. By relying on such blatantly unlawful calls as grounds for the ban, the authorities effectively endorsed the intentions of persons and organisations that clearly and deliberately intended to disrupt a peaceful demonstration in breach of the law and public order."

In the light of the above findings, the Court concludes that the Government failed to carry out an adequate assessment of the risk to the safety of the participants in the events and to public order. It reiterates that if every probability of tension and heated exchange between opposing groups during a demonstration were to warrant its prohibition, society would be faced with being deprived of the opportunity of hearing differing views on any question which offends the sensitivity of the majority opinion ( see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 107). In the present case, the Court cannot accept the Government's assertion that the threat was so great as to require such a drastic measure as banning the event altogether, let alone doing so repeatedly over a period of three years. Furthermore, it appears from the public statements made by the mayor of Moscow, as well as from the Government's observations, that if security risks played any role in the authorities'decision to impose the ban, they were in any event secondary to considerations of public morals."

The Court further reiterates that it would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority. Were this so, a minority group's rights to freedom of religion, expression and assembly would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective as required by the Convention (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37, and Barankevich, cited above, § 31)."

                "82. In the present case, having carefully studied all the material before it, the Court does not find that the events organised by the applicant would have caused the level of controversy claimed by the Government. The purpose of the marches and picketing, as declared in the notices of the events, was to promote respect for human rights and freedoms and to call for tolerance towards sexual minorities. The events were to take the form of a march and picketing, with participants holding banners and making announcements through loudspeakers. At no stage was it suggested that the event would involve any graphic demonstration of obscenity of a type comparable to the exhibition in the case of Müller and Others (cited above) referred to by the Government. The applicant submitted, and it was not contested by the Government, that the participants had not intended to exhibit nudity, engage in sexually provocative behaviour or criticise public morals or religious views. Moreover, it transpires from the mayor's comments ( see, in particular, paragraphs 16 and 24 above) and the Government's observations (see paragraph 61 above) that it was not the behaviour or the attire of the participants that the authorities found objectionable but the very fact that they wished to openly identify themselves as gay men or lesbians, individually and as a group. The Government admitted, in particular, that the authorities would reach their limit of tolerance towards homosexual behaviour when it spilt over from the strictly private domain into the sphere shared by the general public (ibid., in fine )."

                "83. To justify this approach the Government claimed a wide margin of appreciation in granting civil rights to people who identify themselves as gay men or lesbians, citing the alleged lack of European consensus on issues relating to the treatment of sexual minorities. The Court cannot agree with that interpretation. There is ample case-law reflecting a long-standing European consensus on such matters as abolition of criminal liability for homosexual relations between adults (see Dudgeon, cited above; Norris v. Ireland, 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142; and Modinos v. Cyprus, 22 April 1993, Series A no. 259), homosexuals'access to service in the armed forces (see Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, ECHR 1999-VI), the granting of parental rights ( see Salgueiro da Silva Mouta v. Portugal, no. 33290/96, ECHR 1999-IX), equality in tax matters and the right to succeed to the deceased partner's tenancy ( see Karner v. Austria, no. 40016/98, ECHR 2003-IX ); more recent examples include equal ages of consent under criminal law for heterosexual and homosexual acts ( see L. and V. v. Austria, nos. 39392/98 and 39829/98, ECHR 2003-I). At the same time, there remain issues where no European consensus has been reached, such as granting permission to same-sex couples to adopt a child ( see Fretté v. France, no. 36515/97, ECHR 2002-I, and E.B. v. France [GC], no. 43546/02, ECHR 2008 ‑ ... ) and the right to marry, and the Court has confirmed the domestic authorities'wide margin of appreciation in respect of those issues. This, however, does not dispense the Court from the requirement to verify whether in each individual case the authorities did not overstep their margin of appreciation by acting arbitrarily or otherwise. Indeed, the Court has consistently held that the State's margin of appreciation goes hand in hand with European supervision (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24 ). The Government's reference to the concept of a “court of fourth instance” (see § 58 above) cannot prevent the Court from exercising its duties in that regard in accordance with the Convention and established case-law."
            ],
            [
                "84. In any event, the absence of a European consensus on these questions is of no relevance to the present case because conferring substantive rights on homosexual persons is fundamentally different from recognising their right to campaign for such rights. There is no ambiguity about the other member States'recognition of the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms, in particular by exercising their freedom of peaceful assembly. As the Government rightly pointed out, demonstrations similar to the ones banned in the present case are commonplace in most European countries. It is also worth noting that in the case of Bączkowski and Others it was the domestic authorities which first acknowledged the illegal nature of the ban initially imposed on similar marches, when the ban was quashed by the appeal court (cited above, § 22)."

It reiterates that any decision restricting the exercise of freedom of assembly must be based on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among other authorities, Christian Democratic People's Party, cited above, § 70). The only factor taken into account by the Moscow authorities was the public opposition to the event, and the officials'own views on morals."

The mayor of Moscow, whose statements were essentially reiterated in the Government's observations, considered it necessary to confine every mention of homosexuality to the private sphere and to force gay men and lesbians out of the public eye, implying that homosexuality was a result of a conscious, and antisocial, choice. However, they were unable to provide justification for such exclusion. There is no scientific evidence or sociological data at the Court's disposal suggesting that the mere mention of homosexuality, or open public debate about sexual minorities'social status, would adversely affect children or “vulnerable adults”. On the contrary, it is only through fair and public debate that society may address such complex issues as the one raised in the present case. Such debate, backed up by academic research, would benefit social cohesion by ensuring that representatives of all views are heard, including the individuals concerned. It would also clarify some common points of confusion, such as whether a person may be educated or enticed into or out of homosexuality, or opt into or out of it voluntarily. This was exactly the kind of debate that the applicant in the present case attempted to launch, and it could not be replaced by the officials spontaneously expressing uninformed views which they considered popular. In the circumstances of the present case the Court cannot but conclude that the authorities'decisions to ban the events in question were not based on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts."

Thus, the event intended to be held on 27 May 2006 had been banned by the first-instance court on 26 May 2006, only one day before the event. There had been no possibility of having the appeal against the first-instance judgment examined on the same day so that the event could have taken place had the final decision been favourable to the applicant. The notices he had submitted for the picketing had suffered a similar fate. The 2007 and 2008 applications had likewise been refused at final instance long after the intended dates of the events. The applicant further contended that there would have been no possibility of obtaining a final decision before the event in question even if the first-instance judgment had allowed the demonstration. A first-instance judgment, if not appealed against, entered into force ten days after the date of its adoption. This time-frame made it impossible for the organisers of an event, even with their best efforts and forward planning, to obtain a final decision before the scheduled date of the event, because neither the administrative authorities nor the courts were required to complete the proceedings before that date."

Where a difference of treatment is based on sex or sexual orientation the margin of appreciation afforded to the State is narrow, and in such situations the principle of proportionality does not merely require the measure chosen to be suitable in general for realising the aim sought; it must also be shown that it was necessary in the circumstances.

In principle, regulations of this nature should not represent a hidden obstacle to the freedom of peaceful assembly as it is protected by the Convention. It goes without saying that any demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life and encounter hostility. In the Court's opinion, it is important that preventive security measures such as, for example, the presence of first-aid services at the site of demonstrations, be taken in order to guarantee the smooth conduct of any event, meeting or other gathering, be it political, cultural or of another nature. This being so, associations and others organising demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, should respect the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force (see Oya Ataman, cited above, §§ 38 and 39)."

The police established a triple cordon of officers on Bolshoy Kammeny Bridge, which prevented any movement in the direction of the Kremlin. The first cordon was positioned close to the junction of Maly Kamenny Bridge and the Bolotnaya waterfront. Students from the Police College and officers of the Patrol Guard Service (without any protective equipment) made up this line. Behind them were two rows of OMON [riot police], a line of voluntary citizen patrol ( ‘ druzhinniki ’ ), and another cordon of OMON. A number of water cannons were visible between the second and third cordons.",

Moreover, just beyond Luzhkov Bridge, the marchers had to go through a second set of metal detectors, where progress was very slow since there were only 14 detectors.",

An estimated 50-200 people joined the sit-down protest. The leaders stressed the need to maintain a peaceful protest and appealed to demonstrators to remain calm. Participants chanted, ‘ We will not go away ’ and ‘ Police together with the people ’. The leaders attempted to address the crowds using loudspeakers, but those behind the sit-down protest could not hear or see events as they transpired. The sit-down protest did not completely block the road, but it did restrict the movement of those approaching the police lines and the bottleneck caused by the police cordon. As a result, the crowd grew denser as more demonstrators arrived from Bolshaya Yakimanka Street.",

In several places, the police cordon broke, and a few dozen people found themselves in the empty space behind the first police line. It is impossible to determine whether the [breaking of the cordon] was the result of conscious action by sections of the crowd or if the police cordon simply broke due to the pressure from such a large number of people.",

For much of the time, demonstrators and the police stood face to face without much happening. These moments were interspersed with periods when the police advanced and the crowd moved back. There does not appear to have been any clear reason for the police decision to advance other than to divide the crowd up into smaller sections. More than anything, the police advances served to raise tensions and provoke some members of the crowd to push back. There is little evidence that demonstrators initiated the violence. Rather, they appear to have become aggressive only in response to the authorities ’ advances.",

Ponomarev, a deputy of the State Duma, and another one by Mr A. Babushkin, President of the Public Supervisory Committee of Moscow. The complaints and enquiries concerned the allegedly unlawful acts of the police in dispersing the rally on 6 May 2012, including excessive use of force and arbitrary arrests. The Investigative Committee interviewed one of the ten individuals who had lodged the complaints and four police officers deployed in the cordon around Bolotnaya Square, including squadron and regiment commanders. They stated, in particular, that they had been acting under orders to maintain public safety and to identify and arrest the most active instigators of unrest; only those resisting the demands of the police had been arrested and no force had been used unnecessarily. The police officers stated that when the police had had to intervene, they had used combat manoeuvres and truncheons but not tear gas or other exceptional means of restraint.

When the march participants had filled nearly all of Bolotnaya Embankment, limited by the police cordon on one side and by the stage on the other side, the organisers were still at the point between Malyy Kamennyy Bridge, Bolotnaya Square, [the park] and the Udarnik cinema ...",

The police told them that they would not let anyone pass through to the Kremlin because the event was authorised to take place at Bolotnaya Square, where the stage had been specially set up, and they were told to proceed. After that, the organisers decided to call a sit-down protest and called upon those present to disobey the lawful orders of the police. After that, the meeting participants congregated opposite the Udarnik cinema, where after a while they attempted to break the cordon, which [the police] did not manage to prevent. Therefore the police began arresting those who had been most actively involved in breaking the cordon; they were put in a police van and then taken to police stations in Moscow. After the confrontation had been localised, the police officers slightly dispersed the crowd, having apprehended the most active perpetrators. From the very beginning of the sit-down protest the police requested the participants through loudspeakers to proceed to the stage, not to act on provocation and not to commit unlawful acts, but these requests had no effect and therefore [it was clear that] the breaking of the cordon had been organised. In suppressing it the police officers acted in coordination and concert. They did not use force or special means of restraint. However, the work of the officers charged with apprehending offenders did involve the use of force and special means of restraint, in so far as necessary, against persons putting up resistance.",

Bolotnaya Square is a traditional place for holding various opposition events. We all had a clear understanding what the route would be, where the stage would be, what the layout would be. We came there at that time for a rather traditional, customary event, the scenario of which was well-known to everybody ... two days beforehand the maps showing where people would assemble and the route of the march were published on the official [news] website RiaNovosti; they are still posted there. The map was published on the [police] website ‘ Petrovka, 38 ’ and this map is still posted there. Not only the organisers, but the participants too, they knew where they were going ... When we approached the venue of the meeting ... we saw that the map showing where people would assemble on the square had been essentially altered. It was quite different from the map of 4 February [2012], and, above all, different from the document which had been agreed with the Moscow mayor ’ s office and had been published on the website[s] RiaNovosti and ‘ Petrovka, 38 ’ ... [according to which] people were to assemble on Bolotnaya Embankment as well as in the park at Bolotnaya Square. However, when we came we saw that the park at Bolotnaya Square, taking up approximately 80% of the square, was barred and cordoned off ... since [the cordon] did not correspond [to the map] the column stopped. The event organisers and the people who came just waited for this question to be resolved, for the police to remove the wrong cordon, for the police chiefs to reply as to what had changed, why the approved meeting was not being conducted according to the scenario that had been approved ... I had previously [organised events] ... Somebody had taken the map and changed the location of the meeting. This had practically never happened before ... to show visually that we were not going anywhere, we sat on the ground ... the first line of [the police] cordon was composed of 20-year-old conscripts, and with a thousand people pressing on it the cordon broke. It could only break. This led to an uncontrollable situation, as several policemen were walking and trying to say something through megaphones – impossible to tell what they were saying. Some activists passing by were also speaking through megaphones – impossible to tell what they were saying. No authorities were present on the spot. And [it was] impossible to understand who was in command. So all of that caused the rupture of the police cordon. People started spreading across that spot ...Then I tried to walk over to the stage to try and explain to the gathering what was going on, using the amplifiers. I did not know then that the police had already cut off the amplifiers.",

All the [high-ranking] police officers were asked, but they only shrugged. Nobody could understand what was going on. The State Duma deputies present on the spot tried to act as negotiators, but ... they said that nobody wanted to come up to us. We could see some police officers resembling chiefs, at a distance ... but it was impossible to get to them ... it was impossible to reach the [police] command. Nobody would come to us. Nobody could negotiate despite everyone ’ s wish to do so.",

                "“The negotiations with the [mayor ’ s office] were very difficult this time ... I had been the organiser of most events from 25 December 2011. It was always possible to meet the deadline, to find a compromise, [but not this time]. ... It was [only] on 4 [May 2012] that we received the written agreement. On the same day the working meeting took place ... Usually, everything is decided no later than five days before the event. This time there was practically twenty-four hours ’ notice. We could not even bring the vehicles carrying the stage to the square before 1 p.m. [on 6 May 2012]. We were put under very harsh conditions ... we only had three hours to put up the stage ... At the [working meeting] technical issues were discussed, but for the previous events we held, as a matter of practice, [there was] an on-site reconnaissance: the representatives of the organisers [together with] the representatives of the police ... would visit the site, walk through the route and determine where the barriers would be put, the stage, the lavatories, so that there was no ambiguity in understanding how the event would unfold. This time, because [the working meeting] was on 4 [May 2012], and the event was on 6 [May 2012], it was already clear at the working meeting that we wouldn ’ t have time for an on-site reconnaissance; therefore at Mr Deynichenko ’ s suggestion it was stated that in organising the event we would follow the example of the assembly held on 4 February [2012]. Then, it was also a march from Kaluzhskaya Square and a meeting at Bolotnaya Square. The only thing that was noted was that this time the stage would be a bit closer to the park at Bolotnaya Square, at the corner of the square, because originally it had been declared that there would be 5,000 participants. We had a feeling that people were disappointed, somehow low-spirited, and that not many would come. When we realised that there would be more people I told Mr Oleynik [the First Deputy Director of the Regional Security Department], but he told us that it was unacceptable. But it was clear that we could not do anything about it. We warned that there would be significantly more participants ... When we called Mr Deynichenko the following day he told [us] that he had had a map drawn up by the Department of the Interior, and that Mr Udaltsov could come during the day to see it to clarify any issues. During the day he postponed the meeting several times and then he no longer answered the phone. Therefore it was not possible to see or discuss the map.",

Bolotnaya Square is an area comprising the park and Bolotnaya Embankment. It was supposed that people would ... turn [like before] towards the park. It was said that everything except the position of the stage, which would be 20 metres further forward, would be the same as [the last] time; this was expressly spelled out. We were guided by it.",

I learned that both [State Duma deputies] were conducting negotiations; I thought that it was probably going to settle this situation ... at a certain point Ms Mityushkina called me and said that the police were demanding to terminate the event.

I called Mr Udaltsov ... and said that we were coming, [that there was] no need to end anything. Actually, when I reached the corner the sit-in protest had already ended.

On the website of the Moscow Department of the Interior a map was posted showing the location of the police [cordon] and the access points. The map was in the public domain and one could see that the park of Bolotnaya Square should have been open. But it turned out to be closed. Moreover, we openly announced on the Internet, and it was reported in the media, that the route would be exactly the same as on 4 February 2012 ...

We easily turned into the square, there had been no scuffles ... we were sure that on 6 May 2012 it would be exactly the same picture ... but the police had deceived us, blocked Bolotnaya Square, having left a very narrow passage for the demonstrators.

We stopped, and to show the police that we were not going to storm the Kremlin and the [ Bolshoy ] Kamennyy Bridge we sat on the ground ...

He asked Mr Udaltsov regarding the intention to proceed towards the Kremlin and to cause mass disorder because the police had received information concerning it from undercover sources; Mr Udaltsov had assured him that there would be no breaches of order at the event and that they had no intention to approach the Kremlin ...

He had reached an agreement with the officers of the Moscow Department of the Interior that the cordon would be moved back, but the organisers who had filed the notice [of the event] should have signed the necessary documents.

He passed this information on to Mr Udaltsov by phone, [and he] replied that they were standing up and heading towards the stage ... he knew that on 6 May 2012 [some] citizens had brought several tents to Bolotnaya Square, but Mr Udaltsov had not informed him of the need to put up tents during the public event.",

                "Only peaceful assemblies are protected",
                "An assembly should be deemed peaceful if its organisers have professed peaceful intentions and the conduct of the assembly is non-violent. The term ‘ peaceful ’ should be interpreted to include conduct that may annoy or give offence, and even conduct that temporarily hinders, impedes or obstructs the activities of third parties.",

Such discussions might, for example, cover the deployment of law enforcement personnel, stewarding arrangements, and particular concerns relating to the policing operation.",
                "5.3 A human rights approach to policing assemblies",
                "The policing of assemblies must be guided by the human rights principles of legality, necessity, proportionality and non-discrimination and must adhere to applicable human rights standards. In particular, the State has a positive duty to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable peaceful assemblies to take place without participants fearing physical violence. Law enforcement officials must also protect participants of a peaceful assembly from any person or group (including agents provocateurs and counter-demonstrators) that attempts to disrupt or inhibit it in any way.",

                "If a standoff or other dispute arises during the course of an assembly, negotiation or mediated dialogue may be an appropriate means of trying to reach an acceptable resolution. Such dialogue – whilst not always successful – can serve as a preventive tool helping to avoid the escalation of conflict, the imposition of arbitrary or unnecessary restrictions, or recourse to the use of force.",
                "15. ... For the purposes of the Guidelines, an assembly means the intentional and temporary presence of a number of individuals in a public place for a common expressive purpose.",
                "18. The question of at what point an assembly can no longer be regarded as a temporary presence (thus exceeding the degree of tolerance presumptively to be afforded by the authorities towards all peaceful assemblies) must be assessed in the individual circumstances of each case. ... Where an assembly causes little or no inconvenience to others then the authorities should adopt a commensurately less stringent test of temporariness ... the term ‘ temporary ’ should not preclude the erection of protest camps or other non-permanent constructions.",
                "‘ Peaceful ’ and ‘ non-peaceful ’ assemblies",
                "25. ’ Peaceful ’ assemblies: Only ‘ peaceful ’ assembly is protected by the right to freedom of assembly. ...",
                "26. The term ‘ peaceful ’ should be interpreted to include conduct that may annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote, and even conduct that temporarily hinders, impedes or obstructs the activities of third parties. Thus, by way of example, assemblies involving purely passive resistance should be characterized as ‘ peaceful ’ ...",
                "28. If this fundamental criterion of ‘ peacefulness ’ is met, it triggers the positive obligations entailed by the right to freedom of peaceful assembly on the part of the State authorities ... It should be noted that assemblies that survive this initial test (thus, prima facie, deserving protection) may still legitimately be restricted on public order or other legitimate grounds ...",
                "38. To aid certainty, any prior restrictions should be formalised in writing and communicated to the organiser of the event within a reasonable timeframe (see further paragraph 135 below). Furthermore, the relevant authorities must ensure that any restrictions imposed during an event are in full conformity with the law and consistent with established jurisprudence. Finally, the imposition, after an assembly, of sanctions and penalties which are not prescribed by law is not permitted.",
                "95. Whether behaviour constitutes the intentional incitement of violence is inevitably a question which must be assessed on the particular circumstances. Some difficulty arises where the message concerns unlawful activity, or where it could be construed as inciting others to commit non-violent but unlawful action. Expressing support for unlawful activity can, in many cases, be distinguished from disorderly conduct, and should not therefore face restriction on public order grounds. The touchstone must again be the existence of an imminent threat of violence.",
                "96. ... resort to [hate] speech by participants in an assembly does not of itself necessarily justify the dispersal of the event, and law enforcement officials should take measures (such as arrest) only against the particular individuals involved (either during or after the event).",
                "Restrictions imposed during an assembly",
                "108. The role of the police or other law enforcement personnel during an assembly will often be to enforce any prior restrictions imposed in writing by the regulatory body. No additional restrictions should be imposed by law enforcement personnel unless absolutely necessary in light of demonstrably changed circumstances. On occasion, however, the situation on the ground may deteriorate (participants, for example, might begin using or inciting imminent violence), and the authorities may have to impose further measures to ensure that other relevant interests are adequately safeguarded. In the same way that reasons must be adduced to demonstrate the need for prior restrictions, any restrictions imposed in the course of an assembly must be equally rigorously justified. Mere suspicions will not suffice, and the reasons must be both relevant and sufficient. In such circumstances, it will be appropriate for other civil authorities (such as an Ombudsman ’ s office) to have an oversight role in relation to the policing operation, and law enforcement personnel should be accountable to an independent body. Furthermore ... unduly broad discretionary powers afforded to law enforcement officials may breach the principle of legality given the potential for arbitrariness. The detention of participants during an assembly (on grounds of their committing administrative, criminal or other offences) should meet a high threshold given the right to liberty and security of person and the fact that interferences with freedom of assembly are inevitably time sensitive. Detention should be used only in the most pressing situations when failure to detain would result in the commission of serious criminal offences.",
                "Decision-making and review process",
                "132. The regulatory authority ... should fairly and objectively assess all available information to determine whether the organisers and participants of a notified assembly are likely to conduct the event in a peaceful manner, and to ascertain the probable impact of the event on the rights and freedoms of other non-participant stakeholders. In doing so, it may be necessary to facilitate meetings with the event organiser and other interested parties.",
                "133. The regulatory authority should also ensure that any relevant concerns raised are communicated to the event organiser, and the organiser should be offered an opportunity to respond to any concerns raised. This is especially important if these concerns might later be cited as the basis for imposing restrictions on the event. Providing the organiser with such information allows them the opportunity to address the concerns, thus diminishing the potential for disorder and helping foster a cooperative, rather than confrontational, relationship between the organisers and the authorities.",
                "134. Assembly organisers, the designated regulatory authorities, law enforcement officials, and other parties whose rights might be affected by an assembly, should make every effort to reach mutual agreement on the time, place and manner of an assembly. If, however, agreement is not possible and no obvious resolution emerges, negotiation or mediated dialogue may help reach a mutually agreeable accommodation in advance of the notified date of the assembly. Genuine dialogue between relevant parties can often yield a more satisfactory outcome for everyone involved than formal recourse to the law. The facilitation of negotiations or mediated dialogue can usually best be performed by individuals or organisations not affiliated with either the State or the organiser. The presence of parties ’ legal representatives may also assist in facilitating discussions between the assembly organiser and law enforcement authorities. Such dialogue is usually most successful in establishing trust between parties if it is begun at the earliest possible opportunity. Whilst not always successful, it serves as a preventive tool helping to avoid the escalation of conflict or the imposition of arbitrary or unnecessary restrictions.",
                "135. Any restrictions placed on an assembly should be communicated in writing to the event organiser with a brief explanation of the reason for each restriction (noting that such explanation must correspond with the permissible grounds enshrined in human rights law and as interpreted by the relevant courts). The burden of proof should be on the regulatory authority to show that the restrictions imposed are reasonable in the circumstances. Such decisions should also be communicated to the organiser within a reasonable timeframe – i.e. sufficiently far in advance of the date of a proposed event to allow the decision to be judicially appealed to an independent tribunal or court before the notified date of the event.",
                "136. The regulatory authority should publish its decisions so that the public has access to reliable information about events taking place in the public domain. This might be done, for example, by posting decisions on a dedicated web-site.",
                "147. Governments must ensure that law enforcement officials receive adequate training in the policing of public assemblies. Training should equip law enforcement agencies to act in a manner that avoids escalation of violence and minimises conflict, and should include ‘ soft skills ’ such as negotiation and mediation. ...",
                "149. Law enforcement agencies should be proactive in engaging with assembly organizers: [o] fficers should seek to send clear messages that inform crowd expectations and reduce the potential for conflict escalation ... Furthermore, there should be a nominated point of contact within the law enforcement agency whom protesters can contact before or during an assembly. These contact details should be widely advertised.",
                "150. The policing operation should be characterized by a policy of ‘ no surprises ’ : [l] aw enforcement officers should allow time for people in a crowd to respond as individuals to the situation they face, including any warnings or directions given to them.",
                "157. Using mediation or negotiation to de-escalate tensions during an assembly: [ i ]f a standoff or dispute arises during the course of an assembly, negotiation or mediated dialogue may be an appropriate means of trying to reach an acceptable resolution.",
                "159. Law enforcement officials should differentiate between peaceful and non ‑ peaceful participants: [ n]either isolated incidents of sporadic violence, nor the violent acts of some participants in the course of a demonstration, are themselves sufficient grounds to impose sweeping restrictions on peaceful participants in an assembly. Law enforcement officials should not therefore treat a crowd as homogenous if detaining participants or (as a last resort) forcefully dispersing an assembly.",
                "164. Policing peaceful assemblies that turn into non-peaceful assemblies: [a] ssemblies can change from being peaceful to non-peaceful and thus forfeit the protection afforded under human rights law ... Such an assembly may thus be terminated in a proportionate manner. However, the use of violence by a small number of participants in an assembly (including the use of inciting language) does not automatically turn an otherwise peaceful assembly into a non-peaceful assembly, and any intervention should aim to deal with the particular individuals involved rather than dispersing the entire event.",
                "165. Dispersal of assemblies: [s]o long as assemblies remain peaceful, they should not be dispersed by law enforcement officials. Indeed, dispersal of assemblies should be a measure of last resort and should be governed by prospective rules informed by international standards. These rules need not be elaborated in legislation, but should be expressed in domestic law enforcement guidelines, and legislation should require that such guidelines be developed. Guidelines should specify the circumstances that warrant dispersal, and who is entitled to make dispersal orders (for example, only police officers of a specified rank and above).",
                "166. Dispersal should not occur unless law enforcement officials have taken all reasonable measures to facilitate and protect the assembly from harm (including, for example, quieting hostile onlookers who threaten violence), and unless there is an imminent threat of violence.",
                "167. Dispersal should not therefore result where a small number of participants in an assembly act in a violent manner. In such instances, action should be taken against those particular individuals. Similarly, if ‘ agents provocateurs ’ infiltrate an otherwise peaceful assembly, the authorities should take appropriate action to remove the ‘ agents provocateurs ’ rather than terminating or dispersing the assembly, or declaring it to be unlawful ...",
                "168. If dispersal is deemed necessary, the assembly organiser and participants should be clearly and audibly informed prior to any intervention by law enforcement personnel. Participants should also be given reasonable time to disperse voluntarily. Only if participants then fail to disperse may law enforcement officials intervene further.",

They pointed out that the Moscow authorities and the event organisers had worked out the terms of the public assembly in their written exchange and in person at the working meeting on 4 May 2012. However, the police had suspected the protesters of intending to act in breach of the agreed terms, and on 5 May 2012 the prosecutor ’ s office had issued the organisers with a warning to that effect. At the same time, the police had developed a detailed security plan providing for the necessary security measures (see paragraphs 16 et seq. above)."

They had disregarded the police instructions to proceed to the designated venue at Bolotnaya Embankment, even though the venue had been accessible, and had sat on the ground, causing scuffles and disorder. According to the Government, two State Duma deputies, the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation and a member of the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation had supported the police ’ s demands and tried to convince the protesters to follow the route, to no avail. Then, at 6 p.m. one of the organisers, acting at the request of the police, had announced the early termination of the meeting; from 5.58 p.m. to 7 p.m. some of the protesters had attempted to break the police cordon and had thrown various objects at the police. From 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. the police had gradually forced the protesters to leave and had arrested those who put up the most active resistance. The Government submitted that the intervention of the police had been justified since the assembly had ceased to be “peaceful” within the meaning of Article 11 of the Convention. In dispersing the protesters, the police had not resorted to excessive force: only police truncheons had been used; only the most aggressive perpetrators had been targeted; and no tear gas or smoke bombs had been deployed."

Secondly, he argued that the authorities had unilaterally altered the original meeting layout without informing the organisers or the public. He contended that the restriction of the area had had no purpose other than to prevent the possibility of tents being erected in the park. Rather than serving to prevent public disorder, that restriction had created a bottleneck at the entrance to the meeting venue and had caused tension resulting in a spontaneous sit-in by a small number of participants, including the organisers.

In any event, he denied that the assembly had ceased to be peaceful, despite numerous incidents of confrontation with the police. No confrontations had taken place within the authorised perimeter in front of the stage. Overall, he argued that the response by the police had been uncoordinated and disproportionate and that it had had the effect of escalating the confrontation rather than defusing it. The immense number of police officers and extensive crowd-control resources deployed at the site of the assembly should have allowed the authorities to ensure the peaceful continuation of the meeting, but they had chosen to terminate it instead.

He further complained that the domestic courts had taken no account of his arguments and exonerating evidence and had imposed the most severe penalty possible.

The right to freedom of assembly, one of the foundations of a democratic society, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. In examining whether restrictions to the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered “necessary in a democratic society” the Court has, however, consistently held that the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation (see Barraco v. France, no. 31684/05, § 42, 5 March 2009). It is, in any event, for the Court to give a final ruling on the restriction ’ s compatibility with the Convention and this is to be done by assessing the circumstances of a particular case (see Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( dec. ), no. 50841/99, ECHR 2001-X, and Galstyan v.

The limits of tolerance expected towards an unlawful assembly depend on the specific circumstances, including the duration and the extent of public disturbance caused by it, and whether its participants had been given sufficient opportunity to manifest their views (see Cisse v.

The Government contended that on that day the assembly leaders had intended to take the march outside the designated area, to set up a protest campsite and, possibly, to hold an unauthorised assembly near the Kremlin. When they were barred by the police cordon, the organisers called for a sit-in and encouraged assaults on the police cordon.

They denied that it had been their original intention to go outside the designated meeting area; conversely, the sit-in was a reaction to the authorities ’ unilateral change of the meeting layout. The protesters sat on the ground in an attempt to negotiate a passage through the park at Bolotnaya Square, which they considered to be a part of the agreed meeting venue, but the authorities showed no willingness to negotiate or even to communicate with them. From this point of view, the ensuing breaking of the cordon and confrontations were a consequence of the authorities ’ uncooperative conduct.

They had suspected the opposition activists of plotting a popular uprising, starting with unlawful public assemblies and setting up campsites supposedly inspired by the “Occupy” movement and similar to the “ Maidan ” protest in Ukraine (see the testimonies of Mr Deynichenko, Mr Zdorenko, Mr Makhonin and Ms Volondina, paragraph 63 above).

Before deciding on the role of undeclared goals, whether on the part of the organisers or the authorities, the Court will comment on the formal reasons for the decisions taken when the assembly was being organised. On the face of it, the decision to close the park to the rally does not appear in itself hostile or underhand vis-à-vis the organisers, given that the embankment was large enough to accommodate the assembly, even with a significant margin for exceeding the expected number of participants. According to the statement of the Moscow Regional Department of Security (see paragraph 63 above), the maximum capacity of the Bolotnaya Embankment was around 26,000 people. It was therefore large enough not only for the originally declared 5,000 participants, or the officially recorded turnout of 8,000, but even for the organisers ’ retrospective estimate of 25,000.

When cross-examined, Mr Deynichenko and Mr Sharapov stated that the inclusion of the park had not been requested or discussed.

Firstly, the official boundary of Bolotnaya Square comprised the park, as confirmed by the expert witnesses N. and M., as well as the head of Yakimanka district municipality of Moscow.

The independent observers from the Ombudsman ’ s office who had been involved in the negotiations explained that the protesters, faced with the narrowed-down passage, had demanded that it be widened.

Nevertheless, the same sources made it clear that with only twenty to fifty people sitting on the ground, the sit-in remained localised and left sufficient space for those wishing to pass. It is beyond doubt that the sit-in was strictly peaceful.

                "127. The Court ’ s findings in the foregoing paragraphs lead to the conclusion that the police authorities had not provided for a reliable channel of communication with the organisers before the assembly. This omission is striking, given the general thoroughness of the security preparations for anticipated acts of defiance on the part of the assembly leaders. Furthermore, the authorities failed to respond to the real-time developments in a constructive manner. In the first fifteen minutes after the march ’ s arrival at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge, no official took any interest in talking to the march leaders showing signs of distress in front of the police cordon. Eventually, when the sit-in began, they sent the Ombudsman with a message to the leaders to stand up and move on, which did not answer the protesters ’ concerns. Whether or not the senior police officers beyond the cordon had initially understood the demands of the sit-in leaders, there was nothing preventing them from immediately clarifying the issue and from giving them a clear answer."

In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that in the present case the authorities made insufficient efforts to communicate with the assembly organisers to resolve the tension caused by the confusion regarding the venue layout.

It considers, however, that it is unnecessary to define the standard required in relation to the Guidelines or otherwise. The Court considers that from any point of view the authorities in this case did not comply with even the minimum requirements in their duty to communicate with the assembly leaders, which was an essential part of their positive obligation to ensure the peaceful conduct of the assembly, to prevent disorder and to secure the safety of all the citizens involved."

The subsequent events developed simultaneously on two opposite sides of Bolotnaya Square. Congestion occurred at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge at 5.50 p.m., at which point the protesters ended the sit-in and left for the stage. At 5.55 p.m. the pressure of the crowd caused the cordon to break, but it was quickly restored without the use of force, and in the next few minutes protesters from among the crowd began tossing various objects at the police cordon, including a Molotov cocktail. At the same time, at 6 p.m., at the far end of Bolotnaya Square Ms Mityushkina, acting on the instructions of Colonel Makhonin, announced from the stage that the meeting was over. In the next fifteen minutes several confrontations took place between the protesters and the police at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge until, at 6.15 p.m., the police began expansive action to disperse the crowd there."

It is also unclear exactly what prompted that decision, although some witnesses suggested that it was because of the sit-in. The fact that at 5.55 p.m. the authorities were threatening the assembly leaders with criminal sanctions corroborates that hypothesis (see paragraph 34 above). It is clear, in any event, that at 6 p.m. when the announcement was made, the crowd had built up, and there had been squeezing and pushing and isolated incidents of small-scale aggression at the cordon at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge, but no widespread disorder or intensive fighting."

According to the authorities, at that stage it was justified to announce an emergency termination under section 17.3, which curtails the termination procedure in the event of mass disorder. The Court considers that, irrespective of whether the domestic requirements for “mass disorder” had been met, the tensions were still localised at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge while the rest of the venue remained calm. The authorities have not shown that, prior to declaring the whole meeting over, they had attempted to separate the turbulent sector and target the problems there, so as to enable the meeting to continue in the sector of the stage where the situation remained peaceful. The Court is therefore not convinced that the termination of the meeting at Bolotnaya Square was inevitable."

However, even assuming that the decision to terminate the assembly was taken because of a real and imminent risk that violence would spread and intensify, and that the authorities acted within the margin of appreciation which is to be allowed in such circumstances, that decision could have been implemented in different ways and using various methods. Given the diversity in the circumstances of the individual protesters, in particular the degree of their involvement or non ‑ involvement in clashes and the wide range of consequences faced by them, it is impossible to give a general assessment of the police conduct in dispersing the assembly at Bolotnaya Square. For this reason, the Court will abstain from analysing the manner in which the police dispersed the protesters at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge, as it falls outside the scope of the applicant ’ s case. The Court will examine the actions taken against the applicant personally, and in doing so it will take into account the general situation in his immediate vicinity, that is, the area in front of the stage inside the designated meeting area at Bolotnaya Embankment."

Given the benign character of their protests, the police did not use force against those protesters to the same extent as they did at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge.

For the purposes of its analysis under Article 11, it is sufficient to note that, even if the applicant was on the wrong side of the time-limit, measures taken after an assembly has ended fall, as a general rule, within the scope of Article 11 of the Convention as long as there is a link between the exercise of the freedom of peaceful assembly by the applicant and the measures taken against him (see Ezelin, cited above, § 41, and Navalnyy and Yashin, cited above, § 52). Accordingly, in the circumstances of this case, even after the assembly was officially terminated, the guarantees of Article 11 continued to apply in respect of the applicant, notwithstanding the clashes at Malyy Kamennyy Bridge. It follows that any measures taken against him in the given situation had to have complied with the law, pursued a legitimate aim and been necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 of the Convention."

At the same time, the Court observes, and the Government have insisted on this point, that the applicant was not arrested and punished for breaching the rules on public assemblies. Even if his presence at the meeting venue after its termination were to be considered a manifestation of his objection to the early termination of the assembly, that was not the offence with which he was charged. According to the domestic courts and the Government ’ s submissions, he was arrested, detained and sentenced to fifteen days ’ imprisonment because he was obstructing traffic and disobeyed lawful police orders to stop doing so."

His motives for walking on the road and obstructing the traffic are left unexplained by the domestic judgments; the applicant ’ s explanation that there was no traffic and that he was simply not quick enough to leave the venue in the general confusion has not been contested or ruled out. Therefore, even assuming that the applicant ’ s arrest, pre-trial detention and administrative sentence complied with domestic law and pursued one of the legitimate aims enumerated in Article 11 § 2 of the Convention – presumably, public safety – the measures taken against him were grossly disproportionate to the aim pursued. There was no “pressing social need” to arrest the applicant and to escort him to the police station. There was especially no need to sentence him to a prison term, albeit a short one."

Furthermore, the list of exceptions to the right to liberty secured in Article 5 § 1 of the Convention is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty (see Giulia Manzoni v.

The Court observes that the applicant ’ s conviction for the administrative offence of disobeying lawful police orders was based on the following written documents: ( i ) the police report drawn up by two officers, Y. and A., whose orders the applicant had allegedly disobeyed and who had arrested him; the explanatory note by Y. reproducing the content of the police report; (iii) the statement on the administrative offence, which was produced at the police station by an on-duty officer on the basis of the aforementioned police report and reiterating it word-by-word; (iv) the escorting order; and (v) the detention order of 6 May 2012. The Court observes that the police report was drawn up using a template and contained no individualised information except the applicant ’ s name, the names and titles of the arresting officers and the time and place of the arrest. The report indicated that the applicant had been arrested at 9.30 p.m. for obstructing traffic, whereas the statement on the administrative offence indicated that he had been arrested at 8.30 p.m."

The applicant contested the accusations and contended that he had been arrested during the authorised time slot of the public assembly and that there had been no traffic there that he could possibly have obstructed. Three eyewitnesses confirmed his allegations; one of them had not been previously acquainted with the applicant and had no personal interest in the outcome of the administrative proceedings against him. Furthermore, the applicant had submitted a video recording, which the court rejected. Lastly, the court refused to call and examine the two police officers as witnesses, although there had been no impediment to its doing so, and the applicant was not given any other opportunity to confront them."

The courts based their judgment exclusively on standardised documents submitted by the police and refused to accept additional evidence or to call the police officers. The Court considers that given the dispute over the key facts underlying the charge, where the only evidence against the applicant came from the police officers who had played an active role in the contested events, it was indispensable for the domestic courts to exhaust every reasonable possibility of scrutinising their incriminating statements (see Kasparov and Others, cited above, § 64)."

Russia, no. 35082/04, § 82, 26 July 2007). They thus punished the applicant for actions protected by the Convention without requiring the police to justify the interference with his right to freedom of assembly, which included a reasonable opportunity to disperse when such an order was given. The failure to do so ran contrary to the fundamental principles of criminal law, namely in dubio pro reo (see, mutatis mutandis, Barberà, Messegué and Jabardo v. Spain, 6 December 1988, § 77, Series A no. 146; Lavents v.

The Court points out that the right to form an association is an inherent part of the right set forth in Article 11, even if that Article only makes express reference to the right to form trade unions. That citizens should be able to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned. Certainly States have a right to satisfy themselves that an association’s aim and activities are in conformity with the rules laid down in legislation, but they must do so in a manner compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions.",

In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 22, §§ 46 and 47)."

Now that the words [the defence of national independence] that constituted the ground on which the aforementioned application was dismissed as being contrary to law have been deleted, a fresh application has been made for recognition of the association in question. Some of the founder members of the association who are on the provisional management committee … have engaged in promoting the idea that there is a Macedonian minority in Greece (see, for example, the newspapers Makhitis, Ellinikos Voras, Nea and Stokhos of 28 June 1990, 24 June 1990, 18 June 1990 and 28 June 1990 respectively); these newspapers strengthen the Court all the more in its previous opinion as none of the applicants has so far cast any doubt on the matters set out in these newspapers …, namely that they travelled to Copenhagen on 9 June 1990 and took part in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), where they maintained that there was a Macedonian minority in Greece and even congratulated Professor Ataov, a Turk, who read out a text containing provocative and unacceptable allegations against Greece. One of the members of the provisional management committee, Mr Constantinos Gotsis, refused, in the course of proceedings in the Florina Court of First Instance against the publisher of the newspaper Stokhos, to accept that he was Greek… Besides, sixteen founder members of the above-mentioned association reportedly contributed money so that Christos Sidiropoulos and Stavros Anastassiadis could go to Copenhagen to defend their ideas… On the basis of the foregoing circumstances, which have been proved, the Court considers that the true object of the aforementioned association is not the one indicated in clause 2 of the memorandum of association but the promotion of the idea that there is a Macedonian minority in Greece, which is contrary to the country’s national interest and consequently contrary to law.",

In view of the strong public interest at stake, the court, when examining the grounds of an application being heard under the special procedure, as in the present case, may and indeed must take into consideration, of its own motion, matters over and above the evidence submitted to the court by the parties – in particular, real events and situations reported in publications (books, magazines, newspapers, etc.) accessible to any interested person – and this notwithstanding the ordinary rules on the burden of proof. On the basis of the well-known facts set out below, whose validity the Court does not doubt, the Court accepts the following in relation to the case. Ancient (classical) Macedonia is delimited to the south by the Aegean Sea and the Kamvounia, Pieria and Olympus mountains; to the north by Lake Ohrid, the Prespa lakes, and the Babuna-Skomion ( Rila Planina ) and Rhodope mountains; to the east by the river Nestos; and to the west by Mount Grammos and the Pindus range (see: Makedonia, Ekdotiki Athinon, pp. 10 et seq.; A. Vakalopoulos, Synchrona Valkanika Ethnologika Provlimata, p. II; G. Mintsis, Istoria tou Makedonikou Zetematos, p. 29). Its inhabitants (the Macedonians) were one of the most ancient Greek tribes, closely related to the Thessalians, who were also of Aeolian origin, and especially to the Magnesians. Their language was one of the oldest Greek dialects, akin to Aeolian and Arcado -Cyprian and also to the Mycenean dialect. Their religion was that common to the Greeks and their myths and traditions were similar to those elsewhere in the Greek world (see H.G. Wells, The Outline of History, trans. K. Yeroyannis as Pankosmios Istoria, Pergaminai, Chapter B 1, p. 439, and Chapter I, p. 367; Will Durant, Pankosmios Istoria tou Politismou, ed. A. Daskalakis, 1965, p. 483V; Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Maties stin Pankosmia Istoria, trans. P. Drakou, Faros, 1954, p. 25; A. Vakalopoulos, op. cit., pp. 14 et seq.; M.

Andriotis, The Language and the Greek Origin of the Ancient Macedonians, Salonika, 1978). The Macedonian kings Philip II and Alexander the Great acted not just as Greeks but as pan-Hellenists, in the sense that they incarnated the old idea of the creation of a unified Greek State by bringing together the smaller Greek territories; they were bearers, and the latter was a disseminator, not of an incomplete Macedonian civilisation but of Greek civilisation (see Johann Gustav Droysen, Istoria tou Megalou Alexandrou, trans. with commentary etc. by Renos Apostolidis, 1988, pp. 1–9 and 28 et seq.; Istoria tou Ellinikou Ethnous, Ekdotiki Athinon, vol. D, pp. 10 et seq.). And in later years, especially after the appearance in the Balkans of the Bulgars and Slavs (6th–7th cent. A.D.), the Macedonian region as defined above was a stronghold and bastion of Hellenism just as it had been in ancient times. Polybius describes Macedonia as a ‘shield’ and praises the Macedonians because they fought the barbarians (non-Greeks) to ensure the safety of the (other) Greeks (Polybius, Historiae, Leipzig edition, 1898, vol. 3, book 9, p. 35). For the Byzantine period the same is affirmed by the French historian Paul Lemerle in his classic work Philippe et la Macédoine orientale, Paris, 1945, pp. 516–17. In addition, a guide to Salonika written by German historians and archaeologists during the last world war states that ‘the waves of migrating peoples which frequently swamped the Balkan peninsula broke on this most powerful bastion of Hellenism’ (see A. Vakalopoulos, op. cit., pp. 17 et seq.). Nowhere in either the recent or the distant past are Macedonia and the Macedonians mentioned in any official document as a specific ethnic group. The Treaty of Berlin, and the Treaty of San Stefano which it replaced, make no reference to such a notion. In the official Turkish census of 1905 there is mention of Greeks and Bulgarians, or inhabitants whose identity was partly Bulgarian, in the vilayets of Salonika and Monastir, where there were Greek ethnic majorities; but no mention of Macedonians, since nobody declared such descent (A. Vakalopoulos, op. cit., pp. 84 et seq.; G. Roussos, Neoteri Istoria tou Ellinikou Ethnous, vol. 5, pp. 83 et seq., which includes a reproduction of the census tables). In his work Voyage dans la Macédoine (Paris, 1831) E.M. Cousinery, the French Consul in Salonika, says that the Bulgarians (as all speakers of Slavic were then called) never penetrated the forests beyond Vermion, where the population remained Greek (see vol. 1, pp. 67–68, and vol. 2, p. 140). With reference to the same area, the German geographer Leonard D. Schultze observes that in their language, traditions, cultural affinities, ethnic preferences and religion, its inhabitants are as legitimately and authentically Greek as their brothers further to the south ( Macedonien Landschafts - und Kulturbilder, Jena, 1927, p. 106). He reiterates the words of Lord Salisbury, Great Britain’s representative at the Congress of Berlin, on 19 June 1878, when he said that ‘Macedonia and Thrace are just as Greek as Crete’ (K. Vavouskos, op. cit., p. 84). The fact that a small part of this region’s population also speaks a language which is basically a form of Bulgarian with admixtures of Slavic, Greek, Vlach and Albanian words, does not prove that this minority is of Slavic or Bulgarian origin; in isolation this criterion is of no value whatsoever, as is borne out by the experience in the recent past of the forced migration from Asia Minor to Greece of populations which were indisputably Greek but totally ignorant of the Greek language. It is indicative that among the fighters of the Macedonian campaign (1904–08) there were men who spoke the Bulgarian-Slav dialect but who had a purely Greek national consciousness; for example Kotas, Dalipis, Kyrou, Gonos and others. In his Short History of the Bulgarian, Serb and Romanian Orthodox Churches (Moscow 1871), the Russian historian E. Golubinstii wrote of these non-Greek-speaking Greeks that they had an implacable hatred of and scorn for all Slavs and Bulgarians (see K. Vavouskos, op. cit., pp. 85 et seq.). After the Balkan Wars of 1912–13, 51.57% of the region corresponding to ancient Macedonia was under Greek domination, 38.32% under Yugoslav domination, and 10.11% under Bulgarian domination (see Makedonia, Ekdotiki Athinon, p. 504, which includes a map). In this way a territorial status came into being. There were exchanges of population, either voluntary or following bilateral agreements such as the Kafantari-Molov agreement between Greece and Bulgaria in 1926; and Greeks from Turkey populated the Greek part of Macedonia, so that only Greeks remained in this part of Macedonia, even if some of them were bilingual. Greek Macedonia thus became a completely homogeneous part of Greek territory (see K. Vavouskos, op. cit., p. 92; and A. Vakalopoulos, op. cit., p. 31, who refers to the work of the German Stephan Ronart, Griechenland von heute ). This was especially true in the period immediately following the Second World War (1945–49), when almost all the bilingual inhabitants of this region who did not have a Greek national consciousness emigrated to neighbouring countries (see E. Kofos, Nationalism and Communism in Macedonia, Salonika, 1964, pp. 185 et seq.). There they experienced a mutation of their partly Greek or partly Bulgarian nationality into a ‘Macedonian’, i.e. a Slav-Macedonian, nationality (see E. Kofos in Yugoslavia Today, Athens, 1990, p. 50; Kentron Apodimu Ellinismou, Makedonia, Istoria kai Politismos, Ekdotiki Athinon, 1989, pp. 29 et seq.). This situation was preceded by a number of violent incidents, such as the Ilinden revolt, in which the Bulgarians claim to have revolted against the Turks on 2 August 1903 at Krusevo, a town near Monastir whose ethnic composition was overwhelmingly Greek. In fact they turned against the town’s Greek inhabitants, whom they tried to wipe out with the cooperation of the Turks and without causing the rest of the population any significant harm (see K. Vavouskos, op. cit., p. 89; Douglas Dakin, The Greek Struggle in Macedonia 1897–1913, Salonika, 1966, pp. 92 et seq.; Douglas Dakin, E.K. Mazarakis-Ainianos, E. Kofou and I. Diamantourou, O Makedonikos Agonas, Athens, 1985, pp. 30 et seq.; G. Mintsis, op. cit., pp. 53 et seq.). Until 1914 ‘Macedonia’ as a Slavic State and ‘the Macedonian nation’ as a specific nation were unheard of. The part of Macedonia which fell under Yugoslav domination, like that which fell to Bulgaria, is a narrow strip of land along the Greek border and represents only a small part of Serbia. Skopje, which today is the capital of the misleadingly named Socialist Republic of Macedonia of the Federal Yugoslav State, is far away from Macedonia. The S.R.M. was founded under the German occupation (see E. Kofos, The Impact of the Macedonian Question on Civil Conflict in Greece 1943–1948, Athens, 1989). Its foundation was part of a deliberate strategy according to which, when the regions of Skopje and Tetovo (which belonged to ancient Dardania, a non-Macedonian country) were ceded, a Serb population could be said to exist in the sparsely populated part of Macedonia that lay beyond the Greek borders and contained Serbs, Greeks, Greek Vlachs, Muslims with a partly Turkish identity, and Bulgarians; a Slav-speaking population with a specific dialect and an unstable national consciousness (see A. Vakalopoulos, op. cit., pp. 12 et seq.; N. Andriotis, The Confederate State of Skopje and its Language, Athens, 1957, with relevant bibliography). The long-term purpose of founding the S.R.M. was to re-establish a Slav Macedonian State with access to the Aegean. One of the means to this end is to enlist in various ways bilingual Greeks from Greek Macedonia. Setting up an association called ‘Home of Macedonian Civilisation’ at Florina is part of this effort and applies a directive issued by Slav organisations abroad. The aim is to create a Macedonian Question with international ramifications (see statements by Serb politicians to the Borba newspaper, 8 November 1990 and to Nin magazine, 1 February 1991). The parties applying for recognition of the above association are the enablers in this operation. Among them are Christos Sidiropoulos and Stavros Anastassiadis, who appeared at an international conference to dispute the Greek identity of (Greek) Macedonia, the former in particular by distinguishing between Macedonians and Greeks (see the Makedonikos Voras newspaper of 17 March 1991, which includes photographs of the above persons among sixteen members of the ‘Macedonian’ delegation at the CSCE in Copenhagen; and the Ethnos newspaper of 5 February 1991, p. 10). This, in combination with the name of the proposed association and with the whole content of its memorandum of association, renders at least dubious the association’s aims, which according to the founder members’ seemingly lawful statement in clause 2 of the memorandum of association, consist in the cultural, intellectual and artistic advancement of its members, cultural decentralisation, etc. This assessment is supported by the content of clause 3, paragraph 2, of the same memorandum of association, which states that all youths in the Florina area will be enrolled in the proposed association’s youth section. It is clear from this that there is a danger that the immaturity of young people will be exploited and that youths will be trapped by suitable propaganda in an ethnologically non-existent and historically evacuated Slav-Macedonian minority. Clause 4 of the same memorandum of association lays down the condition that enrolment in the association is subject to written acceptance of the association’s principles. Nowhere in the association’s memorandum of association, however, are these principles defined. Thus the memorandum of association does not provide a clear idea of who will enrol, since a clear definition of the principles governing the proposed association is deliberately omitted. Lastly, the very name of the association may be a source of confusion, because at first sight it creates the impression that it refers to Macedonia’s Greek civilisation, whereas in reality it envisages a specifically Slavic civilisation which does not exist in the region in question. Altogether, this Court has good reasons in the light of the foregoing to believe that the purpose of using the term ‘Macedonian’ is to dispute the Greek identity of Macedonia and its inhabitants by indirect and therefore underhand means, and discerns an intention on the part of the founders to undermine Greece’s territorial integrity. The impugned refusal of the application in question was therefore justified, notwithstanding that it was based on shorter and partly different reasoning; and the arguments to the contrary put forward in the present appeal must fail.",

On 20 June 1991 the applicants appealed on points of law to the Court of Cassation, relying, in particular, on Articles 2, 4, 5 and 12 of the Greek Constitution and the corresponding provisions of the Convention. They maintained that, contrary to law, the Court of Appeal had (a) not confined itself to reviewing the lawfulness of the establishment of their association – namely whether the requirements of Articles 78 to 80 of the Civil Code had been satisfied – but had reviewed its desirability, relying on the presumed intentions of the founder members, which (assuming them to have any reality) could not, however, be the subject of judicial review at the stage of granting the association legal recognition; (b) taken into consideration information (in particular, irresponsible and unfounded press articles concerning some of the founder members) that had not been produced by the parties; (c) accepted as true certain matters that were of decisive importance for the outcome of the proceedings without ordering evidence to be taken to establish whether they were in fact true; (d) distorted the content of the association’s memorandum of association; and (e) not given sufficient reasons in its judgment.",

It pointed out that under the special procedure for granting recognition to associations, the inquisitorial system allowed the court to take into account, of its own motion, matters which had not been mentioned by the parties and that the court was not bound by the parties’ evidence and assertions. As to the “matters that were of decisive importance for the outcome of the proceedings”, the parties had not specified the matters in question in their appeal. The Court of Appeal had accepted the truth of certain circumstances in reliance on the content of the association’s memorandum of association and on matters that were common knowledge and supported by documents such as the press articles; and there had not, moreover, been any distortion of the content of the memorandum of association. The Court of Cassation also held that sufficient reasons had been given in the Court of Appeal’s judgment. It further noted that the assertion that Articles 2, 4, 5 and 12 of the Constitution, together with the Rome Convention, had been infringed referred not to the Court of Appeal’s judgment but to the judgment of the Florina Court of First Instance; even supposing that the applicants had put forward a ground of appeal based on Article 559 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it would have had to be dismissed as vague since they had not stated in what way the Court of Appeal had made a mistake in interpreting or applying those provisions.",

This accounts for the announcement that the Yugoslav consul in Salonika, Sasko Todorovski, is to be expelled just 72 hours before tomorrow’s hearing.

The application in question was refused by the lower court at Florina, where an earlier, less veiled version drawn up by the same persons had also been refused. The new application in the Salonika Court of Appeal tomorrow will be heard as ‘a straightforward everyday case’.",

The two also appeared last June at a meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) held in Copenhagen on the subject of human rights, declaring that they were Greek citizens but Macedonian nationals, and denounced the Greek State for ‘oppressing’ the ‘Macedonians’ of ‘Aegean Macedonia’ and ‘depriving’ them of all human rights. In fact, according to the newspaper run by the émigré independence movement in Australia, Australian Macedonian (1/8/1990), the two men carried letters containing similar allegations from Petros Dimtsis of Kato Klines, a village in the prefecture of Florina, who lodged a complaint in Strasbourg in May 1989, and from Stefos Skenderis, a teacher in the Greek State education service who lives at Florina.",
                "(b) As disclosed by the ‘Australian-Macedonian Committee for Human Rights’ on 1 August 1990, Christos Sidiropoulos is the invisible leader of a secret phantom organisation of ‘Aegean Macedonians’, the ‘Central organising committee for the Macedonian human rights of the Macedonians of Aegean Macedonia’. In 1984 this organisation distributed by post a manifesto containing the ‘demands of the Macedonians of Aegean Macedonia’ which caused the Greek people profound unease and distress at the activities of invisible agents belonging to an independence movement within Greek Macedonia. This secret phantom movement remains unknown; however, it claims to be based in Salonika and it is certain that it is directed from abroad and imports all its printed propaganda against Greek Macedonia from foreign countries.",
                "(c) The application to be heard tomorrow in the Salonika Court of Appeal for registration of the ‘Home of Macedonian Civilisation’ will in fact set in motion a provocation of the Greek system of justice which was planned abroad as far back as 1989. The aim is to trap Greece into a series of legal refusals which will then be used against Greece by Skopje in the European Court of Human Rights and the Committee of Ministers at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. The plot is satanic because if the Greek courts accept the application by the leader of the ‘Aegean Macedonians’, Greece will be legalising a Trojan horse sent by Skopje to trap unwitting bilingual Greek Macedonians and deliver them into the claws of foreigners and of propaganda inspired from abroad.",

At the time ‘Macedonian’ professors Michael Radin and Chris Popov, who are Australian citizens, released a plan of action entitled ‘The road to Macedonian human rights’ on behalf of the Salonika ‘section’.

Macedonians from Aegean Macedonia could, for instance, set up an association for popular dances with the name “Macedonian Folklore Association”. The association will undoubtedly be forbidden by the laws mentioned above, which prohibit establishing groups on the ground of nationality. Provided that all appeals to the lower courts are turned down, the case will go through the Greek judicial system until it reaches the country’s highest court, the Court of Cassation. The refusal of an appeal at that level will mean that all domestic legal remedies have been exhausted. One of the conditions for submission of a case to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights will thus have been fulfilled. Within six months of the Supreme Court’s decision an application can be submitted on the ground that the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association has been violated, with the result that the Court of Human Rights, or the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, will deliver a decision against Greece.’",

                "The Court notes that in refusing to register the applicants’ association, the Florina Court of First Instance and the Salonika Court of Appeal relied partly on the fact that the applicants had publicly claimed to be of “Macedonian” ethnic origin and to have a “Macedonian national consciousness” and at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (“the CSCE”) in Copenhagen had disputed the Greek identity of Greek Macedonia (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above).",
                "In the circumstances of the case the Court considers that the applicants’ complaints under Articles 9, 10 and 14 of the Convention also go to the very substance of Article 11, so that in the national courts the applicants did rely on grounds of equivalent effect within the meaning of the Court’s case-law.",

The Commission had not allowed the objection, taking the view, on the one hand, that it went to the merits of the case and, on the other, that “it would be failing in its duty under Article 19 of the Convention … if it were to refuse to examine the application on the basis of the possible impact, if any, that it might have on the dialogue between Greece and ‘the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’”.",

                "40. The Court points out that the right to form an association is an inherent part of the right set forth in Article 11, even if that Article only makes express reference to the right to form trade unions. That citizens should be able to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned. Certainly States have a right to satisfy themselves that an association’s aim and activities are in conformity with the rules laid down in legislation, but they must do so in a manner compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions.",
                "Consequently, the exceptions set out in Article 11 are to be construed strictly; only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restrictions on freedom of association. In determining whether a necessity within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 exists, the States have only a limited margin of appreciation, which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, including those given by independent courts.",
                "When the Court carries out its scrutiny, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 11 the decisions they delivered in the exercise of their discretion. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, p. 22, §§ 46 and 47)."

                "There was nothing in the case file to suggest that any of the applicants had wished to undermine Greece’s territorial integrity, national security or public order. Mention of the consciousness of belonging to a minority and the preservation and development of a minority’s culture could not be said to constitute a threat to “democratic society”. Similarly, the presence of some of the founders at the CSCE in Copenhagen could not be interpreted as an attack on national security, since the Greek Government themselves had, by signing all the relevant CSCE documents, recognised that citizens could take part in such proceedings. Nor had Mr Sidiropoulos in any way challenged the Greek identity of the Greek province of Macedonia; he had merely claimed that the Macedonian minority there was oppressed.",
                "Furthermore, the allegation that the association’s founders were plotting against Greece was unfounded. The press article that referred to a “directive” from Slav organisations abroad was manifestly untrue and a complete fabrication; that was apparent from the very use of the word “directive”, which was not a current term in the latter part of the twentieth century, and from the fact that the Greek Government had not to date confirmed the existence of such a directive. The irresponsible publications of a newspaper could not be used as evidence by a court, or indeed by the government of a State which respected the rule of law.",

More specifically, the Florina Court of First Instance and the Salonika Court of Appeal had made an acceptable assessment of the circumstances of the case and had reached the reasonable conclusion that the association’s real aim was quite different from the one referred to in its memorandum of association. In order to reach that view, the judges of those courts had, of their own motion, taken into consideration as evidence – as Articles 741, 744 and 759 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure entitled them to do in such proceedings – certain press articles and matters of common knowledge such as the threat to Greece that the FYROM’s propaganda against it represented at the time, the attempted “ Slavicisation ” of the term “Macedonia” by that State, certain provisions of that State’s Constitution and the systematic campaign to promote the idea of a “United Macedonia”.",
                "Furthermore, the courts had noted that clause 4 of the association’s memorandum of association provided that acceptance of its principles was an essential prerequisite for becoming a member, without however stating those principles, such that potential members ran the risk of being “trapped” as soon as they had joined. The association’s name was also likely to cause confusion, since the applicants had sought to conceal the type of culture to which they referred; it was only before the Commission that the applicants had revealed for the first time which ethnic group they really believed they belonged to. The deceptive name “Home of Macedonian Civilisation” was part of a propaganda exercise whose objective was to create a favourable climate for disputing the Greek identity of Macedonia and sustain irredentist aspirations.",

They submitted that some respect should be paid to the authorities’ judgment when they weighed conflicting public and individual interests in view of their special knowledge of the country and their general responsibility under national law.

However, in the Commission’s opinion, that would not in itself have justified restricting the applicants’ right to freedom of association; although the applicants had indeed stated that they had a “Macedonian” national consciousness, there was nothing to indicate that they had advocated the use of violence or of undemocratic or unconstitutional means.

Such aims appear to the Court to be perfectly clear and legitimate; the inhabitants of a region in a country are entitled to form associations in order to promote the region’s special characteristics, for historical as well as economic reasons. Even supposing that the founders of an association like the one in the instant case assert a minority consciousness, the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE (Section IV) of 29 June 1990 and the Charter of Paris for a New Europe of 21 November 1990 – which Greece has signed – allow them to form associations to protect their cultural and spiritual heritage.",

For pluralism is also built on the genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs, artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, § 92, ECHR 2004 -I )."

Firstly, it was claimed that, at the meeting of the Financial Council (the governing body of the applicant branch) at which amendments to the founding documents had been adopted, only five members had been in attendance, whereas the Religions Act required that a religious organisation should have at least ten founding members. Secondly, it was alleged that no visas for the applicant branch ’ s foreign members, or other documents establishing their lawful residence in Russian territory, had been provided. Thirdly, the deputy head referred to the fact that the applicant branch was subordinate to a centralised religious organisation in London and inferred therefrom that the applicant branch was “most probably” a representative office of a foreign religious organisation operating on behalf and by order of the latter. Accordingly, its activities were to be governed by Government Regulation no. 310 (see paragraph 46 below)."

Article 6 of the Charter [1] provides that members of the Branch shall include supporters, soldiers, local officers and officers headed by the Officer Commanding, who is appointed from London.

It determined that the applicant branch was a representative office of the international religious organisation “ The Salvation Army ” and therefore was not eligible for registration as an independent religious organisation. In the court ’ s opinion, this fact also prevented the applicant branch from being granted re-registration. Secondly, it referred to Article 13 § 5 of the Constitution, banning the founding and functioning of public associations which advocated a violent change in the constitutional principles of the Russian Federation or destruction of its integrity, undermined the security of the State, created paramilitary formations, or caused social, racial, ethnic or religious division or conflict. The court continued as follows:",
                "“In the course of analysis of the Charter, certain provisions stood out, on the one hand, as being imbued with barrack-room discipline, in which members of the religious organisation show unquestionable subordination to its management and, on the other hand, as relieving the management and the organisation as a whole of any responsibility for its members ’ activities. Thus, according to Article 6 § 3 of the Charter, ‘ the members of the Branch shall act in compliance with The Salvation Army ’ s Orders and Regulations and with the instructions of the Officer Commanding ’, ... ‘ the Branch as a whole shall not be liable for infringements of the legislation of the Russian Federation perpetrated by individual members of the Branch ’. This wording of the Charter leads one to conclude that the Charter assumes that the members of the organisation will inevitably break Russian law in the process of executing The Salvation Army ’ s Orders and Regulations and the instructions of the Officer Commanding ... The Branch excludes its liability for illegal service activity by its members.”",

It pointed out that the organisation ’ s executive body included five foreign nationals who had multiple-entry visas, but not residence permits, whereas section 9 ( 1 ) of the Religions Act required founders to be of Russian nationality. Noting the location of The Salvation Army ’ s headquarters abroad and the presence of the word “branch” in its name, the City Court concluded that the Moscow Justice Department had correctly insisted on registration of the applicant branch as a representative office of a foreign religious organisation. As a subsidiary argument, the City Court endorsed the District Court ’ s finding that the articles of association did not indicate the precise religious affiliation of its members because it was described as “Evangelical Protestant Christian”, certain clauses of the articles of association mentioned the “ faith of The Salvation Army ”, and its objective was the “advancement of the Christian faith ”. On the allegedly paramilitary nature of the applicant ’ s activities, the City Court noted :",

These religious organisations also voiced complaints that they had serious difficulties to settle, to build or buy their places of worship, or to recover confiscated properties.

The Court refers to its settled case-law to the effect that, as enshrined in Article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a “democratic society” within the meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others v.

While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies, inter alia, freedom to “manifest [one ’ s] religion” alone and in private or in community with others, in public and within the circle of those whose faith one shares. Since religious communities traditionally exist in the form of organised structures, Article 9 must be interpreted in the light of Article 11 of the Convention, which safeguards associative life against unjustified State interference. Seen in that perspective, the right of believers to freedom of religion, which includes the right to manifest one ’ s religion in community with others, encompasses the expectation that believers will be allowed to associate freely, without arbitrary State intervention. Indeed, the autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is thus an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 affords. The State ’ s duty of neutrality and impartiality, as defined in the Court ’ s case-law, is incompatible with any power on the State ’ s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others, cited above, §§ 118 and 123, and Hasan and Chaush v.

That citizens should be able to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned. Certainly States have a right to satisfy themselves that an association ’ s aim and activities are in conformity with the rules laid down in legislation, but they must do so in a manner compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions (see Sidiropoulos and Others v.

By virtue of the wording of the second paragraph of Article 11, and likewise of Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Convention, the only necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of the rights enshrined in those Articles is one that may claim to spring from “democratic society” (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v.

For pluralism is also built on the genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs, artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others v.

In fact, the judicial decisions upholding the refusal have not been set aside and have remained in force to date.

This means that the inclusion of information on the applicant branch was solely linked to the establishment of a new register (the Unified State Register of Legal Entities) and to the shifting of registration competence from one authority to another following enactment of a new procedure for the registration of legal entities (see paragraph 45 above). In their statement of appeal, the Moscow Justice Department – that is, the authority with responsibility for registering religious associations – expressly confirmed that the entering of such information could not constitute “re-registration” for the purposes of the Religions Act (see paragraph 27 above)."

Where the organisation of the religious community is in issue, a refusal to recognise it also constitutes interference with the applicants ’ right to freedom of religion under Article 9 of the Convention (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others, cited above, § 105).

The procedure for “re-registration” was the same as for the initial registration of a religious organisation and the same grounds for refusing a registration application applied (see paragraphs 39 and 41 above). In addition, “re-registration” could be refused if grounds existed for dissolving a religious organisation or for banning its activities (see paragraph 43 above).

After 6 December 2001, when it exhausted ordinary domestic remedies against the judicial decision ordering its dissolution, and until that decision was quashed by way of supervisory review on 1 August 2002, the applicant branch continuously ran the risk of having its accounts frozen and its assets seized (compare Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova (dec.), no. 28793/02, 22 March 2005). The Court accepts that that situation had an appreciably detrimental effect on its functioning and religious activities (see paragraphs 29-33 above). Even though the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling later removed the immediate threat of dissolution from the applicant branch, it is apparent that its legal capacity is not identical to that of other religious organisations that obtained re-registration certificates. The Court observes that in other cases the absence of re-registration was invoked by the Russian authorities as a ground for refusing registration of amendments to the articles of association or for staying the registration of a religious newspaper (see Church of Scientology Moscow and Others v.

Although the Moscow Justice Department initially referred to an insufficient number of founding members and the absence of documents showing their lawful residence in Russia, these purported defects found no mention in the subsequent judicial decisions (see paragraphs 14, 16 and 17 above). The allegedly paramilitary nature of the applicant ’ s structure did not form part of the initial decision refusing re-registration and the Department put that argument forward for the first time in its comments on the applicant ’ s claim to a court (see paragraph 15 above). That reason was accepted by the District Court but the City Court did not consider that it required separate examination (see paragraph 17 above). Finally, the argument about inconsistent indication of the applicant ’ s religious affiliation was not relied upon by the Justice Department and appeared for the first time in judicial decisions ( ibid .)"

The Russian authorities held that since the applicant ’ s founders were foreign nationals, in that it was subordinate to the central office in London and had the word “branch” in its name, it must have been a representative office of a foreign religious organisation ineligible for “re-registration” as a religious organisation under Russian law."

                "83. Secondly, it does not appear that the presence of The Salvation Army ’ s headquarters abroad prevented registration of the applicant as a Russian religious organisation. Section 11 ( 6 ) of the Religions Act concerned precisely the situation where a Russian religious organisation was subordinate to the central governing body located abroad (see paragraph 40 above). The only additional requirement in that case was the production of the certified articles of association of the foreign governing body; that circumstance was not a legal ground for refusing registration or re-registration."

Thirdly, under the Religions Act, the only instance in which a religious organisation ’ s name could preclude its registration was where it was identical to the name of another registered organisation. It has not been claimed that this was the case of the applicant branch. By law, the mere presence of the word “branch” in its name was not a circumstance precluding its registration."

Finally, the Court notes that, by the time of the events, the applicant branch had existed for seven years as an independent legal entity exercising a broad range of religious rights. The Moscow Justice Department and domestic courts insisted that it should be registered as a representative office of a foreign religious organisation with the consequence that under Russian law it would not be entitled to status as a legal entity or to continue its religious activities (see paragraph 46 above). As noted above, that claim by the domestic authorities had no legal foundation. Accordingly, in the Court ’ s assessment, it amounted to a refusal on the ground that its establishment was inexpedient, which had been expressly prohibited by section 12 ( 2 ) of the Religions Act (see paragraph 42 above)."

Bulgaria, no. 45963/99, § 55, 13 April 2006 ). This had not, however, been done. Accordingly, the Court considers that this ground for refusing registration has not been substantiated."

Further, the Moscow Justice Department alleged that the applicant branch should be denied registration on the ground that it was a “paramilitary organisation”, since its members wore a uniform and performed service, and because the use of the word “army” in its name was not legitimate. The District Court endorsed that argument."

The Court points out that, according to its constant case-law, the right to freedom of religion as guaranteed under the Convention excludes any discretion on the part of the State to determine whether religious beliefs or the means used to express such beliefs are legitimate (see Hasan and Chaush, cited above, § 78, and Manoussakis and Others v. Greece, 26 September 1996, § 47, Reports 1996 ‑ IV ). It is indisputable that, for the members of the applicant branch, using ranks similar to those used in the military and wearing uniforms were particular ways of organising the internal life of their religious community and manifesting The Salvation Army ’ s religious beliefs. It could not seriously be maintained that the applicant branch advocated a violent change in the State ’ s constitutional foundations or thereby undermined the State ’ s integrity or security. No evidence to that effect had been produced before the domestic authorities or by the Government in the Convention proceedings. It follows that the domestic findings on this point were devoid of factual basis."

There was no evidence before the domestic courts that in seven years of its existence the applicant branch, its members or founders had contravened any Russian law or pursued objectives other than those listed in its articles of associations, notably the advancement of the Christian faith and acts of charity.

As noted above, by the time the re-registration requirement was introduced, the applicant branch had lawfully existed and operated in Russia as an independent religious community for more than seven years. It has not been submitted that the community as a whole or its individual members had been in breach of any domestic law or regulation governing their associative life and religious activities. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the reasons for refusing re-registration should have been particularly weighty and compelling (see the case-law cited in paragraph 76 above). In the present case no such reasons have been put forward by the domestic authorities."
            ],
            [
                "97. It is also relevant for the Court ’ s assessment that, unlike the applicant branch, other religious associations professing the faith of The Salvation Army have successfully obtained re-registration in Russian regions and at federal level (see points 99 and 101-04 of the report on Russia honouring its commitments, cited in paragraph 47 above, and point 5 of the Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Resolution on Russia ’ s Law on religion, cited in paragraph 49 above). In view of the Court ’ s finding above that the reasons invoked by the Moscow Justice Department and endorsed by the Moscow courts in order to deny re-registration of the applicant branch had no legal or factual basis, it can be inferred that, in denying registration to the Moscow branch of The Salvation Army, the Moscow authorities did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality vis-à-vis the applicant ’ s religious community (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others, § 123, and Hasan and Chaush, § 62, both cited above)."

                "98. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of religion and association was not justified. There has therefore been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention read in the light of Article 9.",

Where a substantive Article of the Convention or its Protocols has been relied on both on its own and in conjunction with Article 14 and a separate breach has been found of the substantive Article, it is not generally necessary for the Court to consider the case under Article 14 also, though the position is otherwise if a clear inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the right in question is a fundamental aspect of the case (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/9 5 and 28443/95, § 89, ECHR 1999- III, and Dudgeon, cited above, § 67 )."

The Plovdiv Regional Court had not relied on a specific provision of the Political Parties Act of 1990 to justify its refusal to register the association, which was only natural in view of the text of section 1(3) of that Act. That court's proposition that only political parties could pursue political goals showed a fundamental lack of understanding of the role of non-governmental organisations in a democratic society. These were frequently founded in order to promote various causes and influence public policies. Their goals were thus often political. The fundamental difference between them and political parties, however, were not these goals, but the means to achieve them. Political parties participated in elections and in the government, whereas associations did not. They merely influenced public opinion on various issues, thus indirectly shaping the government's policies. Likewise, the Plovdiv Court of Appeals'holding that the association's aims fell under the proscription of Article 12 § 2 of the Constitution of 1991 was erroneous. The association's aims, as was apparent from the wording of its articles, consisted of various reform ideas, but did not amount to a concrete and coherent political programme and ideology. There was no reason why such ideas could not be backed by various entities in a pluralistic society. It was important to underscore that the association's articles contained no language pointing to an intention to participate in elections or in the government, which were indeed goals solely characteristic of political parties. On the other hand, Article 12 § 2 of the Constitution of 1991 was not framed with sufficient precision, as it could be read as prohibiting to associations all types of political goals. Nor did it make clear what was exactly prohibited: political goals or also political activities. The interference had also been arbitrary, as evidenced by the lack of genuine reasons for the Supreme Court of Cassation's judgment, whose holding was packed in just four lines."

The association had not engaged in any action which could characterise it as propagating violence or undemocratic principles. The idea of a monarchy and the related insignia were not undemocratic or violent, as evidenced in particular by the fact that the name of the coalition which had ruled the country as between 2001 and 2005 had been “National Movement Simeon II”, after the former heir to the throne Simeon Saxe-Coburggotski, who had become prime minister. Even before his starting into office in 2001 Bulgaria's coat of arms had featured a crown, whereas the public debate over the form of government – republic or monarchy – continued. While the Constitution indeed needed stability, it was by no means carved into stone. Its amendment could be envisaged for the purpose of bringing it in line with the dominant public views on the form of government, whereas suppressing any ideas in this respect could harm democracy and constituted unfettered majority rule."

The ability to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned. Certainly States have a right to satisfy themselves that an association's aim and activities are in conformity with the rules laid down in legislation, but they must do so in a manner compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions (see Sidiropoulos and Others v. Greece, judgment of 10 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV, pp. 1614 ‑ 15, § 40; The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, cited above, § 57; The Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army, cited above, § 59; and Ramazanova and Others v.

While in the context of Article 11 the Court has often referred to the essential role played by political parties in ensuring pluralism and democracy, associations formed for other purposes are also important to the proper functioning of democracy. For pluralism is also built on the genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs, artistic, literary and socio ‑ economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others, § 92; and The Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army, § 61, both cited above )."

However, the Court notes that it is primarily for the national courts to interpret and apply domestic law (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, § 55; and Tsonev, § 45, both cited above). Firstly, it is prepared to accept that their holding that the aims of the association were contrary to the Constitution of 1991 did not go so far as to become arbitrary. Secondly, it is true that their categorization of these aims as “political” within the meaning of Article 12 § 2 of the Constitution of 1991 and their holding that the association could not pursue them without being a political party may appear questionable in view of the construction of this Article by the Constitutional Court and the tenor of the other relevant provisions of domestic law (see paragraphs 17, 19 and 22 above). However, the Court is mindful that legal opinions on the exact purport of such a wide notion open to largely diverse interpretations – “political” – may differ. It is therefore likewise prepared to accept that these holdings were not as patently unreasonable as to become arbitrary. Moreover, while the reasoning of the national courts, and especially that of the Supreme Court of Cassation, was indeed very scant, it was not altogether lacking, as claimed by the applicant."

It is not possible to attain absolute rigidity in the framing of laws, and many of them – especially a national constitution – are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The level of precision required of domestic legislation depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question and the field it is designed to cover (see Maestri, cited above, § 30 in fine ). It must also be borne in mind that, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, its application involves an inevitable element of judicial interpretation, since there will always be a need for clarification of doubtful points and for adaptation to particular circumstances. The mere fact that such a provision is capable of more than one construction does not mean that it fails to meet the requirement of “foreseeability” for the purposes of the Convention. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain, taking into account the changes in everyday practice (see Gorzelik and Others, cited above, § 65)."

An organisation may campaign for a change in the legal and constitutional structures of the State if the means used to that end are in every respect legal and democratic and if the change proposed is itself compatible with fundamental democratic principles (see Yazar and Others v. Turkey, nos. 22723/93, 22724/93 and 22725/93, § 49, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; Refah Partisi (The Welfare Party) and Others v.

Monarchy is not incompatible in itself with the principles of democracy, as shown by the example of a number of member States of the Council of Europe.

Secondly, even if it was so, the mere fact that an organisation demands such changes cannot automatically justify interferences with its members'freedoms of association and assembly (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden – PIRIN and Others, cited above, § 61, citing Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 97 )."

                "55. The first thing which needs to be noted in this connection is the uncertainty surrounding the term “political”, as used in Article 12 § 2 of the Constitution of 1991 and as interpreted by the domestic courts. For instance, in the present case these courts deemed that a campaign for changes in the constitution and the form of government fell within that category. In another recent case these same courts had, more questionably, stated that the “holding of meetings, demonstrations, assemblies and other forms of public campaigning” by an association campaigning for regional autonomy and alleged minority rights also amounted to political goals and activities within the meaning of Article 12 § 2 of the Constitution of 1991. The Court found this holding unwarranted (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, cited above, §§ 17, 19, 21 and 73 ). The Constitutional Court has, for its part, adopted a different definition of “political”, which was centred on “participation in the process of forming the bodies through which ... the people exercise[d] its power ” (see paragraph 22 above ). Against this background and bearing in mind that this term is inherently vague and could be subject to largely diverse interpretations, it is quite conceivable that the Bulgarian courts could label any goals which are in some way related to the normal functioning of a democratic society as “political” and accordingly direct the founders of legal entities wishing to pursue such goals to register them as political parties instead of “ ordinary ” associations. A classification based on this criterion is therefore liable to produce incoherent results and engender considerable uncertainty among those wishing to apply for registration of such entities."

                "56. If associations in Bulgaria could, when registered as such, participate in elections and accede to power, as was the case in Gorzelik and Others (cited above), it might be necessary to require some of them to register as political parties, so as to make them subject to, for instance, stricter rules concerning party financing, public control and transparency (see paragraph 20 above). However, under Bulgarian law, as it stood at the material time and as it stands at present, associations may not participate in national, local or European elections (see paragraph 21 above). There is therefore no “ pressing social need ” to require every association deemed by the courts to pursue “ political ” goals to register as a political party, especially in view of the fact that, as noted above, the exact meaning of that term under Bulgarian law appears to be quite vague. That would mean forcing the association to take a legal shape which its founders did not seek. It would also mean subjecting it to a number of additional requirements and restrictions, such as for instance the rule that a political party cannot be formed by less than fifty enfranchised citizens (see paragraph 19 above), which may in some cases prove an insurmountable obstacle for its founders. Moreover, such an approach runs counter to freedom of association, because, in case it is adopted, the liberty of action which will remain available to the founders of an association may become either non ‑ existent or so reduced as to be of no practical value (see, mutatis mutandis, Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, p. 23, § 56; Sigurður A.

The Kurds were portrayed in the programme as an oppressed people whose democratic rights were being completely ignored. According to the Constitutional Court, ÖZDEP called for a right to self-determination for the Kurds and supported their right to wage a “war of independence”. Its stance was similar to that of terrorist organisations and constituted in itself an incitement to insurrection.",

After reiterating what was meant by the principle of secularism, the court said that advocating the abolition of the government Religious Affairs Department amounted to undermining the principle of secularism. It concluded that that aspect of ÖZDEP’s programme was contrary to section 89 of the Law on the regulation of political parties.",

The Constitutional Court had made that order, notwithstanding the voluntary dissolution, to prevent the party leadership from forming a new party with the same name and status. Had ÖZDEP’s leaders lodged their application before the Court in their own name, too, then they could have claimed to have been victims of the dissolution; but they had not done so."

Exceptionally, however, the Commission had considered it appropriate to consider of its own motion the issue of ÖZDEP’s standing in its report made under former Article 31 of the Convention.

Consequently, an estoppel should arise against them (see, among other authorities, the Zana v. Turkey judgment of 25 November 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII, p. 2546, § 44). In its report, however, the Commission examined that issue of its own motion. If an estoppel was nonetheless held to arise against the Government, they would be deprived of an opportunity to make representations on a point that was considered by the Commission of its own motion and was the subject of argument before the Court. That appears inconsistent with the principles of adversarial procedure and equality of arms.

That explanation is supported by section 108 of the Law on the regulation of political parties which, by providing that voluntarily dissolved political parties continue to exist for the purposes of dissolution by the Constitutional Court, is intended to ensure that they are subject to all the effects of the latter form of dissolution (see paragraph 16 above). Thus the decision of ÖZDEP’s leaders to dissolve the party was not made freely, as the decisions of leaders and members of associations should be if they are to be recognised under Article 11.",

It therefore follows that as domestic law provides that a voluntarily dissolved political party remains in existence for the purposes of dissolution by the Constitutional Court, the Government cannot contend before the Court that ÖZDEP was no longer in existence when the dissolution order was made (see, mutatis mutandis, the Kolompar v. Belgium judgment of 24 September 1992, Series A no. 235-C, p. 54, § 32, and the Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v. Ireland judgment of 29 October 1992, Series A no. 246-A, p. 22, § 42).",

The applicant party submitted that it had been clearly stated in its programme that it favoured a democratic and peaceful solution to the Kurdish problem and one complying with international law. It was wrong to suggest that the party sought the partition of Turkey. On the contrary, ÖZDEP’s programme had stressed the need for the country to remain unified, as it said that the party wished to work for the unity of the Turkish and Kurdish peoples, who together would form the country on the basis of equality and voluntarism. Nothing in ÖZDEP’s programme or activities expressed a separatist aim, as indeed was confirmed by the fact that so far no prosecution had been brought against the parties’ leaders under Article 125 of the Criminal Code, which made it an offence to engage in separatist activities.",
                "The Kurdish problem was currently the most serious problem facing Turkey. Given the scale of that problem, political parties were not only able to seek out and propose solutions, they had a duty to do so. However, in the eyes of the authorities, the mere fact that a party had used the word “Kurd” was enough to justify its dissolution. That was what had happened to ÖZDEP: both Principal State Counsel and the Constitutional Court had based their accusations on the use of the words “Kurd”, “Kurdish people”, “minority” and “peoples” in the party’s programme. Yet the programme did not describe the Kurds as a minority or contain a call for them to receive special treatment or to be separated from the Turkish population. Furthermore, there was not a single sentence in the programme that did not reflect the party’s true intentions. Thus, banning a political party solely because it had announced in its programme that it intended to press for a just, democratic and peaceful solution to the Kurdish problem amounted to a breach of Article 11 of the Convention."

The Government submitted that the objectives contained in ÖZDEP’s programme were apt to incite part of the Turkish population to revolt or to engage in illegal activities such as devising a new political order and laws that would have been incompatible with the constitutional principles of the Turkish State.",
                "ÖZDEP was thus using democratic freedoms in an attempt to divide Turkey by choosing as its fundamental theme an alleged oppression by the Turkish State of minorities and, more particularly, of the Kurds. After referring to the right of peoples to self-determination, ÖZDEP had openly supported the armed struggle in its programme, notably by declaring: “ÖZDEP supports the just and legitimate struggle of the peoples for independence and freedom. It stands by them in this struggle.” Such ideas amounted to approval of the illegal activities of terrorist organisations whose aim was to destroy the unity of the State and to incite part of the Turkish population to revolt.",
                "Furthermore, in its programme, ÖZDEP advocated self-determination for the population of Kurdish origin; self-determination was not only unconstitutional but also ineligible for protection under the Convention as it undermined the integrity of the Turkish nation and the indivisibility of the territory of the State.",
                "Moreover, the instant case differed from the cases concerning the United Communist Party of Turkey (judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 1) and the Socialist Party (judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1233) as ÖZDEP’s aim, unlike that of those parties, had not been to abide by the rules of democratic debate but instead to divide the country by, on the one hand, drawing on the support of part of the population and, on the other, applauding the battle being fought by terrorist organisations.",
                "Propaganda in favour of self-determination for part of the population, in this case people of Kurdish origin, was not only contrary to the Turkish Constitution, but also liable to cause unrest among the Turkish population. In a country such as Turkey, which since its creation has been based on a unitary structure and where, by virtue of Article 10 of the Constitution, “[a]ll individuals shall be equal before the law without any distinction based on language, race, colour, sex, political opinion, philosophical belief, religion, membership of a religious sect or other similar grounds”, such propaganda would inevitably provoke grave discord between the various sectors of the Turkish population.",
                "In sum, regard being had to the background to the present case and in particular to the difficulties to which the fight against terrorism gave rise, it was possible to conclude on the basis of the evidence relied on by the Constitutional Court that ÖZDEP bore some responsibility for the problems caused by terrorism in Turkey. The party’s dissolution did not appear to have been a disproportionate measure and, accordingly, could not have amounted to a violation of Article 11 of the Convention."

Indeed, Principal State Counsel had not argued the contrary in the Constitutional Court. Further, it had not been shown that ÖZDEP had intended to destroy the democratic and pluralist system in Turkey or had encouraged a breach of fundamental human rights in the form of racial discrimination.",

That applies all the more in relation to political parties in view of their essential role in ensuring pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy.",

It is for that reason that freedom of expression as enshrined in Article 10 is applicable, subject to paragraph 2, not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. The fact that their activities form part of a collective exercise of freedom of expression in itself entitles political parties to seek the protection of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, the United Communist Party of Turkey and Others judgment cited above, pp. 20-21, §§ 42-43)."

In the Constitutional Court’s view, the programme was based on the assumption that there was a separate Kurdish people in Turkey with its own culture and language. The Kurds were presented in the programme as an oppressed people whose democratic rights were being completely ignored. ÖZDEP had called for a right to self-determination for the Kurds and supported their right to wage a “war of independence”. Its stance was similar to that of terrorist organisations and constituted in itself an incitement to insurrection. That justified making an order for its dissolution (see paragraph 14 above).",

In so doing, the Court has in particular to satisfy itself that the national authorities based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, mutatis mutandis, the Socialist Party and Others judgment cited above, p. 1256, § 44)."

                "40. Having analysed ÖZDEP’s programme, the Court finds nothing in it that can be considered a call for the use of violence, an uprising or any other form of rejection of democratic principles. That, in the Court’s view is an essential factor to be taken into consideration (see, mutatis mutandis, Okçuoğlu v. Turkey [GC], no. 24246/94, § 48, 8 July 1999, unreported). On the contrary, the need to abide by democratic rules when implementing the proposed political project was stressed in the programme. Among other things, it says that ÖZDEP “proposes the creation of a democratic assembly of representatives of the people elected by universal suffrage” and “favours a peaceful and democratic solution to the Kurdish problem, subject to the strict application of international instruments such as the Helsinki Final Act, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights” (see paragraph 8 above).",
                "According to the Government, however, ÖZDEP “openly supported the armed struggle by declaring in a statement leaving no room for doubt that ‘ÖZDEP supports the just and legitimate struggle of the peoples for independence and freedom. It stands by them in this struggle’”.",
                "While the Court considers that that phrase did represent a statement of intent by ÖZDEP to make certain political demands, it finds nothing in it that would incite people to use violence or break the rules of democracy. In that respect, the passage concerned is virtually indistinguishable from passages to be found in the programmes of certain bodies that are politically active in other member States of the Council of Europe."

The Constitutional Court also criticised ÖZDEP for having distinguished two nations in its programme – the Kurds and the Turks – and for having referred to the existence of minorities and to their right to self-determination, to the detriment of the unity of the Turkish nation and the territorial integrity of the Turkish State.",
                "The Court notes that, taken together, the passages in issue present a political project whose aim is in essence the establishment – in accordance with democratic rules – of “a social order encompassing the Turkish and Kurdish peoples”. It is stated elsewhere in the programme that “[t]he Freedom and Democracy Party is campaigning for the voluntary unification of the Kurdish and Turkish peoples, who participated in the foundation of the country”. It is true that in its programme ÖZDEP also refers to the right to self-determination of the “national or religious minorities”; however, taken in context, those words do not encourage people to seek separation from Turkey but are intended instead to emphasise that the proposed political project must be underpinned by the freely given, democratically expressed, consent of the Kurds.",
                "In the Court’s view, the fact that such a political project is considered incompatible with the current principles and structures of the Turkish State does not mean that it infringes democratic rules. It is of the essence of democracy to allow diverse political projects to be proposed and debated, even those that call into question the way a State is currently organised, provided that they do not harm democracy itself (see the Socialist Party and Others judgment cited above, p. 1257, § 47). The same applies, too, to ÖZDEP’s proposals for the abolition of the Religious Affairs Department."

In determining whether a necessity within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 exists, the Contracting States have only a limited margin of appreciation, which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, including those given by independent courts (ibid., p. 22, § 46).",

Democracy thrives on freedom of expression. From that point of view, there can be no justification for hindering a political group solely because it seeks to debate in public the situation of part of the State’s population and to take part in the nation’s political life in order to find, according to democratic rules, solutions capable of satisfying everyone concerned (see the Socialist Party and Others judgment cited above, p. 1256, § 45)."

In that connection, the Government have affirmed that ÖZDEP bears a share of the responsibility for the problems caused by terrorism in Turkey (see paragraph 35 above). The Government nonetheless fail to explain how that could be so as ÖZDEP scarcely had time to take any significant action. It was formed on 19 October 1992, the first application for it to be dissolved was made on 29 January 1993 and it was dissolved, initially at a meeting of its founding members on 30 April 1993 and then by the Constitutional Court on 14 July 1993.

In that case the Grand Chamber held that the French Loi Verdeille of 1964 pursued in particular the legitimate aims of avoiding unregulated hunting and encouraging the rational management of game stocks. According to that law, the applicants could not avoid the compulsory transfer of hunting rights and no measure of compensation was contemplated for landowners who, like the applicants, were opposed to hunting and did not wish to derive any advantage or profit from the right to hunt. The Court also noted that this was an exception to two principles: that ownership means the right to enjoy and dispose of things in the most absolute manner, and that no one may hunt on land belonging to another without the owner’s consent. Moreover, automatic membership of municipal hunters’ associations applied only in 29 of the 93 French départements concerned, such associations had been set up in only 851 municipalities and the Loi Verdeille applied only to landholdings less than 20 hectares in area. The above considerations led the Court to the conclusion that the impugned compulsory-transfer system had placed the applicants in a situation which upset the fair balance to be struck between protection of the right of property and the requirements of the general interest. Compelling small landowners to transfer hunting rights over their land so that others could make use of them in a way which was totally incompatible with their beliefs imposed a disproportionate burden which was not justified under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Chassagnou and Others, cited above, §§ 79 and 82-85)."

Furthermore, they had the right to receive a share of the profits derived from the exercise of those hunting rights. All owners of plots which were too small to allow proper management of hunting rights joined a hunting association. The court further considered that the hunting associations not only served the leisure interests of those who exercised the hunting rights, but also imposed certain specific obligations on them which served the general interest, in particular a duty to manage game stocks with the aim of maintaining varied and healthy game populations and a duty to prevent damage caused by wild game. They were further obliged to comply with specific quotas set by the authorities for the hunting of game.

It noted that in paragraph 114 of the Chassagnou judgment the European Court of Human Rights had accepted that the convictions of the applicants in that case attained a certain level of cogency, cohesion and importance and were therefore worthy of respect in a democratic society. The Constitutional Court left open the question whether this assessment was correct in Mr Herrmann’s case. It agreed, however, to take this assumption as a starting point as it considered that in any case there had been no violation of Article 4 of the Basic Law (see paragraph 25 below). It was doubtful whether there had been any interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of conscience. Even assuming that there had been, it was, in any event, not of a serious nature. As the applicant was not forced to participate in hunting himself and did not have to take any decision in that respect, the court considered that he had not been placed in a position of conflict of conscience. It further observed that the right to freedom of conscience did not encompass a right to have the entire legal order made subject to one’s own ethical standards. If the legal order distributed the right to make use of a certain property among several stakeholders, the owner’s conscience did not necessarily outweigh the other stakeholders’ constitutional rights. If the applicant’s landholding – and those of other owners who were opposed to hunting – were taken out of the common hunting districts because of the landowners’ convictions, the whole system of property ownership and management of game stocks would be jeopardised. The right to freedom of conscience did not outweigh the general interest in the instant case."

They were vested with administrative, rule-making and disciplinary prerogatives and remained integrated within State structures.

Contrary to the situation in France, which had been examined by the Court in the Chassagnou judgment, the Federal Hunting Act applied to the whole of Germany and was binding on all landowners.

This was evident in the notion of “ Hege ”, which transcended the simple management of orderly hunting and encompassed general protection of game stocks. Hunting rights entailed an obligation to preserve varied and healthy game stocks while at the same time regulating the numbers of game in order to prevent game damage in agricultural and forest areas.

Consequently, a law interfering with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must achieve a “fair balance” between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. The search for this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole, and therefore also in the second paragraph thereof: there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others, cited above, § 75; Schneider, cited above, § 45; and Depalle v.

In that case the Grand Chamber held that the French Loi Verdeille of 1964 pursued in particular the legitimate aims of avoiding unregulated hunting and encouraging the rational management of game stocks. According to that law, the applicants could not avoid the compulsory transfer of hunting rights and no measure of compensation was contemplated for landowners who, like the applicants, were opposed to hunting and did not wish to derive any advantage or profit from the right to hunt. The Court also noted that this was an exception to two principles: that ownership means the right to enjoy and dispose of things in the most absolute manner, and that no one may hunt on land belonging to another without the owner’s consent. Moreover, automatic membership of municipal hunters’ associations applied only in 29 of the 93 French départements concerned, such associations had been set up in only 851 municipalities and the Loi Verdeille applied only to landholdings less than 20 hectares in area. The above considerations led the Court to the conclusion that the impugned compulsory-transfer system had placed the applicants in a situation which upset the fair balance to be struck between protection of the right of property and the requirements of the general interest. Compelling small landowners to transfer hunting rights over their land so that others could make use of them in a way which was totally incompatible with their beliefs imposed a disproportionate burden which was not justified under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Chassagnou and Others, cited above, §§ 79 and 82-85)."

The Court further takes note of the Government’s submissions to the effect that hunting is aimed also at preventing the spread of animal diseases. Similarly, one of the main objectives of the French Loi Verdeille was to facilitate “rational organisation of hunting, consistent with respect for the environment” (see Chassagnou and Others, cited above, § 78).

Notwithstanding this, the German hunting legislation confers certain rights on persons who hunt, such as the right to pursue and to acquire ownership of the game (see section 1(1) of the Federal Hunting Act, quoted in paragraph 27 above).

Conversely, both the Luxembourg and the German legislation provided/provide for members of the association to receive a proportionate share of the profits from the leasehold.

Such an act could be considered, in itself, to be incompatible with the ethical convictions held by the applicant (see paragraphs 12 and 53 above).

Moreover, in the light of the material before it, the Court sees no reason to call into question the truthfulness of the applicant’s assertion that he never saw any cattle on his land, never gave permission for the land to be used in that way and would take legal action to prevent or stop any abuse."

Under these circumstances, the Court is not convinced that the situation encountered in Germany is substantially different from those examined by the Court in the cases of Chassagnou and Schneider.

The Grand Chamber reiterates that Article 14 has no independent existence, but plays an important role by complementing the other provisions of the Convention and the Protocols, since it protects individuals, placed in similar situations, from any discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights set forth in those other provisions. Where a substantive Article of the Convention has been invoked both on its own and together with Article 14 and a separate breach has been found of the substantive Article, it is not generally necessary for the Court to consider the case under Article 14 also, though the position is otherwise if a clear inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the right in question is a fundamental aspect of the case (see Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1981, § 67, Series A no. 45, and Chassagnou and Others, cited above, § 89)."

His compulsory membership of the hunting association had deprived him of the possibility of acting in accordance with his moral beliefs."

The Federal Constitutional Court’s argument according to which no one could derive from the right to freedom of conscience a right to have his or her own ethical persuasions made the yardstick of the entire legal system (see paragraph 20 above) failed to appreciate the degree and significance of individual freedom of conscience, which was “sacrificed” to the right of third parties to hunt, a right that was protected neither by the German Constitution nor by the Convention. Compulsory membership of a hunting association increased the pressure to which a person was subjected when obliged to engage in activities contrary to his or her views."

They emphasised that the applicant was not obliged to hunt or to be involved in any activity which was not compatible with his convictions. The decision to permit hunting was not taken by the applicant, but by the law in the general public interest.

France (no. 49853/99, ECHR 2001-X), the Government considered that Article 9 did not confer on those concerned the right to impose their ethical, religious or moral convictions on others, especially if they could also express their ideas by other means.

In that regard it was worth noting that the Convention institutions had expressly held that applicants could not invoke Article 9 in order to avoid paying taxes on the grounds that those taxes were used to fund military actions (the Government referred to C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 10358/83, Commission decision of 15 December 1983, Decisions and Reports (DR) 37, p. 142) and that the public interest in the protection of health was sufficient to justify the duty to wear a motorbike helmet, even if this obligation stood in the way of a Sikh’s obligation to wear a turban (the Government cited X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 7992/77, Commission decision of 12 July 1978, DR 14, p. 234)."

Furthermore, the applicant had never tried to find a way out of the alleged conflict of conscience, for instance by selling the plots of land in question and buying land in an urban area or by trying to influence the decision-making process within the hunting association in accordance with his ethical convictions."

Poland (no. 27617/04, § 206, ECHR 2011) regarding the performing of abortions by medical professionals. Furthermore, in the judgments in Chassagnou (cited above, § 117) and Schneider (cited above, § 82), the Court had implicitly recognised the right to conscientious objection to hunting, without giving an express ruling under Article 9.

Bearing in mind that blanket opposition to hunting was somewhat irrational and the fact that the interference with the applicant’s freedom of conscience was largely confined to his having passively to “tolerate” hunting, the ECLJ considered that there had been a possible, but not clear, violation of Article 9 of the Convention. Conversely, the obligation to join a hunting association constituted interference with the negative right of freedom of conscience. In other words, the applicant was forced to act against his conscience, in breach of his right to conscientious objection under Article 9.",

This state of affairs ought now to improve. There are plans to bring in a new Act on veterinary surgeons, along the lines of the Hamburg legislation governing doctors. According to Dr. Jürgen Arndt, veterinary surgeon and Chairman of the Hamburg Land Association which is part of the Federal Association of Veterinary Surgeons (Bundesverband praktischer Tierärzte e.V.), ‘ it will also regulate the emergency night service ’. At present, it is true, a few clinics voluntarily provide an emergency service from time to time, and [other] veterinary surgeons also help, but this is not on a regular basis and does not give pet-owners security. They only do it voluntarily.\"",

The journalist then quoted the applicant as saying: \"It was high time; ... [the cat] would not have survived the night.\"",

Of course these are not all emergency cases. Sometimes advice over the telephone is all that is needed. ’\"",

Believing that an emergency service organised on a rota basis \"would not release clinics from dispensing their voluntary service but would lessen the strain on them\", Dr. Arndt said that he was actively trying to promote such a service. He added that the appropriate Hamburg authorities envisaged drafting the Act on veterinary surgeons during the fourth quarter of the year. Until it came into force, owners of animals would have to call one veterinary surgeon after another - or else the police, who would normally be prepared to help them.",

In fact, there were important indications pointing in the opposite direction. The author of the article had declared that Dr. Barthold ’ s name had been mentioned without his knowledge. It could be inferred from her testimony that the applicant had not asked for his identity to be divulged and must have expected not to find mention of it in the newspaper. He might thus have believed - as indeed he asserted - that the Hamburger Abendblatt would do no more than discuss the deplorable situation brought about by the absence of a night service.

The question whether the applicant had taken care, or at least endeavoured, to prevent his name and clinic being given prominence over his fellow practitioners had been impossible to elucidate - and this should not operate to Dr. Barthold ’ s detriment - as the journalist had refused to give any further evidence, on the justified ground that she was not obliged to disclose her sources."

That Rule did not unreasonably limit Dr. Barthold ’ s right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 5 of the Basic Law, for there was nothing to prevent him from freely stating his opinion and in particular from criticising deplorable situations, even if this had the inevitable effect of producing publicity favourable to himself. The Agency was not seeking to restrain Dr. Barthold from making public pronouncements about veterinary assistance. Its application was concerned solely with a given form of conduct comprising - \"cumulatively!\" - several aspects: the giving of Dr. Barthold ’ s full name, the reproduction of his photograph, the mention of his being director of the Fuhlsbüttel veterinary clinic and the statement that, at least between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. on working days, animal lovers in Hamburg would get sore fingers trying to telephone a veterinary surgeon willing to help them, plus one of the three assertions set out in the Agency ’ s grounds of appeal (and, previously, in the interim injunction of 15 September 1978 - see paragraph 18 above).",

Such publicity exceeded the bounds of objective comment on matters of justified concern for the applicant. If in the future he were to supply the press with information necessary for the writing of an article, he should, in order to avoid any infringement of Rule 7, paragraph (a), of the Rules of Professional Conduct, ensure beforehand that the text to be published did not involve any unlawful publicity or advertising, by reserving a right of correction or by agreeing on the form of the article with the journalist.",

His intention of enhancing his own competitivity to the detriment of his competitors was to be presumed in the case of this type of publication, and that presumption was not rebutted in the circumstances. It mattered little (unerheblich) that he may additionally or even primarily have been pursuing other objectives, as there was an act done for the purposes of commercial competition as long as the intent to stimulate such competition had not been entirely overriden by other motives (\"nicht völlig hinter sonstigen Beweggründen verschwindet\").",

It was true that the press had itself taken up the case of \"Shalen\" and had invited Dr. Barthold to comment only after being informed of the incident by the animal ’ s owner. However, the applicant had, by his interview, greatly influenced the content of the article and, what was more, had authorised a photograph to be taken of himself. He had thereby provided the opportunity for producing the article in question, with its character of publicity.",

Although he retracted those statements on 29 March and 6 April 1979, he had not shown that he had insisted on publication without inclusion of such details. The testimony of the journalist was not conclusive on this point. It was not necessary to take evidence from Dr. Arndt, because Dr. Barthold had unquestionably allowed photographs to be taken. That being so, he ought not to have contented himself with obtaining a verbal promise - as he claimed to have done - that he would not himself appear in one of the photographs. Whilst he claimed to have told the journalist that the Rules of Professional Conduct prohibited advertising and publicity, he was wrong to have passed on to her the responsibility of writing an article which complied with those Rules.",

These statements, which in part gave incorrect information, went beyond the objective expression of opinion and amounted to commercial advertising.

Unlike the first two of these provisions, the third emanated from the Veterinary Surgeons ’ Council (see paragraphs 11 and 26 above) and not directly from parliament. It is nonetheless to be regarded as a \"law\" within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) of the Convention. The competence of the Veterinary Surgeons ’ Council in the sphere of professional conduct derives from the independent rule-making power that the veterinary profession - in company with other liberal professions - traditionally enjoys, by parliamentary delegation, in the Federal Republic of Germany (see notably the judgment of 9 May 1972 by the Federal Constitutional Court, Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, vol. 33, pp. 125-171). Furthermore, it is a competence exercised by the Council under the control of the State, which in particular satisfies itself as to observance of national legislation, and the Council is obliged to submit its rules of professional conduct to the Land Government for approval (sections 8 (3) and 18 of the 1964 Act - see paragraphs 11 and 26 above)."

In his submission, the relevant legislation did not fix the limits of freedom of expression with sufficient clarity to indicate in advance to each member of the veterinary profession the dividing line between what was permitted and what was not; in particular, section 1 of the 1909 Act was couched in extremely vague terms.",

Such considerations are especially cogent in the sphere of conduct governed by the 1909 Act, namely competition, this being a subject where the relevant factors are in constant evolution in line with developments in the market and in means of communication. Finally, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal based its judgment of 24 January 1980 on a combined application of section 1 of the 1909 Act and paragraph (a) of Rule 7 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which is a clearer and more detailed provision."

The civil courts had no jurisdiction to apply the Rules of Professional Conduct; failure to observe the requirements of those Rules could not automatically entail violation of the 1909 Act, a text which, moreover, was inapplicable to the liberal professions; the ordinary courts had interpreted Rule 7, paragraph (a), differently from the professional tribunals; finally, the Central Agency lacked locus standi to sue him.",

It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply the domestic law: the national authorities are, in the nature of things, particularly qualified to settle the issues arising in this connection (see, mutatis mutandis, the Winterwerp judgment of 24 October 1979, Series A no. 33, p. 20, para. 46; the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, pp. 19-20, para. 43).

The Hanseatic Court of Appeal grounded its decision on the protection of the \"rights of others\" and there is no cause for believing that it was pursuing other objectives alien to the Convention.

The statements that the applicant was restrained by the judgment of 24 January 1980 from repeating denigrated his fellow veterinary surgeons and were in part erroneous; by reason of the form they took and the type of publication in which they appeared, these statements went beyond objective criticism and amounted to advertising incompatible with the Rules of Professional Conduct. Although Dr. Barthold was not himself the author of the article in the Hamburger Abendblatt, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal was not mistaken to hold him responsible.",

Being circumscribed within narrow limits, it did not bar Dr. Barthold from expressing an opinion on the issue of a night veterinary service in Hamburg. The Commission had exaggerated the interest of the people of Hamburg for a statutory scheme for such a service. Nor did the penalties that the applicant risked incurring if he were to repeat the prohibited statements fall foul of the principle of proportionality, since they amounted to no more than an \"abstract threat\" that the domestic courts would have to implement in the event of wrongful conduct in the light of the particular circumstances obtaining at that time.",

The prohibition on his publicly disseminating his opinion together with an indication of his name and professional activities struck at the very essence of his freedom of expression, as did the precautions that the Hanseatic Court of Appeal directed him to observe in his contacts with the press.

The judgment was thus liable, directly or indirectly, to render the task of the press more difficult and to reduce the range of information supplied to readers, a result contrary to one of the objectives of a \"democratic society\".

The necessity for restricting that freedom for one of the purposes listed in Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) must be convincingly established.",

He was, however, directed not to supplement his opinion, when accompanied by such indications, with certain factual examples drawn from his own experience and illustrating the difficulties encountered by animal owners in obtaining the assistance of a veterinary surgeon during the night.",

The injunction issued on 24 January 1980 does not achieve a fair balance between the two interests at stake. According to the Hanseatic Court of Appeal, there remains an intent to act for the purposes of commercial competition, within the meaning of section 1 of the 1909 Act, as long as that intent has not been entirely overriden by other motives (\"nicht völlig hinter sonstigen Beweggründen verschwindet\" - see paragraph 22 above). A criterion as strict as this in approaching the matter of advertising and publicity in the liberal professions is not consonant with freedom of expression. Its application risks discouraging members of the liberal professions from contributing to public debate on topics affecting the life of the community if ever there is the slightest likelihood of their utterances being treated as entailing, to some degree, an advertising effect. By the same token, application of a criterion such as this is liable to hamper the press in the performance of its task of purveyor of information and public watchdog."

Following this instruction the applicants submitted unsigned minutes dated 26 October 1997, which reflect a different agenda and different decisions. These new minutes contain an express resolution for the founding of Ilinden, for the adoption of its articles of association and the electing of a management committee. The heading of these minutes indicates that seventeen persons were founders. An additional, signed version of these minutes bears the signatures of fifteen persons. Three of the alleged founders ... have not signed the minutes of 26 October 1997, while the minutes state that the resolution for the founding of the association was adopted by unanimity. However, these persons have signed the [first version of the minutes], which contain the resolution to re-register Ilinden. [During the hearing] on 29 September 1998 the members of the management committee averred that there had only been one meeting, [which took place] on 26 October 1997. In view of these circumstances, the court considers that it has not been categorically established that a resolution for the founding of Ilinden was adopted on 26 October 1997. It is unclear who the founders were, because there are two versions of the minutes of the same date, signed by different persons and having different contents. Thus, one of the absolute prerequisites of section 136(1) of the [Persons and Family Act of 1949 ] – a resolution for the founding the association – is missing.",

Alongside the articles the applicants have submitted a separate sheet, stating: ‘ The articles of association of Ilinden were discussed and adopted at the founding meeting on 26 October 1997 ’. Only the signatures of the members of the management committee follow. The presentation of articles of association signed by the founders is an absolute prerequisite for [registration]. On this ground alone – the failure to comply with the requirements of section 136(1) of the [Persons and Family Act of 1949 ] – the registration of [Ilinden] must be refused.",
                "The court considers it necessary to note that, alongside the above-mentioned [reasons to refuse registration], there are a number of serious discrepancies between the submitted articles of association and the laws of [ Bulgaria ], which render the registration inadmissible.",
                "In clause 1 of its articles of association [Ilinden] defines itself as a ‘ Macedonian national organisation on ethnical basis and origin ... which is the successor and continuer of the national liberation struggle of the Macedonian nation ... and of the Macedonian fighters who have fallen victim to the Bulgarian State terrorism and genocide ’.",
                "This text clearly shows that the association considers itself a ‘ successor ’ and continuer of ... the ‘ national liberation struggle of the Macedonian nation ’ ... The evoking of historical events in which the Bulgarian people fought for the protection of its national interests [and] for the restoration of the Bulgarian State is puzzling in the context of an activity which is to be carried out against this same State. It is not clear how an association may be a ‘ successor ’ of ‘ fighters fallen victim ’ but probably the applicants wanted to underscore that they intend to lead a ‘ national liberation struggle ’ on the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria through uprisings, which process is expected to lead to victims. Read this way, clause 1 of the articles raises serious doubts as to the peaceful means for the achievement of the goals of the association declared in clause 7. Clause 2(1) of the articles recognises the territorial integrity of the country, its laws and Constitution, but under a condition: ‘ if they are consistent with the international law and the international agreements on human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rights of minorities ’. The reservations relating to respect for the territorial integrity of the country continue in clause 2(2) of the articles, which introduces the concept of modification of the borders through ‘ negotiations ’. The association ’ s goal – to achieve a modification of the borders of Bulgaria through taking of territory away – is clearly spelled out in clause 3 of the articles, which indicates that [Ilinden] ‘ expresses and defends the civil, political, national and social and economic rights of Macedonians living on Macedonian land under Bulgarian occupation (jurisdiction) and of the Macedonians living in Bulgaria ’. The use of the term ‘ occupation ’ indicates that, according to the applicants, the Republic of Bulgaria includes forcibly annexed ‘ Macedonian ’ lands, for the liberation of which they will lead a ‘ national liberation struggle ’. This idea is underscored in several other provisions of the articles. Thus, clause 4 speaks of protection against Bulgarian ‘ assimilation ’ through cultural autonomy of Pirin Macedonia, which takes as a given that the population there is not Bulgarian, clause 5 [speaks of] ‘ taking the Macedonians out ’ of the state of [being subjected to] ‘ discrimination and assimilation ’ by the Bulgarian State.",
                "Clause 7 of the articles indicates that the association will organise peaceful assemblies, meetings, marches and demonstrations with demands for political rights, and that it will participate in elections through the nomination of candidates. Therefore, even though it claims to be a non-profit ‑ making association, Ilinden proclaims that it will carry out a political activity within the meaning of Article 11 § 3 of the Constitution [of 1991] and section 13(3) of the Political Parties Act [of 1990].",

An association which pursues political goals such as those clearly designated by the applicants here may not be registered [as such].",

Even assuming that this was not the case, registration was impossible, because Ilinden ’ s aims were in reality political, as indicated by its declarations that it was a continuer of the “national liberation struggle of the Macedonian nation” and that its founders were “ spiritual successors of ‘ the Macedonian fighters which had fallen victim of the Bulgarian state terrorism and genocide ’ ”, which was impermissible for a non ‑ profit ‑ making association.

On the contrary, all incidents referred to by the Government had been provocative actions of the authorities who had tried to hamper the organisation ’ s registration. Ilinden ’ s articles of association did not contain any calls to violence. Ilinden did not have political goals; it was conceived as a cultural and educational organisation. Its aim was not to deny the Bulgarian character of certain geographical regions or to cause a rift between different groups of the population, but to protect the rights and freedoms of a part of the citizens of Bulgaria. The Government ’ s averment that Ilinden ’ s goal was to seek secession of Pirin Macedonia was not supported by any evidence.

The fact that its articles of association spoke of continuation of the “national liberation struggle” could not change this conclusion. The organisation had been founded as an educational organisation which would attain its goals exclusively through peaceful means. Opposing state genocide and terror was not illegal. On the contrary, it was a national and an international priority.

One of the aims of the organisation was to protect these rights.

The minutes of the founding meeting, as well as the adopted articles of association, had to be signed by all founders. An association could only be registered if these conditions had been met. Despite the fact that the Blagoevgrad Regional Court had twice indicated to the applicants the deficiencies in the documents they had presented, they had failed to comply with these legal requirements. The Blagoevgrad Regional Court had held that “[o]n this ground alone – the failure to comply with the requirements of section 136(1) of the [Persons and Family Act of 1949 ] – the registration of [Ilinden] [had to] be refused”. The Sofia Court of Appeals had likewise found that the imperative rule of section 136 (1) of the Persons and Family Act of 1949 had not been complied with. The applicants had not submitted a signed copy of the articles, but only two separate documents which had no legal value. The Supreme Court of Cassation had also found that the conclusion that the prerequisites for registration had been missing had been supported by the submitted documents, in particular the articles of association. These findings by the domestic courts indicated that the applicants had not complied with the formal requirements of the law. On the other hand, the refusal to register Ilinden did not preclude the applicants from submitting a fresh registration request.

Ilinden suffered the consequences of not being registered and thus not having legal personality on a number of occasions when it sought to organise public events. In several instances the authorities did not reply to its notifications on the ground that it had not been registered, and the courts sometimes refused to examine its applications for judicial review because they had been submitted on behalf of a nonexistent legal person (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, §§ 21, 25, 29 and 30; and The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Ivanov, §§ 19, 24, 43 and 49, both cited above )."

It observes, however, that the refusal to register Ilinden was based on the provisions of the Constitution of 1991, the Persons and Family Act of 1949 and several other statutes. In these circumstances, and recalling that it is primarily for the national courts to interpret and apply domestic law, the Court is prepared to accept that the interference in question was prescribed by law (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others v.

That citizens should be able to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be deprived of any meaning. The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned. Certainly States have a right to satisfy themselves that an association ’ s aim and activities are in conformity with the rules laid down in legislation, but they must do so in a manner compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions (see Sidiropoulos and Others, cited above, pp. 16 14 ‑ 15, § 40)."

For pluralism is also built on the genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs, artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively ( see Gorzelik and Others, cited above, § 92)."

Such a link is particularly relevant where – as here – the authorities ’ intervention against an association was, at least in part, in reaction to its views and statements (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 85 in fine )."

The Sofia Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Cassation did not mention the first deficiency and relied only on the second one, apparently because the first had been cured by the presentation of revised minutes of the founding meeting to the Sofia Court of Appeals (see paragraph 18 above)."

However, it seems that later, in the proceedings before the Sofia Court of Appeals, the applicants rectified these deficiencies by submitting (a) a revised copy of the minutes of the founding meeting and (b) a list of signatures of the founders of Ilinden who were not members of its management committee, apparently with a view to establishing that all founders agreed with the articles of association. The Sofia Court of Appeals did not make clear whether it had taken these fresh documents into account. Nor did the Supreme Court of Cassation, which confined itself to stating that a signed copy of the articles meant a copy featuring the signatures of the founders, “not separate lists and minutes” (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above). However, section 136 (1) of the Persons and Family Act of 1949 did not specify the technical manner in which the articles had to be signed. It only provided that they had to be “signed by the founders” (see paragraph 26 above), the apparent reason for this being to make clear that all founders agreed with their text."

However, in view of the apparent lack of more detailed guidelines in this respect, it is of the opinion that it could be accepted that by submitting two separate sheets with signatures – initially one with the signatures of the members of the management committee and later one with the signatures of the remainder of the founders – the applicants did establish that all founders agreed with Ilinden ’ s articles."

                "71. In the view of the Sofia Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Cassation, Ilinden only allowed “Macedonians” to become its members, which was discriminatory (see paragraph 19 and 21 above). That conclusion was based on an apparently distorted citation of the relevant clause of its articles, which in full provides that “[e]very Macedonian, as well as a citizen of another ethnicity, may become a member of the organisation” (see paragraph 15 above)."
            ],
            [
                "72. Further, the Sofia Court of Appeals held that, since one of Ilinden ’ s goals was to seek an “autocephalous status of the Macedonian church in Pirin Macedonia ”, it was envisaging religious activities and accordingly had to register with the Council of Ministers prior to seeking court registration (see paragraph 19 above). However, the provision requiring such registration, section 133a of the Persons and Family Act of 1949, applies only to denominations and religious education organisations, i.e. entities engaging in preaching or religious education (see paragraph 26 above). It does not seem that Ilinden falls into any of these categories."

Finally, all levels of court held that the “holding of peaceful assemblies, meetings, marches and demonstrations” and the “nomination of independent candidates” in elections were political activities allowed only to political parties (see paragraphs 17, 19 and 21 above). This was also argued by the Government in their pleadings (see paragraph 51 above). Consequently, Ilinden thus had to register as a political party and not as a non ‑ profit ‑ making association. However, the proscription of Article 12 § 2 of the Constitution of 1991 (see paragraph 25 above) in essence means that only parties may participate in elections as such, not that an organisation not registered as a political party may not support independent candidates for elections, which seems to be a routine occurrence in Bulgarian politics. As to section 13 of the Political Parties Act of 1990 (see paragraph 27 above), it only prohibited associations, if not registered as political parties, from carrying out “organised“ political activities and not in general but only “ on the premises of enterprises, government agencies and organisations ”. According to the definition in that same section, “ organised political activities” meant the holding of meetings, demonstrations, assemblies and other forms of campaigning “ in favour of or against a political party or an election candidate ”, not just any organisation of such events. On the other hand, Article 43 § 1 of the Constitution of 1991 and section 2 of the Meetings and Marches Act of 1990 expressly provide that anyone, including associations, may organise meetings, marches and assemblies (see paragraphs 25 and 28 above)."

In view of the foregoing, the Court, while accepting that it is primarily for the domestic courts to interpret and apply domestic law, is likewise not persuaded that their holdings about the purported substantive divergences of Ilinden ’ s articles with the Constitution and the laws of the country constituted a sufficient basis for the impugned interference.",

                "75. The third group of arguments grounding the refusal to register Ilinden, relied on by the Government in their pleadings and apparently based on the reasoning of the Blagoevgrad Regional Court, essentially resumed to saying that by proclaiming that there was a “Macedonian minority” in Bulgaria, by proposing to defend its allegedly infringed rights and by harbouring separatist views, Ilinden would, if registered, be dangerous for the territorial integrity of the country, for the public order and for the rights and freedoms of others (see paragraphs 17, 44, 45, 49 and 50 above). These arguments largely coincide with the reasoning of the Constitutional Court, which declared a sibling organisation, the political party UMO Ilinden – PIRIN, unconstitutional on 29 February 2000 (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden – PIRIN and Others, cited above, §§ 21 ‑ 27 ), and with the reasons invoked by all levels of court to deny Ilinden registration in 1990 ‑ 91 and again in 2002 ‑ 04 (see paragraphs 11, 12, 22, 23 and 24 above )."
            ],
            [
                "76. However, the mere fact that a group of persons calls for autonomy or even requests secession of part of a country ’ s territory – thus demanding fundamental constitutional and territorial changes – cannot automatically justify interferences with their rights under Article 11. Expressing separatist views and demanding territorial changes in speeches, demonstrations, or program documents does not amount per se to a threat to a country ’ s territorial integrity and national security (see, mutatis mutandis, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 97; Freedom and Democracy Party ( ÖZDEP ) v. Turkey [GC], no. 23885/94, § 41, ECHR 1999 ‑ VIII; and Yazar and Others v. Turkey, nos. 22723/93, 22724/93 and 22725/93, §§ 57 and 58, ECHR 2002 ‑ II ). However shocking and unacceptable certain views or words used might have appeared to the authorities and the majority of the population, and however illegitimate Ilinden ’ s demands might have been, their suppression does not seem warranted in the circumstances of the case. In a democratic society based on the rule of law, political ideas which challenge the existing order and whose realisation is advocated by peaceful means must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression through the exercise of the right of association as well as by other lawful means (see, mutatis mutandis, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 97). It is true that the style of Ilinden ’ s articles was virulent and the criticism of the Bulgarian authorities ’ actions was acerbic, as demonstrated by, inter alia, the use of the words “State terrorism” and “genocide” (see paragraph 15 above). However, as the Court has had many times occasion to stress, freedom of expression protects not only “information” and “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as matter of indifference, but also those that offend, shock or disturb, including language as harsh as the one at issue here (see Ceylan, cited above, § § 32 ‑ 34 )."

As regards the alleged propagation of violence, the Court recalls that the allegations of Ilinden ’ s violent intentions were examined in Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and were dismissed (see §§ 99 ‑ 103 of the judgment). Nor is there any evidence in the case at hand which may lead to a different conclusion, despite the Blagoevgrad Regional Court ’ s holding that Ilinden ’ s “articles raise[d] serious doubts as to the peaceful means for the achievement of the goals of the association” (see paragraph 17 above). In this connection, the Court considers that account should be taken of the fact that the association ’ s declarations apparently included an element of exaggeration as it sought to attract attention (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 102). Moreover, in case it subsequently tried to engage in any such action, the authorities would not have been powerless; under former Article 146(1) of the Persons and Family Act of 1949 and section 13(1)(3)(b) of the Non ‑ Profit ‑ Making Legal Persons Act of 2000, the competent regional court could dissolve the association if its functioning proved to be contrary to the law, its articles, or public order (see paragraphs 26 and 29 above, Sidiropoulos and Others, cited above, p. 1618, § 46, and, as an example to the contrary, Gorzelik and Others, cited above, § 101)."

Moreover, the applicants relied on Article 8 of the Law on State Registration, which required that all “deficiencies” ( çatışmazlıqlar ) in registration documents be identified at once and notified to applicants (see paragraph 35 below). The applicants asked the court to recognise that the denial of State registration to HRC had constituted a violation of their rights under Article 58 of the Constitution (right to association) and Article 11 of the Convention, and to order the Ministry of Justice to register HRC."

                "55. The importance of the acquisition of a legal personality for NGOs has been stressed by the ECtHR, according to which “the most important aspect of the right to freedom of association is that citizens should be able to create a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest. Without this, that right would have no practical meaning”.",

                "58. While NGOs can operate without legal personality, on an informal basis, the acquisition of the personality is the precondition for various benefits. It is important to underline that only registered NGOs can be recipients of grants under the 1998 Law on Grants, and only they can enjoy tax preferences under the 2000 Tax Code. Since grants are the main source of revenues for many NGOs, the act of registration is far from being a mere formality devoid of any practical importance.",

Recorded practice shows that some of the NGOs which applied for registration have never got formal decision, and those that have got it, often needed to wait for an extensive period of time.",
                "61. The registration is currently ensured by the Ministry of Justice under a rather complicated procedure which is regulated by the 2000 Law on NGOs and the 2003 Law on State Registration and the State Registry of Legal Entities ... State registration of NGOs is also dealt with in the Civil Code (Articles 47 and 48).",

In exceptional cases, when there is necessity for further investigation during the check, the period can be prolonged for additional 30 days (Art. 8 of the Law on State Registration). While the time-limit is rather long compared to the regulation in other countries of the Council of Europe, it could be accepted, were it meticulously respected and were the extension of the period truly reserved for “exceptional cases”. Yet, several studies realised by the OSCE show that this is not always the case and that the applications of many NGOs, especially human rights NGOs, are for some reasons or even without any reasons treated as “exceptional”.",

In 2003, a Law on State Registration and the State Registry of Legal Entities was adopted.

In order to acquire legal personality, NGOs have to register under the procedure regulated by the 2003 Law on State Registration and the State Registry of Legal Entities. While public associations may operate without legal personality, on an informal basis, branches and representations of foreign NGOs may not. Moreover, the acquisition of legal personality is a precondition for various benefits. Most importantly, only registered NGOs can, on behalf of the legal personality, open a bank account, buy property, receive grants under the 1998 Law on Grants, and enjoy tax preferences under the 2000 Tax Code.",

Mandatory registration for associations in order to acquire legal personality is not as such in breach of the right to freedom of association, as the Commission has observed in its 2011 Opinion.

Although the law applicable at the material time had not explicitly prevented the operation of unregistered NGOs, possession of legal-entity status enabled an NGO to function effectively by allowing it to open a bank account, seek and receive funding as an organisation, hire employees as a legal entity, acquire an official stamp and other prerequisites essential for the proper and effective functioning of the NGO.

Within the meaning of the relevant law, a chairman was not a “legal representative”. A legal representative was an external person authorised by power of attorney to act on behalf of an association. In the present case, the founders had not appointed a legal representative upon founding HRC.

The way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned. States have a right to satisfy themselves that an association ’ s aim and activities are in conformity with the rules laid down in legislation, but they must do so in a manner compatible with their obligations under the Convention and subject to review by the Convention institutions (see, among other authorities, Gorzelik and Others v.

                "79. In such circumstances, the Court notes that Article 5.4.1 of the Law on State Registration, as interpreted and applied by the domestic authorities at the material time, was not sufficiently foreseeable to the persons concerned. It lacked sufficient precision regarding who was considered a legal entity ’ s “legal representative” whose powers should be specified in the decision founding a legal entity, and in what circumstances he or she could be considered to have been appointed."

The Court recognises that it is not possible to attain absolute certainty in the framing of laws, and that many of them are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy, cited above, § 143). The level of precision required of domestic legislation – which cannot in any case provide for every eventuality – depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 110)."

Moreover, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, its application involves an inevitable element of judicial interpretation, since there will always be a need for clarification of doubtful points and for adaptation to particular circumstances. A margin of doubt in relation to borderline facts does not by itself make a legal provision unforeseeable in its application. Nor does the mere fact that a provision is capable of more than one construction mean that it fails to meet the requirement of “foreseeability” for the purposes of the Convention. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain, taking into account the changes in everyday practice (see Gorzelik and Others, cited above, § 65, and Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 91, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI)."

The applicants consistently put forward a reasoned argument before the domestic courts that, in a situation where they had not chosen to appoint a legal representative, lack of specification of a representative ’ s powers could not constitute an omission in the founding document and therefore could not be grounds for refusing their registration request. They maintained that the Ministry of Justice had incorrectly interpreted the law. Given that the relevant legal provision lacked sufficient precision and was open to various plausible interpretations, the arguments put before the domestic courts required them to approach the assessment of the lawfulness of the Ministry of Justice ’ s actions by attempting, as a first step, to put forward a reasonable interpretation of that provision."

Instead, by and large, they limited themselves to upholding the Ministry ’ s actions as lawful without any detailed reasoning, avoiding the examination of the crux of the applicant ’ s arguments.

The Court notes that Article 8 of the Law on State Registration, which was applicable specifically to non-commercial organisations, provided that the procedure for State registration should take, as a general rule, no longer than forty days. Where the Ministry of Justice identified “deficiencies” in the documents that could not serve as a basis for a definitive refusal to register an association, it could return the registration documents for rectification. In such a case, it had to give the founders a twenty-day period for rectification of the deficiencies. Moreover, it required the Ministry of Justice to identify any deficiencies in the registration documents in one review (see Article 8.3 of the Law on State Registration in paragraph 36 above). Once documents were resubmitted following the rectification of any deficiencies, the Ministry of Justice had to either register the association or issue a formal notice of definitive refusal to register (see Articles 8.4 and 11.3.4 of the Law on State Registration in paragraphs 36-37 above)."

Also, as noted above, Article 11.3.4 provided that registration could also be refused if the deficiencies identified by the registering authority had not been rectified within the time period specified in Article 8.3 of the Law on State Registration (see paragraph 37 above)."

Seen in relation to this context, it would appear that the purpose of the safeguards provided in Article 8 of the Law on State Registration, which replaced the old law, was to prevent delays in the State registration procedure, by placing a time-limit on the overall examination period, requiring the Ministry of Justice to identify all “deficiencies that could not serve as a basis for the refusal [of registration]” in one review, and allowing the return of documents for rectification only once."

However, while, as noted above, that provision provided grounds for a definitive formal refusal to register, the relevant letters of the Ministry of Justice did not state that registration had been formally “refused”, but merely that the documents were being “returned” (the term used in Article 8.3 of the Law). In addition, the letters did not expressly provide for a twenty-day rectification period."

As to the intended name of the applicant association, the Court notes that it contained a reference to “Bektashi”, like the name of the already registered religious group “Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia”. The Skopje Court of Appeal stated that the term “Bektashi” was “decisive and represented a synonym for the religious entity”. It accordingly held that the registration of the applicant association under the intended name would create confusion among the believers (see paragraph 30 above, mutatis mutandis, Bekir-Ousta and Others v. Greece, no. 35151/05, § 14, 11 October 2007; Emin and Others v. Greece, no. 34144/05, § 10, 27 March 2008; and Macedonian House of Civilization v. Greece, no. 1295/10, § 8, 9 July 2015 ). The Constitutional Court relied on a more detailed explanation (see paragraph 33 above), with which the Court, in principle, agrees (see the OOA case, § 111). However, similarly to the OOA case, the Court considers that the name chosen for the applicant association in the present case was sufficiently specific to distinguish it from the “Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia”. Another distinguishing element in the intended name of the applicant association was the proposed form of its organisation (religious community) which was different from the form of association of the “Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia”. Lastly, the Court notes that the domestic courts did not provide any substantive reasons to justify the potential risk of confusion among believers in the present case.

It argued that there was no other religious entity registered under the same name. In this connection, it submitted that there were six registered religious entities that contained the term “Christian” in their name and two registered entities that used the term “Islamic”. The intention of the 2007 Act was not to ban the use of terms that had a generic and not exclusive meaning. Otherwise, it would mean that the law would only allow the registration of one religious entity containing the term Christian, Islamic, Bektashi, Jewish, Tarikat, Buddhist, Zen or Zoroastric. It also argued that it had sought registration as a religious community, as opposed to “Ehlibeyt Bektashi”, which was registered as a religious group. Its intended name was substantially different from the name of that entity; it had existed for decades and centuries, as was evident from the directory and correspondence with various State institutions. As regards the doctrinal sources, it argued that they could not be regarded as official insignia within the meaning of section 10(1) of the 2007 Act. Doctrinal sources could be identical for multiple religious entities (as the Bible was common for Orthodox Christians and Catholics, and the Koran was common for the Islamic Religious Community, the Bektashi Order and Shia or Sunni Muslims ). They were of an ideological nature and were not constant, nor could they be interpreted in that way. Official insignia concerned symbols (crosses, crescents, graphic symbols ), a flag or a totem that represented something. In this connection, it stated that the interpretation which the court had given regarding its doctrinal sources, namely that they were identical to the doctrinal sources of all Islamic teaching, was wrong. The mere fact that the court had interpreted its doctrinal sources implied that the State was not separated from religion. Furthermore, if that interpretation had been based on some material, it had not been communicated to the applicant association. Nor had it been given the opportunity to present its views at a public hearing. In this connection, it requested that the Court of Appeal hold a public hearing. Lastly, it complained that the refusal of registration was discriminatory."

The national authorities, including the Constitutional Court, have accepted that it had the requisite standing. It was only in the proceedings upon the constitutional appeal that the second applicant complained in his own name. In the absence of any indication that the applicant association had no capacity to lodge the application with this Court, it considers that the individual applicants could not themselves claim to be victims of a violation resulting from the domestic authorities ’ refusal of re-registration, which affected only the applicant association as such (see Jehovah ’ s Witnesses of Moscow v. Russia, no. 302/02, § 168, 10 June 2010 and Church of Scientology Moscow and others v. Russia (dec.), no. 18147/02, 28 October 2004). Similar considerations apply to the registration proceedings.

The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. Once this burden has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement ( ibid ., §§ 71 and 77)."

Its main grievance was therefore that it had been unable to preserve that status so as to act collectively in the religious sphere. Accordingly, the Court will examine whether a constitutional appeal would have been an effective remedy that the applicant association should have used regarding the application of a legal provision, which prevented religious associations from maintaining that status unless they had been registered at least ten years before the 2007 Act entered into force (see paragraph 39 above)."

It also noted the Constitutional Court ’ s practice in 2009 to 2010, at the time when the recognition proceedings had been completed (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above), of declining jurisdiction to deal with appeals of an association or organisation through which individual members acted collectively in a field of mutual interest ( ibid ., § 70). Similarly, the Constitutional Court rejected constitutional appeals of individuals submitted in their name and on behalf of the non-registered religious associations with which they were associated. In so doing, it stated that it “ha [ d ] no jurisdiction to decide on the rights and interests of citizens in specific cases before administrative and judicial bodies ... ”; that “ [ it ] cannot rule on the request for the protection of human rights and freedoms in relation to specific final decisions of competent bodies”; and that “the [ assessment of ] the application of the law by the registration court ... was beyond its jurisdiction” (see ibid ., §§ 20, 21, 36 and 55). Lastly, and more importantly, the Court observes that all those cases concerned registration proceedings (similar to the proceedings described in paragraphs 23-33 above ) in which the competent authorities had refused to register a newly established religious association.

The existing religious entities that did not fulfil the criteria specified in section 35(2) of the 2007 Act were not to be recorded in the court register and were automatically stripped of their status as religious associations by operation of law.

Furthermore, the Government did not identify any “pressing social need” which the impugned interference served. In the Court ’ s view, exclusive reliance on such a formal ground, without reference being made to any reason related to the applicant association ’ s operation before the 2007 Act had entered into force, can hardly appear justified in respect of religious associations which are long established in the country and familiar to the competent authorities, as is the case with the applicant association (see paragraphs 10-15 and 32 above, Kimlya and Others v.

As to the intended name of the applicant association, the Court notes that it contained a reference to “Bektashi”, like the name of the already registered religious group “Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia”. The Skopje Court of Appeal stated that the term “Bektashi” was “decisive and represented a synonym for the religious entity”. It accordingly held that the registration of the applicant association under the intended name would create confusion among the believers (see paragraph 30 above, mutatis mutandis, Bekir-Ousta and Others v.

The Constitutional Court relied on a more detailed explanation (see paragraph 33 above), with which the Court, in principle, agrees (see the OOA case, § 111). However, similarly to the OOA case, the Court considers that the name chosen for the applicant association in the present case was sufficiently specific to distinguish it from the “Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia”. Another distinguishing element in the intended name of the applicant association was the proposed form of its organisation (religious community) which was different from the form of association of the “Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia”. Lastly, the Court notes that the domestic courts did not provide any substantive reasons to justify the potential risk of confusion among believers in the present case.

The other ground relied on by the domestic courts concerned the doctrinal sources of the applicant association, which they found to be identical to the doctrinal sources of the already registered “Islamic Religious Community”. That conclusion was made on the basis of an assessment by the domestic courts of the applicant association ’ s fundamental precepts and their comparison with the precepts of the “Islamic Religious Community” (see paragraph 32 above). No prior consultation with the applicants preceded that finding, notwithstanding that the registration court could have asked for an additional explanation (see paragraph 23 above). In the Court ’ s view, such an assessment and interpretation of the applicant association ’ s basic tenets of creed was incompatible with the State ’ s role as a neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, which excludes, save for very exceptional cases, any discretion on the part of the State to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see paragraph 43 above, also Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 107, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI ). Furthermore, no explanation was given for the resulting finding of this fresh scrutiny carried out under the 2007 Act, having regard to the fact that both the applicant association and the “Islamic Religious Community” had been active and had already existed in the respondent State for many years (see paragraphs 6, 27 and 32 above) and there was no argument that their doctrinal sources in the meantime had changed or had led to confusion among believers."

In these circumstances, and having regard to the fact that the applicant association had lawfully existed and operated in the respondent State as an independent religious community for many years before the 2007 Act had entered into force, the Court considers that the reasons for refusing registration of the applicant association should have been particularly weighty and compelling.

Accordingly, unless there are exceptional circumstances which justify dispensing with a hearing, the right to a public hearing under Article 6 § 1 implies a right to an oral hearing at least before one instance. A hearing may be dispensed with if a party unequivocally waives his or her right thereto and there are no questions of public interest making a hearing necessary. A waiver can be made explicitly or tacitly, in the latter case for example by refraining from submitting or maintaining a request for a hearing (see Juričić v. Croatia, no. 58222/09, § 87, 26 July 2011). A hearing may not be necessary, for example, when the case raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties ’ written observations (see Meimanis v.

Since the notion of “political activities” was not defined in any Hungarian law, it was not foreseeable whether or not a certain activity fell under the prohibition.

In their pleadings before the Court, the Government relied on Article 78 of the Hungarian Constitution (see paragraph 13 above) as regards the alleged contradiction between the constitutional restriction and the permissive legislation of a lower level and explained that the two were not in conflict but complemented each other. They maintained that in the Hungarian legal system it was the practice that certain provisions of the Constitution could properly be interpreted only if read together with legislation of a lower level completing and explaining their precise content. Contemporary legislative techniques often left it to laws lower in the hierarchy to define general notions used in higher laws – a law-making method not uncommon at least in continental legal systems and never in principle disapproved by the Convention organs. In any event, the Constitutional Court had the competence to rule on any potential contradiction between the Constitution and other legislation."

Furthermore, the legislation in force both prior and subsequent to the adoption of the 1994 Police Act and the 1995 Regulations met the requirements of foreseeability, the latter two instruments having merely recodified provisions already in force. Therefore, the constitutional restriction in question was “prescribed by law” at all times subsequent to its entry into force. Prior to 1 October 1994, the conditions governing various activities of a political nature, whereby police officers have always been permitted to exercise certain rights relating to freedom of expression, were laid down, inter alia, in Law no. 34 of 1989 on parliamentary elections, Law no. 55 of 1990 on the legal status of members of Parliament, Law no. 64 of 1990 on the election of members of local authorities and mayors, and Law no. 17 of 1989 on referenda (the right to collect “nomination coupons”, expound election programmes, promote candidates, organise election campaign meetings, nominate candidates, vote in and stand for elections to Parliament, local authorities and the office of mayor and to participate in referenda) and also in the 1990 Regulations (the right to join trade unions, associations and other organisations representing and protecting police officers’ interests, to participate in peaceful assemblies, make statements to the press, participate in radio or television programmes or publish works on politics, etc.) (see paragraphs 14 to 17 and 19 above)."

In its report the Commission, after examining the relevant domestic law as presented by the Government in the proceedings before it, observed that the 1994 Police Act and the 1995 Regulations had entered into force only in October 1994 and March 1995 respectively. The Commission, therefore, came to the conclusion that in the relevant period the impugned restriction had been based solely on Article 40/B § 4 of the Constitution. Moreover, it considered that the notion of “political activities” was vague and sweeping and that the Government had not adduced any case-law interpreting this term. The constitutional restriction itself was not, therefore, precise enough to enable the applicant to regulate his conduct in the matter. The Commission concluded that, the requirement of foreseeability thus not having been met, the interference was not “prescribed by law”."

In her submissions to the Court, the Commission’s Delegate explained that the various laws referred to by the Government in their memorial and, in particular, the 1990 Regulations, had been adopted prior to the impugned amendment to the Constitution. The only legal provisions which could be regarded as having further defined the constitutional restriction on political activities by police officers were to be found in the 1994 Police Act and the 1995 Regulations. Consequently, it was not until the 1994 Police Act and the 1995 Regulations came into force that the legal situation had met the requirement of foreseeability."
            ],
            [
                "34. According to the Court’s well-established case-law, one of the requirements flowing from the expression “prescribed by law” is foreseeability. Thus, a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, § 49, and the Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260-A, p. 19, § 40). The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain (see, mutatis mutandis, the Cantoni v. France judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, p. 1628, § 32). The level of precision required of domestic legislation – which cannot in any case provide for every eventuality – depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see the previously cited Vogt judgment, p. 24, § 48). Because of the general nature of constitutional provisions, the level of precision required of them may be lower than for other legislation."

The Court notes the Government’s submission that Article 40/B § 4 of the Constitution, which contains the generic term “political activities”, is subject to interpretation and is to be read in conjunction with complementary provisions contained in the various laws cited and the 1990 Regulations (see paragraphs 14 to 17, 19 and 31 above). As has been recalled many times in the Court’s case-law, it is primarily for the national authorities to interpret and apply domestic law (see, for example, the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993, Series A no. 266-B, pp. 35-36, § 25). In the absence of any domestic precedents to the opposite effect adduced by the applicant, the Court considers that the detailed provisions invoked by the Government cannot be held to be in contradiction with the general wording of the Constitution. Further, the adoption of the constitutional amendment in question did not result in the annulment of the 1990 Regulations, which were therefore in force when the impugned circular letters were issued. As a consequence, there appears to have existed at the relevant time a framework of provisions partly permitting – occasionally subject to authorisation – and partly restricting the participation of police officers in certain kinds of political activity."

As to the wording of these provisions, it is inevitable, in the Court’s opinion, that conduct which may entail involvement in political activities cannot be defined with absolute precision. It seems, therefore, acceptable for the 1990 Regulations (see paragraph 19 above) – as for the 1994 Police Act and the 1995 Regulations (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above) – to lay down the conditions for undertaking types of conduct and activities with potential political aspects, such as participation in peaceful assemblies, making statements to the press, participating in radio or television programmes, publications or joining trade unions, associations or other organisations representing and protecting police officers’ interests."

Even accepting that it might not be possible on occasions for police officers to determine with certainty whether a given action would or would not –against the background of the 1990 Regulations – fall foul of Article 40/B § 4 of the Constitution, it was nevertheless open to them to seek advice beforehand from their superior or clarification of the law by means of a court judgment."

In the present case the obligation imposed on certain categories of public officials including police officers to refrain from political activities is intended to depoliticise the services concerned and thereby to contribute to the consolidation and maintenance of pluralistic democracy in the country. The Court notes that Hungary is not alone, in that a number of Contracting States restrict certain political activities on the part of their police. Police officers are invested with coercive powers to regulate the conduct of citizens, in some countries being authorised to carry arms in the discharge of their duties. Ultimately the police force is at the service of the State. Members of the public are therefore entitled to expect that in their dealings with the police they are confronted with politically neutral officers who are detached from the political fray, to paraphrase the language of the recent judgment in the case of Ahmed and Others v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 2 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, pp. 2376-77, § 53, which judgment concerned the compatibility with Article 10 of restrictions on the involvement of senior local government officers in certain types of political activity). In the Court’s view, the desire to ensure that the crucial role of the police in society is not compromised through the corrosion of the political neutrality of its officers is one that is compatible with democratic principles.",
                "This objective takes on a special historical significance in Hungary because of that country’s experience of a totalitarian regime which relied to a great extent on its police’s direct commitment to the ruling party (see, mutatis mutandis, the previously cited Vogt judgment, p. 25, § 51).",

                "(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. Freedom of expression, as enshrined in Article 10, is subject to a number of exceptions which, however, must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established.",
                "(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court’s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts."
            ],
            [
                "43. In the same judgment the Court declared that “these principles apply also to civil servants. Although it is legitimate for a State to impose on civil servants, on account of their status, a duty of discretion, civil servants are individuals and, as such, qualify for the protection of Article 10 of the Convention. It therefore falls to the Court, having regard to the circumstances of each case, to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the fundamental right of the individual to freedom of expression and the legitimate interest of a democratic State in ensuring that its civil service properly furthers the purposes enumerated in Article 10 § 2. In carrying out this review, the Court will bear in mind that whenever civil servants’ right to freedom of expression is in issue the ‘duties and responsibilities’ referred to in Article 10 § 2 assume a special significance, which justifies leaving to the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate” to the legitimate aim in question (p. 26, § 53). Such considerations apply equally to military personnel (see the previously cited Engel and Others judgment, pp. 23 and 41-42, §§ 54 and 100) and police officers (see paragraph 26 above).",

The Government contended that for decades preceding Hungary’s return to democracy in 1989 to 1990, the police had been a self-avowed tool of the ruling party and had taken an active part in the implementation of the party policies. Career members of the police were expected to be politically committed to the ruling party. Given Hungary’s peaceful and gradual transformation towards pluralism without a general purge in the public administration, it was necessary to depoliticise, inter alia, the police and restrict the political activities of its members so that the public should no longer regard the police as a supporter of the totalitarian regime but rather as a guardian of democratic institutions."

Membership of that party was, in many social spheres, expected as a manifestation of the individual’s commitment to the regime. This expectation was even more pronounced within the military and the police, where party membership on the part of the vast majority of serving staff guaranteed that the ruling party’s political will was directly implemented. This is precisely the vice that rules on the political neutrality of the police are designed to prevent. It was not until 1989 that Hungarian society succeeded in building up the institutions of a pluralistic democracy, leading to the first multi-party parliamentary elections in more than forty years being held in 1990.

As to the extent of the restriction on the applicant’s freedom of expression, although the wording of Article 40/B § 4 might prima facie suggest that what is in issue is an absolute ban on political activities, an examination of the relevant laws shows that police officers have in fact remained entitled to undertake some activities enabling them to articulate their political opinions and preferences. Notably, whilst sometimes subject to restrictions imposed in the interest of the service, police officers have had the right to expound election programmes, promote and nominate candidates, organise election campaign meetings, vote in and stand for elections to Parliament, local authorities and the office of mayor, participate in referenda, join trade unions, associations and other organisations, participate in peaceful assemblies, make statements to the press, participate in radio or television programmes or publish works on politics (see paragraphs 14 to 20 above).

In this respect they mainly reiterated their arguments concerning Article 10 (see paragraphs 39 and 44 above) and maintained in particular that the prohibition on party membership on the part of police officers had been intended to contribute to the elimination of any direct party political influence on the police by severing the institutional links which had previously existed between the armed forces and the police on the one hand and political circles on the other. Furthermore, the restriction in question could not be regarded as disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued, since police officers’ right to freedom of association had been restricted exclusively in respect of political parties within the meaning of Law no. 33 of 1989 on political parties."

To be “lawful” for the purposes of that sentence, a restriction must be in accordance with the national law and devoid of arbitrariness. Having been prescribed by the Constitution, the restriction was to be considered as being in accordance with the national law. As regards arbitrariness, the Commission recalled that States must be given a wide discretion when ensuring the protection of their national security (see the Leander v. Sweden judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 25, § 59 in fine ). Against the background of Hungary’s recent history and the repercussions of a politically committed police force exploited for decades by a totalitarian regime, the Commission considered that the efforts to depoliticise the police could not be regarded as arbitrary. The prohibition was, therefore, also “lawful” within the wider meaning of that term in the second sentence of Article 11 § 2."

As recalled above in relation to Article 10, the concept of lawfulness in the Convention, apart from positing conformity with domestic law, also implies qualitative requirements in the domestic law such as foreseeability and, generally, an absence of arbitrariness (see paragraph 34 above)."

In so far as the applicant criticises the basis in domestic law of the impugned restriction (see paragraph 53 above), the Court reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities to interpret and apply domestic law, especially if there is a need to elucidate doubtful points (see the S.W. v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-B, p. 42, § 36, and also the previously cited Chorherr and Cantoni judgments). In the present case, however, the prohibition on membership of a political party by police officers as contained in Article 40/ B § 4 of the Constitution is in fact unambiguous (see paragraph 13 above) and it would not appear to be arguable that subordinate legislation introduced some four years earlier (Regulation 433 of Decree no. 1/1990 of 10 January 1990 – see paragraph 19 above) was capable of affecting the scope of this prohibition. In the circumstances the Court concludes that the legal position was sufficiently clear to enable the applicant to regulate his conduct and that the requirement of foreseeability was accordingly satisfied. Further, the Court finds no ground for holding the restriction imposed on the applicant’s exercise of his freedom of association to be arbitrary. The contested restriction was consequently “lawful” within the meaning of Article 11 § 2."

For the reasons previously given in relation to Article 10 (see paragraphs 41 and 46 to 48 above), the Court considers that, in any event, the interference with the applicant’s freedom of association satisfied those conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, the previously cited Vogt judgment, p. 31, § 68)."

In particular, the Minister indicated that he would dismiss anyone “who acted contrary to the ethical code of the police again”, that the first applicant’s representatives had “lost credibility”, that he was “not obliged to negotiate with those representatives”, and that he had sanctioned the first applicant’s president for making what he considered to be false statements in the course of the meeting of 25 October 2005."

As to whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court reiterates that lawful restrictions may be imposed on the exercise of trade - union rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State. However, it must also be borne in mind that the exceptions set out in Article 11 are to be construed strictly; only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restrictions on such parties'freedom of association. In determining whether a necessity within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 exists, the Contracting States have only a limited margin of appreciation, which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, including those given by independent courts ( see, for example, Sidiropoulos and Others v. Greece, 10 July 1998, § 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV )."

                "36. In the instant case, the Government's arguments provide no explanation as to how the absolute prohibition on forming trade unions, imposed on civil servants and public-sector contract workers in the communications field by Turkish law as applied at the time, met a “pressing social need”. The mere fact that “the legislation did not provide for such a possibility” is not sufficient to warrant a measure as radical as the dissolution of a trade union."

                "37. The Court considers that, at the material time, at least two arguments militated in favour of a strict interpretation of the limitation on civil servants'entitlement to form trade unions."

                "38. In the first place, Turkey had already ratified International Labour Organisation Convention no. 87. Article 2 of that convention secured to all workers, without any distinction between the public and private sectors, the unrestricted right to establish and join trade unions. If the Turkish courts ultimately decided that they could not apply that provision in the instant case, it was on the ground that, at the material time, the Turkish parliament had not yet enacted legislation on the implementation of Convention no. 87."

                "39. Furthermore, although Turkey was one of only two States ( the other being Greece ) that had not yet accepted Article 5 of the European Social Charter, the Committee of Independent Experts had construed that provision – which afforded all workers the right to form trade unions – as applying to civil servants as well. The Court can only subscribe to this interpretation by a particularly well- qualified committee. It also notes that Article 5 of the European Social Charter sets out conditions for the possibility of forming trade- union organisations for members of the police and the armed forces. By converse implication, this Article must be considered as applying without restriction to other categories of State employees."
