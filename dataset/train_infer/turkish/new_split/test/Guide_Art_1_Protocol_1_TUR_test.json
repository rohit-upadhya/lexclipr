                "124. The Court reiterates that the concept of “possessions” in the first part of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 has an autonomous meaning which is not limited to ownership of physical goods and is independent from the formal classification in domestic law: the issue that needs to be examined is whether the circumstances of the case, considered as a whole, may be regarded as having conferred on the applicant title to a substantive interest protected by that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Zwierzyński v. Poland, no. 34049/96, § 63, ECHR 2001-VI). Accordingly, as well as physical goods, certain rights and interests constituting assets may also be regarded as “property rights”, and thus as “possessions” for the purposes of this provision (see Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 54, ECHR 1999-II, and Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 100, ECHR 2000-I). The concept of “possessions” is not limited to “existing possessions” but may also cover assets, including claims, in respect of which the applicant can argue that he has at least a reasonable and “legitimate expectation” of obtaining effective enjoyment of a property right (see, for example, Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v. Germany [GC], no. 42527/98, § 83, ECHR 2001-VIII)."

On 22 January 1960 Istanbul City Council (“the city council”) had been granted use of the land, which belonged to the Forestry Commission (and therefore to the Treasury), for a term of ninety-nine years. Situated on a slope overlooking a valley, the site spread out over a surface area of approximately 35 hectares and from 1972 onwards was used as a rubbish tip by the districts of Beykoz, Üsküdar, Kadıköy and Ümraniye under the authority and responsibility of the city council and, ultimately, the ministerial authorities.",

They complained of damage to their plantations and sought to have the work halted. In support of their application, M.C. and A.C. produced documents showing that they had been liable for council tax and property tax since 1977 under tax no. 168900. In 1983 the authorities had asked them to fill in a standard form for the declaration of illegal buildings so that their title to the properties and land could be regularised (see paragraph 54 below).

In spite of, inter alia, the expert report and the recommendation of the Environment Office, they had knowingly breached their respective duties: Mr Öktem because he had failed to comply with his obligation to order the destruction of the illegal huts situated around the rubbish tip, as he was empowered to do under section 18 of Law no. 775, and Mr Sözen because he had refused to comply with the above-mentioned recommendation, had failed to renovate the rubbish tip or order its closure, and had not complied with any of the provisions of section 10 of Law no. 3030, which required him to order the destruction of the slum dwellings in question, if necessary by his own means.

Methane (CH 4 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) are the two main products of methanogenesis, which is the final and longest stage of anaerobic fermentation (that is, a process taking place in the absence of air). These substances are generated, inter alia, by the biological and chemical decomposition of waste. The risks of explosion and fire are mainly due to the large proportion of methane in the biogas. The risk of an explosion occurs when the level of CH 4 in the air is between 5% and 15%. If the level rises above 15%, methane will catch fire but will not explode."

                "As regards the last-mentioned priority, the recommended method for decontaminating sites appears to entail setting up a drainage system for fermentation gases whereby gases are pumped out and treated using a biological filter as the site continues to operate. A gas-extraction system of this kind, provision for which is also made in the Regulations of 14 March 1991 in force in Turkey, generally consists of perforated vertical ducts drilled into the waste or horizontal drains buried in the mass of waste, a ventilation system, a biological filter and a network of suction pipes.",

However, the Court considers that those steps are more indicative of a conflict of powers between different authorities, or indeed delaying tactics. In any event, the proceedings to have the report set aside were in fact abortive, having not been pursued by the councils’ lawyers, and the report was never declared invalid. On the contrary, it was decisive for all the authorities responsible for investigating the accident of 28 April 1993 and, moreover, was subsequently confirmed by the report of 18 May 1993 by the committee of experts appointed by the Üsküdar public prosecutor (see paragraph 23 above) and by the two scientific opinions referred to in the report of 9 July 1993 by the chief inspector appointed by the Ministry of the Interior (see paragraph 28 above)."

No such recognition had ever been forthcoming under domestic law, either explicitly or tacitly, and the Government observed that the applicant had, moreover, been unable to produce any documents or title deeds in support of his claims. In that connection, the applicant had been mistaken in relying on the laws for the regularisation of illegal dwellings, since those laws had not on any account had the effect of giving him title to publicly owned land, which, pursuant to the Land Registry Act (Law no. 3402), was inalienable and could not be acquired by adverse possession.",

Poland, no. 34049/96, § 63, ECHR 2001-VI). Accordingly, as well as physical goods, certain rights and interests constituting assets may also be regarded as “property rights”, and thus as “possessions” for the purposes of this provision (see Iatridis v.

In the first place, the criminal proceedings were conducted in such a way that the focus was shifted from the all-important life-endangering aspect of the case to a determination of whether or not the mayors could be held liable for “negligence in the performance of their duties”.

The Government observed that neither the Convention nor its case-law compelled the authorities to secure the conviction of a defendant. The Chamber’s suggestion that the verdict handed down against the mayors was tantamount to granting them almost total impunity had ignored both this point and the national authorities’ discretion to classify criminal charges in the light of the circumstances of a particular case, including situations like the one obtaining in the present case, where the applicant had never complained that the mayors were guilty of unlawful killing through negligence."

The Government further contended that, contrary to the Chamber’s finding, the compensation claim had been determined within a reasonable time, and certainly within a much shorter time-frame than, for example, in Calvelli and Ciglio (cited above), where the Court had found that the period of six years and three months taken to determine a civil claim for death by negligence could not be said to raise an issue under Article 2.

As to the alleged loss resulting from the destruction of the applicant’s dwelling, the Court observes at the outset that, in the absence of any substantiation, the sum claimed would appear excessive. In this connection, it considers that the economic interest which the subsidised housing acquired by the applicant may have represented should be taken into account in the assessment of damage (see paragraph 156 above), although this task is complicated both by the constant fluctuation in the rates of exchange and inflation in Turkey and by the transactions carried out by the applicant in relation to his flat (see paragraph 30 above).",
                "The Chamber’s assessment was based on the assumption that the value of the applicant’s dwelling that was destroyed amounted to 50% of the cost of decent housing offered at the time by Istanbul City Council in the Çobançeşme area. The Grand Chamber notes in this connection that, according to a list drawn up on 20 March 2001 by the city council, the council was offering housing in the Çobançeşme area for approximately TRL 10,400,000,000, which on that date was equivalent to EUR 11,800.",
                "That information apart, the Court observes, again on the basis of its own – inevitably approximate – calculations, that on 13 November 1993, when the contract for the sale of the flat to the applicant was signed, the agreed price of TRL 125,000,000 was equivalent to approximately EUR 8,500, a quarter of which (EUR 2,125) was paid immediately. The remainder (equivalent to EUR 6,375) was to be paid in 120 monthly instalments of TRL 732,844. On 13 November 1993 the monthly instalments were equivalent to approximately EUR 53. However, on 24 March 1998, the date on which the applicant promised to sell his flat to E.B., the instalments corresponded to only EUR 3. According to calculations on the basis of the exchange rates in force between 13 November 1993 and 24 March 1998, the average value of the instalments was EUR 15. As there is no reason to believe that the applicant continued to pay the instalments after 24 March 1998, it can be presumed that by that date he must have paid, in addition to the down payment, the equivalent of approximately EUR 780 in monthly instalments towards the purchase of the flat, making a total of approximately EUR 3,000, which is significantly lower than the initial value of the flat.",
                "It should also be borne in mind that from at least February 1995 onwards, if not well before that date, the flat in question had been let to a certain H.Ö. for a monthly rent of TRL 2,000,000 (approximately EUR 41). In the thirty ‑ seven months during which the flat was leased, ending on 24 March 1998 when the undertaking to sell it was signed, the applicant must therefore have received a minimum of approximately EUR 1,500 in rent, whereas during the same period he had had to pay only EUR 550 in monthly instalments.",
                "Furthermore, on signing the undertaking to sell the flat, the applicant received 20,000 German marks from E.B.; that sum, equivalent at the time to EUR 10,226, is significantly higher than any amount the applicant would ultimately have had to spend on the purchase of his flat.",
                "In the light of the foregoing, assuming that the market value of the applicant’s slum dwelling may be estimated according to the criterion adopted by the Chamber and that he must have spent a certain amount on accommodation while his flat was being let out, there is still no reason for the Court to conclude that those circumstances resulted in a loss greater than the profit the applicant seems to have made from the transactions relating to his flat.",

In making that award, however, the court refused to take into account any electrical appliances allegedly owned by the applicant, on the ground that his dwelling did not have electricity (see paragraph 40 above). Furthermore, the compensation awarded has never been paid to the applicant.

At present it is very difficult to make such an estimation. ... In practice, every legal successor [of a Bug River claimant] could, and can, obtain a certificate – at present, a decision – [confirming the right to] a share in the abandoned property.

This situation creates conditions in which the entitled persons may abuse their rights – a fact of which governors and mayors have notified us. They accordingly suggest that a register ... of the certificates issued confirming the entitlement to ... compensatory property be kept. At present, however, there is no single, comprehensive system for the registration of certificates and decisions entitling claimants to [compensatory property].",

                "According to the Supreme Court, the entitlement in question is for all practical purposes a debt chargeable to the State Treasury, and undoubtedly has a pecuniary and inheritable and, to some extent, transferable character, as it can only be transferred between persons expressly mentioned in section 212(4) of the Land Administration Act 1997, namely the owners of property abandoned in the territories beyond the Bug River or their heirs.",
                "Consequently, that entitlement cannot be transferred to a legal person who was not listed in section 212(4) and who, under Polish law, is not capable of inheriting. It has also been stressed that, in the light of the relevant practice and legal theory, a contribution in kind must be fully transferable, must have a precise accounting value and must be able to be entered as a capital asset on a balance sheet. Accordingly, the relevant entitlement does not satisfy the requirements for a contribution in kind.",

In a letter of 9 January 2002, the Ombudsman reminded the Prime Minister that he had already asked his predecessor in office whether any legislative process would be initiated in order to amend legislation and to increase the amount of land held by the State Treasury with a view to providing compensatory property for repatriated persons.

As well as bringing your attention to this problem, I also requested information on whether specific legislative work had been undertaken in order to increase the stock of real property designated for settling the claims of this quite considerable group of citizens. ...",
                "Paragraph 6 of the 1998 Ordinance makes very clear that, apart from the district mayors, other entities that administer State property on the basis of separate regulations are also to administer immovable property belonging to the State Treasury in order to ensure more effective realisation of compensation in kind for'property beyond the Bug River'. However, it turns out that, following the amendments to the 1998 Ordinance, the necessary amendments to legislation, that would have increased the stock of property designated for settling the claims of people repatriated from the'territories beyond the Bug River', have not been introduced.",

The situation is similar when people repatriated from the'territories beyond the Bug River'wish to participate in bids organised by the State Agricultural Property Agency. In all the cases referred to above, each agency, as grounds for denying entitled persons the right to participate in a bid, points to the absence of relevant legal regulations that would allow it to offset the value of property abandoned abroad against the price of property being sold by a given agency. ...",

                "“The first issue to be dealt with concerns the empowerment of the [communist authorities that concluded the Republican Agreements] to enter into international agreements. There is no doubt that the Polish Committee of National Liberation cannot be considered a constitutional entity of a sovereign State, with corresponding democratic legitimacy and capable of taking sovereign decisions in the name of the State.",
                "The scope of compensation set out for repatriated persons in the Republican Agreements was in no way equivalent or proportionate to the scope of compensation that the States with which these Agreements were concluded took upon themselves as an obligation. In most cases the repatriation was de facto in one direction, as most evacuees were former Polish citizens from the territories lost by the Polish Republic as a result of the Second World War. As a consequence, despite a considerably greater material burden of resettlement and repatriation, Poland, by virtue of the 1952 Pact, was obliged to pay the USSR the substantial sum of 76 million roubles (Article 2 of the 1952 Pact). As in the case of the change in Poland's borders, this type of obligation can certainly not be treated as a sovereign decision by the Polish State authorities.",
                "It should be mentioned at this point that similar burdens in connection with the consequences of the war were also borne by other States, but in no case, with the exception of Germany, was the weight of the burden comparable to the one the Polish State had to bear. It is worth recalling that meeting these obligations was further complicated by the considerable material losses suffered during the war and immediately afterwards. Under these conditions, it was evident that the process of affording satisfaction to the repatriated persons, as set forth in the agreements with the USSR and the Soviet Republics concerned, had to be moderate and spread over time. This also means that it is necessary to take into consideration the difficult financial situation of the State and, above all, the situation of groups of citizens other than the Bug River repatriates. Undoubtedly, the consequences of the war were felt by Polish society as a whole. In this connection, it cannot be argued that, for example, compensation that is incomplete, subject to time - limits or taking a specific form is automatically in contradiction with the principle of justice. This view also applies to mechanisms providing only partial compensation for losses suffered as a result of acts of war and territorial changes.”"

                "“ ( 1) The Republican Agreements gave rise to a specific type of State obligation to award compensation, through appropriate domestic law, to persons who had lost property in connection with the delimitation of Poland's borders after the Second World War. The Republican Agreements did not constitute a direct basis for repatriates to lodge compensation claims, as the legislature was left free to determine how the compensation machinery would be set up. The State's responsibilities in this regard, as undertaken in successive legal regulations, are matters left for an independent decision by the legislature.",
                "( 2) The right to credit, which provides for the possibility of offsetting the value of property lost by Polish citizens after being abandoned outside the present territory of the State against the sale price of immovable property or against fees for the right of perpetual use, constitutes a specific surrogate for the lost property rights, which is not solely a legal expectation of compensation but rather a property right recognised in the Republic's legal order as part of its public law. As such, this right enjoys the constitutionally guaranteed protection of property rights (Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution).",
                "( 3) The creation of legal frameworks for given institutions cannot be entirely abstracted from the factual circumstances and the economic realities in which the legal institutions thus established are to function. As a matter of principle, therefore, the legislature may not narrow down the possibility of benefiting from a general right granted to an individual so severely that the ultimate result is essentially a nudum ius, so that the property becomes an immaterial right devoid of any pecuniary value in practice. In the case of the so-called right to credit, its nominal value does not, however, correspond to its actual value. The depreciation of the value of this right has occurred as a result of the legislature excluding specific categories of immovable property, which has fundamentally limited the possibility of enjoying this right.",
                "( 4) All property rights within the legal order are subject to constitutional protection. An interference with the sphere of an entity's legally protected property interests, when it occurs without the formal removal of the entity's legal title, amounts to de facto expropriation, within the meaning adopted in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. Consequently, the assessment of provisions that eliminate the possibility of benefiting from a right in practice leads to the conclusion that they are incompatible with Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution.",
                "( 5) Legal solutions limiting the possibility of benefiting from the right to credit, within the framework determined by the law, and resulting in those rights being stripped of their substance, cannot be considered necessary in a democratic State governed by the rule of law, and are not functionally related to any of the values set out in Article 31 § 3 [of the Constitution] (the principle of proportionality).",
                "( 6) The requirement of respect for the principle of maintaining citizens'confidence in the State and the law made by it, ensuing from the principle of the rule of law (Article 2 of the Constitution), entails a prohibition on enacting laws that would create illusory legal institutions. This principle therefore requires that the obstacles which prevent [persons] from benefiting from the right to credit be eliminated from the legal system. From the point of view of the confidence principle, in the case of the right to credit it is the means of protecting this right that is subject to assessment, rather than its substance. The lack of opportunity to benefit from this right, within the framework set out by the legislature, shows that an illusory legal institution has been created, and thereby constitutes a violation of Article 2 of the Constitution.”"

It is not a proper ownership right, but neither can it be reduced to the category of a potential right in the sense of a maximum formulated expectation [ ekspektatywa maksymalnie ukształtowana ].

Consequently the right to credit is becoming more and more of an'empty obligation'and is turning into a nudum ius. Maintenance of the present trend, in which various types of State Treasury land are excluded from the application of the right to credit will mean that there is no hope of this right materialising in the future. This state of affairs is already resulting in an unfavourable and paradoxical situation: entitled persons who have been waiting for years to be able to participate in competitive bids and, subsequently, in the course of such bids, being aware of how difficult it is to realise their right to credit,'push up'the price of the property to a level considerably exceeding its market value.",
                "In the present circumstances, in order to assess the possibility of taking advantage of the right to credit, one must take into consideration not only the limitation of the availability of certain types of property, with varying degrees of justification, but also the actual opportunities for enforcement of this right and its economic value.",
                "The statutes restricting repatriates'access to State Treasury property essentially result in de facto expropriation, whereby it is impossible to enjoy the right to credit either at present or in the future, in the sense in which this concept is used in the European Court of Human Rights'case-law cited above. ...",

Moreover, it is not just a question of temporary impossibility, conditioned by certain factual and legal circumstances, but rather a question of the creation of legal constructions that exclude this possibility ex thesi. In the case at hand, assessment of the possibility of this right materialising is all the more essential in that the legislature, in accepting the principle of the State's obligations towards repatriates on the basis of the international agreements, failed at the same time to establish any alternative compensation mechanism. For several decades, the right to credit has been the only available de lege lata solution allowing for compensation of the material losses suffered by Polish citizens as a result of territorial changes in the 1940s. ... ”"

What is necessary is to remain within the constitutional framework which sets out the boundaries for constitutional protection of a given property right [references to the relevant judgments of the Constitutional Court ]. Such limitations are introduced by the Constitution in Article 31 § 3. In the Constitutional Court's case-law it has been indicated on many occasions that this provision provides tests for determining the conditions for the admissibility of limitations on the enjoyment of constitutional rights and freedoms. ...",

Such a situation leads to a constitutionally unacceptable violation of the fundamental substance or the essence of that right. ...",

The aims set out in section 17 of the 1993 Amendment, and the grounds provided for limiting the right to credit in the case of property entrusted to the Military Property Agency, namely the need for funds to modernise the armed forces, must not be pursued in a manner that deprives only a specific group of persons of the possibility of realising property rights vested in them.",

This type of solution can never be recognised as necessary in a democratic State governed by the rule of law. Neither is there any functional connection between that limitation and the pursuance of the aims referred to in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution. The need to introduce limitations could arise if the realisation of the right to credit were to make it impossible to satisfy the legally protected interests of other persons. In particular, the existence of the right to credit does not lead to a situation in which the rights of other persons might be violated (for example, the rights of former owners who have been given priority or persons with a right of pre-emption).",

Rather, it arises from the defective legal formulation of the provisions governing the question of compensation, which causes an inadmissible systemic dysfunction. It must be stressed that in creating a general property right, the State may not at the same time arbitrarily introduce, by taking advantage of the attributes of State power, such limitations which, by excluding substantial stocks of property from the compensation procedure, de facto paralyse the possibility for beneficiaries to derive any economic advantage from these rights. ”"

For it must be stressed yet again that in the case of the so-called'right to credit,'its nominal value does not correspond to its real value. This depreciation occurs precisely because the possibility of realising this right has been limited to a significant extent through legislation excluding certain categories of property. ...",
                "The imperative of adherence to the principle of maintaining confidence in the State, which encompasses, as indicated above, a prohibition against creating law that introduces fictional legal institutions, requires the elimination of legal obstacles that make it impossible to enjoy the right to credit. The Constitutional Court cannot assess to what extent a properly functioning right to credit could repair the damage caused by the loss of'property beyond the Bug River'. The resolution of this problem, which is part of the general issue of redress for the losses sustained by particular groups of the population as a result of the country's historical territorial changes and changes in ownership introduced several decades ago, lies within the competence of the legislature. ...",
                "Essentially, then, the important point here is the implementation of the postulate that legal regulations should be formulated in such a way as to secure to the individual not only legal certainty, but also complete foreseeability as to the extent to which their implementation will affect the individual's legal position in particular legal situations. The compensation mechanism introduced for persons who were deprived of their property as a result of territorial changes resulted in the development of legitimate expectations, on the part of those concerned, that this problem would be definitively resolved in the future, with due consideration for the interests of all persons in whom this right to credit was vested. The opinion that there has been a violation of the principle of maintaining confidence in the State and the law made by it, is further strengthened by the lack of alternative forms of compensation in the legal system. ...",
                "Elimination from the legal system of the limitations introduced by sections 212 and 213 of the Land Administration Act 1997, and by the other individual provisions, would make it possible for the remainder of the credit mechanism to become a real, and not, as hitherto, fictional instrument of compensation. This Court has not assessed the advisability of selection by the legislature of specific means of satisfying the repatriates'property interests, since the determination of concrete institutional solutions is within the legislature's independent sphere of competence. Therefore, it is the compensation machinery already set out in legislation that has been subjected to assessment from the point of view of constitutional guarantees.",
                "It should be pointed out in passing that, in addition to the compensation procedure directly established by section 212 of the Land Administration Act, the legislature recently introduced a new possibility for the realisation of the right to credit in the Law of 5 December 2002 on amendments to the Law on the exercise of the State Treasury's powers, the Law on commercialisation and privatisation of State enterprises and other statutes, which enters into force on 14 January 2003, and which adds a third subsection to section 53 of the Law of 30 August 1996 on the commercialisation and privatisation of State enterprises. On the basis of this provision, the persons referred to in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997 have been given the possibility of crediting the value of abandoned property against the sale price of a privatised enterprise, corresponding to the value of rights to certain items of immovable property included among the assets of the enterprise, or against the sale price of such rights not included among the assets. This is a new form of the right to credit and it is to be expected that it will broaden the possibility of obtaining actual compensation for lost property. However, the new regulation does not in principle change the assessment of the right to credit, as formed by the provisions contested in this case. For the existence of a new form of the right to credit ... does not free the legislature from ensuring that the compensation machinery, as examined in the present case, is designed in such a way as to be a genuine instrument for the protection of the individual's property rights and not just a legal fiction.",
                "The elimination of the limitations contained in the contested provisions will certainly provide new and more favourable conditions for enjoyment of the right to credit, and hence a chance for the genuine functioning of the compensation mechanism established by legislation.”"

In certain auctions only those persons who had made applications for compensation before 26 May 1990 had been able to make bids. In 2002 the mayor of the Cracow District had begun to hold auctions, but throughout that year there had been only two such auctions.",

Also, there were situations where the State Treasury's Agricultural Property Agency organised auctions from which, under the relevant provisions, persons from beyond the Bug River were excluded.",
                "Particular attention should, however, be given to situations where auctions did not exclude persons from beyond the Bug River. These occurred extremely rarely. In such situations a large group of persons who had entitlements to compensation would participate. These people, concerned that, owing to the small stock of property set aside to satisfy their claims, they would not be able to obtain any satisfaction, would increase their bids for the property in such a way that the price of the property for sale was several times higher than its market value. It was symptomatic that only persons from beyond the Bug River took part in these auctions, although the organisers also permitted the participation of persons who were able to buy the property in cash. In one of the auctions a property whose reserve price, assessed in line with market valuations, was 115,000 Polish zlotys, was sold for 700,000 zlotys. In another auction a plot with a building that had been used as a dissecting room, and which had a reserve price of just over 200,000 Polish zlotys, was sold for 1,500,000 Polish zlotys. In the context of the above situation, it suffices to say that, within the area of activity of the Cracow Branch of the All-Polish Association of Borderland Creditors of the State Treasury, that is, within the territory of the former Cracow Province and part of the Nowy Sącz Province, only about twenty entitled persons out of a total of some 300 having certificates or administrative decisions took advantage of their right to credit and, of these, nobody obtained full compensation for their entitlement. It should be added that, within the area of activity of the Cracow Branch of the All-Polish Association of Borderland Creditors of the State Treasury, 3,600 persons tried to obtain certificates confirming their right to receive an equivalent to the abandoned property.”",

It considered the refusal justified since the condition for obtaining the first property, a plot of land, had been to construct a house on it within four years, whereas the plaintiffs had not had the means for such an investment. The second offer had been to choose one of three tenement houses in another town, but those houses had been in a catastrophic state."

In this way, finding themselves in a highly pressured situation, they lost a large part of their entitlement. The severe limitations placed on the possibility of satisfying their entitlements in effect brought about its elimination. This situation, where the State has created the circumstances described above, is in effect a totally unjustified expropriation [and amounts to] taking from persons from beyond the Bug River property rights to which they are entitled. Even the creation of such a situation should be considered a state of lawlessness with regard to the rights of repatriated persons.",

While the legislature, in section 81 of the 1985 Act and in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997, gave persons from beyond the Bug River the right to credit the value of property abandoned abroad against the price of building plots or the price of buildings or premises situated on land belonging to the State Treasury, the subsequent acts rendered ineffective any possibility of this social group satisfying that entitlement.",
                "In essence, the damage sustained by repatriated persons, and also by the plaintiff in the context of the present case, consists of the difference between what they should have been able to have within the value of their entitlement, pursuant to section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997, and what they actually have in practice, as a result of the wrongful manner in which the State has implemented the law. ...",

The liability of the State Treasury follows from Article 417 of the Civil Code, linked as it is with the functioning of a public authority as a whole, rather than with specific persons connected to that institution, bearing in mind that responsibility arises if there is an unlawful act. Furthermore, the functioning of the public authorities should be taken, in a wider sense, as an act or omission, as specific actions, or as orders, judgments, administrative decisions, quasi-normative statutes and, finally, legislative activity. ...",

However, in the context of the number of repatriated persons who were entitled to take part in auctions, any possible participation in an auction could result in their losing a significant proportion of their entitlement.",

In that context, the court stressed that the plaintiffs had not yet exhausted all means available under domestic legislation.

In the light of the constitutional provisions cited above, it therefore cannot constitute a source of law, since it did not come within the domestic legal order. Consequently, this agreement cannot be applied directly or relied on as a basis for the plaintiffs'claims.

The basis expressed for this opinion was that, in the opinion of the Minister, the agreement had been executed inter partes, and therefore terminated, given the conclusion of the 1952 Pact with the government of the USSR. ...",

But then one must ask the question why, for example, the Supreme Court in its case-law, quoted so extensively in the present case, has bothered over the last fifty years with the issue of agreements which were no longer in force? For instance, in the well - known resolution of seven Supreme Court judges of 30 May 1990 (III CZP 1/90, ...), the Supreme Court ruled not only on section 88(1) of the Land Administration and Expropriation Act 1985, which set out the right to credit, but also on the Republican Agreements of 1944, and considered the substance of Article 3 § 6 [11]. ...",

To put it in precise terms, the public authority refrained from acting, despite a statutorily formulated duty to do so, and hence it acted in breach of the law (objective unlawfulness). Hence the first of the conditions of liability required by Article 417 of the Civil Code, read in conjunction with Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution, is fulfilled. ...",

But this absence is the result of an unlawful omission by the executive power, which neglected to publish the Agreement in the Journal of Laws.",
                "Given these circumstances, there is a clear and direct causal link between the unlawful omission by the public authorities and the damage suffered by the plaintiffs. This pecuniary damage consists in the fact that it is impossible for the plaintiffs to satisfy their claims through a civil action based on Article 3 § 6 of the Agreement, given that the result of such a process is prejudged at the present time (rejection of the claim, or, as in the present proceedings, an indication that such a basis is unfounded).

Neither the Agricultural Property Agency nor the Military Property Agency have complied with the Constitutional Court's judgment. Such practices make it impossible, for all practical purposes, [for the claimants] to have their right to credit realised.

The crucial point is, however, that previous legislative action rendered [this machinery] illusory – as the Constitutional Court has unequivocally held. This had an impact on the actual value of the [right to credit]. Indeed, the value of this right was reduced since the legislature, on the one hand, excluded from the scope of section 212 ... [certain] portions of State land and, on the other, through the application of this provision in practice ( failing to hold auctions), made it unenforceable.

Moreover, it should be reiterated that the various rules incorporated in Article 1 are not distinct, in the sense of being unconnected, and that the second and third rules are concerned only with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. One of the effects of this is that the existence of a “public interest” required under the second sentence, or the “general interest” referred to in the second paragraph, are in fact corollaries of the principle set forth in the first sentence, so that an interference with the exercise of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 must also pursue an aim in the public interest (see Beyeler, cited above, § 111)."

This policy resulted in the effective suspension of the execution of the judgment because the provisions restoring State agricultural and military property to the pool of property available to the Bug River people could not be implemented in practice. It was strongly condemned by the judicial authorities, most notably the Supreme Court, which deemed such acts to amount to constitutional torts.

Before examining the applicant's individual claims for just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention, in view of the circumstances of the instant case and having regard also to the evolution of its caseload, the Court wishes to consider what consequences may be drawn for the respondent State from Article 46 of the Convention. It reiterates that by virtue of Article 46 the High Contracting Parties have undertaken to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they are parties, execution being supervised by the Committee of Ministers. It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a breach imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction under Article 41, but also to select, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in their domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress so far as possible the effects. Subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, the respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII)."

The failure to implement in a manner compatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 the chosen mechanism for settling the Bug River claims has affected nearly 80,000 people (see paragraphs 33-34 above). There are moreover already 16 7 applications pending before the Court brought by Bug River claimants. This is not only an aggravating factor as regards the State's responsibility under the Convention for an existing or past state of affairs, but also represents a threat to the future effectiveness of the Convention machinery.",

Above all, the measures adopted must be such as to remedy the systemic defect underlying the Court's finding of a violation so as not to overburden the Convention system with large numbers of applications deriving from the same cause. Such measures should therefore include a scheme which offers to those affected redress for the Convention violation identified in the instant judgment in relation to the present applicant. In this context the Court's concern is to facilitate the most speedy and effective resolution of a dysfunction established in national human rights protection. Once such a defect has been identified, it falls to the national authorities, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, to take, retroactively if appropriate (see Bottazzi v. Italy [GC], no. 34884/97, § 22, ECHR 1999- V, Di Mauro v.

The Court is not in a position to assess whether the December 2003 Act (see paragraphs 114-20 above ) can be treated as an adequate measure in this connection since no practice of its implementation has been established as yet. In any event, this Act does not cover persons who – like Mr Broniowski – had already received partial compensation, irrespective of the amount of such compensation. Thus, it is clear that for this group of Bug River claimants the Act cannot be regarded as a measure capable of putting an end to the systemic situation identified in the present judgment as adversely affecting them.",

As to the former option, the respondent State should, therefore, through appropriate legal and administrative measures, secure the effective and expeditious realisation of the entitlement in question in respect of the remaining Bug River claimants, in accordance with the principles for the protection of property rights laid down in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, having particular regard to the principles relating to compensation (see paragraphs 147-51, 176 and 186 above).",

It will confine itself to observing that, before the applicant was evicted, he had operated the cinema for eleven years under a formally valid lease without any interference by the authorities, as a result of which he had built up a clientele that constituted an asset (see the Van Marle and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 June 1986, Series A no. 101, p. 13, § 41); in this connection, the Court takes into account the role played in local cultural life by open-air cinemas in Greece and to the fact that the clientele of such a cinema is made up mainly of local residents."

It was settled case-law that without such an application the most that could be achieved by lodging an objection against an eviction order was to have that order quashed; the court simply looked at whether the conditions for issuing the order had been satisfied and did not deal with issues of ownership, use or possession. Moreover, a judicial decision returning the land to the applicant would be enforceable against the State, since section 8 of Law no. 2097/1952 (introducing State immunity from execution) applied only to monetary claims.",

The court found in his favour, holding that the conditions for issuing such an order had not been satisfied. The Minister of Finance, however, refused to give approval for the cinema to be returned to him. In the light of the Minister’s stance, an action under Articles 987 and 989 of the Civil Code – assuming it had succeeded – would in all probability not have led to a different outcome from that of the application to have the eviction order quashed. The applicant cannot therefore be criticised for not having made use of a legal remedy which would have been directed to essentially the same end and which moreover would not have had a better prospect of success (see, mutatis mutandis, the Miailhe v.

In the instant case, however, compensation would not have been an alternative to the measures which the Greek legal system should have afforded the applicant to overcome the fact that he was unable to regain possession of the cinema despite a court decision quashing the eviction order. Furthermore, the various proceedings pending in the Athens Court of First Instance are decisive only in respect of an award of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Hornsby v. Greece judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports 1997-II, p. 509, § 37).",

The Minister of Agriculture’s decision in 1953 (see paragraph 8 above) had merely determined the boundary line between that part of the “Karras estate” classified as forest and the urban part, which belonged to K.N. It was clear from the plans that the site of the cinema fell within the latter part – that is to say, squarely within the urban area and a long distance from the tract of land which had been transferred to the Police Cooperative and dealt with in judgment no. 4910/1977. Although the ownership of the cinema was still a matter of dispute between the State and those who had leased the land to the applicant, namely K.N.’s heirs, the State had always treated the heirs as the true owners by levying inheritance tax on the land from them, from the very beginning and right up to the present day; moreover, the permit for the cinema to be built had referred to K.N. as the owner of the land. In its judgment of 21 June 1977 the Court of Appeal had determined only the ownership of the land transferred to the Police Cooperative, not that of the land in question, which was quite separate and a long distance from the other tract of land.

                "53. The Government submitted that the administrative eviction order had merely deprived the applicant of the right to use and possess the land in issue and had not prevented him from carrying on his business. The applicant had had four years to find an alternative site for his business, which had consequently suffered no harm on account of the enforcement of the eviction order. Furthermore, a lessee’s right to use a leased property is limited in scope and in duration (since the lease can be terminated at any time by either party) and is relative (since it cannot be relied on against a third party with an overriding right over the leased property, such as a property right in rem ). Hence the lease had never given the applicant a sufficiently well-founded property right enforceable against the State. Any doubt which might have remained as to the State’s ownership of the land claimed by K.N.’s heirs had been dispelled by the Court of Appeal’s judgment (no. 4910/1977) of 21 June 1977 (see paragraph 13 above), in which it had been held that the whole area in dispute belonged to the State; the applicant could have learned of that by consulting the mortgage registers. The Court of First Instance judgment of 23 October 1989 had not established that the applicant had any right over the land in issue, since the proceedings had been concerned only with the formal validity of the eviction order and not with the property rights the parties might have over the land. Besides, the applicant could have sought redress from the lessors in the form of damages for leasing him land that he was unable to use owing to a legal defect. Lastly and most importantly, it had been open to the applicant, who still owned the cinema equipment, to set up his business elsewhere."

The Court reiterates that the concept of “possessions” in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 has an autonomous meaning which is certainly not limited to ownership of physical goods: certain other rights and interests constituting assets can also be regarded as “property rights”, and thus as “possessions” for the purposes of this provision (see the Gasus Dosier- und Fördertechnik GmbH v. the Netherlands judgment of 23 February 1995, Series A no. 306-B, p. 46, § 53).",

It is not for the Court, in deciding this case, to take the place of the national courts and determine whether the land in question belonged to the State or whether the lease between K.N.’s heirs and the applicant was void under Greek law. It will confine itself to observing that, before the applicant was evicted, he had operated the cinema for eleven years under a formally valid lease without any interference by the authorities, as a result of which he had built up a clientele that constituted an asset (see the Van Marle and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 June 1986, Series A no. 101, p. 13, § 41); in this connection, the Court takes into account the role played in local cultural life by open-air cinemas in Greece and to the fact that the clientele of such a cinema is made up mainly of local residents."

According to the Court’s case-law, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which in substance guarantees the right of property, comprises three distinct rules (see the James and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98-B, pp. 29-30, § 37): the first rule, set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property; the second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions; the third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule.",

It also notes that, despite a judicial decision quashing the eviction order, Mr Iatridis cannot regain possession of the cinema because the Minister of Finance refuses to revoke the assignment of it to the Council (see paragraph 26 above).",
                "In those circumstances, there has been interference with the applicant’s property rights. Since he holds only a lease of his business premises, this interference neither amounts to an expropriation nor is an instance of controlling the use of property but comes under the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1."

                "58. The Court reiterates that the first and most important requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful: the second sentence of the first paragraph authorises a deprivation of possessions only “subject to the conditions provided for by law” and the second paragraph recognises that the States have the right to control the use of property by enforcing “laws”. Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see the Amuur v. France judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 850-51, § 50) and entails a duty on the part of the State or other public authority to comply with judicial orders or decisions against it (see, mutatis mutandis, the Hornsby judgment cited above, p. 511, § 41). It follows that the issue of whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights (see the Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, p. 26, § 69) becomes relevant only once it has been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary."

It had therefore been open to him to seek the protection of the courts or to keep his business going by transferring it elsewhere. Further and more especially, the Athens Court of First Instance in its judgment of 23 October 1989 had not ordered the eviction of the Town Council from the cinema and the applicant’s reinstatement (see paragraph 19 above). No such reinstatement order could have been made unless the applicant had expressly applied for one, separately from his application to have the eviction order quashed; the Government submitted that there was a large body of case-law to this effect and produced a judgment of the Athens Court of Appeal (no. 6802/1989) in which it had been held that an application for reinstatement could be lodged independently of other proceedings and was not subject to the time-limits for challenging eviction orders."

Even supposing that he had obtained an order for his reinstatement in the cinema, there was no judicial avenue whereby he could have recovered possession of it. If the application was brought against Ilioupolis Town Council, it would be of no practical effect, since the decision would be binding only on the Council and there would be nothing to prevent the State from transferring the cinema to another public body; and even if he brought the application against the State itself, he would have no recourse in the event of a further refusal by the Minister."

The Court notes that those appearing before it had diverging views on this point but it is not for it to resolve the dispute, particularly as decision no. 26/1997 of the Committals Division of the Athens Criminal Court, committing the mayor of Ilioupolis for trial on charges of dereliction of duty (see paragraph 28 above), appears to indicate that a special order for the applicant’s reinstatement was not necessary. Moreover, that court held that although “neither the report on the administrative inquiry of 2 April 1990, nor opinion no. 508/1991 of the full State Legal Council, nor the recommendation of the governing board of the State Lands Authority of 31 July 1995, [had] binding force or [was] enforceable, that [did] not mean that Ilioupolis Town Council … was entitled to disobey the law and to await enforcement proceedings like a private individual who deliberately refuses to assume his statutory or contractual obligations”.",
                "In the instant case there are also other considerations on which the Court may base its decision. The applicant’s eviction on 17 March 1989 certainly had a legal basis in domestic law, namely the administrative eviction order issued on 9 February 1989 by a State-controlled body, the Lands Department of the Attica prefecture, the cinema having in the meantime been assigned to Ilioupolis Town Council by the State Lands Authority. However, on 23 October 1989 the Athens Court of First Instance heard the case under summary procedure and quashed the eviction order on the grounds that the conditions for issuing it had not been satisfied. No appeal lay against that decision. From that moment on, the applicant’s eviction thus ceased to have any legal basis and Ilioupolis Town Council became an unlawful occupier and should have returned the cinema to the applicant, as was indeed recommended by all the bodies from whom the Minister of Finance sought an opinion, namely the Ministry of Finance, the State Legal Council and the State Lands Authority (see paragraphs 20, 21 and 25 above). More specifically, the last-named body proposed that the Minister should revoke the assignment of the cinema to the Town Council, restore the use of it to Mr Iatridis and reinstate him in the property he had leased. The Minister, however, refused to approve that proposal as was necessary if the applicant was to be reinstated in his premises."

It indicated that the installations should be brought into line with the requirements of the “assignment plan” ( piano di assegnazione ) within twenty-four months and that the measures taken to that end should conform to the adjustment programme ( programma di adeguamento ) drawn up by the Communications Regulatory Authority ( Autorità per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni – AGCOM) in conjunction with the Ministry of Communications (“the Ministry”). It appears from the Consiglio di Stato ’s judgment no. 2624 of 31 May 2008 (see paragraph 14 below) that, under the terms of the licence, the allocation of frequencies was deferred until such time as the authorities had adopted the adjustment programme, on the basis of which the applicant company should have upgraded its own installations. The adjustment programme should, in turn, have taken into account the requirements of the national frequency-allocation plan. However, the plan was not implemented. A succession of transitional schemes that benefited existing channels were applied at national level, with the result that, even though it had a licence, the applicant company was unable to broadcast until June 2009 as it had not been allocated any frequencies."

In the ECJ’s view, such criteria had not been applied in the present case, since the status of the existing channels had not been amended under the transitional schemes and they had continued their broadcasting activities to the detriment of operators such as the applicant company, which, because it had not been allocated any broadcasting frequencies, had been unable to exercise its rights and make use of its licence.",

The fact that the authorities had launched a public tendering procedure for the frequencies in 1999, although the situation in the broadcasting sector had not been clarified and there were outstanding technical issues, had been “risky”. The Consiglio di Stato considered that the question of redress for the damage sustained by the applicant company should take this context into account.

As to the criteria for determining the damages to be awarded, the Consiglio di Stato pointed out that, as regards the losses sustained, the applicant company had been fully aware, at the time of the call for tenders, of the circumstances of the case and the conditions to which the licence was subject. Furthermore, the sequence of events that had prevented the frequencies from being allocated had been largely foreseeable. Accordingly, the applicant company should have known that it was unlikely to obtain the frequencies, at least in the short term.

In the Consiglio di Stato ’s view, the comparison between the applicant company and the two leading operators (Mediaset and RAI) was unjustified, especially as it did not take into account the other nationwide operator (La 7), which, although it had greater economic power than the applicant company, was nevertheless operating at a loss.",

                "54. In judgment no. 420 of 5 December 1994, the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the provisions allowing the three channels controlled by the Mediaset group (Canale 5, Italia Uno and Retequattro) to occupy a dominant position. It held that the provision whereby the same operator could hold several television-broadcasting licences on condition that it did not exceed 25% of the total number of national channels – that is, three channels in all – was not sufficient to prevent concentration of television channels, and was accordingly in breach of Article 21 of the Constitution in that it did not make it possible to guarantee the plurality of information sources. The Constitutional Court considered that the existence of legislation to prevent dominant positions from being established was an essential requirement to justify the State’s relinquishment of its monopoly on broadcasting. The creation of such dominant positions in this sector would not only have had the effect of changing the rules on competition but would also have led to the emergence of an oligopoly and would have breached the fundamental principle of plurality of information sources. The Constitutional Court thus held that the mere coexistence of a State-owned company and private companies (a mixed system) within the broadcasting sector was not sufficient to secure respect for the right to receive information from several competing sources. As it had previously stated in decision no. 826/1988, it reaffirmed that a State-owned company could not by itself ensure a balance precluding the establishment of a dominant position in the private sector."

A democracy is judged not only by its day-to-day operations but by the principles the country upholds with regard to its own citizens and internationally. The Assembly recalls that, in accordance with Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, States have a duty to protect and, when necessary, take positive measures to safeguard and promote media pluralism.",

The Assembly deplores the fact that several consecutive Italian governments since 1994 have failed to resolve the problem of conflict of interest and that appropriate legislation has not yet been adopted by the present Parliament. It disagrees that the leading principle of the Frattini Bill currently under consideration – that only managers, not owners, should be held responsible – provides a genuine and comprehensive solution to the conflict of interest concerning Mr Berlusconi.",

Through Mediaset, Italy’s main commercial communications and broadcasting group, and one of the largest in the world, Mr Berlusconi owns approximately half of the nationwide broadcasting in the country. His role as head of government also puts him in a position to influence indirectly the public broadcasting organisation, RAI, which is Mediaset’s main competitor. As Mediaset and RAI command together about 90% of the television audience and over three quarters of the resources in this sector, Mr Berlusconi exercises unprecedented control over the most powerful media in Italy.",
                "5. This duopoly in the television market is in itself an anomaly from an antitrust perspective. The status quo has been preserved even though legal provisions affecting media pluralism have twice been declared anti-constitutional and the competent authorities have established the dominant positions of RAI and the three television channels of Mediaset. An illustration of this situation was a recent decree of the Prime Minister, approved by Parliament, which allowed the third channel of RAI and Mediaset’s Retequattro to continue their operations in violation of the existing antitrust limits until the adoption of new legislation. Competition in the media sector is further distorted by the fact that the advertising company of Mediaset, Publitalia ’80, has a dominant position in television advertising. The Assembly deplores the continued exclusion of a potential national broadcaster, Europa 7, winner of a 1999 government tender to broadcast on frequencies occupied by Mediaset’s channel, Retequattro.",

The Assembly believes that the newly-adopted ‘Gasparri Law’ on the reform of the broadcasting sector may not effectively guarantee greater pluralism simply through the multiplication of television channels in the course of digitalisation. At the same time, it manifestly allows Mediaset to expand even further, as it gives the market players the possibility to have a monopoly in a given sector without ever reaching the antitrust limit in the overall integrated system of communications (SIC). The Assembly notes that these concerns led the President of the Republic to oppose the previous version of the law.",
                "7. The Assembly is particularly concerned by the situation of RAI, which is contrary to the principles of independence laid down in Assembly Recommendation 1641 (2004) on public-service broadcasting. RAI has always been a mirror of the political system of the country and its internal pluralism has moved from the proportionate representation of the dominant political ideologies in the past to the winner-takes-all attitude reflecting the present political system. The Assembly notes with concern the resignations of the President of RAI and of one of the most popular journalists in the country in protest against the lack of balanced political representation in the Council of Administration and against the political influence over RAI’s programming.",
                "8. While the printed media in Italy has traditionally provided greater pluralism and political balance than the broadcasting sector, most Italians receive their news through the medium of television. The high cost of newspaper compared to television advertising is having a damaging effect on the Italian printed media. However, the Assembly wishes to record its approval of government measures to help small- and medium-sized newspapers and other measures to boost newspaper readership.",
                "9. The Assembly is extremely concerned that the negative image that Italy is portraying internationally because of the conflict of interest concerning Mr Berlusconi, could hamper the efforts of the Council of Europe aimed at promoting independent and unbiased media in the new democracies. It considers that Italy, as one of the strongest contributors to the functioning of the Organisation, has a particular responsibility in this respect.",
                "10. The Assembly points out that several international bodies, such as the OSCE representative on Freedom of the Media and, most recently, the European Parliament, have expressed concerns similar to its own. It welcomes the measures for safeguarding media pluralism proposed in the European Parliament resolution on the risks of violation, in the European Union and especially in Italy, of freedom of expression and information (Article 11 § 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights) of 22 April 2004, namely that the protection of media diversity should become a priority of European Union competition law.",

Newly available channels may have very small audiences but with similar amounts of output. Finally, larger companies will enjoy greater purchasing power in a wide range of activities such as programme acquisitions, and will thus enjoy significant advantages over other national content providers.",

Indeed, it may allow an individual company to enjoy extremely high degrees of revenue shares in individual markets, whilst at the same time remaining below the 20% threshold for the whole sector.",

                "As regards the provisions on migration of radio and television broadcasters from analogue to digital frequencies, the Commission has the impression that the Gasparri Law has taken the approach of attempting to hold back on finding a real solution to the problem of media concentration in the television market until some future point in time and it relies heavily on the point when digitalisation will come into full effect. In the Commission’s view, this approach is not satisfactory, as, if the status quo is maintained, it is likely that Mediaset and RAI will remain the dominant actors in Italian television. In this respect, the Commission recalls that while general anti-trust measures [are aimed] against the abuse of dominant positions, in the media sector dominant positions are forbidden as such.",
                "In respect of the privatisation of RAI, which should lead to a lesser degree of politicisation of the public broadcaster, the Commission notes that change at RAI will allow for government control over the public broadcaster for an unforeseeable period of time. For as long as the present government stays in office, this will mean that, in addition to being in control of its own three national television channels, the Prime Minister will have some control of the three public national television channels. The Commission expresses concern over the risk that this atypical situation may even strengthen the threat of monopolisation, which might constitute, in terms of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, an unjustified interference with freedom of expression.",

The duopoly was accompanied by a practical monopoly by Mediaset in the commercial television sector and the advertisement market. Before digitalisation, the duopoly’s audience share was around 90% (both owned three channels). Combined revenues and the advertisement market also provided evidence of the duopoly.",

Freedom of the press and other news media affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of political leaders. It is incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on political issues and on other subjects of public interest. Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them (see, for example, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24, and Lingens, cited above, §§ 41-42)."

Such consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 49, Series A no. 30; Kokkinakis v.

As regards the allocation of frequencies, the licence referred to the national frequency-allocation plan, adopted on 30 October 1998, and gave the applicant company twenty-four months to bring its installations into line with the relevant requirements (see paragraph 9 above). However, as is clear from the decisions of the domestic courts (see paragraph 14 above), that obligation could not be satisfied by the applicant company until such time as the authorities had adopted the adjustment programme and implemented the frequency-allocation plan. The Court considers that in such circumstances the applicant company could reasonably have expected the authorities to adopt, within the twenty-four months following 28 July 1999 at the latest, the instruments needed to regulate its terrestrial broadcasting activities.

However, section 3(6) of the same Law established a transitional scheme whereby the over-quota channels could continue broadcasting on terrestrial frequencies on a temporary basis after 30 April 1998, provided that they complied with the obligations imposed on channels holding licences and that their programmes were broadcast simultaneously on satellite or cable (see paragraph 60 above)."

In the light of that judgment, the applicant company could have expected that the frequencies which should have been allocated to it would be freed up by the start of 2004.

The applicant company further noted that the Consiglio di Stato, referring to the Constitutional Court’s finding that 31 December 2003 constituted a reasonable date for the expiry of the transition period, had taken into account only the damage sustained after 2004, thereby disregarding five years of the violation. Lastly, the applicant company noted that, according to the Consiglio di Stato ’s finding, the award of the licence had not conferred the immediate right to engage in the corresponding economic activity, and that the compensation should therefore have been calculated on the basis of the legitimate expectation of being allocated frequencies by the appropriate authorities."

Nevertheless, the possibility of engaging in the activity corresponding to the licence was affected by several measures which, in essence, were aimed at delaying the start-up date; this, in the Court’s view, represents a means of controlling the use of property, to be examined from the standpoint of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

                "\"The legislature is entitled to consider that the categories to whom the impugned Act is addressed are, principally on account of their involvement in shipping, sufficiently specific to warrant special rules concerning liability.",
                "In this instance the legislature gave the Act retrospective effect. The retrospective component of the special rules on liability introduced for pilots infringes the fundamental principle of legal certainty, according to which the content of the law must in principle be foreseeable and accessible so that those subject to the law may foresee to a reasonable degree the consequences of a given action at the moment when that action is carried out.",
                "This violation of the principle is not, in the circumstances of the case, disproportionate in relation to the general objective underlying the contested legislation. The legislature intended to preserve in the legislation on pilots the rules on liability which it had not wanted to amend in 1967 and which the case-law prior to 1983 and legal writing inferred from section 5 of the Pilots Act 1967 and sections 64 and 251 of the Shipping Act (Book II, Title II, of the Commercial Code). Moreover it took into account the considerable financial implications that would result, in a way that could not have been foreseen, for the relevant public authorities from the reversal of the case-law.",
                "In the light of all these considerations, exempting from liability the organisers of a pilot service and limiting the personal liability of pilots cannot be regarded as a failure to comply with the requirements of Articles 6 and 6 bis of the Constitution, even having regard to the retrospective effect of the Act in question.",
                "The applicants claim that the legislation in issue introduces an unjustified distinction between, on the one hand, disputes that have reached their conclusion (causae finitae), which fall outside the scope of the legislation, and, on the other, pending disputes (causae pendentes), which are covered by the Act.",
                "Attributing retrospective effect to a legal rule means in principle that that rule applies to legal relationships that came into being and were not definitively terminated before its entry into force; such a rule can therefore apply only to pending and future disputes and cannot bear in any way on disputes that have been concluded.",
                "According to a fundamental principle of our legal system, a judicial decision may be varied only on appeal. By applying the contested distinction so as to limit the effect of the Act with regard to the past, the legislature sought to respect that principle and did not therefore operate a distinction contrary to Articles 6 and 6 bis of the Constitution.",
                "The applicants relied further on the violation of Article 11 of the Constitution and of Article 1 of the First Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights (P1-1).",
                "By amending rules governing compensation for damage without calling into question the existence of debts arising from judicial decisions, the legislature did not introduce any unjustified distinction, as the protection guaranteed by the above-mentioned provisions extends only to property that has already been acquired.\"",

                "On 26 January 1990 the Court of Cassation referred a question to the Court of Arbitration for a preliminary ruling on the constitutionality of the 1988 Act and in particular its retrospective effect. On 22 November 1990 that court confirmed in substance its judgment of 5 July 1990 (see paragraph 7 above).",
                "Accordingly, on 19 April 1991, the Court of Cassation dismissed the twenty-fifth applicant's appeal on points of law. Reproducing the reply given by the Court of Arbitration to its question for a preliminary ruling, it dismissed a first submission according to which the retrospective effect of the 1988 Act infringed the former Articles 6 and 6 bis of the Constitution. It then declared inadmissible the submission based on an alleged violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), after noting that the twenty-fifth applicant had not invoked that provision (P1-1) in the Court of Appeal. Finally, it rejected the submission that, by taking effect in respect of proceedings that were in progress, the 1988 Act prevented the courts from deciding the disputes as brought before them, contrary to the principles of the independence of the courts and equality of arms between the parties. The Court of Cassation held as follows:",
                "\"The task and duty of a judge is to apply the law to the dispute before him; the fact that that is his task and his duty has no bearing on his independence. A retrospective law applicable to pending disputes, even where the State is a party to the dispute, does not impair the judge's independence in carrying out his task and accomplishing his duty. Any pressure brought to bear on a judge by such a law is no different from the pressure that all laws exert on him. The fact that the judgment applies such a law does not constitute a violation of the right to a fair hearing of the case by an independent tribunal.\"",

The application to have the Act declared void lodged with the Court of Arbitration had not rendered such proceedings superfluous, because complaints based on the violation of provisions of international law taken separately fell outside the jurisdiction of that court (see paragraph 19 above).

They then submitted that the financial reasons cited by the Government could not justify such a massive violation of their fundamental rights, in particular in view of the fact that, far from being unforeseeable, the Court of Cassation's judgment of 15 December 1983 was entirely consistent with its \"La Flandria\" judgment of 1920 (see paragraph 17 above). The State had had ample time to take measures in conformity with the Convention so as to anticipate a ruling that merely developed a particular line of case-law, which had been initiated much earlier. Instead it had not only annulled retrospectively claims that were already in existence, but it had waited until 1988 before doing so, thereby aggravating the frustration of the applicants' expectations, many of whom had delayed instituting proceedings against the State until 1986 or later."

Materials available to the Court describe relevant aspects of the occurrence of tied votes in the upper courts ’ decision-making in several Contracting States representing different legal traditions. There is no uniform practice in the contracting States with regard to the occurrence of a tied vote in decision-making before the Supreme and Constitutional Courts. Many States provide for measures to avoid tied votes and to ensure that a majority is obtained, such as establishing formations made up of an uneven number of judges (for example, in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland, Malta and the United Kingdom) and /or prohibiting judges from abstaining (for example, in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Moldova) and /or providing for an uneven number of judges to make a decision-making quorum (for example, in Italy, Andorra and Austria). Even in these circumstances, however, a tied vote could still occur. With a view to ensuring that a final decision can be reached, even in the event of a tied vote, different legal systems provide for different solutions, such as a casting vote for the president of the court/formation (for example, in Austria, Italy and Spain) or for the judge rapporteur (for example, in Andorra), or giving an interpretation to the tied vote (for example, in Germany, Poland, Slovakia and Moldova).

The extent to which the duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision at issue (see, for example, Helle v.

Once the liquidation order has been made, the liquidator is responsible for the administration of the company ’ s assets. Indeed, it is self-evident in the Court ’ s view that disputes over such matters may have major repercussions on the assets and liabilities of the company ’ s estate. The Court consequently finds that the restriction is intended to protect the rights and interests of others, namely those of the company ’ s creditors. The Court will go on to examine whether the consequences suffered by the applicant were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, mutatis mutandis, Luordo v.

The applicant was able to contest the winding-up proceedings before four levels of jurisdiction. Hence, it cannot be considered that his right of access to a court was unreasonably limited.

Accordingly, and contrary to the position taken by the parties, the Court can only conclude that the Constitutional Court failed to pronounce on the applicant ’ s appeal not as a result of a tied vote but because of its failure to reach a majority on any of the proposals submitted for deliberation.

In contrast to other legal systems, which either preclude a tied vote or provide different alternatives to enable a final decision to be reached in the event of such a vote, in the Albanian legal system a tied vote in the Constitutional Court results in a decision which does not formally determine the issue under appeal. Moreover, no reasons are given for dismissing the appeal in such an eventuality other than that the vote was tied. Having regard to its above considerations, the Court can only conclude that the tied vote arrangements foreseen in section 74 of the CCOA do not serve the interests of legal certainty and are capable of depriving an applicant of an effective right to have his constitutional appeal finally determined.",

However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State ’ s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions. To construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would indeed be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6.

Hence, the applicant does not have an arguable claim in respect of those complaints under Article 6 that have already been found inadmissible by the Court, and Article 13 is therefore not applicable as regards those complaints.

The Court has previously considered that rights akin to property rights existed in cases concerning professional practices where by dint of their own work, the applicants concerned had built up a clientele. It explained that this clientele had, in many respects, the nature of a private right and constituted an asset and, hence, a possession within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 (see Van Marle and Others, cited above, § 41 ). In a case involving an alleged interference with an applicant ’ s medical practice, the Commission noted that the “vested interests” in the applicant ’ s medical practice could be regarded as “possessions” (see Karni v. Sweden, no. 11540/85, Commission decision of 8 March 1988, Decisions and Reports 55, p. 157). In later cases, the Court explained that law practices and their clientele were entities of a certain worth that had in many respects the nature of a private right and thus constituted assets and therefore possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 (see Olbertz v.

The presenting officer was not content to rely on the matters of which notice had been given but proceeded to refer to a number of other matters against the claimant none of which had been put to him. This was a breach of regulation 13(11).

The notes show that this did not happen since during the discussion reference was made to Dr Malik being ‘ unclear about the prescribing of colostomy bags and food supplements ’. Those related to matters not the subject of prior information. In any event, the matters raised must inevitably have prejudiced the claimant and the failure to exclude them at the hearing was itself unfair. Added to this, there was the failure to have [a relevant witness] attend despite the promise that he would and the observations of the presenting officer, compounded by the chairman, that the meeting was to review the decision to suspend the claimant.

Where such clientele/goodwill exists, measures that diminish its value, as, for example in Van Marle, interference with professional practice, may engage Article 1. But where it does not exist, as it does not here, the Court of Appeal ’ s decision in Countryside ... is also clear authority for the proposition that, without it, mere prospective loss of future income cannot amount to a possession for the purpose. Equally, any consideration of a further category of Article 1 possession based on a notion of legitimate expectation in this context would unacceptably blur that distinction of principle. It would also, as I have indicated, lead to great difficulties of practical application in the next stages of the Article 1 exercise of identifying precisely what legitimately expected ‘ possession ’ had been interfered with and to what extent, and in considering the ‘ legitimacy ’ of the expectation against considerations of the general interest on the issue of justification.”"

However, there was no evidence before the Judge to support such finding of interference, in particular, no effective loss of remuneration or of actual or prospective loss of patients, since he continued to receive 90% of his National Health Service remuneration by reference to his patient list, pursuant to regulation 13(17) of the 2004 Performers Lists Regulations ... and his practice was preserved by the PCT arranging and paying for his patients to be seen by a locum ...",

Because of the unsatisfactory condition of Dr Malik ’ s surgery premises, the PCT was obliged to refer his NHS patients to a locum at another nearby practice. However, his premises were still available for his use, for example, for the purpose of seeing private patients.

One solution may be ... looking only to marketability. I am not sure of that, however, for two reasons: one is the substantive distinction drawn by Denimark; the other is the emphasis placed by the Strasbourg jurisprudence on goodwill as a possession in the case of professionals with respect to their clientele. I suspect that such goodwill is not readily marketable: on the other hand, I can conceive that a professional practice can perhaps only or best be thought of as involving a vested possession in terms of the goodwill consisting in its clientele.",

As such, I do not see how it can be regarded as an asset or, therefore, a possession for the purposes of [Article 1].

So also in Karni, which in its way is the closest authority to the facts of the instant case, it was not the affiliation to Sweden ’ s social security system which was regarded as the possession with which there had been interference by reason of its withdrawal, but the doctor ’ s ‘ vested interests ’ in his practice which had had to be closed down ... ”"

For reasons discussed above, it is not possible for Dr Malik to show that his practice had any asset in the nature of goodwill separate from his anticipation of future income under his NHS contract. Reference to his patient list ... is in one sense somewhat more to the point, because at least it can be said that the numbers on his list had a direct bearing, as I understand the matter, on his NHS remuneration, since that had to be recalculated every three months in accordance with those numbers. However, even so, his patient list remained in place, continued to earn him remuneration under his contract, and even if those numbers fell somewhat during the period of his suspension, as to which there was no evidence before the judge and no findings, that seems to me to be simply a matter relating to future income rather than an interference with vested rights in possession. The judge said that inclusion on the list had ‘ an intrinsic value ’ in that it enabled the doctor to practise and he went on immediately to explain that because the amount of remuneration would be affected by patient numbers, ‘ suspension may well affect the economic value of his practice ’ ... Although the judge then said that that reflected a present value apart from the right to future income, it seems to me that it plainly did not.

If the principle that the ability to earn future income is not a possession within [the meaning of Article 1] is to be maintained, it must follow that if the element of goodwill which has or may be damaged is reputation, or the loyalty of past clients, that element is not to be identified as a possession. In Denimark terms, the doctor ’ s complaint is as to an unjustified loss of reputation, caused by unlawful acts.

It was personal and non-transferable, and had been obtained after he had satisfied the PCT of his suitability to perform medical services. Second, his inclusion on the list was not akin to a licence to perform an economic activity: he remained entitled to practise as a doctor in NHS and private hospitals, and as a general practitioner to private patients by virtue of his registration with the GMC. Third, he could not rely on an underlying interest in the value of his NHS practice as the rule which prevented him from disposing of any goodwill in the practice deprived it of a value which would have the nature of private right.

In a case involving an alleged interference with an applicant ’ s medical practice, the Commission noted that the “vested interests” in the applicant ’ s medical practice could be regarded as “possessions” (see Karni v. Sweden, no. 11540/85, Commission decision of 8 March 1988, Decisions and Reports 55, p. 157). In later cases, the Court explained that law practices and their clientele were entities of a certain worth that had in many respects the nature of a private right and thus constituted assets and therefore possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 (see Olbertz v.

In any event, it went on to explain that, according to its case-law, the termination of a valid licence to run a business amounted to an interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Bimer S.A. v. Moldova, no. 15084/03, § 49, 10 July 2007; and Megadat.com SRL v. Moldova, no. 21151/04, §§ 62-63, 8 April 2008 ).

Where an applicant refers to the value of his business based upon the profits generated by the business, or the means of earning an income from the business, as “goodwill”, the Court has indicated that this reference is to be understood as a complaint in substance of loss of future income. The Court has previously found that this element of the complaint falls outside the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Ian Edgar [ Liverpool ] Ltd.; and Denimark Limited and 11 Others, both cited above).",

The above review of the general principles which emerge from an examination of the Court ’ s case-law demonstrates that, in cases involving the suspension or revocation of licences and permits or the refusal to enrol a person on a list of individuals entitled to practise a particular profession, the Court has tended to regard as a “possession” the underlying business or professional practice in question. Restrictions placed on registration, licences or permits connected to the work carried out by the business or the practice of the profession are generally viewed by the Court as the means by which the interference with a business or professional practice has taken place."

                "95. The Court emphasises at the outset that the present application concerns a medical practice operating within the context of the NHS in the United Kingdom and it is within this limited context that the following observations and conclusions must be understood."
            ],
            [
                "96. In view of its review of the case-law, the Court does not consider that the applicant ’ s inclusion in the Performers List in England constituted a “possession” for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In order for that Article to apply, it must be established that there was an underlying professional practice of a certain worth that had, in many respects, the nature of a private right and thus constituted an asset and therefore a “possession” within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 (see paragraph 89 above). The Court makes the following observations."
            ],
            [
                "97. First, it is not disputed that the applicant had practised as a sole practitioner in the same medical practice for almost thirty years. By the time his name was suspended from the Performers List, he had built up a clientele in the form of his patient list of around 1,400 patients (see paragraph 7 above)."
            ],
            [
                "98. Second, the medical practice was the vehicle through which the applicant earned his income. The income received by way of monies paid to him under the PCT contract was moreover directly linked to the size of his patient list (see paragraph 8 above). It is therefore clear that the applicant had a vested interest both in his medical practice generally and in ensuring that the number of patients registered with his practice did not fall. This interest was of an economic nature."
            ],
            [
                "99. Third, the applicant enjoyed “goodwill” in his practice, namely the advantage which had arisen over thirty years of practice from his own reputation and connections. As noted above, the applicant had a vested interest in his practice and his patient list, and the goodwill he had established was relevant to the decision of patients to remain registered or to choose to register with him. This consideration is not affected by the fact that under the terms of the Primary Medical Services (Sale of Goodwill and Restrictions on Sub-Contracting) Regulations 2004 (see paragraph 78 above) he was precluded from selling the goodwill in his practice."
            ],
            [
                "100. Having regard to the above considerations, the Court is of the view that the question whether there is a possession in the present case is inextricably linked to the question whether there has been an interference, a matter to be examined in the context of the Court ’ s consideration of the merits of the case. It therefore joins the question to the merits. The Court further considers that the application raises complex issues of fact and law which cannot be resolved at this stage in the examination of the application. It follows that the application cannot be declared manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established. It must therefore be declared admissible."
            ],
            [
                "101. The applicant emphasised that the High Court had found that an interference with his right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions had occurred (see paragraphs 36 - 37 above). Although the judgment of the High Court on the issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 had been reversed on appeal, Auld LJ had accepted that if he had found the applicant ’ s inclusion on the Performers List to be a possession, then the suspension would have amounted to an interference with that possession (see paragraph 49 above)."
            ],
            [
                "102. The applicant maintained that he had suffered loss as a result of the suspension. He pointed out that the issue of loss had been reserved to a further hearing by Collins J, and in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal, had never been addressed (see paragraph 37 above). He insisted that he had suffered loss as a result of the suspension because his monthly payments were reduced; the PCT stopped paying rent for the premises; and his patient numbers had dropped from 1,380 to 1,013 (see paragraph 43 above)."

Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, § 82, ECHR 2011). Future income cannot be considered to constitute “possessions” unless it has already been earned or is definitely payable (see Erkan v.

                "46. Although there is in principle no right under the Convention to hold a public post entailing the administration of justice (see Dzhidzheva ‑ Trendafilova v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 12628/09, § 38, 9 October 2012, and Harabin v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 62584/00, 29 June 2004), such a right may exist at the domestic level. In Regner ( cited above ) the Court reiterated that there can be no doubt about the fact that there is a right within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 where a substantive right recognised in domestic law is accompanied by a procedural right to have that right enforced through the courts. The mere fact that the wording of a legal provision affords an element of discretion does not in itself rule out the existence of a right. Indeed, Article 6 applies where the judicial proceedings concern a discretionary decision resulting in interference in an applicant ’ s rights (ibid., § 102). In some cases, national law, while not necessarily recognizing that an individual has a subjective right, confers the right to a lawful procedure for examination of his or her claim, involving matters such as ruling whether a decision was arbitrary or ultra vires or whether there were procedural irregularities. This is the case regarding certain decisions where the authorities have a purely discretionary power to grant or refuse an advantage or privilege, with the law conferring on the person concerned the right to apply to the courts, which, where they find that the decision was unlawful, may set it aside. In such a case Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is applicable, on condition that the advantage or privilege, once granted, gives rise to a civil right (ibid., § 105). While access to employment and to the functions performed may constitute in principle a privilege that cannot be legally enforced, this is not the case regarding the continuation of an employment relationship or the conditions in which it is exercised (ibid., § 117). In Baka, for instance, the Court recognised the right of the President of the Supreme Court to serve his full term of six years under Hungarian law (see Baka, cited above, §§ 107-11).",

                "47. Applying these principles to the present case, the Court observes, first of all, that there was a “dispute” concerning the exercise of the right to hold the position of president of a court. As regards the issue of whether such a “right” could be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised in domestic law, it has to be noted that the applicant was appointed to the position of president of the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal for a five ‑ year term (see paragraph 13 above) and his appointment for such tenure was not disputed at the domestic level. The applicant was provided with specific remuneration for his service as president of the court and his dismissal from this position was subject to certain substantive and procedural conditions. In the light of the above, and given that there was no dispute between the parties as to the existence of the right in question, there is no ground for considering that the applicant ’ s right to serve in that administrative position was not recognised under domestic law. Despite his appointment for a five-year period, the applicant ’ s right to hold the position of president of the court was limited in time by the fact that he was due to reach the retirement age in 2013, before the expiry of that period (see Article 126 of the Constitution cited in paragraph 26 above)."

Moreover, the dispute was “serious”, having regard to the role of the president of a court (see section 29 of the Judiciary and Status of Judges Act, cited in paragraph 28 above) and to the direct pecuniary consequences for the applicant resulting from his removal from that administrative position. In that regard the Government ’ s argument that the reduction in salary was insignificant for the applicant is not convincing. The applicant ’ s calculation of pecuniary damage in his domestic claim was limited only to the short period (see paragraph 22 above) which had elapsed at that stage, because the principal purpose of the claim was to secure his reinstatement in the position of president of the court. However, the pecuniary consequences were not insignificant from the perspective of the whole period which remained for the applicant to serve as president."

                "51. In this connection it has to be noted that the scope of the “civil” concept in Article 6 is not limited by the immediate subject matter of the dispute. Instead, the Court has developed a wider approach, according to which the “civil” limb has covered cases which might not initially appear to concern a civil right but which may have direct and significant repercussions on a private pecuniary or non-pecuniary right belonging to an individual. Through this approach, the civil limb of Article 6 has been applied to a variety of disputes which may have been classified in domestic law as public-law disputes. These examples include disciplinary proceedings concerning the right to practise a profession (see Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, 23 June 1981, §§ 47 and 48, Series A no. 43, and Philis v. Greece (no. 2), 27 June 1997, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV), disputes involving the right to a healthy environment (see Taşkın and Others v. Turkey, no. 46117/99, § 133, ECHR 2004 ‑ X), prisoners ’ detention arrangements (see Ganci v. Italy, no. 41576/98, § 25, ECHR 2003 ‑ XI, and Enea v.

Ukraine, no. 38773/05, §§ 143-45, 2 6 July 2012), disputes regarding the non-inclusion of a conviction in a criminal record (see Alexandre v. Portugal, no. 33197/09, §§ 54 and 55, 20 November 2012), proceedings for the application of a non-custodial preventive measure (see De Tommaso v.

Besides the above -mentioned development of the case-law, the scope of the “civil” limb has been substantially extended in relation to public - employment disputes, a field which is directly relevant to the present case. In Vilho Eskelinen and Others (cited above) the Court, having regard to the existing state of affairs in the Contracting States and in view of non-discrimination considerations in relation to civil servants as compared to private employees, established a presumption that Article 6 applied to “ordinary labour disputes” between a civil servant and the State and that it would be for the respondent Government to show that a civil servant did not have a right of access to a court under national law and that this exclusion of the rights under Article 6 was justified (ibid., § 62). On the basis of the principles set out in Vilho Eskelinen and Others, Article 6 has been applied to employment disputes involving judges who were dismissed from judicial office (see, for example, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § § 91 and 96; Kulykov and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 5114/09 and 17 others, §§ 118 and 132, 19 January 2017; Sturua v. Georgia, no. 45729/05, § 27, 28 March 2017; and Kamenos v.

Slovakia, no. 33392/12, § 34, 23 May 2017). It has also been applied to employment disputes involving civil servants who had lost a remote-area allowance which had been added to their salaries as a bonus (see Vilho Eskelinen, cited above, §§ 40 and 41) or who had been transferred to another office or post against their will, resulting in a decrease in salary (see Zalli v. Albania, no. 52531/07, 8 February 2011, and Ohneberg v. Austria, no. 10781/08, 18 September 2012). Furthermore, in Bayer v. Germany (no. 8453/04, 16 July 2009), which concerned the removal from office of a State-employed bailiff following disciplinary proceedings, the Court held that disputes about “salaries, allowances or similar entitlements” were only non-exhaustive examples of “ordinary labour disputes” to which Article 6 should in principle apply under the Vilho Eskelinen test (ibid., § 38; see also Regner, cited above, § 108).",

As shown above, a public-law dispute may bring the civil limb into play if the private-law aspects predominate over the public-law ones in view of the direct consequences for a civil pecuniary or non-pecuniary right. Furthermore, the Court follows the criteria set out in Vilho Eskelinen and Others and applies a general presumption that such direct consequences for civil rights exist in “ordinary labour disputes” involving members of the public service, including judges (ibid., § 62 and Baka, cited above, § 104 )."

Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 119, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports 1996 ‑ III)."

On the contrary, the HCJ was empowered to carry out its own assessment of the facts, provide its own legal characterisation of the matter and adopt a binding decision after holding a hearing and assessing the evidence.

In these circumstances the Court must examine whether the HCJ and the HAC satisfied the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

Accordingly, in the present case the Court is called upon to examine firstly whether the requirements of an “independent and impartial tribunal” were complied with by the HCJ. Secondly, if those requirements were not satisfied at that stage, it is necessary to determine whether the review of the case by the HAC was “sufficient” to remedy the shortcomings identified.

                "68. In its Oleksandr Volkov judgment (cited above) the Court set out a number of criteria for examining whether the HCJ as a disciplinary body of judges complied with the requirements of independence and impartiality. In doing so, the Court relied on its previous case-law and took into account relevant international texts, notably the opinions and recommendations of other bodies of the Council of Europe. First, it emphasised the need for substantial representation of judges within such a body, specifying that where at least half of the membership of a tribunal was composed of judges, including the chairman with a casting vote, this would be a strong indicator of impartiality (ibid., § 109). Second, in view of the importance of reducing the influence of political organs on the composition of the disciplinary body, it was relevant to assess the manner in which judges were appointed to that body, having regard to the authorities which delegated them and the role of the judicial community in that process (ibid., § 112). Third, it was relevant to establish whether the members of the disciplinary body worked on a full-time basis or continued to work and receive a salary outside; given that the latter case would inevitably involve their material, hierarchical and administrative dependence on their primary employers, this would endanger their independence and impartiality (ibid., § 113). Fourth, attention had to be paid to the participation of representatives of the prosecution authorities in the composition of the disciplinary body for judges; the inclusion of the Prosecutor General ex officio and the other members delegated by the prosecution authorities raised concerns as to the impartiality of the disciplinary body of judges in view of the functional role of prosecutors in domestic judicial proceedings (ibid., § 114). Fifth, where the members of the disciplinary body played a role in the preliminary inquiry in a disciplinary case and subsequently participated in the determination of the same case by the disciplinary body, such a duplication of functions could cast objective doubt on the impartiality of those members (ibid., § 115)."
            ],
            [
                "69. The Court found in Oleksandr Volkov that the composition of the HCJ, as provided for by the Constitution, had disclosed a number of structural shortcomings which had compromised the requirements of independence and impartiality. Under these constitutional rules, the majority of the HCJ had consisted of non-judicial staff appointed directly by the executive and the legislative authorities, with the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutor General being ex officio members. The decision to dismiss the applicant in Oleksandr Volkov had been taken by sixteen members of the HCJ, only three of whom were judges. Furthermore, only four out of the twenty members of the HCJ worked there on a full-time basis, while the other members continued to work and receive a salary outside the HCJ. The membership and presence of the Prosecutor General and other representatives of the prosecution system within the HCJ raised further concerns in terms of impartiality, given the functional role of the prosecutor ’ s office in domestic court proceedings. Moreover, there were two members of the HCJ who had brought disciplinary charges against the applicant, based on the results of their own preliminary inquiries, and subsequently decided on the merits of his case (ibid., §§ 110-15)."

            [
                "70. Those findings are entirely pertinent to the present application. The HCJ was formed and functioned under the same constitutional rules as in Oleksandr Volkov. Therefore, the same concerns arise as regards the compliance of the proceedings before the HCJ with the standards of independence and impartiality. The applicant ’ s case was heard and determined by eighteen members of the HCJ, of whom only eight were judges. The non-judicial members therefore constituted a majority capable of determining the outcome of the proceedings. Moreover, there remained issues both with the manner in which the judicial members were delegated to the HCJ by the executive and legislative authorities, limiting the number of judges in the HCJ elected by their peers, and also with the fact that the majority of the HCJ ’ s members were not employed there full time and that the Prosecutor General was a member."

This preliminary involvement cast objective doubt on Judge K. ’ s impartiality when he subsequently took part in the decision of the HCJ on the merits of the applicant ’ s case (compare Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 115; Poposki and Duma v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 69916/10 and 36531/11, § 48, 7 January 2016; and Sturua, cited above, § 35)."

                "74. In Oleksandr Volkov the Court specifically found that the HAC had not provided a sufficient review of a case concerning a judge ’ s dismissal from office. Firstly, the Court observed that the HAC had powers to declare the impugned decisions unlawful, but that it was unable to quash them and take any further appropriate steps if deemed necessary. Even though no legal consequences arose from a decision being declared unlawful, the HAC ’ s inability to quash the impugned decision, together with the absence of rules as to the further progress of the disciplinary proceedings (in particular, the steps that had to be taken by the authorities involved after the impugned decisions had been declared unlawful and the time-limits for those steps to be taken), produced serious uncertainty about the real legal consequences of such judicial declarations. Judicial practice suggested, moreover, that there was no automatic reinstatement in the event of a positive declaration by the HAC, because the judges concerned had to institute new proceedings for reinstatement (ibid., §§ 125 and 126). The Court also examined the manner and the actual scope of the HAC ’ s review and concluded that these were likewise inappropriate to provide a “sufficient review” (ibid., §§ 127 and 128)."

Firstly, in its decision the HAC considered that the applicant had not contested the facts forming the grounds for his dismissal and therefore those facts were taken as established. This conclusion is not consistent with the grounds of the applicant ’ s claim before the HAC, in which he clearly contested those facts. The applicant argued in particular that the findings of the HCJ were too general and that in order to substantiate its conclusions the HCJ should have referred to the specific circumstances and their time frame."

Having mentioned its competence to review whether the impugned decision had been taken in a manner compatible with a number of criteria, notably the requirement of impartiality, the HAC reached a general conclusion that the HCJ had not violated the Constitution or the laws of Ukraine. However, the HAC failed to assess whether the proceedings before the HCJ had complied with the principles of independence and impartiality. It provided no reasons in that regard."

As to the guarantees of independence and impartiality under Article 6 § 1 to be provided by the reviewing judicial body, such a review was performed in the present case by the judges of the HAC, who were also under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the HCJ. This means that those judges could also be the subject of disciplinary proceedings before the HCJ. The fact that judges of the HAC were subject to disciplinary law and were bound by rules of judicial discipline and ethics is not in itself a reason to put in doubt their independence and impartiality in relation to the authority empowered to implement disciplinary rules. The question of compliance with the fundamental guarantees of independence and impartiality may arise, however, if the structure and functioning of the disciplinary body raises serious issues in this regard. The present case does indeed disclose serious issues of this kind on the part of the HCJ, in particular structural deficiencies and the appearance of personal bias (see paragraphs 70-72 above). Secondly, the HCJ was not merely a disciplinary authority; it was in reality an authority with extensive powers with respect to the careers of judges (appointment, disciplining and dismissal). On the basis of those factors and having regard to the specific context of the Ukrainian system at the time, the Court, in the light of Oleksandr Volkov (cited above, § 130), finds that the judges of the HAC considering the applicant ’ s case, in which the HCJ participated, were not able to demonstrate the “independence and impartiality” required by Article 6 of the Convention."

However, it is important to stress that Article 8 cannot be relied on in order to complain of a loss of reputation which is the foreseeable consequence of one ’ s own actions, such as, for example, the commission of a criminal offence (see Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, § 49, and Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, § 83, 7 February 2012 ). In Gillberg (cited above) the Grand Chamber did not limit this rule to reputational damage and expanded it to a wider principle that any personal, social, psychological and economic suffering could be foreseeable consequences of the commission of a criminal offence and could not therefore be relied on in order to complain that a criminal conviction in itself amounted to an interference with the right to respect for “private life” (ibid., § 68). This extended principle should cover not only criminal offences but also other misconduct entailing a measure of legal responsibility with foreseeable negative effects on “private life”."

Whereas no general right to employment, nor a right of access to the civil service or a right to choose a particular profession, can be derived from Article 8, the notion of “private life”, as a broad term, does not exclude in principle activities of a professional or business nature. It is, after all, in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant opportunity to develop relationships with the outside world (see Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, § 29, Series A no. 251 ‑ B; Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 165; and Bărbulescu, cited above, § 71).

Other types of cases have concerned restrictions on access to employment in the public service (see Naidin v.

In Özpınar (cited above), proceedings for the applicant ’ s dismissal as a judge fell under Article 8 of the Convention because they concerned not only her professional performance but also targeted aspects of her private life, in particular her close private relationships, the clothes and make-up she wore and the fact that she lived separately from her mother (ibid., §§ 43 and 47). In another case the applicant ’ s transfer to a less important post within the public service raised an issue under “private life” given that such a measure amounted to a disguised penalty and had been prompted by reasons relating to the applicant ’ s beliefs and his wife ’ s clothing (see Sodan, cited above, §§ 47-49 )."

Where a private company dismissed an employee on the basis of monitoring of his correspondence by his employer in the workplace, such a measure fell within the ambit of Article 8 in so far as it concerned the “correspondence” and because it encroached upon the reasonable possibility of enjoying any “private life” in the workplace (see Bărbulescu, cited above, §§ 81 and 127)."

In this connection the Court has taken into account negative consequences as regards (i) impact on the individual ’ s “inner circle”, in particular where there are serious material consequences, (ii) the individual ’ s opportunities “to establish and develop relationships with others”, and (iii) the impact on the individual ’ s reputation."

The dismissal also had a negative impact on the applicant ’ s “inner circle” in view of his loss of earnings, and it also affected his reputation (see Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 166). The refusal to allow an applicant who was a foreigner to sit for the Bar examinations in Greece fell within the scope of Article 8 because it affected her personal choice as to the way she wished to pursue her professional and private life (see Bigaeva, cited above, §§ 24 and 25). The entry of an applicant ’ s name in the bankruptcy register entailed a series of legal restrictions on the exercise of her professional activities and civil rights. It therefore affected the applicant ’ s opportunities to develop relationships with the outside world and fell within the sphere of her private life (see Campagnano, cited above, § 54).

The Court has addressed the issue of the seriousness or severity of the alleged violation in several contexts. Notably, it has done so when assessing the “significant disadvantage” under Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention as an explicit admissibility requirement for the whole system of the Convention rights (see, for example, Giusti v.

The Court has also consistently applied a threshold of severity in cases concerning Article 3 of the Convention (see, for example, Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, § 67, ECHR 2006 ‑ IX; Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 88, ECHR 2010; and Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, § 86, ECHR 2015)."

In environmental cases, in particular, an arguable claim under Article 8 may arise where an environmental hazard attains a level of severity resulting in significant impairment of the applicant ’ s ability to enjoy his or her home or private or family life. The Court has ruled that the assessment of this minimum level in such cases is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance and its physical or mental effects on the individual ’ s health or quality of life (see Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, §§ 68 and 69, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV; Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine, no. 30499/03, § 105, 10 February 2011; and Grimkovskaya v. Ukraine, no. 38182/03, § 58, 21 July 2011 ).

These aspects include (i) the applicant ’ s “inner circle”, (ii) the applicant ’ s opportunity to establish and develop relationships with others, and (iii) the applicant ’ s social and professional reputation.

According to that principle, where the negative effects complained of are limited to the consequences of the unlawful conduct which were foreseeable by the applicant, Article 8 cannot be relied upon to allege that such negative effects encroach upon private life. It has to be noted that in Gillberg the fact of the applicant ’ s unlawful conduct was largely undisputed (see Gillberg, cited above, § 71), whereas in the present case the applicant contested the very existence of any misconduct, thus implying that the measure involving his legal liability – his dismissal – could not have been a foreseeable consequence of his conduct in the position of president of a court of appeal.

Even though the pecuniary element of the dispute has been considered significant for the purpose of the applicability of Article 6 under its civil head, this conclusion does not automatically bring the issue within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention. In the present case the applicant has not provided any evidence to suggest that the ensuing reduction in his monthly remuneration (see paragraph 22 above) seriously affected the “inner circle” of his private life.

Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, § 82, ECHR 2011). Future income cannot be considered to constitute “possessions” unless it has already been earned or is definitely payable (see Erkan v.

As a rule, it was not possible to transfer the ownership of Crown land before it had been transformed into privately owned land ( perinnöksiosto, skatteköp ). It was nevertheless possible to establish various rights relating to the enjoyment of the property and benefiting private individuals, municipalities or the Church. For example, the Crown could transfer a so-called permanent and exclusive right of possession in respect of the land, subject to a payment. Such a right required the land to be used for a specific purpose, and the Crown was entitled to regain possession of it either on payment of compensation or without having to redeem it. Over time the State ’ s title to the land could change into an ordinary one, whereas it was not, for example, possible to change the amount of the payment ( stadga ) collected from the holder of a right attaching to the property."

According to the applicants, the right to perpetual usufruct did exist in the early 18 th century and was explicitly established, given that transfer of ownership per se was prohibited in respect of Crown land. A right of usufruct was granted permanently until 1766, when the Royal Finance Collegium (in Swedish Kammarkollegiet ) decided to let Crown land for a fixed period of six years following a tendering procedure in the form of an auction. As the right claimed by the applicants in respect of the Bergö-Högholm property had been established well before, the 1766 Decree was irrelevant to this case. The nature of the payment collected from the then owners of the Karsby mansion (in Swedish stadga or stadgad ränta ) was fiscal, which is evidenced by the fact that it was entered in the column of land tax in the land register, and replaced by wealth tax in 1924."

For land registration purposes such a right is treated as a leasing right, and its holder may put it up as collateral (section 18a, subsection 4, of the Implementation Act).

The nature of that right was either full ownership or at least a right of usufruct. By upholding the State ’ s ownership of the Bergö-Högholm property, as registered in 1991, the Court of Appeal had in its judgment of 1996 effectively confiscated the applicants ’ property without any justification under the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. This provision was applicable, since the applicants ’ interests relating to the Bergö-Högholm property constituted a “possession” for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Their right to make use of the property had been equivalent to a right of ownership peacefully enjoyed for over 300 years, the sole limitation being that the legal title could not be transferred from the State to the owners of the Karsby mansion. In all other respects those owners had continuously enjoyed the rights and obligations pertaining to a de facto proprietary interest: the State had levied payments of a fiscal nature and later wealth tax; it had levied inheritance tax following Olof Bruncrona ’ s death; the owners ’ right had been recorded as a right of perpetual usufruct in the official land register; and over the centuries the authorities had on several occasions confirmed the nature of that right."

The Court of Appeal had thus deprived the applicants of the possibility of relying on any other means of evidence. All known relevant land- register extracts and court decisions had been produced in the domestic proceedings, and the transfer of the relevant right to the applicants ’ predecessors had never been based on a specific deed or agreement. As the Court had found in The Holy Monasteries v. Greece ( judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-A, p. 32, § 60), adverse possession could be relied upon both against the State and against third parties after an extensive period of possession, in the absence of any legal title. The applicants ’ peaceful enjoyment of the Bergö-Högholm property for over 300 years should therefore have sufficed for a claim based on adverse possession.

Even though the cases had not been fully comparable, in both of them the Senate had spoken of “attaching the islands to an estate in return for payment of a levy” (in Swedish underläggs ... mot en stadgad ränta ). The evidence adduced had contained nothing to support the Court of Appeal ’ s view that the applicants ’ right constituted a leasing right, as opposed to a right of perpetual usufruct. On the contrary, the permanent nature of their right had been clearly evidenced by the documentation and, by analogy, by the Supreme Court ’ s judgment no. 1989:73.

The Court of Appeal ’ s judgment of 1996 had not been foreseeable. In addition, the Court of Appeal had not referred to any public or general interest justifying the interference with the applicants ’ property rights.

The applicants had tried in vain to obtain confirmation either of their formal ownership of the property or of their right of permanent usufruct. The courts had twice examined whether ownership of the Crown land in question had been transferred from the State to the owners of the Karsby mansion, whether the owners of the mansion had a permanent right of usufruct in respect of the land and, if so, whether that right could be considered to constitute formal ownership. To that end the courts had examined legal documents from the 18 th century onwards ( in contrast to the position in The Holy Monasteries, cited above, p. 32, § 60). Different interpretations had been possible, as was demonstrated by the different decisions given by the courts. The legal experts relied on by the parties had also disagreed with one another. The Court of Appeal had found, in the light of the evidence adduced, that the applicants had never enjoyed full ownership or even a permanent right of usufruct, as the right originally afforded to the Karsby mansion had had the character of a mere lease. The restricted right of usufruct afforded by that lease did not under current domestic law entail a right of ownership on the mere ground that the property had been in the tenant ’ s actual possession for a long time. It was not for the European Court to take the place of the national courts in determining whether the land in question belonged to the State or whether – contrary to the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment of 1996 – the applicants should have been recognised as owners of the land on one legal basis or another."

                "76. It is obvious that different interpretations concerning the classification in domestic law of the property interest at issue were possible. This is shown by the contradictory conclusions drawn by the District Court and the Court of Appeal in both sets of proceedings. This, however, is far from saying that the classification by the Court of Appeal, which became final, was arbitrary or manifestly wrong and therefore incompatible with the Convention."

                "77. The Court, indeed, cannot discern any arbitrariness. It considers that the Court of Appeal ’ s interpretation is not incompatible with the historical context, the prevailing legal opinion or the notion of a lease. As to the taxes levied on the applicants, the Court considers that no conclusions can be drawn from the levying of inheritance tax with regard to the Bergö-Högholm property, since it was a mere result of the inclusion of the property in the inventory of Olof Bruncrona ’ s estate. As to the levying of wealth tax, the Court notes that according to domestic law, leased Crown land has been regarded as the tenant ’ s possession for taxation purposes. Thus, the taxes levied are not inconsistent with the Court of Appeal ’ s interpretation."

Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, §§ 59-60, ECHR 2004 - ... ). It follows that the court proceedings ending with the Court of Appeal judgment cannot be said to have deprived the applicants of any such right.

While the court proceedings cannot be qualified as a deprivation of possessions, they nevertheless confirmed that the applicants had been granted a proprietary interest, which was classified as a lease. The events starting at the latest from the granting of fishing rights to a third party in 1984 amounted to an interference with a proprietary interest protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. That interference was not intended as a means of controlling the applicants ’ property but rather reflected the authorities ’ view, ultimately confirmed by the courts, that the property, that is to say the islands, belonged to the State. In these circumstances, the interference with the applicants ’ proprietary interest should be analysed in the light of the general rule in the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 ( see Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 136, ECHR 2004 -V)."

The Court does not doubt that these are legitimate interests for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No 1."

That arrangement was upheld by the Senate ’ s decision of 1862. Neither was the arrangement affected by the land - parcelling proceedings in 1975. The owners of the Karsby mansion made use of the islands in an undisturbed manner until 1984, when the State granted fishing rights to a third party. This act does not seem to have been accompanied by any explanation to Olof Bruncrona that the granting of fishing rights was based on the State ’ s ownership of the islands. Instead, a few years later Olof Bruncrona himself instituted proceedings which dealt, firstly, with the ownership of the islands and, secondly, with the possible existence of a right of permanent usufruct. The court proceedings confirmed that Olof Bruncrona was neither the owner of the islands nor the holder of a permanent right of usufruct. At the same time, however, the proceedings confirmed that the relationship between the State and the Karsby mansion had been based on the lease of the property in question. No explicit termination of the lease has taken place."

The applicants could reasonably have expected at the very least to be informed of the date of the expiry of the lease in the notice of termination. Although the existing provision to this effect in current Finnish law (see the Rent on Land Act, paragraph 41 above) was not directly applicable in the present case, the same requirement should be regarded as a minimum under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

Moreover, all evidence had been disclosed to the applicant and her lawyer during the hearings. To sum up, the only restriction imposed on the applicant, namely an obligation to consult the classified documents in a secret registry of the lustration court and to deposit her notebook there, did not affect her ability to examine the evidence against her in a way that would have impaired her defence rights."

In particular the Court held in that judgment that, unless the contrary is shown on the facts of a specific case, it cannot be assumed that there remains a continuing and actual public interest in imposing limitations on access to materials classified as confidential under former regimes. This is because lustration proceedings are, by their very nature, oriented towards the establishment of facts dating back to the communist era and are not directly linked to the current functions and operations of the security services. Lustration proceedings inevitably depend on the examination of documents relating to the operations of the former communist security agencies, the selection and disclosure of which documents is at the discretion of the current security service. If the party to whom the classified materials relate is denied access to all or most of the materials in question, the possibility of his or her contradicting the security agency ’ s version of the facts will be severely curtailed.",

In this connection, the Court first observes that it is not in dispute that materials from the communist-era security services were regarded as State secrets. The confidential status of such materials had been upheld by the State Security Bureau. Thus, at least part of the documents relating to the applicant ’ s lustration case had been covered by official secrecy. However, the Court reiterates that it has previously held that such a situation is inconsistent with the fairness of lustration proceedings, including the principle of equality of arms (see Turek, cited above, § 115; Matyjek, cited above, § 57; and Bobek, cited above, § 58 )."

After the institution of the lustration proceedings, the applicant could also access her court file. However, pursuant to Article 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and section 52 (2) of the Protection of Classified Information Act 1999, no copies could be made of materials contained in the court file and confidential documents could be consulted only in the secret registry of the lustration court.

Under the domestic law, the Commissioner, who was a public body, had been vested with powers identical to those of a public prosecutor. Under section 17(e) of the Lustration Act, the Commissioner of Public Interest had a right of access to full documentation relating to the lustrated person created by, inter alia, the former security services. If necessary, he or she could hear witnesses and order expert opinions. The Commissioner also had at his or her disposal a secret registry, with staff who had obtained official clearance, allowing them access to documents considered to be State secrets, and were employed to analyse lustration declarations in the light of the existing documents and to prepare the case file for the lustration trial."

The notebooks could not be removed from this registry and could be opened only by the person who had made notes in them. Similar constraints were imposed on any notes taken during the hearings.

The Court accepts that there may be a situation in which there is a compelling State interest in maintaining the secrecy of some documents, even those produced under the former regime. Nevertheless, such a situation will arise only exceptionally, given the considerable time which has elapsed since the documents were created. It is for the Government to prove the existence of such an interest in the particular case, because what is accepted as an exception must not become the norm. The Court considers that a system under which the outcome of lustration trials depends to a considerable extent on the reconstruction of the actions of the former secret services, while most of the relevant materials remain classified as secret and the decision to maintain their confidentiality falls within the powers of the current secret services, creates a situation in which the lustrated person is put at a clear disadvantage."

Regard being had to the particular context of the lustration proceedings and to the cumulative application of those rules, the Court considers that they placed an unrealistic burden on the applicant in practice and did not satisfy the requirements of a fair hearing or equality of arms between the parties to the proceedings."

Collaboration itself had not barred citizens from access to public office; only the truthfulness of the lustration declaration was in issue in the lustration proceedings. The principle of the protection of the citizen ’ s confidence in the State and law also militated in favour of the solution adopted in the applicant ’ s case. The requirements of social justice, guaranteed by Article 2 of the Constitution, had made it necessary to draw a distinction between judges who had made true declarations and those who had not.

In her case, the institution of the lustration proceedings had been unjustified, because when the 1997 Act had entered into force she no longer occupied a judicial post. Hence, none of the reasons for which the Lustration Act had been enacted, namely to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they could not be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles, had applied to her situation.

The essential aim of lustration was to protect a newly emerged democracy, not to punish people presumed guilty. No one could reasonably contest after 1996 that Poland was a stable and relatively mature democracy, no longer threatened by the possibility of a post-communist coup d ’ état. Therefore, the severity and scope of acceptable lustration measures adopted in 1997 should have been less than what might have been acceptable in the early 1990s.

The Government argued that, under domestic law, the status was linked with the constitutional principle of judicial independence and irremovability and that, even though a retired judge who acquired the privileged status no longer occupied a judicial post and had no active judicial role to play, he or she was regarded in domestic law as continuing to exercise a public function and the application of the lustration laws to the holder of such status was accordingly justified.",

On 4 December 1997 the applicant acquired the status of retired judge. On 17 December 1997 it became apparent from the amendment to the 1985 Act that those who wished to maintain the status and to enjoy the special pension rights attached to it would be required to submit a lustration declaration. The applicant was thus aware from an early stage, and before she had received any part of the pension, that her status as a retired judge and her right to receive a special retirement pension was conditional on her submitting a lustration declaration and that her special pension rights were defeasible if she were found to have submitted a false declaration. This was ultimately the case, as it was established in the lustration proceedings that the applicant did not satisfy the conditions which domestic law attached to the acquisition and retention of the status of a “retired judge” and to the related pension rights."

In this regard, the case bears a similarity to a series of cases against Poland in which the Commission declared inadmissible claims under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by applicants who had been deprived of their “veteran status” and related social insurance benefits under a law passed in 1991, many years after the grant of such status, on the grounds of their previous service as collaborators with the former internal security service. In rejecting the applications, the Commission recalled that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 could not be interpreted as conferring a right to a pension of a particular amount and noted that, although being deprived of their special social insurance benefits, the applicants had retained their rights to their ordinary retirement benefits due under the general social insurance system. It was observed that the 1991 Act was partly intended as a condemnation of the political role which the communist security service had played in repressing political opposition to the communist system and that such considerations of public policy, even if they resulted in the reduction of social insurance benefits, did not affect the property rights stemming from the social insurance system in a manner contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. I. (see Styk v. Poland (dec.), no. 28356/95, 16 April 1998; Szumilas v. Poland (dec.), no 35187/97, 1 July 1998; Bieńkowski v. Poland (dec.), no. 33889/97, 9 September 1998). The same approach was followed by the Court itself in the case of Domalewski, in which it was noted that “the applicant ’ s pecuniary rights stemming from the contributions paid into her pension scheme remained the same” and that “the applicant ’ s right to derive benefits from the social insurance scheme was [not] infringed in a manner contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, especially as the loss of “veteran status” did not result in the essence of his pension rights being impaired ( see Domalewski v. Poland (dec.), no. 34610/97, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; see also, Slavičinsky v. the Czech Republic (dec. ), no. 10072/05, 20 November 2006)."

In these circumstances, the Court finds that the loss of the applicant ’ s status as a retired judge and of the special retirement pension attached to that status, as a result of the submission of a false lustration declaration, did not amount to an interference with the property rights of the applicant under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

As regards the second aspect of the applicant ’ s complaint, the Court notes that the applicant was held to have submitted a false declaration following a procedure which the Court has found above to have been unfair and to have violated Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The Court recalls in this regard that, although Article 1 contains no explicit procedural requirements, an applicant who is liable to be deprived of property rights must be afforded a reasonable opportunity of putting his or her case (see, AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 198 6, § 55). The Court has found above that the applicant was not deprived of a property right. Insofar as the applicant complains that the procedures which led to the finding by the National Judicial Council that she had submitted a false declaration were unfair, and that she was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to assert her claim to retain her special status and retirement pension, the Court considers that the complaint is directly connected with that already examined under Article 6 of the Convention. Having regard to its conclusion that there was an infringement of the applicant ’ s right to a fair hearing for the reasons stated above, the Court finds that it is not necessary to examine the applicant ’ s further complaint based on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, Glod v. Romania, no. 41134/98, § 46, 16 September 2003; Albina v. Romania, no. 57808/00, § 43, 28 April 2005; Mitrevski v. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 33046/02, § 41, 21 June 2007)."

There was at the time no common border between Nagorno-Karabakh (known as Artsakh by its Armenian name) and the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (“the Armenian SSR”), which were separated by Azerbaijani territory, the district of Lachin being the shortest distance between them, including a strip of land often referred to as the “Lachin corridor”, less than 10 km wide."

They also recommend that measures be taken to preserve cemeteries and places of worship in the territories and to clarify the status of settlers who lack identity documents.

The use of military force that has already created the current situation of confrontation and instability will not resolve the conflict. A renewal of hostilities would be disastrous for the population of the region, resulting in loss of life, more destruction, additional refugees, and enormous financial costs. We strongly urge the leaders of all the sides to recommit to the Helsinki principles, particularly those relating to the non-use of force or the threat of force, territorial integrity, and equal rights and self-determination of peoples. We also appeal to them to refrain from any actions or rhetoric that could raise tension in the region and lead to escalation of the conflict. The leaders should prepare their people for peace, not war.",

While in 2005 some thirty-three buildings remained intact, there were only seventeen in 2009 and thirteen in 2012 left. For most of the destroyed buildings, outer and interior walls have been preserved while roofs have collapsed. While the state of the buildings suggests fire as a possible cause of destruction, the report emphasises that the cause of destruction could not be determined via satellite imagery, and, in particular, it was not always possible to state whether or not buildings had been destroyed deliberately. No cemeteries were identifiable on the satellite imagery. The report suggests that this might be due to vegetation overgrowth.",

They had not provided any details in respect of the civil cases allegedly brought before the Azerbaijani courts by ethnic Armenians. The cases individually related to inheritance and had no direct relevance for a person in the applicant ’ s situation. In short, the Government had failed to produce any example of an Armenian claimant obtaining redress in circumstances comparable to the applicant ’ s. In addition, the applicant argued that the position adopted by the Government in the proceedings before the Court was indicative of the outcome of any action the applicant might have brought before the Azerbaijani courts. According to the Government, the relevant domestic authorities did not dispose of any documentary evidence showing that the applicant had had possessions in Gulistan or that he had lived there.

Referring to documents of various United Nations bodies, in particular the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the applicant asserted that there was no political will on the part of the Government to protect abandoned property of ethnic Armenians, which was often occupied by refugees or internally displaced persons (IDPs), or to provide compensation for it. Moreover, there was a practice of not giving ethnic Armenians access to documentation concerning their property. There were no signs of a change of these practices. In addition, the applicant drew attention to the practical difficulties in pursuing any court case in Azerbaijan. Borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan were closed. As there were no diplomatic relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, ethnic Armenian refugees or citizens of Armenia were unable to obtain visas except via the consular services in neighbouring countries. Visas were only granted in the context of official visits organised by international organisations or diplomatic missions. Postal services between the two countries were not viable either."

Moreover, he had been seriously ill since 2004."

To start with, Article 29 of the 1995 Constitution guaranteed the right to property. In addition, Article 68 of the Constitution provided for State liability to compensate any damage resulting from illegal actions or omissions of State bodies or their officials. The Civil Code and the Code of Civil Procedure in turn contained more detailed provisions protecting both ownership and possession of property. Adequate procedures were in place to enable both citizens and foreigners to bring an action before the courts of Azerbaijan with regard to any damage or loss suffered on the territory of Azerbaijan (for a detailed description, see the relevant domestic law, paragraphs 88 - 92 above).

In support of their position, the Government submitted statistics by the Ministry of Justice concerning cases brought by ethnic Armenians: for instance, between 1991 and 2006 the courts of first instance in Baku examined and delivered judgments in 243 civil cases brought by ethnic Armenians, 98 of which related to housing disputes. Furthermore, the Government submitted copies of judgments in two cases concerning inheritance, in which decisions in favour of ethnic Armenians living abroad were given by the appellate courts. The case of Mammadova Ziba Sultan gizi v. Mammadova Zoya Sergeyevna and Mammadov Farhad Tarif oglu (judgment of the Chamber of Civil Cases of the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Azerbaijan of 24 May 2007) concerned an inheritance dispute over property, in which the defendants were the ethnic Armenian spouse and son of the deceased, who were both living in the United States of America. The Court of Appeal overturned the judgment of the Court of First Instance dismissing its assessment that the defendants had to be considered as heirs in bad faith. In Sinyukova, Korovkova and Zaimkina ( “ Chagaryan ”, judgment of the Chamber of Civil Cases of the Shaki Court of Appeal of 7 November 2007), the Court of Appeal decided that the State Notary Office of Mingachevir city had to issue an inheritance certificate in respect of an apartment to the three claimants, daughters of an ethnic Armenian living abroad, as they had to be considered as having made their declaration of inheritance in time. While conceding that these cases did not concern situations which were comparable to the applicant ’ s case, they demonstrated, in the Government ’ s view, that claims of Armenians relating to property and other protected rights could be effectively enforced in the Azerbaijani legal system."

States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system, and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV ). The Court cannot emphasise enough that it is not a court of first instance; it does not have the capacity, nor is it appropriate to its function as an international court, to adjudicate on large numbers of cases which require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation – both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic jurisdiction (see Demopoulos and Others, cited above, § 69, and Kazali and Others v. Cyprus (dec.), nos. 49247/08 and 8 others, § 132, 6 March 2012 )."

                "116. The Court has set out the general principles pertaining to the exhaustion of domestic remedies in a number of judgments. In Akdivar and Others (cited above) it held as follows.",
                "“65. The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article [35] of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial or arbitral organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity –, that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights ...",
                "66. Under Article [35] normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness ...",
                "Article [35] also requires that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at Strasbourg should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used ...",
                "67. However, there is, as indicated above, no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective. In addition, according to the ‘ generally recognised rules of international law ’ there may be special circumstances which absolve the applicant from the obligation to exhaust the domestic remedies at his disposal ... The rule is also inapplicable where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective ...",
                "68. In the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedies there is a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement ... One such reason may be constituted by the national authorities remaining totally passive in the face of serious allegations of misconduct or infliction of harm by State agents, for example where they have failed to undertake investigations or offer assistance. In such circumstances it can be said that the burden of proof shifts once again, so that it becomes incumbent on the respondent Government to show what they have done in response to the scale and seriousness of the matters complained of.",
                "69. The Court would emphasise that the application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. Accordingly, it has recognised that Article [35] must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism ... It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case ... This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants.”"

                "117. Turning to the present case, the Court observes that the application of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention has to be assessed against the general background of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. While the military phase of the conflict ended with the Ceasefire Agreement in May 1994, no peace treaty has been concluded to date. It is not in dispute that there are no diplomatic relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan and that borders are closed. Moreover, it appears that postal services are not viable between the two countries. In such a situation it must be recognised that there may be obstacles to the proper functioning of the system of the administration of justice. In particular, there may be considerable practical difficulties in bringing and pursuing legal proceedings in the other country (see, mutatis mutandis, Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 70)."

The Court observes that the Government have described the general scheme of protection of property and of compensation for unlawful acts or omissions as laid down in the Constitution and the Civil Code. However, they have failed to explain how these provisions would apply in the specific context where a person in the applicant ’ s situation, namely an Armenian refugee who had to leave his or her property and home in the context of the Nagorno ‑ Karabakh conflict, wishes to claim restitution of property or compensation for the loss of its enjoyment. The Government have submitted statistics on civil cases which were introduced by ethnic Armenians and decided by the Azerbaijani courts. Apart from stating that the cases concerned housing disputes, the Government did not provide any details regarding the nature of the claims examined or the outcome of the proceedings. Turning to the two judgments from 2007 which the Government submitted by way of example, the Court notes that they both concerned inheritance proceedings and did not relate to claims for loss of access to and enjoyment of property and/or home of a person displaced in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. In fact, the Government have not provided a single example of a case in which a person in the applicant ’ s situation had been successful before the Azerbaijani courts."

It is therefore not necessary to determine whether, as alleged by the applicant, there is an administrative practice on the part of the Azerbaijani authorities which would prevent the applicant from making use of existing remedies. Similarly, as no effective remedies have been shown to exist, it is not necessary to examine the effect that the alleged lack of effective control over the area in issue may have on the operation of domestic remedies."

In the applicant ’ s view, the Government had failed to produce such proof as they had not shown that they did not exercise control over Gulistan. He pointed out that the Government ’ s position concerning the factual situation had been somewhat inconsistent, but that they had accepted that Gulistan was not under Armenian control.

Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, §§ 331 and 333, ECHR 2004-VII).

Gulistan was such an area. It was on the Line of Contact, meaning that it was surrounded by armed forces of Azerbaijan on one side (in the north and east) and of Armenia on the other side (in the south and west) and was not under the effective control of either side.

They argued that such positive obligations depended on the factual circumstances of the case and were not to be construed in such a way as to impose a disproportionate burden on the State ( ibid., § 332).

                "“137. Article 1 of the Convention requires the States Parties to ‘ secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention ’. It follows from this provision that the States Parties are answerable for any violation of the protected rights and freedoms of anyone within their ‘ jurisdiction ’ – or competence – at the time of the violation.",
                "139. The Ajarian Autonomous Republic is indisputably an integral part of the territory of Georgia and subject to its competence and control. In other words, there is a presumption of competence. The Court must now determine whether there is valid evidence to rebut that presumption.",
                "140. In that connection, the Court notes, firstly, that Georgia has ratified the Convention for the whole of its territory. Furthermore, it is common ground that the Ajarian Autonomous Republic has no separatist aspirations and that no other State exercises effective overall control there (see, by converse implication, Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia (dec.) [GC], no. 48787/99, 4 July 2001, and Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, Series A no. 310 ). On ratifying the Convention, Georgia did not make any specific reservation under Article 57 of the Convention with regard to the Ajarian Autonomous Republic or to difficulties in exercising its jurisdiction over that territory. Such a reservation would in any event have been ineffective, as the case-law precludes territorial exclusions (see Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24833/94, § 29, ECHR 1999-I) other than in the instance referred to in Article 56 § 1 of the Convention (dependent territories).",
                "142. Thus, the presumption referred to in paragraph 139 above is seen to be correct. Indeed, for reasons of legal policy – the need to maintain equality between the States Parties and to ensure the effectiveness of the Convention – it could not be otherwise. But for the presumption, the applicability of the Convention could be selectively restricted to only parts of the territory of certain States Parties, thus rendering the notion of effective human rights protection underpinning the entire Convention meaningless while, at the same time, allowing discrimination between the States Parties, that is to say beween those which accepted the application of the Convention over the whole of their territory and those which did not.",

                "This presumption may be limited in exceptional circumstances, particularly where a State is prevented from exercising its authority in part of its territory. That may be as a result of military occupation by the armed forces of another State which effectively controls the territory concerned (see Loizidou v.

In order to be able to conclude that such an exceptional situation exists, the Court must examine on the one hand all the objective facts capable of limiting the effective exercise of a State ’ s authority over its territory, and on the other the State ’ s own conduct. The undertakings given by a Contracting State under Article 1 of the Convention include, in addition to the duty to refrain from interfering with the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms guaranteed, positive obligations to take appropriate steps to ensure respect for those rights and freedoms within its territory (see, among other authorities, Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, § 73, ECHR 2001-V).",

The Court considers that where a Contracting State is prevented from exercising its authority over the whole of its territory by a constraining de facto situation, such as obtains when a separatist regime is set up, whether or not this is accompanied by military occupation by another State, it does not thereby cease to have jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention over that part of its territory temporarily subject to a local authority sustained by rebel forces or by another State.",
                "Nevertheless, such a factual situation reduces the scope of that jurisdiction in that the undertaking given by the State under Article 1 must be considered by the Court only in the light of the Contracting State ’ s positive obligations towards persons within its territory. The State in question must endeavour, with all the legal and diplomatic means available to it vis-à-vis foreign States and international organisations, to continue to guarantee the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention.",

Although it is not for the Court to indicate which measures the authorities should take in order to comply with their obligations most effectively, it must verify that the measures actually taken were appropriate and sufficient in the present case. When faced with a partial or total failure to act, the Court ’ s task is to determine to what extent a minimum effort was nevertheless possible and whether it should have been made. Determining that question is especially necessary in cases concerning an alleged infringement of absolute rights such as those guaranteed by Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention.",

The AAAS report based on the interpretation of satellite images from 2005, 2009 and 2012 indicates that there are trenches in or, at the very least, on the edges of the village. These trenches can be seen clearly in the 2005 and 2009 images, but are less clearly distinguishable in the 2012 image. Since the village is on the north bank of the river and there are only Azerbaijani positions there, the Court considers it sufficiently established, based on the available evidence, that the trenches form part of Azerbaijani positions. This also provides an indication of the presence of military Azerbaijani personnel given that trenches need to be maintained (as follows from the AAAS report according to which trenches fell into disuse in the period between 2009 and 2012 and are therefore less clearly visible). In that connection the Court reiterates that it was not in dispute that there were no civilians in the village. In addition, it appears again from the AAAS report and from the DVD submitted by the third-party Government in 2012 that the territory north of the village and thus access routes to it are under the control of Azerbaijani armed forces.

In its decision on the admissibility of the present case, the Court has held that the declaration was not capable of restricting the territorial application of the Convention to certain parts of the internationally recognised territory of Azerbaijan ( see Sargsyan (dec.), cited above, §§ 63-65) nor did it fulfil the requirements of a valid reservation ( ibid., §§ 66-70)."

On the basis of all the material before it and having regard to the above establishment of facts, the Court finds that Gulistan is not occupied by or under the effective control of foreign forces as this would require a presence of foreign troops in Gulistan."

Russia ( nos. 17170/04 and 5 others, § 293, 3 May 2011 ), the Court accepted the claim of ownership by some of the applicants on the basis of extracts from a housing inventory issued by the town administration after the attack which showed that the applicants were the owners of their houses. As regards the applicants who had submitted no proof of title, the Court established their property right on the basis of other evidence, such as a certificate of residence issued by the town administration. The Court also considered it likely that any documents confirming the applicants ’ title to the houses had been destroyed during the attack."

In situations where it has been established that the applicant was the owner of a house, the Court has not required further documentary evidence of his or her residence there to show that the house constituted a “home” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. For example, in Orphanides v. Turkey ( no. 36705/97, § 39, 20 January 2009 ), it stated as follows.",
                "“ The Court notes that the Government failed to produce any evidence capable of casting doubt upon the applicant ’ s statement that, at the time of the Turkish invasion, he was regularly residing in Lapithos and that his house was treated by him and his family as a home. ”"

Turkey, no. 15973/90, § 50, 2 November 2010, where the Court declared a complaint incompatible ratione materiae in the absence of evidence of ownership; see also the conclusion as to some applicants in the above-mentioned case of Kerimova and Others ). In several cases the Court has reiterated that the applicants are required to provide sufficient prima facie evidence in support of their complaints. In Damayev v. Russia ( no. 36150/04, § § 108-11, 29 May 2012 ) it considered that an applicant complaining of the destruction of his home should provide at least a brief description of the property in question. Since no documents or detailed claims were submitted, his complaint was found to be unsubstantiated. As further examples of prima facie evidence of ownership of or residence on property, the Court has mentioned documents such as land or property titles, extracts from land or tax registers, documents from the local administration, plans, photographs and maintenance receipts as well as proof of mail deliveries, statements of witnesses or any other relevant evidence (see, for instance, Prokopovich v. Russia, no. 58255/00, § 37, ECHR 2004-XI, and Elsanova v. Russia (dec.), no. 57952/00, 15 November 2005 )."

The applicant, for his part, referred to specific provisions of the 1 958 Charter on village councils (see paragraph 82 above), which appear to support his position that the village council could allocate land for the purpose of private construction.

In the present case, the applicant has submitted a technical passport established in his name and relating to a house and land of some 2,100 sq. m in Gulistan, with a detailed plan of the house. In the Court ’ s view the technical passport constitutes prima facie evidence. Provided that the technical passport can be regarded as a valid document, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine the details of the parties ’ submissions on the relevant domestic law of the Azerbaijan SSR in respect of the allocation of land in the early 1960s. The Court will therefore first examine the validity of the technical passport submitted by the applicant. The Court observes that both parties agreed that the registration of houses had been regulated by the 1985 Instructions (see paragraph 81 above ). The Court will address in turn each of the reasons adduced by the Government for finding that the technical passport was deficient or a forgery."

In so far as the Government claim that the technical passport did not contain a reference to a primary title of ownership, the Court notes that the parties disagreed as to which provisions of the 1985 Instructions applied in the applicant ’ s case. The Court is not in a position to establish the correct interpretation of the law in force in Azerbaijan in May 1991 when the technical passport was established. It notes that the applicant has at least given a plausible explanation as to why such a reference was not needed in his case. It is also correct, as the applicant pointed out, that the form which was used does not foresee such a reference. Finally, the applicant has submitted copies of technical passports of houses owned by other former villagers from Gulistan, which contain no such reference either."

Be that as it may, the Court attaches weight to the argument that the Government have not claimed let alone shown that new stamps had actually been provided to the relevant local authorities of the (former) Shahumyan region before May 1991, when the technical passport of the applicant ’ s house was established."

He submitted a copy of his former Soviet passport and of his marriage certificate, which show that he was born in Gulistan in 1929 and got married there in 1955. The applicant ’ s submissions as to how he obtained the land and the permission to build a house and then did so in the early 1960s with the help of neighbours and friends are supported by statements of a number of family members and former villagers. While the Court takes into account that these are written statements, which have not been tested in cross-examination, it notes that they are rich in detail and tend to demonstrate that the persons concerned have actually lived through the events they described. Given the long lapse of time since the villagers ’ displacement, the Court does not attach decisive importance to the fact that these statements do not corroborate each other in all details, as pointed out by the Government."

In the admissibility decision in the present case, the Court had noted that it was not clear whether the applicant ’ s house had been destroyed. It went on to say that at that stage it was only concerned with examining whether the facts of the case were capable of falling within its jurisdiction ratione temporis, while a detailed examination of the facts and legal issues of the case had to be reserved to the merits stage ( see Sargsyan (dec.), cited above, § 88 ). Having regard to its case-law, the Court considered that the applicant ’ s lack of access to his alleged property, home and the graves of his relatives in Gulistan had to be considered as a continuing situation which the Court had competence to examine since 15 April 2002. It had therefore rejected the Government ’ s objection ratione temporis ( ibid. , §§ 91-92). However, as the Court had reserved a detailed examination of the facts to the merits stage, it still has to determine whether or not the house was destroyed prior to the entry into force of the Convention and, consequently, whether there is a factual basis for the Government ’ s objection ratione temporis in respect of the house. Should the house have been destroyed before the entry into force of the Convention, this would indeed constitute an instantaneous act falling outside the Court ’ s competence ratione temporis (see Moldovan and Others v.

In reply to the Court ’ s request to explain this apparent contradiction, the applicant asserted that there had been some confusion between his house and his parent ’ s house which had arisen when his representative drafted the application on the basis of his written statement of 10 July 2006 in which he had used the phrase, “My mother stayed in the village of Gulistan and our house was destroyed”. The Court notes, firstly, that the said statement was submitted with the application. It accepts that the specific context in which the expression “our house” was used leaves room for different interpretations and that the relevant passage in the application form referring to the destruction of the applicant ’ s house might be the result of a misunderstanding."

They could, however, own houses as personal property. Moreover, land could be allotted to citizens for an indefinite period of time for purposes such as farming and housing. While the 1991 Law on property and the 1992 Land Code provided – for the first time – for a possibility to transfer land already allotted to citizens into their private ownership, detailed rules on the privatisation of land including individual houses allotted to citizens were only introduced by the 1996 Law on land reform."

It has not been claimed that the applicant has subsequently made use of this possibility. As the rights acquired by him under the old legislation were not rescinded by the enactment of the 1991 Law on property and the 1992 Land Code, the right to the house and land that he possessed at the time of his flight must be assessed with reference to the laws of the Azerbaijan SSR."

Personal property and the right to inherit it were protected by the State. In contrast, all land was owned by the State. Plots of land could be allocated to citizens for specific purposes such as farming and the construction of individual housing. In that case the citizen had a “ right of use ” in respect of the land. This follows again from Article 13 of the 1978 Constitution and Article 4 of the Land Code. The “right of use”, though it obliged the beneficiary to use the land for the purposes for which it had been allocated, was protected by law. This is not contested by the Government.

Such measures could include creating a property - records body and a process allowing refugees and displaced persons to re-establish legal title to pre-war property and file a claim for its repossession.

The Government pointed out that they consistently opposed the unlawful occupation of Nagorno ‑ Karabakh and the surrounding provinces by Armenian forces. In parallel, they had sought to re-establish control over the territory by all available diplomatic means, in particular by participating in the peace talks in the framework of the Minsk Group. Regular meetings were held by the Co- Chairs of the Group with the Foreign Ministers and Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan. In so far as individual measures were required to address the situation of refugees and IDPs, the Government referred to the 1991 Order (see paragraph 83 above) which legalised private property swaps between Azeris fleeing Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding provinces and Armenians fleeing Azerbaijan.

In that connection, the Government noted that the Azerbaijani armed forces, whose status was regulated by the 1993 Law on armed forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan, were responsible for defending the borders of Azerbaijan and for securing the safety of its inhabitants. Access to Gulistan, which was situated within an area of military operations, was prohibited by an Order of the Minister of Defence, which they could not disclose as it was strictly confidential. The legal basis for the Minister of Defence to issue such orders was to be found in Article 7 § 2 (11) of the Law on defence of the Republic of Azerbaijan. In fulfilling their mission outlined above, the Azerbaijani armed forces had to comply with the Convention and with international humanitarian law. They were thus responsible for minimising possible harm to civilians by preventing them from entering areas of danger. In fact, allowing civilians to enter the village might be regarded as a violation of Azerbaijan ’ s obligation to protect their right to life under Article 2 of the Convention.

Currently, more than a thousand individual applications lodged by persons who were displaced during the conflict are pending before the Court, slightly more than half of them being directed against Armenia and the remainder against Azerbaijan.

Comprehensive solutions to such questions as the return of refugees to their former places of residence, repossession of their property and/or payment of compensation can only be achieved through a peace agreement.

However, the rules are not “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see among many other authorities, Broniowski v.

The Court therefore considers that the situation of which the applicant complains falls to be examined under the first sentence of the first paragraph, as it concerns a restriction of the applicant ’ s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions (see Loizidou (merits), cited above, § 63; Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no. 25781/94, § 187, ECHR 2001 ‑ IV; and Doğan and Others, cited above, § 146).",

However, by virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, each Contracting Party “shall secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”. The discharge of this general duty may entail positive obligations inherent in ensuring the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, those positive obligations may require the State to take the measures necessary to protect the right of property (see Broniowski, cited above, § 143, and Sovtransavto Holding v.

The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. Whether a case is analysed in terms of a positive duty of the State or in terms of interference by a public authority which needs to be justified, the criteria to be applied do not differ in substance. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. It also holds true that the aims mentioned in that provision may be of some relevance in assessing whether a balance between the demands of the public interest involved and the applicant ’ s fundamental right of property has been struck. In both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention ( see Broniowski, cited above, § 144)."

In those cases the interference with the Greek-Cypriot owners ’ property rights was closely linked with the fact of occupation and establishment of the “TRNC” ( see Loizidou (merits), cited above, §§ 52-56 and 63, and Cyprus v.

The only cases which would be comparable to the present case are a number of applications against Cyprus lodged by Turkish Cypriots also raising complaints about the lack of access to their property and homes situated in the areas remaining under the Cypriot Government ’ s control. However, these have not reached the stage of examination of the merits as they were either settled ( see Sofi v.

It is worth noting that, while it did analyse the villagers ’ complaint regarding the refusal of access to their property in the village in terms of interference, the Court eventually left open the questions whether the interference with their right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions was lawful and pursued a legitimate aim, and concentrated its examination on the issue of proportionality (§§ 147 ‑ 49)."

The Court reiterates that the concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measures applied by the State, including measures depriving a person of his or her possessions. In each case involving the alleged violation of that Article, the Court must, therefore, ascertain whether by reason of the State ’ s action or inaction the person concerned had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden ( see Broniowski, cited above, § 150, with further references ).

The Court observes that international humanitarian law contains rules on forced displacement in occupied territory but does not explicitly address the question of displaced persons ’ access to their home or other property. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (see paragraph 95 above) prohibits individual or mass forcible transfers or deportations in or from occupied territory, allowing for the evacuation of a given area only if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so require; in that case, displaced persons have a right to return as soon as hostilities in the area have ceased.

It has not been claimed and there is no indication that this situation has changed in any significant way in the period from the entry into force of the Convention until the present day. In any case, there are no signs that the situation has improved. The evidence before the Court rather points to an increase in military activity and ceasefire violations in the area. The Court accepts that refusing civilians, including the applicant, access to Gulistan is justified by safety considerations, in particular restricting access to a mined area and protecting civilians against the dangers existing in such an area (see, mutatis mutandis, Oruk v.

It would be unrealistic at present to expect the Azerbaijani Government to ensure the applicant access to or repossession of his property in Gulistan irrespective of the fact that it is in a militarily sensitive zone (see, mutatis mutandis, Demopoulos and Others, cited above, § 112 )."

The Court would point out that the obligation to take alternative measures does not depend on whether or not the State can be held responsible for the displacement itself. In Doğan and Others the Court noted that it was unable to determine the exact cause of the displacement of the applicants and therefore had to confine its consideration to the examination of their complaints concerning the denial of access to their possessions ( cited above, § 143 ).

The question therefore arises whether it is sufficient for the Government to participate in these negotiations in order to fulfil their duty to strike a fair balance between the competing public and individual interests.

The gist of his complaint is precisely that he has been unable to return there ever since. In these circumstances his prolonged absence cannot be considered to break the continuous link with his home. Furthermore, the Court finds it established that the applicant had lived in Gulistan for most of his life and must therefore have developed most of his social ties there. Consequently, his inability to return to the village also affects his “private life”. Finally, the Court considers that, in the circumstances of the case, the applicant ’ s cultural and religious attachment to his late relatives ’ graves in Gulistan may also fall within the notion of “private and family life”. In sum, the inability of the applicant to return to his former place of residence affects his rights to his “private and family life” and “home”."

In the subsequent case of Demopoulos and Others (cited above, §§ 104-29 ), the Court examined the effectiveness of remedies which had been amended in the meantime. Having carried out a detailed examination, the Court was satisfied that the proceedings before the Immovable Property Commission provided an effective remedy. It noted in particular that : the Commission, which included two independent international members, had been functioning for four years; the Commission had concluded eighty-five applications and some 300 other claims were pending before it; there was no evidence establishing that the proceedings would take an unreasonable length of time; the Commission had paid out significant sums of money by way of compensation; claims could also be made in respect of non-pecuniary damage, including aspects of any loss of enjoyment of home; exchange of property had been effected in several cases; and there was a right to appeal to a court.

Moreover, the CPA placed the burden of proof of the lawfulness of their income on those whose properties the authorities sought to seize, and did not indicate any reliable methods of calculating income and expenditure over a lengthy period of time : a period marked, in this case, by radical economic transition and galloping inflation. Lastly, the applicants pointed out that the CPA provided for overly “drastic” measures where “unlawful” income was identified, such as the forfeiture of all property acquired with that income."

Their purpose was not the confiscation of proceeds of crime, seeing that in proceedings under Chapter Three the prosecution authorities were not obliged to establish that the properties to be forfeited were linked to any criminal conduct.

It comprises three distinct rules: the first rule, set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property; the second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions; the third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest (see, among others, Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, § 61, Series A no. 52). However, the three rules are not distinct in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1986, § 106, Series A no. 102)."

Still, this provision must be construed in the light of the general principle set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph (see, among many examples, Allan Jacobsson v.

Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 109, ECHR 2000 ‑ I), and that the law must provide a measure of legal protection against arbitrariness (see Zlínsat, spol. s r.o. , cited above, § 98 )."

                "46. In that regard, the Court notes that in the case at hand the CPA provided that the State ’ s claims under its Chapter Three could not lapse through prescription (see paragraph 25 above), which meant that individuals being investigated under it could be required to provide evidence of the income they had received and their expenditure many years earlier and without any reasonable limitation in time. In addition, as apparent from the applicants ’ case, decisions of the prosecution authorities to discontinue proceedings under Chapter Three, after establishing that their continuation was unjustified, had no binding force. In the present case, even though they concluded in 2002 that there was no legal ground for bringing an action for forfeiture against the first applicant and her husband, in 2004 the prosecution authorities opened new proceedings under Chapter Three, concerning the same people and the same period of time (see paragraphs 7 ‑ 11 above). It thus appears that, as pointed out by the applicants (see paragraph 36 above), the prosecution authorities were free to “open, suspend, close and open again proceedings at will at any time”. All this, coupled with the fact that the procedure under Chapter Three of the CPA was very rarely resorted to after 1989 (see paragraph 2 8 above), means that the CPA did not meet the foreseeability requirement set out in the paragraph above, which entails that a person should be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to reasonably foresee the consequences which a given action may cause ( see, mutatis mutandis, Lindon, Otchakovsky -Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 41, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV )."

In the case, this led to the courts reaching conflicting conclusions as to whether the evidence presented to them was relevant and sufficient to prove as “lawful” part of the income claimed by the applicants (see paragraphs 13 and 16 above). Eventually the Court of Appeal found the income at issue unproven and thus “unlawful”, even though it had not been alleged that the first applicant and her husband had breached any legal regulation. To this was added the fact that the burden of proof in proceedings under the CPA was placed on the defendants (see paragraph 25 above); thus, the applicants had to show that the first applicant and Mr Dimitrov had received “lawful” income, without there being any clarity as to what constituted “lawful” within the meaning of the CPA. This clearly placed on the applicants an excessive burden."

It is also noteworthy that that tax legislation was applied to the first applicant and her husband, as the tax authorities initiated probes into their incomes and in two decisions of 23 June and 26 November 2004 established the amount of tax due from them (see paragraph 21 above).

This initiative led to the enacting of Law no. 1341/1983, which was designed to settle as quickly as possible - in the very terms of the Court of Cassation ’ s judgment of 8 January 1988 - the problem created in 1967 (see paragraph 21 above). The Athens second Expropriation Board having recognised them all in 1983 as having title (see paragraphs 18-21 above), the applicants thereafter awaited allocation of the promised land. However, neither the land in Attica nor the land in Pieria was able to be used for the proposed scheme (see paragraph 22 above); in 1992 the applicants attempted to secure part of the\" Semeli estate\" but again without success (see paragraph 27 above)."

But it must be borne in mind that, after that date, the competent authorities took three positive decisions in respect of the applicant company: on 7 January 1983 the County Administrative Board decided in the same proceedings to issue only an admonition against TTA under section 64, having regard to the considerable time which had elapsed - almost three years - since the discrepancies in the book-keeping of AB Citykällaren had occurred and to the fact that in the meantime there had been no further deficiencies (see paragraph 16 above); on 14 January the same Board renewed the applicant company ’ s licence for Le Cardinal, extending the serving hours until 2.00 a.m. (see paragraph 17 above); and on 27 May the District Court of Helsingborg acquitted Mrs Flenman of the offence of hindering control by the fiscal authorities (see paragraph 13 above).",

Indeed, at the beginning of the 1990s the housing situation of Poland was particularly difficult, as was demonstrated, on the one hand, by a shortage of dwellings and, on the other hand, by the high cost of acquiring a flat. The State-controlled rent, which also applied to privately owned buildings, covered just 30% of the actual costs of maintenance of the buildings.",

The shortfall was to be covered by landlords. The scale of the problem was considered to have been very large, since at that time 2,960,000 dwellings (25.5% of the country ’ s entire housing resources) were let under the rent-control scheme. That number comprised some 600,000 flats in buildings owned by private individuals. The total number of flats in Poland was estimated at about 11,600,000.

According to the information received, levels of controlled rent had never reached the statutory 3% of the reconstruction value referred to in section 25(2) but were determined by the municipalities at 1.3% of that figure. As a result, the levels of controlled rent covered merely 60% of the maintenance costs of residential dwellings. The rest had to be covered by landlords from their own resources.

In the judgment, the Constitutional Court attached much importance to the fact that the relevant regulations concerning controlled rent had brought about a situation whereby the expenses incurred by owners of dwellings were much higher than the rent paid by tenants and that the former “had no influence on how the rates of controlled rent were determined”. In its view, that shortfall of the rent actually received had resulted in the progressive reduction of the value of tenement houses and this, with the passage of time, entailed consequences similar to expropriation.",
                "The judgment contains extensive reasoning, the gist of which can be summarised as follows.",
                "“One of the essential elements of the right of property is the possibility of deriving profit from the object of ownership, which is of particular importance in a market economy. The legislature may regulate and limit this right in view of, among other things, the social context of enjoyment of property and duties towards the community that are inherent in ownership. In exceptional cases, ... it is even [acceptable] to exclude temporarily the possibility of ... deriving an income from goods that are the subject of ownership. However, if the limitations on a property right go even further and the legislature places an owner in a situation in which his property necessarily inflicts losses on him, while at the same time imposing on him a duty to maintain the property in a specific condition, it can be said that there is a limitation which impairs the very essence of that right. ...",
                "The Constitutional Court observes that the applicable provisions very seriously limit the possibility for a landlord to use and dispose of his dwellings, as referred to in section 56(1) of the 1994 Act. In particular, under this section all earlier tenancy relationships, in so far as they originated in administrative decisions on the allocation of a dwelling ... were transformed into contractual leases for an indefinite period. ...",
                "The Constitutional Court will not assess the compatibility of those regulations with the Constitution, as this is not the object of its ruling. It merely observes that, against that background, the owner of a building is practically deprived of any influence on the choice of tenants in his building and on whether the lease relationships with those persons should continue. ...",
                "Thus, the possibility [for a landlord] to enjoy and dispose of property is very considerably limited. While it is not totally extinguished, as he may still sell his building (dwelling) or take out a mortgage on it and there are no restrictions on succession rights, the exclusion of the owner ’ s right to dispose of dwellings subject to the provisions of the 1994 Act results in the depreciation of the market value of the building. By the same token, other attributes which have so far not been taken away from the owner, such as the possibility of enjoying and disposing [of his property], are substantially reduced and his property right becomes illusory.",
                "At the same time, the legal provisions impose on the owner of the building a number of onerous duties ... Not only do most of the applicable laws impose specific duties on the owner but they also provide for specific penalties for failure to comply with those duties or to discharge them properly. ...",
                "The Constitutional Court considers that the 1994 Act and, especially, its practical application have not secured a sufficient mechanism for balancing the costs of maintaining a building, its equipment and surroundings and the income from controlled rent. ...",
                "The Constitutional Court considers it necessary to draw attention to two further points which are relevant for the situation of the landlord.",
                "Firstly, the inadequacy of controlled rent vis - à - vis real expenses for maintenance of a building does not allow ... [landlords] to put aside savings for repairs and for keeping the building in a good condition. As a result, the tenement houses are gradually losing value. In terms of property rights, this should be perceived as a process of gradual deprivation of this right, leading, with the passage of time, to results similar to expropriation. Also, it has a general impact on the community because many tenement houses are approaching the time of their ‘ technical death ’ and, in consequence, not only will the owner lose his property but tenants will also lose the possibility of housing, which will hardly be compatible with Article 75 § 1 of the Constitution.",
                "Secondly, the inadequacy of controlled rent vis - à - vis real expenses for maintenance of a building has not been duly recognised by the tax laws ... [Under those laws], landlords are treated in the same way as businessmen or persons letting dwellings for a profit and must bear the financial consequences of all losses caused by the lease of their dwellings. ...",
                "[As regards the principle of proportionality laid down in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution]",
                "... it may be justified to fix rent in such a way that it will not be disproportionate to the financial standing of tenants, so that it will be possible for them to maintain a decent standard of living (or at least a minimum standard) after paying the rent. Thus, it is in conformity with the contemporary perception of a ‘ social State ’ to demand some sacrifice from all members of society for the benefit of those who cannot provide subsistence for themselves and their families. By the nature of things, the extent of that sacrifice depends on the level of income and imposes a heavier burden on those who are better off. By the nature of things, the owners of property may be required to make sacrifices, according to the general principle that ‘ ownership entails obligations ’. However, the distribution of burdens among specific members of society cannot be arbitrary and must maintain rational proportions.",
                "In the circumstances obtaining in Poland, under Article 31 § 3 it may be justified to maintain the provisions limiting landlords ’ property rights and, more particularly, excluding unrestricted freedom in fixing rates of rent and other charges collected from tenants. ... It may still – in any event in the transitional period – be justified to impose wider restrictions on property rights, precluding the freedom to derive profit by fixing levels of rent in such a way as to cover only the costs of maintenance and upkeep of the building.",
                "However, an assessment of the 1994 Act leads to the conclusion that the applicable restrictions do not stop there. The present regulations deliberately set the levels of controlled rents below the costs and expenses actually incurred by owners. That, in itself, would not necessarily have had to be considered unconstitutional had there been any parallel legal mechanism compensating for incurred losses. No such mechanisms have been set up. In consequence, the applicable provisions are based on the premise that property must – until the end of 2004 – entail losses for the owner and that, at the same time, the owner has a duty to incur expenses to maintain his property in a particular condition.",
                "That means that the 1994 Act placed the main burden of the sacrifices that society had to make for tenants, or at least for tenants in a difficult financial position, on the owners of property. Besides, other remedies – such as, for instance, subsidising from public funds the costs of maintaining and repairing buildings referred to in section 56(1), ensuring full recognition in the tax regulations for losses and expenses incurred by landlords and making the level of rent dependent on the tenant ’ s income – have not been employed. Instead, the simplest means (being apparently the cheapest in social terms) have been applied, namely setting a low maximum level of rent and allowing the municipalities to make exceptions to that level. Consequently, it has been assumed that owners will cover the remaining costs of maintaining their property out of their own pockets. No proportionality whatsoever has been maintained in respect of the distribution of burdens (sacrifices) among the owners and the other members of society.",
                "The Constitutional Court would stress once again that in the present context there is a constitutionally acknowledged necessity to protect the rights of tenants ... and this may be reflected in, among other things, provisions fixing a maximum level of rent. However, there is no constitutional necessity to afford them such protection mostly at the expense of private individuals – the owners of dwellings – because the duty to help the underprivileged and [the duties inherent in] social solidarity are incumbent not only upon those persons. It is possible to adopt other legal solutions so as to secure at the same time the necessary protection to tenants and the minimum financial means needed to cover the requisite costs to the landlords. ... It is not for the Constitutional Court to indicate concrete solutions and to determine the ratio of costs to be incurred by tenants, landlords and the community as a whole. However, this Court considers that there are no constitutional considerations which justify imposing the greater part of those costs on the landlords. ...",
                "Consequently, section 56(2) is incompatible with the Constitution. A limitation on the right of property ... which is not ‘ necessary ’ does not satisfy the constitutional requirements of proportionality.",
                "The finding that section 56(2) infringes the principle of proportionality makes it unnecessary for the Constitutional Court to determine whether that provision also infringes the very essence of the right of property since [a further finding to that effect] will not affect the merits of the ruling. It should merely be noted in passing that the question whether the ‘ essence ’ of the right of property has been preserved must also be assessed ... against the background of the combination of existing limitations on this right. ... The manner in which [rent control] has been effected by section 56(2) taken together with other provisions regarding privately owned buildings has [resulted] in the owners being deprived of even the slightest substance of their property rights.",
                "It is the Constitutional Court ’ s opinion that, in consequence, the right to derive profit from property, which is an important element of the right of property, has been destroyed and, at the same time, the second element, the right to dispose of one ’ s property, has been stripped of its substance. In consequence, the right of property has become illusory and unable to fulfil its purpose in the legal order based on the principles listed in Article 20 of the Constitution [principles of social market economy, economic activity, private ownership, solidarity, dialogue and cooperation].",

The Constitutional Court considers that, having regard to the principle of maintaining citizens ’ confidence in the State and the law made by it and the principle of legal certainty, which ensue from the rule of law laid down in Article 2 of the Constitution and are binding on the legislature, renouncing that obligation will be admissible only in the event of exceptional public necessity. At present, there is no such necessity ... It should be noted in passing that setting a time-limit for the operation of the rent-control scheme in buildings owned by natural persons also places an obligation on the legislature – for the benefit of landlords – to repeal the scheme in its present form by the end of 2004. This obligation should also be seen from the perspective of the principle of maintaining citizens ’ confidence in the State.",

                "“During the transition from controlled rent to contractual rent it is necessary to control the increase in rent. ... In most European countries legislative bodies exercise control over rent increases. The introduction of such a mechanism into Polish law seems to be particularly justified and the need for it follows quite evidently from the shortage of flats and the absence of a lease market which would influence rates of rent. This very low supply of flats for rent has caused a situation in which tenants are exposed to undue demands from landlords. Hence there is a need to regulate rent increases.",
                "While recognising this necessity, the Constitutional Court is convinced that the mechanism introduced by the impugned provision is defective and is objectively inappropriate for accomplishing the aims pursued by the legislature. ...",
                "To begin with, the Constitutional Court will examine the impact of the operation of section 9(3) of the 2001 Act on landlords who were subject to controlled rent under the 1994 Act. In this Court ’ s view, the contested provision has not only ‘ frozen ’ the disadvantageous position of landlords subsisting under the 1994 Act, a situation which was already found to have been incompatible with the Constitution, but has also actually aggravated that situation on account of changing economic circumstances. ...",
                "At the time when the present legislation came into force, tenants paid rent determined by the municipalities. [The rent paid], according to the information supplied by the Office for Housing and Town Development, covered merely 60% of the costs of maintenance of residential buildings. The 2001 Act did not increase rent to the level that could have been established according to the principles set out by the Constitutional Court in [the judgment of 12 January 2000]. Nor did the legislature give landlords an opportunity to increase rent to a level ensuring recovery of their expenses. The 2001 Act has frozen rates of rent and fixed them as a reference level for the calculation of future increases. ...",
                "In the Constitutional Court ’ s opinion, in order to arrive at reasonable levels of rent it is necessary to take one of the following two measures: either a one-off increase in deflated rates of controlled rent, accompanied by a restrictive protection of tenants against further increases or, while freezing the applicable rates, permitting considerable increases in relatively rapid succession until an acceptable level has been reached. However, the legislature fixed an unreasonably low basic rent and allowed only strictly regulated increases, correlated with the inflation rate. The legislature did not take into account the fact that the rate of inflation was constantly declining, which means that permissible increases have been insignificant, amounting merely to a few percentage points of the basic rent and giving no opportunity, for purely mathematical reasons, to reach levels that would ensure profitability, or at least recovery of maintenance costs. The decrease in the inflation rate, although a generally positive sign of economic stability, has resulted in the stagnation of rents at low levels.",
                "The deterioration of the situation of landlords receiving controlled rent is also shown by a comparison of rent increases under the 1994 Act with increases permissible under the 2001 Act. As transpires from information supplied by the Office for Housing and Town Development [in respect of the operation of the 1994 Act], at the relevant time, municipalities raised controlled rent annually to a significant extent: in 1996, when the inflation rate was about 20%, by 30% on average, but in 1997, when the inflation rate was 13%, by 31%. The pace of transition to reasonable levels of rent was faster than at present, if only because municipalities, themselves owning residential buildings, had a strong interest in securing genuine increases in rent. Finally, the previous regulations gave landlords the hope of relaxing rent policy. Irrespective of the rates of controlled rent imposed on them by municipalities, they knew that from 2005 they would be able to negotiate rents freely. However, that encouraging prospect was wiped out by section 9(3) of the 2001 Act. Even though the ceiling of 3% will no longer apply after [31 December] 2004, given the provision of section 9(3), this ceiling will not be reached in reality.",
                "In the Constitutional Court ’ s view, the above circumstances give sufficient grounds to find that the situation of landlords who formerly received controlled rent is now unquestionably less favourable than it used to be under the 1994 Act. ... [O]n the contrary, section 9(3) has perpetuated the violation of the right of property. At this point, it is necessary to determine how the landlords ’ situation looks in other respects, apart from the restrictions on rent increases. If, following the ... judgment of 12 January 2000, the legislature had significantly changed any aspect of the legal position of landlords, thereby compensating for losses resulting from reduced rent, the evaluation of levels of rent in the present case would have had to be based on other criteria than those referred to by this Court in 2000.",
                "Since 12 January 2000 there have been no changes to legislation, apart from the enactment of the 2001 Act, which seriously aggravated the situation of landlords. They still bear the burden of obligations imposed by the Construction Act, whose non-fulfilment, as stressed by the Ombudsman, is subject to penalties. There have been no changes to regulations on income tax, at least in respect of deductions from tax (or from taxable income) of amounts spent on the maintenance of buildings in which flats are let to tenants. Nor has the legislature introduced preferential loans for repairs. ... The Constitutional Court also points out that the 2001 Act has not materially improved the situation of landlords in respect of termination of leases. ...",
                "Accordingly, it is fully justified to rely on this Court ’ s findings in respect of section 56(2) of the 1994 Act. Even though the provisions under consideration have changed, and the Court is now considering completely different legal instruments (control of rent increase as opposed to the scheme of rent control under the 1994 Act), the core of the dispute and the issues under consideration remain essentially the same, namely the situation of landlords on whom the legislature has imposed reduced levels of rent. In addition, section 9(3) leads to a difference in the treatment of landlords, depending on whether they are parties to lease relationships formerly governed by the rent- control scheme, or to lease contracts based on freely determined rents. As shown above, in practice the rent increase mechanism adversely affects the first group of landlords and, at the same time, unjustifiably and at the tenant ’ s expense, favours the second group.",
                "In view of the foregoing, the Constitutional Court finds that the [operation of] the contested provision is tantamount to the continued violation of the right of property vested in a specific group of landlords, namely those who entered into a lease relationship by virtue of administrative decisions on the allocation of a dwelling, or on another basis, prior to the introduction of State management of housing matters in a given municipality. Not only did the legislature fail to adjust rates of controlled rent, despite their having been found to be unconstitutional, but in fact, through the introduction of restrictive provisions on rent increases, it practically froze such rents at levels that cannot be regarded as consistent with constitutional guarantees of the right of property. ...",
                "It is worth reiterating, having regard to the [judgment of 12 January 2000], that the restrictions in question are undoubtedly guided by the need to protect public order and the rights of other persons, namely tenants. However, according to the Constitutional Court ’ s case-law, Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution requires restrictions on the rights guaranteed therein to be necessary. In respect of the rent [control scheme], the Constitutional Court qualified as ‘ necessary ’ – at least during the transitional period – the restriction on the right of property ‘ precluding the freedom to derive profit, by fixing levels of rent in such a way as to cover only the costs of maintenance and upkeep of the building ’. A reduction below that minimum was seen by this Court as unconstitutional. Placing the financial burden of subsidising rent on a single social group, namely landlords, was also considered to have been unconstitutional since ‘ the duty to help the underprivileged and [the duties inherent in] social solidarity are incumbent not only upon those persons ’. The Constitutional Court envisaged and still envisages the possibility of applying other legal solutions ... which would result in a more uniform social distribution of the burden linked to the necessity to satisfy housing needs. It is therefore unnecessary to place the entire burden on the single group of landlords. Consequently, the Constitutional Court considers that the restriction resulting from section 9(3) ... does not meet the criteria established by the principle of proportionality and goes beyond the tolerable extent of limitations on the right of property set out in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution.",
                "The Constitutional Court is not competent to fix minimum levels of rent... [However,] from the point of view of the protection of landlords ’ rights, [it] stresses again the crucial importance of the correct determination of the costs of maintenance and upkeep of residential buildings. This constitutes the absolute minimum rate. ...",
                "As regards the implementation of the constitutional rights of tenants, the Constitutional Court stresses that, although in the present judgment section 9(3) of the 2001 Act has been found unconstitutional, the Act still imposes significant restrictions on the freedom to increase rents. The most important of them is definitely section 28(2), which remains in force and which provides that ... up to 31 December 2004 inclusive the annual rent may not exceed 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling.”",

The contested section has set a maximum ceiling on rents with a clear time-frame – up to the end of 2004 – and this also may have an impact on whether a temporary restriction on the right of property may be regarded as not impairing its essence.",

The gist of the Constitutional Court ’ s arguments is summarised in the following paragraphs."
            ],
            [
                "137. The Constitutional Court first analysed the impugned provisions from the point of view of the principle of the rule of law as laid down in Article 2 of the Constitution (see paragraph 107 above):",
                "“ In the opinion of the [ Court], the introduction of the contested legal provisions clearly violated the principle of proper legislation, which necessarily leads it to declare those provisions incompatible with the principle of the rule of law as expressed in Article 2 of the Constitution. The amendments, contrary to the intentions of the legislature itself – as is confirmed by the content of the Sejm ’ s written observations [filed in this case] – eliminated a market mechanism in a situation where the actual purpose of introducing restrictions on rent increases was to be the protection of tenants, that is to say, persons who in a given case do not accept the proposed increase. There is a distinct inconsistency between the provisions of the amendment in the initial bill and the provisions introduced following the parliamentary debate. In consequence, none of the declared aims of the [legislation] has been attained. Rents were not relaxed within rational limits encompassing the requirements of justice and of protection of landlords ’ rights and nor were effective and precisely determined procedures introduced to protect the rights of tenants against abuse of [landlords ’ right to] determine rent freely.",
                "The new version of section 9 (1)(a) has also violated the principle of ... confidence in the State and the law made by it. Thus, as already mentioned, there is no doubt whatsoever that until the adoption of the 17 December 2004 Amendment the legislation of the last decade consistently assured society, and especially persons directly interested in the situation of landlords and tenants, that rents that were controlled and at the same time limited to the level of 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling exclusively in respect of a certain category of premises would apply for the transitional period, that is, up to 31 December 2004. This period ... was [set] to make it possible for the government and the legislature to develop a new, comprehensive and multi-faceted system governing the relations between landlords and tenants, fully taking into consideration the justified interests of the parties and also realistically allowing those same parties to prepare themselves for surviving the most difficult period and to accept fully the new state of affairs, so that mutual relations between the parties to a lease (or an analogous relationship) could be shaped in a rational manner and above all with due consideration for the concrete conditions determining rent. The date of 31 December 2004 as the deadline for the transition period was also confirmed in the 2001 Act, which further strengthened the conviction that after that date the mechanism for determining rent would be compatible with the principle of freedom of contract.",
                "This societal conviction was further supported by the unambiguous case - law of the Constitutional Court, which on many occasions underlined the transitional character of the rent-control scheme. It thus follows that in the years 1994-2004 the unambiguous ‘ rules of the game ’ were established, whose period of validity was clearly indicated by the 1994 Act ( section 56 ( 2) ) and then in some sense confirmed by section 28 (2) of the 2001 Act. ...",
                "In its case-law the Constitutional Court has frequently expressed the opinion that the legislature must not fail to meet deadlines for those ‘ rules of the game ’ that it set itself. This opinion was expressed, inter alia, in ... the reasoning of [its judgment of 12 January 2000]. In its judgment ..., the Constitutional Court expressed the opinion that setting aside the principle of controlled rent for a ten-year transitional period would be acceptable only under exceptional circumstances, for otherwise there would be a violation of the principle of legal certainty expressed in Article 2 of the Constitution.",
                "These considerations lead to the conclusion that the adoption of the contested Act and its publication on 29 December 2004, with its entry into force on 1 January 2005, violated the ‘ rules of the game ’ which were laid down in the previous legislation and which were subject to an unambiguous time -limit[. This happened in a situation where] there were no exceptional circumstances or events that could justify or explain the extension of [those rules] for a longer period.",
                "The breaking of what amounted to a promise laid down in a statute must be regarded as a particular kind of irresponsibility on the part of the public authorities, and hence an exceptionally jarring violation of the principle of confidence in the State and the law made by it, a principle constituting one of the foundations of the rule of law. ”"

                "“ Article 64 § § 1 and 2 of the Constitution guarantees the protection of ownership and other property rights on an equal basis for all. Among these ‘ other property rights ’ are the right to lease residential premises and other rights relating to premises serving to satisfy housing needs. Each of these rights, whether accruing to landlords or to tenants, enjoys constitutional protection, but in different ways. As a rule these rights collide but, as has been pointed out [in one of the Constitutional Court ’ s previous judgments], it would be a simplification to treat this conflict in linear terms, and to presume that providing a certain degree of protection to one of these rights must necessarily result in a weakening of the degree of protection afforded to the other.",
                "Section 9 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and section 9 (1)( a ) ... were based on the unjustified conviction that relations between landlords and tenants always have an antagonistic nature, which inevitably leads to the ‘ zero-sum game ’. In reality, however, this does not have to be the case; on the contrary, properly determined relations between the parties to a lease agreement are of service both to landlords and tenants, provided that neither of the parties abuses its rights, since everyone is obliged to respect the freedoms and rights of others (Article 31 § 2 of the Constitution).",
                "The Constitutional Court is fully aware of how difficult it is to balance the legitimate interests of both landlords and tenants and to create the best possible ways of organising their relations. This is particularly true in the Polish situation, in which the rights of landlords were not respected for a long time and housing matters were subject to State management for entire decades [. This], combined with other systemic and economic factors, resulted in a degradation of housing supply unheard of in the countries of western Europe, and the consequences of which affected and still affect not only landlords but, ultimately, also tenants. Stepping back from this abyss will be difficult and will take many years, and the effective change of the present state of affairs will probably not be possible without committing public funds adapted to concrete situations (see the Constitutional Court judgment [of 12 January 2000]).",
                "It is therefore the legislature ’ s duty to strive to form a harmonious legal situation for landlords and tenants, so that their relations can be seen as desirably complementary rather than characterised by inevitable antagonism. Charges for the use of the premises, including rent, are a special element of those relations. They should ensure that the landlord not only covers the costs of building maintenance and repair, but also obtains a return on invested capital (amortisation) and a decent profit because no legal provisions may extinguish one of the basic components of the right to property, namely the right to derive profit from property ... This was possible, as found by the Constitutional Court [in its earlier judgment], in the transitional period, during which it was considered reasonable to restrict profit [by fixing] such levels of rent as only covered the costs of maintenance and upkeep. Now complete regulations, fully and precisely determining the elements of rent, are required. The 2001 Act specified what are to be regarded as charges that do not depend on the landlord ... but it did not indicate ... the elements of rent as such. As a result, judicial control of reasons for rent increases is to a large extent illusory. ...",
                "At the same time, the Constitutional Court considers it necessary to take into account the legitimate interests of tenants, and to establish effective mechanisms to protect them against abuse of their rights by landlords. It is also necessary to develop a set of instruments that would make it possible to support tenants finding themselves in difficult financial and living circumstances. This must not be done, as has been the case hitherto, mainly at the cost of landlords, but mostly through the deployment of special public resources. Thus, the duties inherent in social solidarity and the duty to help the underprivileged are incumbent on society as a whole. ...",
                "Over the last dozen years or so, attempts have been made in Poland to protect the legal interests of ... tenants through the statutory determination of percentage rent increase indicators, or of rent ceilings, or through the introduction of certain stronger control measures after a certain limit was exceeded, but in fact this has always been done in isolation from the concrete circumstances of given landlords and given tenants. An exception in this respect is the duty to determine officially the so - called ‘ conversion index ’, which of course adjusts the calculation of rent, but only locally, and, furthermore, is highly formalised and mechanical in nature.",
                "The end of the transitional period for controlled rents must mean a real break with the statutory automatism in respect of setting levels of rent, determining the rent ceilings or imposing restrictions on rent increases. One should expect the establishment of a system providing flexible solutions, adapted to the requirements of a modern housing market, which – stressing the parties ’ freedom to determine rent levels – would also ensure effective control in order to prevent arbitrariness and abuse of that freedom.",
                "The contested provisions allow the parties ... a very small margin of freedom, which does not take into consideration concrete circumstances, such as the technical condition of the premises and the building, the personal and financial situation of the tenants or local factors. The legislature believes that the elimination of irregularities in increasing rent, apart from rent being subject to an arithmetical ceiling, will be effected through a special procedure for judicial control laid down in section 8a combined with the mechanism restricting rent increases as laid down in section 9 of the 2001 Act, in particular section 9 (1) and (1)(a).",
                "The legislature, declaring that controlled rents would be abolished in the future, never promised that from 1 January 2005 the levels of rent determined by the parties would not be controlled at all. However, judicial control to this end would be effective if the law clearly determined elements of rent and formulated precise criteria for its evaluation. But this did not happen. The 2001 Act does not indicate at all how rent should be determined ( because rent increases as such are a different matter ), even in such a fragmentary way as section 20 of the 1994 Act did. It thereby deprived a court assessing an increase in rent of the possibility of objective verification, on the basis of concretely enumerated elements of rent and clear criteria for their evaluation, whether or not the increase was justified (section 8a ( 5 ) of the 2001 Act), and hence created a risk of divergence between judicial decisions. It should also be noted that in certain situations the limiting mechanism introduced by section 9 ( 1 ) and ( 1 )(a) either excludes judicial control of rent altogether, or makes it completely illusory ...",
                "In consequence, ... both the contested amendments amounted to a breach of the principle of proportionality expressed in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution, [notably] through defective formulation of the rules determining [rent], which do not give adequate protection either to landlords or to the rights of tenants. ”"

In the circumstances obtaining in Poland, under Article 31 § 3 [ of the Constitution ], it may be justified to maintain the provisions limiting landlords ’ property rights and, more particularly, excluding unrestricted freedom in fixing rates of rent and other charges collected from tenants. ’",
                "The latter remark was particularly significant for the assessment of legislation during the transition period, but it cannot be seen as having fully lost its relevance with the end of that period.",

This is a very difficult task, especially given the absence of well-tried models of proceeding in such cases. The scale of the phenomenon far surpasses the post-war experience of western European States. Changes in this area are being introduced by trial and error; they are slow and not effective enough – as has been pointed out by the Constitutional Court in the judgments cited above.",
                "It is therefore not possible, in respect of the rights of landlords, who were formerly deprived of the possibility of fully enjoying their property, simply to give this possibility back to them in the form of unrestricted market -related rent. Such a measure, in a situation where private houses, previously taken in connection with the so - called ‘ public management of housing matters ’, have depreciated and require very major investments in repairs and high running maintenance costs, would mean imposing on tenants an excessive burden undermining their existence. ...",
                "It must be kept in mind that the fact that landlords ’ rights were infringed over several decades did not result from any acts by tenants, but was first and foremost caused by defective legislation. Removing, after years of neglect, all those harmful consequences may not therefore be done at the expense of tenants, and certainly not at their expense alone, but must above all stimulate the public authorities themselves to take appropriate action. ”"

                "... Under the present legislation, as amended by the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment [of 19 April 2005], landlords may increase rents or other charges for the use of the dwelling not more often than every six months but an increase in rent or other charges, apart from those which do not depend on a landlord, whereby rent would exceed 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling within one year may take place only in justified cases. ... [T]he tenant may challenge the increase by bringing a court action to have the increase declared unjustified, or justified but in a different amount, or may refuse to accept the increase with the effect that the contract is terminated at the end of the term of notice.",
                "However, judicial control of increases in rent and the procedure for such increases do not apply if an increase does not exceed 10% of the current rent or current charges.",
                "2. Lack of statutory criteria for judicial control",
                "[The 2001 Act] does not indicate, and this is its fundamental shortcoming, the criteria on the basis of which the courts are to control increases in rent or other charges for the use of the dwelling. This situation is detrimental to both landlords and tenants. Accordingly, judicial control, lacking statutory criteria, certainly becomes very difficult and unforeseeable, if not illusory. This may lead to quite arbitrary decisions. It is likely that in this legal situation the courts would be forced to create an ad hoc set of criteria for the future assessment [of increases] rather than to review legal grounds for increases. It should be stressed that removing from the judicial control increases in rent and charges that do not exceed 10% will, in many instances, deprive tenants of the necessary protection and will, within several years, lead to rents being hauled up to an objectively unjustified level.",
                "The above considerations lead to the conclusion that the statutory system of fixing the maximum ceiling of rents and other charges and of controlling increases determined algorithmically, which was justified in the transitional period ..., can neither satisfactorily serve the interests of landlords nor protect the justified interests of tenants. It is therefore necessary to regulate in a complex manner those matters, maintaining at the same time flexible solutions. ....",

                "The question of determining rents and charges for the use of the dwelling cannot be seen only from the perspective of the criteria and rules for their increase. First of all, it is necessary to set a statutory starting - point – in other words, elements of rent that would adequately take into account the rights of landlords.",
                "At the same time, not losing sight of the necessarily complementary relationship between a landlord and a tenant, one should have regard to the fact that the essential duty of the tenant is to pay an economically justified level of rent, i.e. not too high but related to the justified economic interest of the landlord.",

Likewise, a decent profit derived from the exercise of the right of property is an indispensable element of the genuine protection of property rights. Without profit, there are no investments or even modernisation works, which are dictated by technological progress and which are also beneficial for the interests of tenants. The future detailed legal solutions should, however, pay due regard to the fact that the aims pursued by the public authorities ( the State Treasury, other State authorities and municipalities) are different from those pursued by private individuals and bodies (such as housing cooperatives) and that the expectations of [those two groups] in respect of a decent rent should be established at different levels. ...",

Such systems are known in some European countries as a ‘ rent mirror ’. ...",

In such precisely determined cases the system of public finances should provide for forms of individual support for landlords obliged to cover the extra costs involved in the maintenance of the buildings. Such support may take various forms, from housing subsidies, through loans on preferential terms for specific investments and, finally, to tax exemptions. ...",

It is against the rules of proper legislation to include the provisions governing the lease of dwellings not in the Civil Code, which contains a full set of regulations on lease relations, but in a law whose object is to protect tenants generally, not to regulate the lease relationship.",

The subsequent laws, as applicable from 10 October 1994 to the present day, had not introduced any restrictions which would reduce the applicant ’ s hitherto practically non-existent rights but, on the contrary, had gradually increased her and other landlords ’ property rights with regard to the lease of their dwellings.",

That Act equated in the eyes of the law the so-called “administrative lease” of the applicant ’ s flats with a lease based on the free will of the parties to an ordinary civil contract (see paragraphs 72-79 above). Subsequent housing laws which were enacted after that date and are still in force maintained that system (see paragraphs 80-145 above ).",

She did not have the possibility to decide who would live in her house and for how long. The lease of the flats had been imposed on her by unlawful administrative decisions but, despite that fact, she could not terminate the lease agreements and regain possession of her house because the statutory conditions attached to the termination of leases, including the duty to provide a tenant with substitute accommodation, made it impossible in practice to do so.",

In that sphere decisions as to whether, and if so when, it may fully be left to the play of free- market forces or whether it should be subject to State control, as well as the choice of measures for securing the housing needs of the community and of the timing for their implementation, necessarily involve consideration of complex social, economic and political issues.",

In cases concerning the operation of wide-ranging housing legislation, that assessment may involve not only the conditions for reducing the rent received by individual landlords and the extent of the State ’ s interference with freedom of contract and contractual relations in the lease market, but also the existence of procedural and other safeguards ensuring that the operation of the system and its impact on a landlord ’ s property rights are neither arbitrary nor unforeseeable. Uncertainty – be it legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities – is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State ’ s conduct.

Since the applicable housing laws did not attach any conditions – such as the level of income, social or family situation and age of a tenant or the size or standard of the flat in question – to the entitlement to a low-rent dwelling, it was thus sufficient for a tenant to have the right to a lease granted pursuant to an administrative decision given under the communist regime in order to profit from the privileged situation under the rent-control scheme.

This situation had required the State to control increases in rent not only in the State sector but also in the private sector.

The provisions of the 2001 Act currently in force stated the contrary: under section 8a of the 2001 Act, any increase whereby rent would exceed the ceiling of 3% was permitted only in justified cases and could be challenged before a court. At the same time, the landlords ’ onerous duties in respect of maintenance of property remained unchanged. As regards the termination of leases, the provisions differed only slightly from those under the previous, defective laws and the relocation of a tenant was still very difficult if not impossible. Those minor changes to the housing legislation could hardly be considered to have abolished the rent-control scheme. Nor did they improve the landlords ’ situation in any meaningful way.",

In that context, the Constitutional Court had reminded the authorities of the urgent need to introduce rules whereby landlords, after decades of subsidising the State ’ s housing policy, might be able to derive a “decent profit” from their property, stressing that the right to derive profit was one of the basic components of the right of property. However, the authorities had not so far taken any steps to implement those recommendations.",

As the Constitutional Court had rightly pointed out in its judgment and recommendations, in the absence of such statutory criteria judicial control of rent increases had become illusory. In that regard, the applicant supplied details of one case lodged with a Polish court involving a dispute over a 13% increase in rent and added that, given the average delay in the Polish civil courts, it might realistically be expected that the final ruling would be delivered within some two years, rent being frozen at the 3% level until the claim had been determined."

The applicant admitted that attention given by the Polish media to her case before the Strasbourg Court had indeed resulted in her two tenants ’ moving out. She had learnt of this fact from a representative of the Polish government in June 2005 – who had nevertheless refused officially to transfer possession of the house to her – and had informed the Court thereof on 22 August 2005. Yet, on the hearing date, the third flat was still being occupied by J.W. She could not simply terminate the lease as, given J.W. ’ s advanced age, the latter belonged to the group of tenants statutorily protected against termination of leases under section 11(12) of the 2001 Act.",

The effects that the impugned legislation had entailed for her would not cease or be erased by the return of what was left of her property. When the State had taken the house under its management, it had been in good condition.

In that connection, they advanced the argument that, given that management of housing matters introduced under the communist regime had deprived owners of even theoretical property rights, on 10 October 1994 the applicant had had no rights in respect of the termination of the leases on her flats or the determination of the level of rent (see paragraphs 151 and 153 above). Seen from this perspective, the impugned housing laws, as applicable from that date to the present time, had not reduced the applicant ’ s property rights but, on the contrary, had gradually increased the scope of her and other landlords ’ rights in respect of the lease of their dwellings. Thus, in their view, the introduction of the rent-control scheme had in fact commenced the complicated process of restoring landlords ’ rights, a process which, given the state of housing supply inherited from the communist regime and the need to balance the rights of all members of society, involved extremely difficult decisions on the part of the authorities."

In the proceedings before the Grand Chamber they also put forward another new argument, namely that the rent-control scheme had been based on a specific social agreement between landlords, tenants and the State. By virtue of that agreement, the tenants had been guaranteed that their situation during the ten- year period following the entry into force of the 1994 Act would not change, and the landlords – who had waived their claims for compensation – had been promised that after that period all restrictions on rent would cease to exist. The Government, for their part, had given an undertaking that by 31 December 20 04 any restrictions resulting from that agreement would no longer apply. Thus, this situation could be described as “legal peace” as it had reflected the compromise reached by various social groups. This was confirmed by the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 19 April 2005, which had declared that it had been necessary to introduce the rent-control scheme during the transformation period. Moreover, in all its earlier judgments on that matter, the Constitutional Court had consistently recognised the need for the continued protection of tenants who had entered into lease agreements pursuant to administrative decisions and to whom the 1994 Act guaranteed a specific, maximum level of rent for a fixed time. It had explicitly acknowledged that the need to protect tenants against unduly high levels of rent had been fully justified by the housing situation in Poland.",

The Government further stressed that the means for controlling rent under both the 1994 Act and the 2001 Act had only been of a temporary nature and they had no longer been maintained after the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 19 April 2005, which had in fact marked the end of the rent-control scheme in Poland. Thus, by virtue of that judgment all the previous restrictions had been abolished. Since then, rents in Poland had been regulated by free - market forces and at present there were no limitations imposed on them by the authorities. The parties to lease contracts could freely determine the level of rent and the rights of landlords were no longer limited in any way. By the same token, the Government had fulfilled the obligations they had taken upon themselves under the above ‑ mentioned social agreement and the “rules of the game” referred to by the Constitutional Court had finally been complied with."

Thus, the court had referred to the general situation in Poland, which had not necessarily applied to each landlord. They saw no reason why it should apply to the applicant ’ s case. In that context, they also referred to the fact that two flats in her house had been vacated in June 2003 and September 2004 respectively. The third flat was to be vacated by a certain J.W. within several weeks following the oral hearing, as she had been allocated a flat owned by Gdynia City Council. She had actually moved out in February 2006 (see paragraph 66 above ). The applicant had never given J.W. notice to quit. Nor had she increased her rent, even though J.W. had paid the amount corresponding to 1.5% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling.

It also agrees that, in comparison to the previous “special lease scheme”, which had imposed full State control over the lease market, the 1994 Act was in general a step forward. In particular, it limited State control over leases to dwellings which, regardless of whether they were owned by a municipality or a private individual, had hitherto been subject to the “special lease scheme”, while allowing rents for commercial premises to be market-related (see paragraphs 171 and 172 of the Chamber judgment and paragraph 188 above).",

To begin with, under sections 55 and 56 of the 1994 Act any lease that had originated in past administrative decisions allocating a flat was to be treated as a contractual lease signed for an indeterminate time. While that provision in effect created a quasi - lease agreement between a landlord and a tenant – which, again, was a step forward in terms of re-establishing the rudiments of contractual relationships on the lease market – landlords had no influence on the choice of tenant or the essential elements of such an agreement. This applied not only to the duration of the agreement but also to the conditions for its termination, which considerably restricted the landlords ’ right to terminate the lease even in respect of tenants who persistently failed to comply with its statutory terms. In addition, even if landlords terminated the lease, they could not have the dwelling vacated and possibly rented out on the free market unless they provided the tenant with “alternative accommodation” at their own expense. Such a cluster of legal rules, combined with the permanent shortage of dwellings in Poland, and the statutory succession right of the tenant ’ s relatives to a lease agreement made it very difficult for the landlord to regain possession of the flat (see paragraphs 16, 18, 73 and 79 above)."

Pursuant to section 25 of the 1994 Act the landlords had no power to fix the rent, as rents could not exceed a ceiling determined by law at the level of 3% of the “ reconstruction value ” of the dwelling (see paragraphs 76-83 above).",

It is true that the Constitutional Court found that the introduction of the rent-control scheme was not per se incompatible with the Constitution or even Poland ’ s international obligations since at the material time there was a “constitutionally acknowledged necessity to protect the rights of tenants” and, in view of the difficult housing situation, it was necessary to restrict or even exclude freedom in fixing rates of rent. However, it held that the manner in which rent control was effected by section 56(2) taken together with other provisions of the 1994 Act resulted in “ owners being deprived even of the slightest substance of their property rights”. It further stressed that there was no constitutional justification for affording the necessary protection to tenants mostly at the expense of private individuals – the owners of rented flats. In that regard, it observed that the 1994 Act had “deliberately set the levels of controlled rent below the costs and expenses actually incurred by owners” and that, given their duty to disburse sums to maintain their property in a particular condition, it had been based “on the premise that property must – until the end of 2004 – entail losses for the owner”. In its view, the 1994 Act had placed the main burden of the necessary sacrifices that society should make for poor tenants on the landlords. In that context, the Constitutional Court attached considerable importance to the fact that Polish legislation lacked any parallel solutions enabling landlords to offset losses and expenses incurred in maintaining property, and pointed out that the situation could, and should, be remedied by “subsidising from public funds the costs of maintaining and repairing buildings ..., ensuring full recognition in the tax regulations for losses and expenses incurred by landlords and making the level of rent dependent on the tenant ’ s income” (see paragraph 82 above)."

However, as the applicant rightly pointed out ..., although the relevant Austrian legislation provided for many restrictions on, or the possibility of reductions in, the amount of rent chargeable, it also provided for procedures enabling landlords to recover maintenance costs (see also Mellacher and Others, cited above, §§ 31-32 and 55-56).

However, having regard to the relevant indicators as supplied by the parties, the Court considers that it did not result in the applicant ’ s situation being materially improved. According to the Government, in the period immediately preceding the repeal of section 9(3), i.e. October 2002, the maximum rent for similar flats in her town was PLN 4.61 per square metre, whereas the amount actually available to the applicant throughout and at the end of 2004 reached PLN 5.15 ... That amount (approximately 1.27 euros), which was within the applicable rent rates (PLN 5.00-PLN 6.00) in most other towns in the country, represented a mere 10% increase in the previous indicative rent, which, as clearly established above, was totally insufficient to cover basic maintenance costs ... Consequently, the Court does not see how the possibility of increasing the rent up to the – apparently low and inadequate – statutory ceiling could ameliorate the situation found to have amounted to a continuing violation of the property rights of the applicant and of other landlords. Nor does it consider that it provided her and the whole class of affected persons with any relief for the past state of affairs. ”"

On this basis, they argued that the applicant could not effectively claim that her rights had been infringed by the operation of the rent - control scheme at the relevant time (see paragraphs 66 and 192 above).",

It suffices for it, as it sufficed for the Chamber, to assume that at the material time nothing prevented the applicant from so doing. The core issue before it does not consist in making detailed calculations and speculating as to how much or how little the applicant or other landlords would gain from increasing rent to 3% of the reconstruction value. Rather, the issue is whether this improvement, effected after many years of forcing landlords to accept a level of rent which bore no relation whatsoever to the costs of maintenance of property – not to mention making it impossible for them to derive some profit from rent – put an end to the continued violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 caused by the combined effect of the restrictions referred to above or, alternatively, provided the applicant with appropriate relief in terms of restoring her Convention rights."

What was more, notwithstanding that in January 2000 the Constitutional Court had already held that the State had “placed the main burden of the sacrifices that society had to make for tenants ... on the owners of property” and that that situation was exacerbated by the fact that there had been no legal ways and means in Poland enabling landlords to offset expenses or mitigate losses incurred in connection with the maintenance of property or to obtain funds for the necessary repairs, no such mitigating mechanism had been set up (see paragraphs 82 and 104 above).",

The constitutionality of those provisions was contested by landlords before the Constitutional Court after being in operation for merely three days.

Firstly, all levels of rent may, on condition that the increase is effected with the appropriate notice and not more often than every six months, reach 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling. Secondly, levels of rent exceeding 3% of that value may not be increased by more than 10% annually ...",

Yet it cannot but note that, given the recent amounts shown as the reconstruction value of the dwelling, the 10% increase in rent does not, for all practical purposes, entail any significant increase in rent. It can therefore hardly be seen as improving the applicant ’ s situation in respect of covering the cost of maintenance works, which she is still obliged to carry out under section 6(a) of the 2001 Act.",

As the Court has already stated on many occasions, in spheres such as housing, States necessarily enjoy a wide margin of appreciation not only in regard to the existence of a problem of general concern warranting measures of control of individual property but also to the choice of the measures and their implementation. The State control over levels of rent is one such measure and its application may often cause significant reductions in the amount of rent chargeable (see, in particular, Mellacher and Others, cited above, § 45).",
                "Also, in situations where, as in the present case, the operation of the rent-control legislation involves wide-reaching consequences for numerous individuals and has significant economic and social consequences for the country as a whole, the authorities must have considerable discretion not only in choosing the form and deciding on the extent of control over the use of property but also in deciding on the appropriate timing for the enforcement of the relevant laws. Nevertheless, that discretion, however considerable, is not unlimited and its exercise, even in the context of the most complex reform of the State, cannot entail consequences at variance with the Convention standards (see Broniowski, cited above, § 182).",

The Court once again acknowledges that the difficult housing situation in Poland, in particular an acute shortage of dwellings and the high cost of acquiring flats on the market, and the need to transform the extremely rigid system of distribution of dwellings inherited from the communist regime, justified not only the introduction of remedial legislation protecting tenants during the period of the fundamental reform of the country ’ s political, economic and legal system but also the setting of a low rent, at a level beneath the market value ... Yet it finds no justification for the State ’ s continued failure to secure to the applicant and other landlords throughout the entire period under consideration the sums necessary to cover maintenance costs, not to mention even a minimum profit from the lease of flats.",

Some five years ago the Polish Constitutional Court found that the operation of the rent-control scheme based on the provisions necessarily and unavoidably entailing losses for landlords had resulted in a disproportionate, unjustified and arbitrary distribution of the social burden involved in the housing reform and that the reform had been effected mainly at the expense of landlords. It reiterated that statement in its subsequent judgments, clearly indicating that the failure to abolish the rent-control system by 31 December 2004 might result in a breach of the constitutional principle of the rule of law and undermine citizens ’ confidence in the State. It repeatedly held that the adopted measures amounted to a continuing violation of the property rights of landlords.

However, in none of those cases had the authorities restricted the applicants ’ rights to such a considerable extent as in the present case.",

In the latter case, although the State had temporarily suspended evictions from privately owned flats, landlords retained their right to terminate leases by means of a simple notice to quit, without any further restrictions. In contrast, in the instant case Polish legislation attached a number of conditions to the termination of leases, thus seriously limiting the landlords ’ rights in that respect. Finally, in the case of Mellacher and Others, while the domestic legislation restricted the rent chargeable, the levels of rent were never set, as in the present case, below the costs of maintenance of the property and landlords were able to increase the rent in order to cover the necessary maintenance expenses. That provision had at least made it possible for Austrian landlords to keep their property in a proper condition, whereas the Polish scheme did not, and does not, provide for any procedure for maintenance contributions or State subsidies, thereby causing the inevitable deterioration of the property for lack of adequate investment and modernisation (see paragraphs 82, 104 and 138 above )."

In Broniowski (cited above), concerning the issue of the compatibility with the Convention of a legislative scheme that affected a large number of persons (some 80,000), the Court found for the first time the existence of a systemic violation, which it defined as a situation where “the facts of the case disclose ... within the [domestic] legal order ... a shortcoming as a consequence of which a whole class of individuals have been or are still denied [their Convention right or freedom] ” and where “the deficiencies in national law and practice identified in the applicant ’ s individual case may give rise to numerous subsequent well-founded applications” (§ 189).",
                "The Court further found that the violation in that case had “originated in a widespread problem which resulted from a malfunctioning of Polish legislation and administrative practice and which ha[d] affected and remain[ed] capable of affecting a large number of persons ” ( ibid. )."

It also observed that they should include a scheme offering to those affected redress for the Convention violation. It stressed that once such a defect had been identified, it fell to the national authorities, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, to take, retroactively if appropriate, the necessary remedial measures in accordance with the subsidiary character of the Convention (ibid., § 193, and Broniowski v.

The object in the Court ’ s designating a case for a pilot - judgment procedure is to facilitate the most speedy and effective resolution of a dysfunction affecting the protection of the Convention right in question in the national legal order. One of the relevant factors considered by the Court in devising and applying that procedure has been the growing threat to the Convention system resulting from large numbers of repetitive cases that derive from, among other things, the same structural or systemic problem (ibid.).",
                "Indeed, the pilot-judgment procedure is primarily designed to assist the Contracting States in fulfilling their role in the Convention system by resolving such problems at national level, thereby securing to the persons concerned their Convention rights and freedoms as required by Article 1 of the Convention, offering to them more rapid redress.",

                "235. The Chamber considered that the principles established in Broniowski applied equally to the present case, especially as the operation of the rent-control scheme might potentially affect an even larger number of individuals – some 100,000 landlords and from 600,000 to 900,000 tenants (see paragraph 191 of the Chamber judgment). It also held that, as in Broniowski, the facts of the instant case revealed the existence of an underlying systemic problem connected with a serious shortcoming in the domestic legal order. The Chamber identified that shortcoming as “ the malfunctioning of Polish housing legislation in that it imposed, and continue [d] to impose, on individual landlords, restrictions on increases in rent for their dwellings, making it impossible for them to receive rent reasonably commensurate with the general costs of property maintenance ”."
            ],

                "It is common ground that the operation of the impugned housing legislation – which, regardless of the Government ’ s reservations as to the applicant ’ s allegedly atypical situation (see paragraph 228 above), applied to her in the same way as to the other landlords – potentially entailed consequences for the property rights of a large number of persons whose flats (some 600,000, or 5.2% of the entire housing resources of the country) were let under the rent-control scheme (see paragraphs 15 and 19 above). While the number of similar applications pending before the Court currently stands at eighteen – a figure which, in comparison with the Broniowski case, may seem insignificant – one of those cases has been lodged by an association of some 200 landlords asserting a breach of their individual rights. At any rate, the identification of a “systemic situation” justifying the application of the pilot-judgment procedure does not necessarily have to be linked to, or based on, a given number of similar applications already pending. In the context of systemic or structural violations the potential inflow of future cases is also an important consideration in terms of preventing the accumulation of repetitive cases on the Court ’ s docket, which hinders the effective processing of other cases giving rise to violations, sometimes serious, of the rights it is responsible for safeguarding."

Although the Government maintained that the rent-control scheme no longer existed in Poland following the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 19 April 2005 (see paragraph 228 above), the Court can only refer to its earlier conclusion that, notwithstanding that ruling, the general situation has not yet been brought into line with the Convention standards (see paragraphs 221-22 above).",
                "The Grand Chamber shares the Chamber ’ s general view that the problem underlying the violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the present case consists in “the malfunctioning of Polish housing legislation”. Indeed, this assessment is still accurate, in particular in the light of the Constitutional Court ’ s finding that the breach of the applicant ’ s and other landlords ’ property rights originated in “defective legislation” that has continually been applied to them since the entry into force of the 1994 Act (see paragraph 140 above).",
                "However, the Grand Chamber sees the underlying systemic problem as a combination of restrictions on landlords ’ rights, including defective provisions on the determination of rent, which was and still is exacerbated by the lack of any legal ways and means enabling them at least to recover losses incurred in connection with property maintenance, rather than as an issue solely related to the State ’ s failure to secure to landlords a level of rent reasonably commensurate with the costs of property maintenance."

One of the implications of the pilot - judgment procedure is that the Court ’ s assessment of the situation complained of in a “pilot” case necessarily extends beyond the sole interests of the individual applicant and requires it to examine that case also from the perspective of the general measures that need to be taken in the interest of other potentially affected persons (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski (friendly settlement), cited above, § 36). For that reason, the individual solutions adopted in the applicant ’ s case and relied on by the Government in their arguments as to the application of the pilot - judgment procedure (see paragraph 228 above) cannot be regarded as decisive in this context."

In deciding to make an award in respect of non- pecuniary damage at the current stage of the proceedings, the Court also considers it important that the applicant has not only asserted her own rights before it but has also taken upon herself the trouble and burden of acting – at least to some extent – on behalf of landlords in a similar situation."

It was situated on Tallerova St. in Bratislava – in the Staré Mesto district – and several applicants are co ‑ owners of the flats concerned (see also Appendix 4 ). The opinion indicated that the relevant legislation allowed for regulated rent which corresponded, on average, to 0.69% of the acquisition value of a flat in 1994.

The calculation is based on (i) the technical value of the flats in 2012, (ii) their rental value (both on the free market and under the rent - control scheme) in 2012; (iii) duration of application of the rent - control scheme; (iv) the ownership share of individual applicants; and (v) the marginal interest rate of the European Central Bank.",

They fell to be examined under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Such interference must be compatible with the principles of (i) lawfulness, (ii) legitimate aim in the general interest, and (iii) “fair balance” (along with cases cited in the preceding paragraph see, for example, Nobel and Others v. the Netherlands, (dec.), no. 27126/11, § 31, 2 July 2013)."

Decisions as to whether, and if so when, it may fully be left to the play of free-market forces or whether it should be subject to State control, as well as the choice of measures for securing the housing needs of the community and of the timing for their implementation, necessarily involve consideration of complex social, economic and political issues. Acknowledging that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, the Court has declared that it will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is in the “public” or “general” interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation. Those principles apply equally, if not a fortiori, to measures adopted in the course of the fundamental reform of a country ’ s political, legal and economic system in the transition from a totalitarian regime to a democratic State."

Uncertainty – be it legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities – is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State ’ s conduct.

In this regard, it should be pointed out that when speaking of “law”, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term (see, for example, Vistiņš and Perepjolkins v. Latvia [GC], no. 71243/01, § 96, 25 October 2012). It follows that the legal norms upon which the interference is based should be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application (see, among many other authorities, Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, §§ 109-10, ECHR 2000-I). In particular, a norm is “foreseeable” when it affords a measure of protection against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities (see Centro Europa 7 S.r.1. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 143, 7 June 2012). Any interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must, therefore, be accompanied by procedural guarantees affording to the individual or entity concerned a reasonable opportunity of presenting their case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by that provision. In ascertaining whether that condition has been satisfied, a comprehensive view must be taken of the applicable judicial and administrative procedures (see Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, § 45, ECHR 2002-IV; Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, § 134, ECHR 2005-XII; and Stolyarova v. Russia, no. 15711/13, § 43, 29 January 2015).",

The Court has held that a law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. This is particularly true with regard to persons carrying on a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation. They can on this account be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails (see, among other authorities, Karácsony and Others v. Hungary [GC], nos. 42461/13 and 44357/13, § 125, 17 May 2016, and Cantoni v. France, 15 November 1996, § 35, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V). The same may be said to apply to persons engaging in commercial activities (see, by analogy, Špaček, s.r.o., v. the Czech Republic, no. 26449/95, § 59, 9 November 1999, and Forminster Enterprises Limited, cited above, § 65). As a minority member of L.E. and its former managing director, the applicant must have been well aware not only of the state of the company, but also of the civil proceedings brought against it by its creditor (see paragraph 11 above). As a result, the Court is of the view that the applicant could have been expected to devote his attention in no small measure to the outstanding issues facing the company. It considers that the applicant must have been acquainted with the domestic law applicable to companies, and in particular to insolvent companies, and that no specific warning as to the impact of the FOCA had to be provided to him."

In his capacity as acting director and later managing director, he had been authorised to act on behalf of the company. Moreover, even after he had resigned as managing director, he had still been active in the running of the company and had also signed the winding-up petition.

It observed, inter alia, that the Constitutional Court had found the measure of lifting the corporate veil under the FOCA to be in line with the principle of the separation of a company’s assets from those of its members and thus consistent with the Constitution. The court considered it irrelevant whether the applicant had become a member of L.E. before or after the creditor’s claim had arisen. Having joined the company, he had assumed its assets as well as its liabilities. It further held that it was not decisive that the applicant had not remained a director of L.E. until the dissolution of that company. What was crucial was that the applicant had been actively involved in its management and that he had had the rights of a minority member pursuant to section 445 of the Companies Act 1993 (see paragraph 37 below). The court noted that, in contrast to section 6 of the Companies Act 1993 which required the creditors of a company to prove that a member of the company had abused the corporate form (see paragraph 34 below), the FOCA had introduced a “non-rebuttable” presumption that the members of a struck-off company were deemed to have undertaken joint and several liability for any outstanding debts of the company. In accordance with the Constitutional Court’s ruling, they could be exonerated from their personal liability only if they demonstrated that they were “passive members” of the company (see paragraphs 46 and 51 below). Lastly, the court took note of the fact that the applicant had indeed made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E., but it considered this irrelevant because L.E. had at the time failed to make the required advance payment and the petition had therefore been rejected (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above)."

Therefore, the Act required companies to conduct their business in such a manner that they were able at all times to fulfil their obligations in due time (section 5). Moreover, they were required to maintain adequate capital in proportion to the volume and type of operations and activities they carried out and to the risks to which they were exposed (section 6).

Since the legislative solutions provided for in the Act were similar to those in the amendment to the FOCA (see paragraph 52 above), the Constitutional Court was once again called upon to decide if the Act struck a fair balance between the interests of former members of struck-off companies and the companies’ creditors. The Constitutional Court held that in cases where a creditor’s claims had been recognised by a judicial decision or where the judicial proceedings were pending, as well as in cases where a creditor had not yet lodged a claim against former members of a struck-off company but had a legitimate expectation to be able to do so, there were no constitutionally admissible reasons for interfering with his or her acquired rights.

In most of them (including all former republics of the SFRY), domestic law (statutory or case-law) provides for the lifting of the corporate veil in case of abuse of the corporate form. The grounds for the lifting of the corporate veil are along the lines of those listed in section 6 of the Slovenian Companies Act 1993 (see paragraph 34 above): members have abused the corporate form in order to attain an objective that was forbidden to them as individuals; members have abused the corporate form such as to cause damage to creditors; members have used the assets of a company, in breach of the law, as their own personal assets; or members have reduced a company’s assets, for their own benefit or for the benefit of another person, where they knew or should have known that the company would not be capable of meeting its liabilities to third persons.",

The latter proceedings, unlike the former, had not been initiated of the court’s own motion, but at the request of a creditor of L.E.

Thus, as a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Article 35 § 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to inform the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level, otherwise the principle of subsidiarity would be breached. However, this provision allows only remedies which are normal and effective to be taken into account, as an applicant cannot extend the strict time-limit imposed under the Convention by seeking to make inappropriate or misconceived applications to bodies or institutions which have no power or competence to offer effective redress for the complaint in issue under the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Lopes de Sousa Fernandes v. Portugal [GC], no. 56080/13, §§ 130-32, 19 December 2017).

In that regard, it referred, inter alia, to inadequate capitalisation, a prolonged state of insolvency and inactivity on the part of the company’s management (see, in particular, paragraphs 122-28 of the Chamber judgment). The Chamber further noted that the effect of reducing the capital below the statutory threshold and ultimately exhausting it completely, coupled with prolonged failure to institute winding-up proceedings, had had considerable adverse effects on the position of the company’s creditor. It concluded that, “given the wide margin of appreciation which the Contracting States enjoy in matters of economic policy systems, ... the measure complained of did not represent an excessive individual burden for the applicant in the particular circumstances of the present case.” Accordingly, there had been no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Ypourgos Typou kai Meson Mazikis Enimerosis (C ‑ 81/09, EU:C:2010:622), he argued that the impugned measure was likewise contrary to the fundamental principles of company law in the European Union.

Slovenia, no. 31371/12, 25 April 2017) and find a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, despite the fact that he had been relatively passive with regard to the destiny of L.E. and its outstanding debt. In the applicant’s view, what was crucial was that he had not acted in bad faith. In this connection, he pointed out that he had attempted to have L.E. dissolved by instituting winding-up proceedings, but his attempt had failed because L.E. was not able to cover the related costs. The applicant further maintained that a fair balance between the general interest and his property rights was upset by imposing on him the onus of demonstrating his “passive” status. In any event, he emphasised that he had held a managerial position in company L.E. for only a couple of years. This was not sufficient, in his opinion, to hold him liable for debts of the company. The applicant concluded that the impugned measure was profoundly unfair because the Slovenian Railways had fully realised its claim, whereas he had been left with nothing.

The Constitutional Court of Slovenia had likewise held that the personal service of decisions rendered in strike-off proceedings against dormant companies on all members of the companies would be very time-consuming, and in certain cases impossible, given the numbers involved and the fact that companies did not always notify the register of all relevant changes (see paragraph 49 above). Mr J. Za., Mr M. K. and Mr J.

One of the key principles of company law was that members of companies were not personally liable for the debts of the companies, unless there was proof that they had acted in abuse of the corporate form (the so-called lifting or piercing of the corporate veil). The FOCA disregarded that principle. Pursuant to section 37(3) of that Act, the FOCA started to apply only three months after its introduction [17]. The companies therefore had no time to act in order to escape its application. According to the association, since the court register was not up to date (the companies did not always notify the court register of all relevant changes), even those who were no longer members when a company was struck off were held liable for debts of the company; moreover, they were unable to put forward any arguments to the contrary in judicial proceedings pursued against them by the creditors. The association acknowledged that the Constitutional Court in the 2002 decision had limited the liability for debts of struck-off companies to active members only (that is, those who were able to influence the operation of the company), but argued that this had created confusion in the Slovenian legal system. Further confusion had purportedly been created by attempts to abolish the impugned regime of personal liability introduced by the FOCA. The third-party association further submitted that whereas the members of struck-off companies were held liable for the companies’ debts, they were not able to realise the companies’ claims. It acknowledged that the Association of Judges, the Judicial Council, the Institute for Comparative Law of the Faculty of Law of the University of Ljubljana and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry [18], among others, had expressed support for the FOCA, but claimed that all of them were acting in collusion with leftist political structures. The association, lastly, provided the following figures: almost 25,000 companies were struck off; assuming that each of them had at least two responsible members, about 50,000 people were affected (2.5% of the Slovenian population).",

Croatia [GC], no. 37685/10, § 124, 20 March 2018) and bearing in mind the procedural requirements inherent in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraph 95 below), the Court finds it appropriate to examine that complaint together with the applicant’s liability complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Forminster Enterprises Limited v. the Czech Republic, no. 38238/04, § 59, 9 October 2008)."

The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, must be read in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among other authorities, Ališić and Others v.

The parties also agreed that the measure in issue, taken in isolation, should be considered as a measure of control over the use of property.

                "94. The Court reiterates that the first and most important requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful: the second sentence of the first paragraph authorises a deprivation of possessions only “subject to the conditions provided for by law” and the second paragraph recognises that States have the right to control the use of property by enforcing “laws”. Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see, for instance, Former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC] (merits), no. 25701/94, § 79, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 147, ECHR 2004 ‑ V)."

            [
                "95. The principle of lawfulness also presupposes a certain quality of the applicable provisions of domestic law. In this regard, it should be pointed out that when speaking of “law”, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term (see, for example, Vistiņš and Perepjolkins v. Latvia [GC], no. 71243/01, § 96, 25 October 2012). It follows that the legal norms upon which the interference is based should be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application (see, among many other authorities, Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, §§ 109-10, ECHR 2000-I). In particular, a norm is “foreseeable” when it affords a measure of protection against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities (see Centro Europa 7 S.r.1. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 143, 7 June 2012). Any interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must, therefore, be accompanied by procedural guarantees affording to the individual or entity concerned a reasonable opportunity of presenting their case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by that provision. In ascertaining whether that condition has been satisfied, a comprehensive view must be taken of the applicable judicial and administrative procedures (see Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, § 45, ECHR 2002-IV; Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, § 134, ECHR 2005-XII; and Stolyarova v. Russia, no. 15711/13, § 43, 29 January 2015).",

                "96. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes, at the outset, that the applicant’s personal liability for a debt of company L.E. was based on section 27(4) of the FOCA, which provided that the members of a company which had been struck off from the court register because of a failure to perform payments through its accounts for twelve consecutive months would be deemed to have made the statement envisaged in section 394(1) of the Companies Act 1993 (namely, that they assumed joint and several liability for any and all unsettled debts of the company). The FOCA was published in the Official Gazette on 8 July 1999 and entered into force on 23 July 1999. The Court considers that the regulation introduced by the FOCA was accessible to the applicant and that the content of the Act was sufficiently clear to enable him to foresee that his company ran the risk of being struck off from the court register and that he ran the risk of being held personally liable for its debts."

The Court has held that a law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. This is particularly true with regard to persons carrying on a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation. They can on this account be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails (see, among other authorities, Karácsony and Others v. Hungary [GC], nos. 42461/13 and 44357/13, § 125, 17 May 2016, and Cantoni v. France, 15 November 1996, § 35, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V). The same may be said to apply to persons engaging in commercial activities (see, by analogy, Špaček, s.r.o., v. the Czech Republic, no. 26449/95, § 59, 9 November 1999, and Forminster Enterprises Limited, cited above, § 65). As a minority member of L.E. and its former managing director, the applicant must have been well aware not only of the state of the company, but also of the civil proceedings brought against it by its creditor (see paragraph 11 above). As a result, the Court is of the view that the applicant could have been expected to devote his attention in no small measure to the outstanding issues facing the company. It considers that the applicant must have been acquainted with the domestic law applicable to companies, and in particular to insolvent companies, and that no specific warning as to the impact of the FOCA had to be provided to him."

Greece (no. 2) (no. 66610/09, ECHR 2013), which concerned a piece of legislation introduced in 1942 (during the occupation of Greece by the Axis Powers) and ratified in 1946, under which all bank deposits which had not been claimed by the account holder or had not been the subject of any transactions for a period of twenty years were transferred permanently to the State. The Court held in that case, inter alia, that the fact that the applicant had not been informed when the limitation period was due to expire, or therefore afforded the possibility of stopping the limitation period running, had upset the fair balance required by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It is significant that, unlike the present applicant, the applicant in that case was an ordinary citizen unversed in civil or banking law. The present case has more in common with J.A. Pye (Oxford) Ltd and J.A. Pye (Oxford) Land Ltd v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 44302/02, ECHR 2007-III). In that case, the Court examined the proportionality of the taking-away of land belonging to the applicant companies on account of twelve years’ adverse possession. It held, inter alia, that the lack of notice to a paper owner before the expiry of the limitation period at the relevant time had not upset the fair balance required by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

It is true that, as argued by the applicant, the legislative conception of personal liability for the debts of struck-off companies introduced by the FOCA, pursuant to which all members were liable irrespective of their roles in the companies, was mitigated by the 2002 decision of the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 48-51 above). However, the fact that the said decision was given more than two years after the relevant provisions of the FOCA had become applicable did not affect the applicant in any way, as the issue of his own personal liability for the debts of company L.E. was established in the enforcement proceedings which began in April 2002 (see paragraph 24 above) and ended in July 2007 (see paragraph 30 above). Throughout those proceedings, of which he only became aware in December 2004 (see paragraph 24 above), the applicant argued that he had not been an active member of company L.E., relying on the very decision of the Constitutional Court to support his main argument against the enforcement. Therefore, the Court cannot discern that the applicant was in any way adversely affected in the exercise of his rights by the fact that the distinction between active and passive members was not introduced until October 2002."

                "100. Furthermore, the test developed by the Constitutional Court in this regard, establishing a distinction between “active members”, who were in a position to influence the operation of a company, and “passive members”, who exerted no such influence, was clear (see paragraph 51 above). Indeed, it led to the development of consistent domestic jurisprudence according to which the members of struck-off companies holding at least a 10% share were personally liable for the debts of the companies and those holding less than a 10% share were, as a rule, not liable. The Court considers this 10% threshold not to be arbitrary given the statutory rights enjoyed by members of limited liability companies with at least a 10% share: the right to be informed of the company’s affairs; the right to access the company’s records and files; the right to request the convening of a general meeting; the right to request that a specific issue be included on the agenda of a general meeting; and the right to lodge an action with the competent court requesting that the company be wound up (see paragraphs 37-38 above). Relevant international organisations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), use a similar test in order to distinguish between investors who do not control a company (portfolio investors) and those who do (direct investors). In this regard, the relevant part of OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment, Fourth Edition 2008, reads as follows (pp. 22-23) [19] :",
                "“29. ... The motivation to significantly influence or control an enterprise is the underlying factor that differentiates direct investment from cross-border portfolio investments. For the latter, the investor’s focus is mostly on earnings resulting from the acquisition and sales of shares and other securities without expecting to control or influence the management of the assets underlying these investments. Direct investment relationships, by their very nature, may lead to long-term and steady financing and technological transfers with the objective of maximising production and the earnings of the MNE over time. Portfolio investors do not have as an objective any long-term relationship. Return on the assets is the main determinant for the purchase or sale of their securities.",
                "31. It has been argued that in practice there are several factors which may determine the influence a direct investor has over the direct investment enterprise. However, for the sake of consistency and cross-country comparability of the FDI statistics, a strict application of a numerical guideline is recommended to define direct investment. Accordingly, direct investment is considered evident when the direct investor owns directly or indirectly at least 10% of the voting power of the direct investment enterprise. In other words, the 10% threshold is the criterion to determine whether (or not) an investor has influence over the management of an enterprise, and, therefore, whether the basis for a direct investment relationship exists or not.”"

Thus, either by himself or together with the other members of the company, he should have taken the necessary steps to collect any letters addressed to his company (see Hennings v. Germany, 16 December 1992, § 26, Series A no. 251-A). Indeed, for as long as the members of L.E. maintained the company’s existence, albeit only formally, and because they failed to find a way to dissolve it, they should have ensured some basic management. Taking into account, in addition, the reasonably long time-limits for appealing against decisions rendered in strike-off proceedings (see paragraphs 44-45 above), the Court considers the service of the decisions on L.E., together with a notification in the court register or in the Official Gazette, as applicable, to have been adequate."

The Court is of the opinion that, because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is ‘in the public interest’. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures of deprivation of property. Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities, accordingly, enjoy a certain margin of appreciation.",
                "Furthermore, the notion of ‘public interest’ is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws expropriating property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues. The Court, finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, will respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is ‘in the public interest’ unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see James and Others, cited above, p. 32, § 46; The former King of Greece and Others, cited above, § 87; and Zvolský and Zvolská v. the Czech Republic, no. 46129/99, § 67 in fine, ECHR 2002-IX).

                "106. It transpires from the preparatory work relating to the adoption of the FOCA that the main purposes of that Act were to ensure stability in the commercial market and financial discipline. One of the side effects of the transition from a socialist to a free-market economy was the existence of a large number of dormant companies with debts, but no assets, which had been created under the legislation of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The legislature considered that the initiation by the courts of winding-up proceedings against such companies, which was the only measure available at the time, would have inundated the courts for an estimated 30 years and would have had significant financial implications for the State (see paragraph 85 above). The FOCA thus introduced the possibility for companies to be struck off from the court register, on the court’s initiative, without first being wound up. In addition, in order to protect the creditors of such companies, section 27(4) of the FOCA, as amended by the Constitutional Court in 2002, provided that the former members of companies struck off under the FOCA who had been able to influence the operation of the companies would be liable for the companies’ debts (see also Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, § 877, 25 July 2013). Bearing in mind the particularly broad margin of appreciation enjoyed by the domestic authorities in matters of general social and economic policy (see Jahn and Others, cited above, § 91; Vistiņš and Perepjolkins v. Latvia, cited above, § 98; and Béláné Nagy v. Hungary [GC], no. 53080/13, §§ 113-14, 13 December 2016), the Court finds no reason to doubt that the impugned measure was in the public interest. In situations such as the deterioration of the commercial market due to a high number of dormant and insolvent companies, there may be a paramount need for the State to act so as to avoid irreparable harm to the economy and to enhance the legal security and confidence of participants in the market.",

It has considered it relevant to take into account the risk of abuse if a general measure were to be relaxed, that being a risk which is primarily for the State to assess. A general measure has also been found to be a more feasible means of achieving the legitimate aim than a provision allowing a case-by-case examination, when the latter would give rise to a risk of significant uncertainty, of litigation, expense and delay as well as of discrimination and arbitrariness (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § 108, ECHR 2013, with further references). It falls to the Court to examine carefully the arguments taken into consideration during the legislative process and leading to the choices that have been made by the legislature and to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the competing interests of the State or the public generally and those directly affected by the legislative choices (compare Correia de Matos v.

                "111. Lastly, in Agrotexim and Others, to which the applicant referred in his submissions, the Court held that only exceptional circumstances could justify the lifting of the corporate veil. This was not specifically in relation to a question, as that raised in the present case, of whether an interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions was justified under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, but the question whether a shareholder may in any circumstances claim to be a victim under Article 34 of the Convention as a result of actions aimed at the property of a company. Apparently, the rationale for the Court’s reasoning was that since companies had a distinct legal personality from shareholders, it was the former and not the latter who could lodge complaints of violations of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 with the Court, unless, due to exceptional circumstances, the company was not in a position to do so. The Court observed (ibid., § 66) that the Supreme Courts of certain members States of the Council of Europe had taken the same line and that the principle had also been confirmed with regard to the diplomatic protection of companies by the International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) in Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Limited (judgment of 5 February 1970, ICJ Reports 1970, pp. 39-40, §§ 55-58). Addressing both sides of the principle, the ICJ stated the following in the relevant part of that judgment:",
                "“55. The Court will now examine other grounds on which it is conceivable that the submission by the Belgian Government of a claim on behalf of shareholders in Barcelona Traction may be justified.",
                "56. For the same reasons as before, the Court must here refer to municipal law. Forms of incorporation and their legal personality have sometimes not been employed for the sole purposes they were originally intended to serve; sometimes the corporate entity has been unable to protect the rights of those who entrusted their financial resources to it; thus inevitably there have arisen dangers of abuse, as in the case of many other institutions of law. Here, then, as elsewhere, the law, confronted with economic realities, has had to provide protective measures and remedies in the interests of those within the corporate entity as well as of those outside who have dealings with it: the law has recognized that the independent existence of the legal entity cannot be treated as an absolute. It is in this context that the process of ‘lifting the corporate veil’ or ‘disregarding the legal entity’ has been found justified and equitable in certain circumstances or for certain purposes. The wealth of practice already accumulated on the subject in municipal law indicates that the veil is lifted, for instance, to prevent the misuse of the privileges of legal personality, as in certain cases of fraud or malfeasance, to protect third persons such as a creditor or purchaser, or to prevent the evasion of legal requirements or of obligations.",
                "57. Hence the lifting of the veil is more frequently employed from without, in the interest of those dealing with the corporate entity. However, it has also been operated from within, in the interest of – among others – the shareholders, but only in exceptional circumstances.",
                "58. In accordance with the principle expounded above, the process of lifting the veil, being an exceptional one admitted by municipal law in respect of an institution of its own making, is equally admissible to play a similar role in international law. It follows that on the international plane also there may in principle be special circumstances which justify the lifting of the veil in the interest of shareholders.”",
                "The Court has then applied the Agrotexim test on a number of occasions, when dealing with shareholders’ claims to be identified with companies for the purposes of “victim” status – that is, “from within” in the parlance of the ICJ (see Centro Europa 7 S.r.1. and Di Stefano, cited above, §§ 90-95, and the authorities cited therein). The Agrotexim line of case-law cannot thus be transposed directly to assist the Court in resolving a case, such as the present one, which concerns lifting of the corporate veil of a limited liability company in the interest of its creditors – or “from without” in the parlance of the ICJ. In this connection, the Court has acknowledged that where a limited liability company was used merely as a façade for fraudulent actions by its owners or managers, lifting of the corporate veil may be an appropriate solution for defending the rights of its creditors (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, § 877). Moreover, in a number of cases introduced by creditors of State-owned limited liability companies or banks, the Court has found a breach of, inter alia, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 because of the refusal of the respondent State to pay a debt of the impugned company or bank, hiding thereby behind the corporate veil (see Ališić and Others, cited above, §§ 114-15, with further references). The Court relied in this regard on, inter alia, the following factors: whether the State siphoned the corporate funds to the detriment of the company and its stakeholders, failed to keep an arm’s-length relationship with the company or otherwise acted in abuse of the corporate form (ibid.). This is also in line with the approach taken by a number of Contracting States (see the comparative law information provided by the parties and one of the third parties in the present case in paragraph 56 above)."

The Court will now proceed to examine whether in the present case a fair balance was struck between the interests involved (that is, the interest of the applicant not to be held liable for the debts of L.E., the interest of L.E.’s creditor in having its claim fully settled and the public interest of stable economic relations). In assessing whether the person has had to bear an individual and excessive burden within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court will, as appropriate, take into account the principle, explained above, that holding a member of a limited liability company liable for debts of the company, and thus lifting the corporate veil, should be made necessary by exceptional circumstances and counterbalanced by specific safeguards.",

At the outset, the Court observes that prior to the entry into force of the FOCA, the lifting of the corporate veil in order to hold a company member personally liable for company debts, under the Slovenian law, was limited to the grounds set out in section 6 of the Companies Act 1993 as described in paragraph 34 above, including abuse of the company and misuse of the company’s assets. Similar provisions have been introduced in the domestic law of a number of other Contracting States (see paragraph 56 above)."

However, as can be seen from the preparatory work in respect of the FOCA, section 6 of the Companies Act 1993 was no longer deemed adapted to deal with the situation that had arisen in Slovenia by the end of the 1990s, when thousands of companies, which had been created under the legislation of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, existed only on paper and, moreover, had large debts, but no assets. The national legislature decided to put in place new means of dealing with such companies."

To begin with, the Court notes that there can be no doubt that the FOCA entailed extensive consequences for many individuals including the applicant, who, as a result, became personally liable for their respective companies’ debts. However, the exceptional character of the circumstances that may warrant the lifting of the corporate veil essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the competent national court, not to the frequency of such situations. It does not mean that this kind of measure may be justified only in rare cases (see, mutatis mutandis, Miller v. Sweden, no. 55853/00, § 29, 8 February 2005, in relation to an issue under Article 6)."

                "116. It is further apparent from the FOCA preparatory work (see paragraph 41 above), that the FOCA was introduced in response to a serious and widespread problem in post-socialist Slovenia extending to no less than 6,500 companies and undermining some of the basic conditions which the companies had to satisfy in a free-market economy. The introduction of new rules on the lifting of the corporate veil so as to make members of dormant companies liable for the companies’ debts, on the basis of a presumption that they intended to have the companies dissolved and that they assumed joint and several liability for those debts, would also seem to have been motivated by a certain urgency. Moreover, by virtue of the Constitutional Court’s decision, such liability was confined to company members who were in fact able to influence the operation of a company (see paragraph 51 above). The Constitutional Court pointed out, inter alia, that the need for an additional protection of creditors was even stronger under the FOCA, which did not envisage any procedures to ensure repayment to creditors in the event of the dissolution of these companies, and in case of potential over-indebtedness of a company also no procedures to at least ensure the regular responsibility of limited liability companies (decision U-I-135/00 of 9 October 2002, § 49, cited in paragraph 50 above)."

Thus, the FOCA was first amended in 2007 to relieve company members of their personal liability, but the Constitutional Court annulled that amendment the same year in order to protect creditors (see paragraph 52 above). When the legislature made a further attempt to relieve company members in 2011 (see paragraph 54 above), the Constitutional Court allowed exoneration but only for companies struck off after the entry into force of the Act."

From a perusal of the relevant considerations in the preparatory work and the reasoning of the Constitutional Court, it appears that at the time under consideration, notably from the Constitutional Court’s ruling of 2002, genuine efforts were made to achieve a fair balance between the interests of the creditors of struck-off companies and those of the members of such companies. The quality of the parliamentary and judicial review of the necessity of that legislation and of the measures adopted was such as to warrant a wide margin of appreciation as regards the legislative and judicial choices made (see Animal Defenders International, cited above, § 109). The divergence of views expressed in the legislature, on the one hand, and the Constitutional Court, on the other, is one that must be considered to fall within that margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether the impugned interference in the instant case is reconcilable with the applicant’s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v.

In its judgment of 12 March 2005, the Ljubljana Local Court found that the onus of proving his status as passive member was on the applicant and that he had failed to demonstrate that he had not been an active member of L.E. The court established that with his 11.11% share in the company, the applicant had enjoyed the rights of a minority member, and moreover, had been employed by the company and actively involved in its management since 1993. In his capacity as acting director and later managing director, he had been authorised to act on behalf of the company. Furthermore, even after he had resigned as managing director, he had still been active in the operations of the company and had also signed the winding-up petition. Lastly, the court considered that, as a minority member, the applicant could have and should have proposed the appointment of a new director at a general meeting of the company because pursuant to domestic law all limited liability companies had to have at least one director."

            [
                "120. On 9 February 2006 the Ljubljana Higher Court rejected the applicant’s appeal on essentially the same grounds as the first-instance court. It noted, inter alia, that the Constitutional Court had found the measure of lifting the corporate veil under the FOCA to be in line with the principle of the separation of a company’s assets from those of its members and thus to be consistent with the Constitution. The court considered it irrelevant whether the applicant had become a member of L.E. before or after the creditor’s claim had arisen. Having joined the company, he had assumed its assets as well as its liabilities. It further held that it was not decisive that the applicant had not remained a director of L.E. until the dissolution of that company. What was crucial was that the applicant had been actively involved in its management and that he had had the rights of a minority member pursuant to section 445 of the Companies Act 1993 (see paragraph 37 above). The court noted that, in contrast to section 6 of the Companies Act 1993, which required the creditors of a company to prove that a member of the company had abused the corporate form (see paragraph 34 above), the FOCA had introduced a “non-rebuttable” presumption that the members of a struck-off company were deemed to have undertaken joint and several liability for any outstanding debts of the company. In accordance with the Constitutional Court’s ruling of 2002, they could be exonerated from their liability only if they demonstrated that they were “passive members” of the company (see paragraphs 46 and 51 above). Lastly, the court took note of the fact that the applicant had indeed made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E., but it considered this irrelevant because L.E. had at the time failed to make the required advance payment and the petition had therefore been rejected (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above)."

It thus rejected the applicant’s complaint as manifestly ill-founded."

                "122. The Court sees no cause to disagree, in substance, with the above reasoning of the national courts. It is not persuaded by the applicant’s argument that the domestic courts should have attached more weight to other factors that he had adduced and absolved him from his personal liability. In principle it is not the Court’s task to reassess their factual findings. Moreover, as the Court has recognised in its case-law, presumptions of fact or of law operate in every legal system. The Convention clearly does not prohibit such presumptions as a matter of principle. It does, however, require the Contracting States to remain within certain limits in this respect as regards criminal law (see Salabiaku v. France, 7 October 1988, § 28, Series A no. 141 ‑ A). In the Court’s view, presumptions can a fortiori be accepted in the area of company law, where the right to respect for possessions may be at stake. Moreover, there is nothing to indicate that the manner of the application of the relevant burden of proof in the applicant’s case overstepped those limits (see paragraph 100 above)."

                "123. Regarding the specific situation of the company in issue, the Court further observes that L.E. was converted from a public limited company into a limited liability company in November 1995 (see paragraph 13 above). As explained by the Constitutional Court of Slovenia in its decision U ‑ I ‑ 135/00, § 44 (cited in paragraph 51 above), limited liability companies, also known as private limited companies, were very different from public limited companies, notably when it came to the responsibility of their members. The applicant acknowledged that L.E. had already been insolvent at the time when it was converted. Consequently, it can only be concluded that, as a limited liability company, L.E. was not adequately capitalised from the start and acted in breach of the applicable rules of company law. Moreover, despite the fact that the company had been unable to re-establish liquidity and solvency since 1995, it did not apply for winding-up until two years later, when it was evidently lacking any assets whatsoever. L.E. failed to make the required advance payment for the costs of the proceedings in the amount of EUR 626, and instead decided to wait until such proceedings were instituted of the court’s own motion. However, the relevant legislation changed and removed that possibility; the FOCA introduced stricter provisions on the operation of companies."

            [
                "124. It is worth noting in this regard that the impugned provisions of the FOCA only became applicable one year after the Act had entered into force. The one-year vacatio legis provided L.E. and its members with ample time to institute appropriate proceedings in order to have the company dissolved and to avoid the application of the FOCA (contrast with Vékony v. Hungary, no. 65681/13, § 34, 13 January 2015, where the Court held that the applicant had not been granted enough time to adjust to the new situation). It is true that the members would have been required to cover the costs of winding-up proceedings instituted by them, but would have avoided the strike off and personal liability for the debts of the company. In sum, although the company was not able to pay its debts or to perform the activities for which it had been established, it perpetuated its existence. In this connection, the Court sees no grounds for calling into doubt the position of the Constitutional Court relied on by the Government that such companies posed a threat to the proper functioning of the market."

Furthermore, the effect of reducing the capital below the statutory limit and eventually exhausting it completely, coupled with prolonged failure to institute winding-up proceedings, had considerable adverse effects on the position of the company’s creditor (namely, the Slovenian Railways). The latter was subjected to prolonged uncertainty as to whether its debt would be repaid. Such a lengthy course of proceedings could have been avoided if L.E. had applied for winding-up in due time after recognising that it was unable to re-establish sufficient basic funds to continue its operations."

In contrast, pursuant to the FOCA, as amended by the Constitutional Court in 2002, only those who were in a position to actively influence the operation of a company were liable for debts of the company. The CJEU further held that the deterrent effect of the measure in question was greater for investors from other member States than for Greek investors. That point was not argued in the present case."

In any event, the applicant has not argued, let alone substantiated, that he suffered any serious consequences in this connection (contrast Vaskrsić, cited above, § 83). Therefore, in this particular case, the Court has no factual grounds to establish that the impugned measure, which was based on the statutory rule of unlimited liability of the applicant for the outstanding debts of L.E., was disproportionate."

Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. The notion of “public interest” is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws concerning social-insurance benefits will commonly involve consideration of economic and social issues.

Prior to the retirement age, the disability pension is an exceptional benefit granted to individuals on the ground of their disability.

The Government added that, had the law not been amended, she would once again have become eligible when her health impairment was again assessed as exceeding the relevant threshold in 2012.

The Convention did not guarantee any property rights independently from the domestic law of sovereign States.

This was also indicated by the fact that her 67% loss of working capacity under the pre-2008 system would have been equivalent to 54% health impairment under the new methodology; however, it had been assessed at 40% in 2009, which thus indicated a certain improvement in her health. The regular statutory reviews foreseen by the expert opinions prior to the withdrawal of the disability pension suggested only that the applicant’s ailments were susceptible to evolution, whereas the periodic reviews subsequent to that withdrawal had been requested by the applicant, rather than ordered by the authorities, and could therefore not be interpreted as proof of any subsisting legitimate expectation."

The Government further asserted that ex post facto legislation was typical of any social-security system, because of the lengthy and continuing nature of the social-security relationship between an insured person and the State. Applications for such benefits were normally not adjudicated on the basis of the law as in force at the beginning of the insurance relationship but rather under the law as it stood when the request was decided upon. Amendments enacted in the meanwhile to social-security laws might thus inevitably impose an individual burden on the insured. Any ex post facto legislation could only be validly disputed if the new law concerned those already in receipt of a benefit at the time of the entry into force of the retroactive law; however, this was not the case here."

To dispense the applicant from making the necessary contributions would be unfair and discriminatory towards those in a comparable situation who had diligently contributed to the social-security scheme. With regard to the actual aggregate of contributions made by the applicant, the Government submitted that this was a necessary but not a sufficient precondition, which was not capable of substituting for a valid national legal basis."

The first rule, which is set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose. However, the rules are not “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 37, Series A no. 98; and Sargsyan v.

Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 50, ECHR 2004-IX).

In applications concerning claims other than those relating to existing possessions, the idea behind this requirement has also been formulated in various other ways throughout the Court’s case-law. By way of example, in a number of cases the Court examined, respectively, whether the applicants had “a claim which was sufficiently established to be enforceable” (see Gratzinger and Gratzingerova, cited above, § 74); whether they demonstrated the existence of “an assertable right under domestic law to a welfare benefit” (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.)

It took the view that “where the proprietary interest is in the nature of a claim it may be regarded as an “asset” only where it has a sufficient basis in national law, for example where there is settled case-law of the domestic courts confirming it” (see Kopecký, cited above, § 52)."

Ireland, 29 November 1991, § 51, Series A no. 222; and Stretch v. the United Kingdom, no. 44277/98, § 35, 24 June 2003). In this line of cases, the “legitimate expectation” was thus based on a reasonably justified reliance on a legal act which had a sound legal basis and which bore on property rights (see Kopecký, cited above, § 47). Respect for such reliance follows from one aspect of the rule of law, which is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention and which implies, inter alia, that there must be a measure of legal protection in domestic law against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see, as a recent authority, Karácsony and Others v.

Many national legal systems recognise that such individuals require a degree of certainty and security, and provide for benefits to be paid – subject to the fulfilment of the conditions of eligibility – as of right (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 51). The principles which apply generally in cases under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are equally relevant when it comes to social and welfare benefits (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 54). The Court has previously addressed the issue of legitimate expectation in the context of social benefits on a number of occasions (see, for example, Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, § 44, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX, and Klein v. Austria, no. 57028/00, § 45, 3 March 2011."

                "81. In those legal systems where the national legislation requires mandatory contributions of employees to the social-security system, the legislation normally provides that those who have made adequate contributions and satisfied the statutory requirements of disability will receive some form of long-term disability benefit, on grounds of the principles of social solidarity and equivalency, for the period of the disability persisting or until the age of retirement. Such insurance schemes, which are typically mandatory, provide such protection, that is, the availability of benefits, for the entire period of insurance and on every occasion when the conditions of the insurance are satisfied. The relevant legal conditions are however subject to evolution. In this connection, it may be reiterated that in Gaygusuz v. Austria (16 September 1996, § 41, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV) the Court found that the right to emergency assistance – a social benefit linked to the payment of contributions to the unemployment insurance fund – was, in so far as provided for in the applicable legislation, a pecuniary right for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In Klein (cited above, § 43) it was noted that entitlement to a social benefit – in that instance, a pension payable from a lawyers’ pension scheme – was linked to the payment of contributions, and, when such contributions had been made, an award could not be denied to the person concerned. Contributions to a pension fund may thus, in certain circumstances and according to the domestic law, create a property right (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 39; Apostolakis v. Greece, no. 39574/07, §§ 28 and 35, 22 October 2009; Bellet, Huertas and Vialatte v. France (dec.), nos. 40832/98, 40833/98 and 40906/98, 27 April 1999; Skórkiewicz v.

The Court has also held that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 imposes no restriction on the Contracting States’ freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social-security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme (see Sukhanov and Ilchenko v. Ukraine, nos. 68385/10 and 71378/10, §§ 35-39, 26 June 2014; Kolesnyk v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 57116/10, §§ 83, 89 and 91, 3 June 2014; and Fakas v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 4519/11, §§ 34, 37-43, 48, 3 June 2014). If, however, a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a welfare benefit – whether conditional or not on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation must be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 54)."

The payment of contributions to a pension fund may in certain circumstances create a property right in a portion of such a fund and a modification of the pension rights under such a system could therefore in principle raise an issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1; even if it is assumed that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 guarantees to persons who have paid contributions to a special insurance system the right to derive benefit from the system, it cannot be interpreted as entitling that person to a pension of a particular amount (see Müller v.

The decision granting her a disability pension in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Act and which formed the basis of her original entitlement could thus be regarded as representing an “existing possession” (see Kopecký, § 35(c)). Further, it seems undeniable that throughout the said period, she could, on the basis of the said “legal act”, entertain a “legitimate expectation” (ibid., § 47) of continuing to receive disability benefits should her disability persist to the requisite degree, there being no dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law (ibid., § 50)."

In this connection, the Court observes in particular that during the intervening period between the discontinuation of the applicant’s disability pension in 2010 and the legislature’s introduction of the new contribution requirement in 2012, the applicant not only continued to be part of the social-security system but also continued to fulfil the relevant length-of-service requirement for disability benefits. Co-operating with the authorities at all times, and actively and continuously pursuing her disability claim, she underwent several periodic reassessments of her condition in the years 2011 and 2012; further such assessments were scheduled for November 2012, April and September 2014 and March 2015."

In its ruling of 1 April 2011, the Nyíregyháza Labour Court noted that the applicant had accrued 23 years and 71 days of service time (see paragraph 16 above), which, the Court observes, far exceeds the five-year minimum period (prior to contingency) warranting at least a reduced invalidity benefit under the European Code of Social Security and ILO Conventions nos. 102 and 128 (see paragraph 42 above). Furthermore, whilst approving the withdrawal of the applicant’s disability pension as of 1 February 2010, the Labour Court expressly confirmed that a new medical assessment could take place in 2012 and drew her attention to the possibility of making a renewed application should her health deteriorate (see paragraph 16 above)."

It was undisputed that this disability level would have qualified the applicant for a disability benefit in February 2012 had it not been for the new retroactive contribution requirement, which was not met by her. In the meantime, on 13 December 2011, she had been recommended for rehabilitation and for the accompanying allowance – a type of benefit closely related to disability pension (see paragraph 17 above) and introduced to take the place of the disability pension for individuals capable of being rehabilitated. However, the authorities did not implement this recommendation. Had they done so, the applicant might have been in receipt of a benefit on 31 December 2011, which would have altered her situation under the new law."

On the contrary, the measures taken by the authorities and the judgment of 1 April 2011 in particular indicate that the authorities acted in full recognition of the applicant’s insured status, and therefore the applicant could have relied in a reasonably justified manner on the applicable legislation and had a legitimate expectation of receiving a disability benefit should the statutory conditions be satisfied.

It was not in dispute between the parties that the applicant would have been eligible for the disability allowance from the date on which her health impairment was found in 2012 to have exceeded the relevant threshold, had the new law not entered into force earlier that year (see paragraphs 22 and 60 above)."

Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. The notion of “public interest” is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws concerning social-insurance benefits will commonly involve consideration of economic and social issues. The Court finds it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one and will respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is “in the public interest” unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see, mutatis mutandis, The former King of Greece and Others v.

This element gains particular importance in view of the fact that the applicant did not have any other significant income on which to subsist (see paragraph 25 above; compare also Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 44) and that she evidently had difficulties in pursuing gainful employment and belonged to the vulnerable group of disabled persons (see Alajos Kiss v.

At present it is very difficult to make such an estimation. ... In practice, every legal successor [of a Bug River claimant] could, and can, obtain a certificate – at present, a decision – [confirming the right to] a share in the abandoned property.

This situation creates conditions in which the entitled persons may abuse their rights – a fact of which governors and mayors have notified us. They accordingly suggest that a register ... of the certificates issued confirming the entitlement to ... compensatory property be kept. At present, however, there is no single, comprehensive system for the registration of certificates and decisions entitling claimants to [compensatory property].",

                "“The first issue to be dealt with concerns the empowerment of the [communist authorities that concluded the Republican Agreements] to enter into international agreements. There is no doubt that the Polish Committee of National Liberation cannot be considered a constitutional entity of a sovereign State, with corresponding democratic legitimacy and capable of taking sovereign decisions in the name of the State.",
                "The scope of compensation set out for repatriated persons in the Republican Agreements was in no way equivalent or proportionate to the scope of compensation that the States with which these Agreements were concluded took upon themselves as an obligation. In most cases the repatriation was de facto in one direction, as most evacuees were former Polish citizens from the territories lost by the Polish Republic as a result of the Second World War. As a consequence, despite a considerably greater material burden of resettlement and repatriation, Poland, by virtue of the 1952 Pact, was obliged to pay the USSR the substantial sum of 76 million roubles (Article 2 of the 1952 Pact). As in the case of the change in Poland's borders, this type of obligation can certainly not be treated as a sovereign decision by the Polish State authorities.",
                "It should be mentioned at this point that similar burdens in connection with the consequences of the war were also borne by other States, but in no case, with the exception of Germany, was the weight of the burden comparable to the one the Polish State had to bear. It is worth recalling that meeting these obligations was further complicated by the considerable material losses suffered during the war and immediately afterwards. Under these conditions, it was evident that the process of affording satisfaction to the repatriated persons, as set forth in the agreements with the USSR and the Soviet Republics concerned, had to be moderate and spread over time. This also means that it is necessary to take into consideration the difficult financial situation of the State and, above all, the situation of groups of citizens other than the Bug River repatriates. Undoubtedly, the consequences of the war were felt by Polish society as a whole. In this connection, it cannot be argued that, for example, compensation that is incomplete, subject to time - limits or taking a specific form is automatically in contradiction with the principle of justice. This view also applies to mechanisms providing only partial compensation for losses suffered as a result of acts of war and territorial changes.”"

                "“ ( 1) The Republican Agreements gave rise to a specific type of State obligation to award compensation, through appropriate domestic law, to persons who had lost property in connection with the delimitation of Poland's borders after the Second World War. The Republican Agreements did not constitute a direct basis for repatriates to lodge compensation claims, as the legislature was left free to determine how the compensation machinery would be set up. The State's responsibilities in this regard, as undertaken in successive legal regulations, are matters left for an independent decision by the legislature.",
                "( 2) The right to credit, which provides for the possibility of offsetting the value of property lost by Polish citizens after being abandoned outside the present territory of the State against the sale price of immovable property or against fees for the right of perpetual use, constitutes a specific surrogate for the lost property rights, which is not solely a legal expectation of compensation but rather a property right recognised in the Republic's legal order as part of its public law. As such, this right enjoys the constitutionally guaranteed protection of property rights (Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution).",
                "( 3) The creation of legal frameworks for given institutions cannot be entirely abstracted from the factual circumstances and the economic realities in which the legal institutions thus established are to function. As a matter of principle, therefore, the legislature may not narrow down the possibility of benefiting from a general right granted to an individual so severely that the ultimate result is essentially a nudum ius, so that the property becomes an immaterial right devoid of any pecuniary value in practice. In the case of the so-called right to credit, its nominal value does not, however, correspond to its actual value. The depreciation of the value of this right has occurred as a result of the legislature excluding specific categories of immovable property, which has fundamentally limited the possibility of enjoying this right.",
                "( 4) All property rights within the legal order are subject to constitutional protection. An interference with the sphere of an entity's legally protected property interests, when it occurs without the formal removal of the entity's legal title, amounts to de facto expropriation, within the meaning adopted in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. Consequently, the assessment of provisions that eliminate the possibility of benefiting from a right in practice leads to the conclusion that they are incompatible with Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution.",
                "( 5) Legal solutions limiting the possibility of benefiting from the right to credit, within the framework determined by the law, and resulting in those rights being stripped of their substance, cannot be considered necessary in a democratic State governed by the rule of law, and are not functionally related to any of the values set out in Article 31 § 3 [of the Constitution] (the principle of proportionality).",
                "( 6) The requirement of respect for the principle of maintaining citizens'confidence in the State and the law made by it, ensuing from the principle of the rule of law (Article 2 of the Constitution), entails a prohibition on enacting laws that would create illusory legal institutions. This principle therefore requires that the obstacles which prevent [persons] from benefiting from the right to credit be eliminated from the legal system. From the point of view of the confidence principle, in the case of the right to credit it is the means of protecting this right that is subject to assessment, rather than its substance. The lack of opportunity to benefit from this right, within the framework set out by the legislature, shows that an illusory legal institution has been created, and thereby constitutes a violation of Article 2 of the Constitution.”"

In the assessment of the Constitutional Court, it is justified to hold that the right to credit is a special property right of a public - law nature. It is not a proper ownership right, but neither can it be reduced to the category of a potential right in the sense of a maximum formulated expectation [ ekspektatywa maksymalnie ukształtowana ]. Even though materialisation of the right depends on action by the entitled person, it would not be justified to conclude that this right does not exist until the time of its realisation resulting from winning a bid, in which the entitled person may offset the value of abandoned property against the value of acquired property or against fees for perpetual use. ...",

                "In the present legal circumstances, one can identify a peculiar functional paradox in that a general right laid down in the legislation in force cannot be materialised in practice. Consequently the right to credit is becoming more and more of an'empty obligation'and is turning into a nudum ius. Maintenance of the present trend, in which various types of State Treasury land are excluded from the application of the right to credit will mean that there is no hope of this right materialising in the future. This state of affairs is already resulting in an unfavourable and paradoxical situation: entitled persons who have been waiting for years to be able to participate in competitive bids and, subsequently, in the course of such bids, being aware of how difficult it is to realise their right to credit,'push up'the price of the property to a level considerably exceeding its market value.",
                "In the present circumstances, in order to assess the possibility of taking advantage of the right to credit, one must take into consideration not only the limitation of the availability of certain types of property, with varying degrees of justification, but also the actual opportunities for enforcement of this right and its economic value.",
                "The statutes restricting repatriates'access to State Treasury property essentially result in de facto expropriation, whereby it is impossible to enjoy the right to credit either at present or in the future, in the sense in which this concept is used in the European Court of Human Rights'case-law cited above. ...",

Moreover, it is not just a question of temporary impossibility, conditioned by certain factual and legal circumstances, but rather a question of the creation of legal constructions that exclude this possibility ex thesi. In the case at hand, assessment of the possibility of this right materialising is all the more essential in that the legislature, in accepting the principle of the State's obligations towards repatriates on the basis of the international agreements, failed at the same time to establish any alternative compensation mechanism. For several decades, the right to credit has been the only available de lege lata solution allowing for compensation of the material losses suffered by Polish citizens as a result of territorial changes in the 1940s. ... ”"

                "“[T]he protection of property rights does not mean that it is completely impossible to interfere with their substance, or that they are absolutely inviolable ... What is necessary is to remain within the constitutional framework which sets out the boundaries for constitutional protection of a given property right [references to the relevant judgments of the Constitutional Court ]. Such limitations are introduced by the Constitution in Article 31 § 3. In the Constitutional Court's case-law it has been indicated on many occasions that this provision provides tests for determining the conditions for the admissibility of limitations on the enjoyment of constitutional rights and freedoms. ...",
                "In this context, it is important to note the Constitutional Court's position expressed in the judgment of 12 January 2000, [references], according to which the scope of such limitations must not cause annihilation of the fundamental components of the general right, resulting in its being'stripped'of its real substance and turned it into a legal fiction. Such a situation leads to a constitutionally unacceptable violation of the fundamental substance or the essence of that right. ...",
                "In the light of the foregoing considerations, it must be recognised that all the provisions referred to in the Ombudsman's application, which limit the actual scope of property in respect of which the procedure set out in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997 can be applied, are incompatible with Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 read in conjunction with Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution.",
                "Such limitations are not justified in a democratic State governed by the rule of law. The aims set out in section 17 of the 1993 Amendment, and the grounds provided for limiting the right to credit in the case of property entrusted to the Military Property Agency, namely the need for funds to modernise the armed forces, must not be pursued in a manner that deprives only a specific group of persons of the possibility of realising property rights vested in them.",

                "In the case of exclusions provided for in the 1996 Act, the aim of generating resources for the modernisation and maintenance of military institutions does not justify discrimination against persons entitled to credit for the value of property abandoned outside the present territory of Poland, purely because those persons may not be able to pay the purchase price in cash. This type of solution can never be recognised as necessary in a democratic State governed by the rule of law. Neither is there any functional connection between that limitation and the pursuance of the aims referred to in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution. The need to introduce limitations could arise if the realisation of the right to credit were to make it impossible to satisfy the legally protected interests of other persons. In particular, the existence of the right to credit does not lead to a situation in which the rights of other persons might be violated (for example, the rights of former owners who have been given priority or persons with a right of pre-emption).",
                "At the same time, it should be stressed that the unconstitutionality of these provisions is not connected with a legislative omission consisting of the lack of certain regulations regarding compensation for the Bug River repatriates. Rather, it arises from the defective legal formulation of the provisions governing the question of compensation, which causes an inadmissible systemic dysfunction. It must be stressed that in creating a general property right, the State may not at the same time arbitrarily introduce, by taking advantage of the attributes of State power, such limitations which, by excluding substantial stocks of property from the compensation procedure, de facto paralyse the possibility for beneficiaries to derive any economic advantage from these rights. ”"

                "“This principle means, first and foremost, the need to protect and respect properly acquired rights and to protect interests that have not yet been vested ... but it also encompasses a prohibition against the legislature creating legal constructions that cannot be implemented and constitute an illusion of law, and hence a pretence of protecting those property interests that are functionally connected with the substance of the established general right.",

For it must be stressed yet again that in the case of the so-called'right to credit,'its nominal value does not correspond to its real value. This depreciation occurs precisely because the possibility of realising this right has been limited to a significant extent through legislation excluding certain categories of property. ...",
                "The imperative of adherence to the principle of maintaining confidence in the State, which encompasses, as indicated above, a prohibition against creating law that introduces fictional legal institutions, requires the elimination of legal obstacles that make it impossible to enjoy the right to credit. The Constitutional Court cannot assess to what extent a properly functioning right to credit could repair the damage caused by the loss of'property beyond the Bug River'. The resolution of this problem, which is part of the general issue of redress for the losses sustained by particular groups of the population as a result of the country's historical territorial changes and changes in ownership introduced several decades ago, lies within the competence of the legislature. ...",
                "Essentially, then, the important point here is the implementation of the postulate that legal regulations should be formulated in such a way as to secure to the individual not only legal certainty, but also complete foreseeability as to the extent to which their implementation will affect the individual's legal position in particular legal situations. The compensation mechanism introduced for persons who were deprived of their property as a result of territorial changes resulted in the development of legitimate expectations, on the part of those concerned, that this problem would be definitively resolved in the future, with due consideration for the interests of all persons in whom this right to credit was vested. The opinion that there has been a violation of the principle of maintaining confidence in the State and the law made by it, is further strengthened by the lack of alternative forms of compensation in the legal system. ...",
                "Elimination from the legal system of the limitations introduced by sections 212 and 213 of the Land Administration Act 1997, and by the other individual provisions, would make it possible for the remainder of the credit mechanism to become a real, and not, as hitherto, fictional instrument of compensation. This Court has not assessed the advisability of selection by the legislature of specific means of satisfying the repatriates'property interests, since the determination of concrete institutional solutions is within the legislature's independent sphere of competence. Therefore, it is the compensation machinery already set out in legislation that has been subjected to assessment from the point of view of constitutional guarantees.",
                "It should be pointed out in passing that, in addition to the compensation procedure directly established by section 212 of the Land Administration Act, the legislature recently introduced a new possibility for the realisation of the right to credit in the Law of 5 December 2002 on amendments to the Law on the exercise of the State Treasury's powers, the Law on commercialisation and privatisation of State enterprises and other statutes, which enters into force on 14 January 2003, and which adds a third subsection to section 53 of the Law of 30 August 1996 on the commercialisation and privatisation of State enterprises. On the basis of this provision, the persons referred to in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997 have been given the possibility of crediting the value of abandoned property against the sale price of a privatised enterprise, corresponding to the value of rights to certain items of immovable property included among the assets of the enterprise, or against the sale price of such rights not included among the assets. This is a new form of the right to credit and it is to be expected that it will broaden the possibility of obtaining actual compensation for lost property. However, the new regulation does not in principle change the assessment of the right to credit, as formed by the provisions contested in this case. For the existence of a new form of the right to credit ... does not free the legislature from ensuring that the compensation machinery, as examined in the present case, is designed in such a way as to be a genuine instrument for the protection of the individual's property rights and not just a legal fiction.",

The court established that from 1991 to 1998 the Cracow District Office [9] had organised twenty-two auctions for the sale of property in which Bug River repatriates could participate. In certain auctions only those persons who had made applications for compensation before 26 May 1990 had been able to make bids. In 2002 the mayor of the Cracow District had begun to hold auctions, but throughout that year there had been only two such auctions.",

Also, there were situations where the State Treasury's Agricultural Property Agency organised auctions from which, under the relevant provisions, persons from beyond the Bug River were excluded.",
                "Particular attention should, however, be given to situations where auctions did not exclude persons from beyond the Bug River. These occurred extremely rarely. In such situations a large group of persons who had entitlements to compensation would participate. These people, concerned that, owing to the small stock of property set aside to satisfy their claims, they would not be able to obtain any satisfaction, would increase their bids for the property in such a way that the price of the property for sale was several times higher than its market value. It was symptomatic that only persons from beyond the Bug River took part in these auctions, although the organisers also permitted the participation of persons who were able to buy the property in cash. In one of the auctions a property whose reserve price, assessed in line with market valuations, was 115,000 Polish zlotys, was sold for 700,000 zlotys. In another auction a plot with a building that had been used as a dissecting room, and which had a reserve price of just over 200,000 Polish zlotys, was sold for 1,500,000 Polish zlotys. In the context of the above situation, it suffices to say that, within the area of activity of the Cracow Branch of the All-Polish Association of Borderland Creditors of the State Treasury, that is, within the territory of the former Cracow Province and part of the Nowy Sącz Province, only about twenty entitled persons out of a total of some 300 having certificates or administrative decisions took advantage of their right to credit and, of these, nobody obtained full compensation for their entitlement. It should be added that, within the area of activity of the Cracow Branch of the All-Polish Association of Borderland Creditors of the State Treasury, 3,600 persons tried to obtain certificates confirming their right to receive an equivalent to the abandoned property.”",
                "The court further found that the plaintiffs, or their predecessors, had earlier refused to accept two offers of compensatory property. It considered the refusal justified since the condition for obtaining the first property, a plot of land, had been to construct a house on it within four years, whereas the plaintiffs had not had the means for such an investment. The second offer had been to choose one of three tenement houses in another town, but those houses had been in a catastrophic state."

It found, however, that the conduct of the State had amounted to a series of tortious acts and held, inter alia, that:",
                "“ As has been proved in detail in this case, a paradoxical situation arose, where entitled persons waited for years to participate in an auction, and then, if an auction actually took place, knowing how difficult it was to use their entitlement to credit and pressured by the situation they found themselves in, they bid up the price of the property to levels far exceeding its market value. In this way, finding themselves in a highly pressured situation, they lost a large part of their entitlement. The severe limitations placed on the possibility of satisfying their entitlements in effect brought about its elimination. This situation, where the State has created the circumstances described above, is in effect a totally unjustified expropriation [and amounts to] taking from persons from beyond the Bug River property rights to which they are entitled. Even the creation of such a situation should be considered a state of lawlessness with regard to the rights of repatriated persons.",
                "It should be emphasised most strongly that the legislature not only has the positive obligation to create regulations and procedures that protect property rights, but there is also a negative obligation to refrain from introducing regulations that might remove legal protection from such rights, or that might restrict them, not to mention [measures] eliminating them entirely. If the legislature does not fulfil the above conditions, it is in breach of Article 64 § 2 of the Constitution and enacts lawlessness. ...",
                "In the opinion of this Court, the statutory restrictions resulting from the legislation described above – although the statutes may have been necessary – and relating to local government reform, agricultural restructuring, the modernisation of the army and other issues, do not justify discrimination against persons who have the right to credit the value of property abandoned outside the borders of the country, just because these people cannot pay the price of this property or [the fee for] the right [of perpetual use] in cash. ...",

While the legislature, in section 81 of the 1985 Act and in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997, gave persons from beyond the Bug River the right to credit the value of property abandoned abroad against the price of building plots or the price of buildings or premises situated on land belonging to the State Treasury, the subsequent acts rendered ineffective any possibility of this social group satisfying that entitlement.",
                "In essence, the damage sustained by repatriated persons, and also by the plaintiff in the context of the present case, consists of the difference between what they should have been able to have within the value of their entitlement, pursuant to section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997, and what they actually have in practice, as a result of the wrongful manner in which the State has implemented the law. ...",
                "In accordance with Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution, everyone has the right to obtain compensation for unlawful acts carried out by a public authority. The liability of the State Treasury follows from Article 417 of the Civil Code, linked as it is with the functioning of a public authority as a whole, rather than with specific persons connected to that institution, bearing in mind that responsibility arises if there is an unlawful act. Furthermore, the functioning of the public authorities should be taken, in a wider sense, as an act or omission, as specific actions, or as orders, judgments, administrative decisions, quasi-normative statutes and, finally, legislative activity. ...",
                "The fact that it was impossible for the [plaintiffs] to satisfy the entitlements they had obtained without a reduction in the greater part of their value, gives them the right to claim, on the basis of liability for a tort, compensation equal to the amounts stated in the relevant certificate.",
                "It is completely understandable that the plaintiffs, after obtaining the certificates that confirmed their entitlements as laid down in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997, did not participate in auctions organised by the [authorities], since the number of auctions of which they could have been aware was very small. However, in the context of the number of repatriated persons who were entitled to take part in auctions, any possible participation in an auction could result in their losing a significant proportion of their entitlement.",

It therefore constituted only a contingent right. Moreover, no pecuniary compensation was provided in section 212, which laid down another specific procedure for the discharge of the State's obligation. The plaintiffs could have obtained compensation only if they had proved that it had been impossible for them to obtain any compensatory property within the entire territory of Poland. In that context, the court stressed that the plaintiffs had not yet exhausted all means available under domestic legislation. They had not participated in auctions and had refused to buy the compensatory property offered to them by the authorities. Only through their active participation in the auctions could the plaintiffs have demonstrated that they had difficulty in satisfying their claim. The Court of Appeal also held that there was no basis for attributing tortious liability to the State, in particular liability for the alleged legislative inactivity.

However, it is worth noting that the Constitutional Court's judgment ... concerned, as mentioned above,'the elimination of restrictions from the system'; hence there are no grounds for adopting the position expressed in the communiqués made available to the public on the Internet. As a result, this possibility [of satisfying claims] remains illusory for the Bug River people.",

In the light of the constitutional provisions cited above, it therefore cannot constitute a source of law, since it did not come within the domestic legal order. Consequently, this agreement cannot be applied directly or relied on as a basis for the plaintiffs'claims. A similar opinion was expressed by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 19 December 2002, which has already been mentioned in connection with the findings of fact made in the present case. ...",

The basis expressed for this opinion was that, in the opinion of the Minister, the agreement had been executed inter partes, and therefore terminated, given the conclusion of the 1952 Pact with the government of the USSR. ...",
                "This opinion is erroneous for at least two reasons.",
                "To begin with, in formal terms the Vienna Convention does not provide for the possibility of terminating an agreement as a result of its execution, but rather for termination as a result of the renunciation of the agreement. ...",

But then one must ask the question why, for example, the Supreme Court in its case-law, quoted so extensively in the present case, has bothered over the last fifty years with the issue of agreements which were no longer in force? For instance, in the well - known resolution of seven Supreme Court judges of 30 May 1990 (III CZP 1/90, ...), the Supreme Court ruled not only on section 88(1) of the Land Administration and Expropriation Act 1985, which set out the right to credit, but also on the Republican Agreements of 1944, and considered the substance of Article 3 § 6 [11]. ...",
                "It can be seen from the above arguments that the executive authority, despite an application from the plaintiff to this effect, did not proceed with the publication of the Agreement with the Ukrainian SSR (at least ), despite the existence of a statutory obligation to publish ratified agreements immediately. ... To put it in precise terms, the public authority refrained from acting, despite a statutorily formulated duty to do so, and hence it acted in breach of the law (objective unlawfulness). Hence the first of the conditions of liability required by Article 417 of the Civil Code, read in conjunction with Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution, is fulfilled. ...",
                "In its findings of fact, this Court found that the plaintiffs could not satisfy their claims under the Land Administration Act 1997, since the State Treasury, as represented by the mayor, had not made it possible for the right to credit to be enjoyed, given that it had not offered any immovable property for auction, and that this situation had lasted for years. In these circumstances, as rightly pointed out by the Constitutional Court, this right had become illusory. It was also indicated that the situation had not changed at all since the Constitutional Court's judgment. ...",

But this absence is the result of an unlawful omission by the executive power, which neglected to publish the Agreement in the Journal of Laws.",
                "Given these circumstances, there is a clear and direct causal link between the unlawful omission by the public authorities and the damage suffered by the plaintiffs. This pecuniary damage consists in the fact that it is impossible for the plaintiffs to satisfy their claims through a civil action based on Article 3 § 6 of the Agreement, given that the result of such a process is prejudged at the present time (rejection of the claim, or, as in the present proceedings, an indication that such a basis is unfounded). It is certain that such proceedings cannot have a positive outcome. ...",

Neither the Agricultural Property Agency nor the Military Property Agency have complied with the Constitutional Court's judgment. Such practices make it impossible, for all practical purposes, [for the claimants] to have their right to credit realised. Of course, [in such matters as] the existence of damage and its value, the burden of proof lay on the plaintiff. Admittedly, this damage does not amount to deprivation of property rights and its value is not equal to the value of the property abandoned in Ukraine. ...",

The crucial point is, however, that previous legislative action rendered [this machinery] illusory – as the Constitutional Court has unequivocally held. This had an impact on the actual value of the [right to credit]. Indeed, the value of this right was reduced since the legislature, on the one hand, excluded from the scope of section 212 ... [certain] portions of State land and, on the other, through the application of this provision in practice ( failing to hold auctions), made it unenforceable. [I]n consequence, the right to credit could not, and still cannot, be realised.",

Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see The former King of Greece and Others v.

Moreover, it should be reiterated that the various rules incorporated in Article 1 are not distinct, in the sense of being unconnected, and that the second and third rules are concerned only with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. One of the effects of this is that the existence of a “public interest” required under the second sentence, or the “general interest” referred to in the second paragraph, are in fact corollaries of the principle set forth in the first sentence, so that an interference with the exercise of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 must also pursue an aim in the public interest (see Beyeler, cited above, § 111)."

As emerges from the material before the Court, it was a matter of common knowledge that the authorities desisted from organising auctions for the Bug River claimants, subjected their participation in auctions to various conditions or, as shown by the practices of the Military Property Agency, openly denied them the opportunity to seek to enforce their entitlement through the bidding procedure (see paragraphs 61, 84, 97 and 110 above). The practices of that agency, which were described in detail in its own official instruction and which, in the Court's opinion, constituted a purposeful attempt to circumvent the rules governing the procedure for the implementation of the applicant's entitlement, in reality prepared the ground for the next restrictive statute. The 2001 Amendment, which came into force on 1 January 2002, eliminated the possibility for the applicant to seek compensation from among the State's military property resources (see paragraphs 58-59 above)."

In that context, it also found that that conduct of the authorities was incompatible with the constitutional principle of maintaining citizens'confidence in the State and the law made by it, ensuing from the rule of law.",

Both communiqués were worded similarly and announced that the agencies had suspended all auctions for the sale of State property because, allegedly, they could not be held before numerous amendments to the legislation had been introduced (see paragraphs 30-32 above ). This policy resulted in the effective suspension of the execution of the judgment because the provisions restoring State agricultural and military property to the pool of property available to the Bug River people could not be implemented in practice. It was strongly condemned by the judicial authorities, most notably the Supreme Court, which deemed such acts to amount to constitutional torts.

The choice of measures may necessarily involve decisions restricting compensation for the taking or restitution of property to a level below its market value.

In the context of the present case, it was incumbent on the Polish authorities to remove the existing incompatibility between the letter of the law and the State-operated practice which hindered the effective exercise of the applicant's right of property.

Moreover, this legislation operated a difference of treatment between Bug River claimants in so far as those who had never received any compensation were awarded an amount which, although subject to a ceiling of PLN 50,000, was a specified proportion (15%) of their entitlement, whereas claimants in the applicant's position, who had already been awarded a much lower percentage, received no additional amount (see paragraphs 115 and 118-19 above).",

This applies particularly to situations in which the compensatory entitlement does not arise from any previous taking of individual property by the respondent State, but is designed to mitigate the effects of a taking or loss of property not attributable to that State. What Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 requires is that the amount of compensation granted for property taken by the State be “reasonably related” to its value (see paragraph 176 above). It is not for the Court to say in the abstract what would be a “reasonable” level of compensation in the present case.

That interference had not been disproportionate either, even though the market value forming the basis for setting the inheritance tax had been increased from FIM 150,000 – the estimate reported in the inventory of the estate – to FIM 600,000. Nor could it be deduced from that increase that the compensation fixed in the expropriation proceedings had been too small. The market value for taxation purposes had taken into account Mr Jokela's 1989 purchase of a third of the property for FIM 300,000 as well as his 1990 sale of 4,000 sq. m for FIM 450,000 (which, according to the Government's calculations, corresponded to a price of FIM 28 and FIM 112 per square metre respectively)."

To the Government, it was evident from the relevant provisions of domestic law that the market value of inherited real property was not determined in the same way as the market value of expropriated property. Under the tax legislation the value of real property always took account of buildings thereon, of the purpose for which the property had been designated in local or regional plans, and of any existing building rights. In the present case the assessment of the inheritance tax had thus taken into account the building right existing in respect of part of the inherited – but not expropriated – land. Apart from compensation for the expropriated land, Mr Jokela had been awarded a further FIM 700,000 (about 118,000 euros) in compensation for the buildings, the equipment and the vegetation removed from that area. Moreover, the market value of the land in question had been assessed at different times and the property in respect of which inheritance tax had been levied had not been identical with the expropriated land."

True, those records had shown that the price of both forest and agricultural land, as well as of planned real property, had clearly decreased between 1989 and 1993. Nevertheless, the starting-point when determining the market value of the expropriated land had to be the price level in the autumn of 1990, when the Roads Authority had taken over the land in question. Domestic practice likewise spelled out the principle of basing the market value on the reference prices dating back to the time of the initial interference with the property. Any domestic law or practice to the contrary would in itself be in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1: if the compensation were not based on the price level at the time when the property had been interfered with, the property owner's right to compensation would depend solely on the efficiency of the authorities in processing the matter."

The expropriated part had amounted to approximately half of the latter area and the two areas had not differed from one another from the point of view of applicable planning regulations. A building plan had been in force on both of them, allowing construction on up to 20% of the overall area. In these circumstances, the market value of the expropriated area should have amounted to about half of the market value arrived at in the assessment of the inheritance tax. The compensation for removed buildings could have no bearing on the determination of the market value of the expropriated land as such, given that the inheritance tax had likewise been based on an estimation of the market value of the land only."

The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The three rules are not “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, for example, Fredin v.

It followed that they should have been entitled to compensation in the amount of FIM 624,375 (EUR 105,012), whereas they had received only FIM 124,875 (EUR 21,002).

Without such a reduction the amount of the tax would have been FIM 217,500.

The prices of each type of real property had been surveyed; on the basis of this survey, the likely market value of the land in question had been established, which had then constituted the ground for the decision on compensation. The Government noted that the price statistics which the applicants had obtained from the National Surveying Board illustrated the development in the price of forests, agricultural land and detached-house properties between 1985 and 1994 and were similar to those presented by the Government. The statistics relied on by the Government were nevertheless based on a larger number of sales of the main types of real property, and therefore gave a more precise picture of the general development of prices than the records relied on by the applicants, which illustrated the development in the prices of certain types of real property. The Government furthermore contended that the prices per square metre in the documents submitted by the applicants in no respect illustrated the price of the land subject to dispute, and no conclusions as to the market value of the land in question could therefore be made on the basis of those records."

Were the Court to find a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Government therefore considered that the applicants Heidi, Jussi and Petri Jokela should be awarded appropriate compensation for the pecuniary damage suffered as a result of the overvaluation of the property subject to inheritance tax."

Should the basis of the assessment of the market value of that property be FIM 7.50 per square metre, it was the Government's view that the total price of that property had amounted to approximately FIM 200,000. The loss suffered by Heidi, Jussi and Petri Jokela would have corresponded to the difference between the inheritance tax calculated on the basis of the amounts given above, and the tax imposed would have been FIM 8,125 less in respect of each of those applicants. In addition, if the reference point to be used was the market value of FIM 7.50 per square metre, changes in the total value of the land in respect of which inheritance tax was levied could have affected the inheritance tax rate and thereby the amount of loss sustained. Moreover, a smaller inheritance tax had the effect of increasing the possible tax on capital gains. Therefore, the actual loss which each of the three applicants might have incurred as a result of the excessively high inheritance tax would have amounted to about FIM 8,000."

As the lack of sufficient explanations for the estimation of the value of the property at a prima facie high level in the inheritance tax proceedings was the principal reason for the finding of the violation, the Court accepts that Heidi, Jussi and Petri Jokela have suffered pecuniary damage in the form of excessive inheritance tax. In these circumstances there is, for the purposes of Article 41, also a sufficient causal link between the violation and the pecuniary damage suffered. On the other hand, the Court cannot speculate as to the exact amount of the pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants.

                "“Alleged contraventions of registration procedures do not appear to justify a decision to put a stop to the functioning of a commercial company. ... We urge Moldtelecom and the relevant authorities to reconsider this question. This seems all the more important in view of the commitment of the public authorities of Moldova to European norms and values.”",

When ANRTI finds such non-compliance, it warns the licence beneficiary and gives it a deadline for remedying the problem. If the problem is not remedied within that period, ANRTI may suspend the licence for a period of three months."

According to it, the invalidation of the licences had had extremely serious consequences which had finally resulted in the closure of its business. Moreover, the applicant company had started to be persecuted by the CFECC and the Tax Authorities. Due to the concerted efforts of the State authorities and Moldtelecom, all the companies from the Megadat.com group had been prevented from taking over the business and all of the clients were abusively taken from it by Moldtelecom. As a result of that, the goodwill and the value of the applicant company had suffered serious repercussions."

However, that had been a very minor breach which had not had any adverse consequences.

The applicant company disputed the Government ’ s submission that its situation was different from that of the ninety other companies (see paragraph 59 below) and argued that while ANRTI did not specify in the minutes of its meetings the precise irregularities committed by each company in the list of ninety-one companies, it was clear that at least two of those companies had their licences suspended on 21 October 2003 on account of their failure to present information about the change of their addresses.

Secondly, the Government had not submitted any information to show whether it had been warned in the same manner as Megadat.com SRL and whether it had been given a ten - day time - limit with which it had complied.

However, they expressed the view that nobody had withdrawn the applicant company ’ s licences; rather the licences had become invalid by the effect of the law a long time before 6 October 2003. According to them, the licences would have become invalid without ANRTI ’ s involvement, at the moment when the ten - day time - limit provided for by section 3.5.2 of the Regulations had expired, that is, some ten or eleven months before the decision of 6 October 2003.",

Section 3.5.7 of the ANRTI Regulations was designed in the general interest to contribute to the reduction and elimination of violations of the law by companies operating in the field of Internet services.

                "64. The Government did not expressly argue that there was no interference with the applicant company ’ s possessions; however, they submitted that ANRTI ’ s decision was a mere finding of a fact which had come into existence long before and emphasised the distinction between withdrawal and invalidation of licences (see paragraph 55 above). In so far as these submissions are to be interpreted as meaning that ANRTI ’ s decision of 6 October 2003 did not interfere with the possessions of the applicant company for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court is unable to accept this view. The Court notes in the first place that before 6 October 2003 the applicant company had been operating unhindered. Moreover, it is clear from the parties ’ submissions that ANRTI was well aware long before 6 October 2003 of the applicant company ’ s failure to request a modification of the address in the text of its licences. ANRTI was informed by the applicant company about the change of address in May 2003 (see paragraph 10 above) and the latter even requested a new licence with the new address in it. For unknown reasons, ANRTI did not consider it necessary to invalidate the applicant company ’ s existing licences at that time and even issued it with a new one. Moreover, the Government implicitly admitted that ANRTI was well aware of the situation by submitting that in July 2003 it had drawn the applicant company ’ s attention to the irregularity and urged it to remedy it (see paragraph 55 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot but note that ANRTI ’ s decision of 6 October 2003 had the immediate and intended effect of preventing the applicant company from continuing to operate its business and of terminating its existing licences. The fact that the domestic authorities decided to attribute retroactive effect to ANRTI ’ s decision of 6 October 2003 does not change that. Accordingly, the Court considers that ANRTI ’ s decision of 6 October 2003 had an effect identical to a termination of valid licences and thus constituted an interference with the applicant company ’ s right to the peaceful enjoyment of its possessions for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Without underestimating the importance of State control in the field of Internet communications, the Court cannot but note that the Government were only able to cite theoretical and abstract negative consequences of the applicant company ’ s failure to comply with the procedural requirement. They could not indicate any concrete detriment caused by the applicant company ’ s omission to have its address modified in the text of its licences. Indeed, it is common ground that ANRTI was well aware of the applicant company ’ s change of address and it had no difficulty in contacting Megadat.com SRL on 24 September 2003 (see paragraph 12 above). Moreover, it is similarly undisputed that the applicant company kept its old address and any attempt to contact it at that address would have certainly been successful. Immediately after changing its address, the applicant company informed the State Registration Chamber and the Tax Authorities (see paragraph 9 above). Accordingly, the applicant company could not be suspected of any intention to evade taxation in connection with its failure to notify its change of address to ANRTI. Nor had it been shown that any of the applicant company ’ s clients had problems in contacting the company due to the change of address. It is also important to note that the applicant company did in fact inform ANRTI about its change of address in May 2003 and even requested a third licence using its new address. For reasons which ANRTI did not spell out at the time, the new licence was issued with the old address on it."

Against this background, the Court notes that the measure applied to the applicant company was of such severity that the company, which used to be the largest Internet service provider in Moldova, had to wind up its business and sell all of its assets within months. Not only did the measure have consequences for the future, but it was also applied retroactively, thus prompting sanctions and investigations by various State authorities, such as the Tax Authorities and the CFECC (see paragraph 32 above)."

It points out that ANRTI had been apprised of the change of address in May 2003, at the time of the applicant company ’ s application for a third licence. Without giving reasons, ANRTI failed to take note of the change of address and issued the applicant company with a new licence indicating the old address in it. Had ANRTI considered that the defect in the licence was a matter of public concern, it could have intervened at that stage. However, it failed to do so."

The Court further notes that in ANRTI ’ s letter of 17 September 2003 the applicant company was clearly led to believe that it could continue to operate provided it complied with the instructions contained therein within ten days. In these circumstances it can only be concluded that the applicant company, by submitting an application for the amendment of its licences within the time-limit, could reasonably expect that it would not incur any prejudice. Despite the encouragement given by it to the applicant company, ANRTI invalidated the applicant company ’ s licences on 6 October 2003 (see, mutatis mutandis, Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v.

Procedural safeguards also appear to have failed at the stage of the court proceedings. While the case was not one which required special expediency under the domestic law, the Court of Appeal appears to have acted with particular diligence in that respect. After setting the date of the first hearing, the Court of Appeal acceded to ANRTI ’ s request to speed up the proceedings and advanced the hearing by two weeks (see paragraph 21 above). Not only did the Court of Appeal decide the case in the applicant company ’ s absence, but it failed to provide reasons for dismissing the latter ’ s request for adjournment.

The examination carried out by the courts appears to have been very formalistic and limited to ascertaining whether the applicant company had failed to inform ANRTI about the change of its address. No balancing exercise appears to have been carried out between the general issue at stake and the sanction applied to the applicant company."

Firstly, they argued that the other ninety companies concerned had committed other, less serious irregularities, such as, inter alia, failure to present to ANRTI annual reports (see paragraph 59 above).

The minutes do not contain reference to irregularities such as failure to present annual reports. Moreover, this submission was made for the first time by the Government in the proceedings before the Court, and must therefore be treated with caution, especially in the absence of any form of substantiation ( see, mutatis mutandis, Sarban v.

By refusing to comply with those legal requirements, the court had breached the law.

However, the court found that it was only possible to determine the exact amount of remuneration to be paid at the end of the proceedings. The reason for this was that the Remuneration Ordinance provided for a lower amount in case of termination of the criminal proceedings by way of a plea bargain (see paragraph 2 8 below). The court could not predict the outcome of the proceedings at their outset. Therefore, the applicant ’ s insistence on a prior determination of his fee was contrary to section 44 of the Bar Act. The applicant had thus caused an unjustified adjournment and had rightly been fined under Article 269 § 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The Court notes that whether the applicant has suffered any significant disadvantage represents the main element of the criterion set forth in Article 35 § 3(b) of the Convention (see Adrian Mihai Ionescu v. Romania (dec.), no. 36659/04, 1 June 2010; see also Korolev v. Russia (dec.), no. 25551/05, 1 July 2010). Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this admissibility criterion rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant ’ s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev, cited above). In other words, the absence of any significant disadvantage can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant (see Adrian Mihai Ionescu, cited above). The Court observes in this connection that it has previously considered the pecuniary loss of some EUR 90 allegedly sustained by the applicant in the case of Adrian Mihai Ionescu (cited above) as not attaining the required level of significance. It has also assessed as negligible a pecuniary loss of some EUR 0.5 allegedly sustained by the applicant in the case of Korolev, cited above."

In respect of the Government ’ s position that the applicant in the present case had not suffered a significant disadvantage as the fine ’ s size was negligible, the Court notes the following. The applicant was fined approximately EUR 260 by the domestic courts in the context of a criminal case to which he had been assigned to act as defence counsel for one of the accused. Neither party submitted information about the applicant ’ s financial situation. The Court observes that, according to a study commissioned by the European Observatory of Working Life (a European Union agency), the minimum monthly salary in Bulgaria at the time of the facts was equivalent to about EUR 61. Even assuming that the applicant was a freelance lawyer whose earnings were not pegged to the minimum salary level, the Court considers the above information indicative of the general standard of living in the country at the time and, as such, of relevance."

The Court also notes that the fine, which is the subject of the complaint before it, was imposed on the applicant as a pecuniary sanction, or a penalty for what the domestic court considered was his disrespectful conduct during the case proceedings. Therefore, in addition to and apart from the applicant ’ s pecuniary interest in not having been fined, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that the issue of whether he had been fined lawfully concerned a question of principle for him, which was that of respect for his position as a lawyer in the exercise of his professional activities."

The fine imposed on the applicant had been lawful, given that he had been a court ‑ appointed defence counsel at the time but had been absent from the hearing. The fine had also been proportionate to his conduct, given that it was a disciplinary punishment for unethical conduct and lack of respect displayed by the applicant towards the court.

The applicant argued that, as the court had failed to indicate the fee to be paid to him in the decision appointing him counsel, the court had not acted lawfully; therefore he had effectively not been appointed counsel before he was fined. He further pointed out that he had not failed to appear at the hearing; he had in fact turned up prepared to act for the defence and had only subsequently left because of the court ’ s unlawful refusal to guarantee a fee of no less than the legal minimum.

The first rule, expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of one ’ s “possessions”. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third rule, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that States are entitled to, among other things, control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The Court has repeatedly held that the second and third rules must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, Grifhorst v. France, no. 28336/02, §§ 81-83, 26 February 2009 )."

In particular, the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, while recognising that States have the right to control the use of property, subjects their right to the condition that it be exercised by enforcing “laws”. Moreover, the principle of lawfulness presupposes that the applicable provisions of domestic law are sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application (see, mutatis mutandis, Frizen v. Russia, no. 58254/00, § 33, 24 March 2005 )."

Italy (dec.), no. 70074/01, 21 March 2006 ). Consequently, a financial liability arising out of a fine may undermine the guarantee afforded by that provision if it places an excessive burden on the person or fundamentally interferes with his or her financial position (see Valico S.r.l., cited above ). The fair balance requires procedural guarantees to establish the applicant ’ s liability whereby the applicant is afforded an adequate opportunity to put his or her case to the responsible authorities in order to plead, as the case might be, illegality or arbitrary and unreasonable conduct (see Yildirim v.

This was something explicitly required by national law at the time. As the applicant had not been duly appointed counsel in the proceedings, in accordance with the applicable legal requirements, he could not have been fined for failing to appear and thus obstructing the judicial proceedings. The Government insisted that the applicant had been appointed counsel by the court before it fined him on the basis of Article 269 of the CCP and, therefore, that the fine was lawful."

The dispute was about the time when legal fees of ex officio lawyers should be determined by the courts, as well as their amount. Section 44(2) of the Bar Act, applicable at the time, stipulated that the court had to indicate the amount of legal fee to be paid to counsel in the decision with which the court appointed that counsel to act in the proceedings. This was also explicitly confirmed by the domestic court before which the applicant appealed the disputed fine.

It is eventually for the national courts to determine the lawfulness under national law of an impugned interference the Court ’ s role in that respect being limited. The Court further notes that conflicting legal provisions are an inevitable part of any legal system and that the purpose of the requirement of lawfulness, and consequently of clarity and foreseeability of the domestic law, is there to allow everyone to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the particular circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 ‑ III ). Domestic legislation could not in any case provide for every eventuality and the level of precision required depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see Hashman and Harrup v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 25594/94, § 31, ECHR 1999 ‑ VIII )."

Taking into account those principles and the circumstances of the present case, the Court is not convinced, despite the apparent conflict between different provisions of domestic legislation, that the impugned fine was based on law that failed to meet Convention standards. It is of particular importance in the present case that the fine was imposed on a professional lawyer, by a trial court before which he was appearing in his professional capacity. Under those circumstances the applicant must have been fully aware of the ultimate responsibility of the judge presiding the judicial proceedings for their proper conduct. The applicant was instructed in no unclear terms by the domestic court that he was appointed as defense counsel, before he was fined for choosing to leave the court hearing. The domestic court fined the applicant specifically referring to a legal provision which was part of the Criminal Procedure Code, vesting ultimate authority for the proper administration of the proceedings in the judge. Given that the applicant was a lawyer, both this basic principle and the content and meaning of the particular provision of the CPC should have been sufficiently clear to him and the consequences of its application foreseeable. Any dispute about the remuneration of the applicant as an ex officio counsel could not have been expected to take precedence over the proper conduct of the judicial proceedings and those judicial proceedings could not have been expected to be the forum where such a dispute should be resolved."

However, the rules are not \"distinct\" in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property.

One has, however, to bear in mind that, over the years, the exploitation of gravel had become more and more regulated and, in fact, restricted (see paragraphs 10 and 32-35 above). Thus, the amendment introduced on 1 July 1973 to the 1964 Act (see paragraph 35 above) empowered the authorities to revoke, without compensation, old permits, such as the applicants ’, after ten years had passed, that is after 1 July 1983.

The first applicant company acquired the land by a series of transactions between 1975 and 1977 and owned it until April 1986, when it transferred the land to the second applicant company subject to an option to repurchase. The owners of a property adjacent to the land, Mr and Mrs Graham (“the Grahams”) occupied the land under a grazing agreement until 31 December 1983. On 30 December 1983 a chartered surveyor acting for the applicant companies wrote to the Grahams noting that the grazing agreement was about to expire and requiring them to vacate the land. In January 1984 the applicant companies refused a request for a further grazing agreement for 1984 because they anticipated seeking planning permission for the development of all or part of the land and considered that continued grazing might damage the prospects of obtaining such permission."

At the conclusion of his thirty -page judgment, Neuberger J remarked that the result he had reached did not accord with justice and could not be justified by practical considerations: the justification advanced for the right to acquire title to land by adverse possession – namely the avoidance of uncertainty – had in his view little relevance to the use of registered land where the owner was readily identifiable by inspecting the register of the relevant title at the Land Registry.

Although this conclusion was sufficient to dispose of the appeal, two members of the Court of Appeal went on to address the question whether the applicant companies ’ loss of title to the land could also have given rise to a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as applied in domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998."

The extinction of the applicant companies ’ title was not, in his view, a deprivation of possessions nor a confiscatory measure for which payment of compensation would be appropriate, but simply a logical and pragmatic consequence of the barring of the right to bring an action after the expiration of the limitation period. In the alternative, Mummery LJ found that any deprivation was justified in the public interest, the conditions laid down in the 1980 Act being reasonably required to avoid the risk of injustice in the adjudication of stale claims and as ensuring certainty of title: those conditions were not disproportionate, the period of twelve years being reasonable and not imposing an excessively difficult burden on the landowner."

Lord Browne-Wilkinson, with whom Lord Mackay of Clashfern and Lord Hutton agreed, held that the Grahams did have “possession” of the land in the ordinary sense of the word, and therefore the applicant companies had been “dispossessed” of it within the meaning of the 1980 Act. There was no inconsistency between a squatter being willing to pay the paper owner if asked and his being in possession in the meantime. Concluding, Lord Browne-Wilkinson held as follows:",

Despite Pye ’ s notification to quit the land in December 1983, its peremptory refusal of a further grazing licence in 1984 and the totally ignored later requests for a grazing licence, after 31 December 1983 the Grahams stayed in occupation of the disputed land using it for what purposes they thought fit. Some of those purposes (i. e ., the grazing) would have fallen within a hypothetical grazing agreement. But the rest are only consistent with an intention, verified by Mr Michael Graham, to use the land as they thought best. That approach was adopted from the outset. In my judgment, when the Grahams remained in factual possession of the fully enclosed land after the expiry of the mowing licence they manifestly intended to assert their possession against Pye.",

But Pye submitted that, even under the common- law principles of construction applicable before the Human Rights Act came into effect, the court should seek to apply the law so as to make it consistent with the [Convention]. Any such old principle of construction only applied where there was an ambiguity in the language of a statute. No such ambiguity in the Act of 1980 was demonstrated to your Lordships.”"

When Pye failed to respond they did what any other farmer in their position would have done: they continued to farm the land. They were not at fault. But the result of Pye ’ s inaction was that they enjoyed the full use of the land without payment for 12 years. As if that were not gain enough, they are then rewarded by obtaining title to this considerable area of valuable land without any obligation to compensate the former owner in any way at all. In the case of unregistered land, and in the days before registration became the norm, such a result could no doubt be justified as avoiding protracted uncertainty where the title to land lay. But where land is registered it is difficult to see any justification for a legal rule which compels such an apparently unjust result, and even harder to see why the party gaining title should not be required to pay some compensation at least to the party losing it. It is reassuring to learn that the Land Registration Act 2002 has addressed the risk that a registered owner may lose his title through inadvertence. But the main provisions of that Act have not yet been brought into effect, and even if they had it would not assist Pye, whose title had been lost before the passing of the Act. While I am satisfied that the appeal must be allowed for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend, this is a conclusion which I (like the judge [Neuberger J] ...) ‘ arrive at with no enthusiasm ’ .” ( JA Pye ( Oxford ) Ltd and Others v.

Fortunately ... a much more rigorous regime has now been enacted in Schedule 6 to the Land Registration Act 2002. Its effect will be to make it much harder for a squatter who is in possession of registered land to obtain a title to it against the wishes of the proprietor.

One example given was the position of the rights of adverse possessors (section 75(1) of the Land Registration Act 1925 was referred to). The Consultative Document set out and commented on four particularly cogent reasons often given for the law on adverse possession:",

However, adverse possession does not merely bar claims. Its effect is positive: ‘ a squatter does in the end get a title by his possession and the indirect operation of the [ Limitation Act ]. .. ’ This can only be justified by factors over and above those which explain the law on limitation. In this context it should be noted that a landowner may be barred even where he or she is quite blameless. As we have explained above, adverse possession can take place without it being readily detectable. In any event, this particular justification has much greater force in relation to unregistered land than it does for land with registered title. Unregistered title ultimately depends upon possession. It therefore behoves a landowner to be vigilant to protect that possession and not to sleep on his or her rights. ... [ w ] here title is registered, ... the basis of title is primarily the fact of registration rather than possession. Registration confers title because the registration of a person as proprietor of land of itself vests in him or her the relevant legal estate ...”",
                "(ii) Because if land and its ownership are out of kilter, the land may become unmarketable. Where the registered owner has disappeared, and cannot be traced, and a squatter takes possession, the doctrine of adverse possession “does at least ensure that in such cases land remains in commerce and is not rendered sterile”. Where there have been dealings “off the register”, such as where a farmer agrees to a land swap with a neighbour under a “gentleman ’ s agreement” but does not register the change, “adverse possession fulfils a useful function”.",
                "(iii) Because in case of mistake the innocent but mistaken squatter of land may have incurred expenditure. In such circumstances adverse possession can be justified on grounds of hardship, and there are parallels with the principles of proprietary estoppel.",
                "(iv) Because it facilitates and cheapens investigation of title to land.

As a result of the various criticisms, including those made by a number of the judges in the present case and the Report on registered land (Law Com No. 271), the Land Registration Act 2002 made a number of changes to the law as it related to registered land. It provided that adverse possession, for however long, would not of itself bar the owner ’ s title to a registered estate. A squatter was entitled to apply to be registered as proprietor after ten years, and would be so registered if application was not opposed. If the application was opposed, it would be refused. If the application was refused but no steps were taken to evict the squatter or otherwise regulate the position, he was entitled to apply again to be registered as proprietor, and would be so registered whether or not the application was opposed. The 2002 Act came into force on 13 October 2002."

The case concerned a licensee who had remained in possession of registered land for over twelve years after the expiry of his licence. Applying the judgment of the House of Lords in the present case, the judge found that under English law as it stood up to the entry into force of the Human Rights Act 1998 the registered owner of the land lost all claim to it. However, on analysing the facts on a Convention basis, he found that there was no real public or general interest in the law on adverse possession in the case of registered land, and that the adverse consequences for the landowner were disproportionate. By reinterpreting the relevant legislation in accordance with section 3 of the Human Rights Act, the judge found that the claim by the former licensee to have acquired the disputed land failed.",

In particular, the pre-existing rules on adverse possession could not be said to be an incident of the applicant companies ’ property right at the time of its acquisition such that Article 1 ceased to be engaged when the relevant provisions took effect and the property right was lost after twelve years ’ adverse possession. Further, the mere fact that limitation periods were generally considered under Article 6 of the Convention did not prevent the Court from considering a case from the angle of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

Whilst accepting that in the case of unregistered land the law of adverse possession served two important public interests – namely the prevention of uncertainty and injustice arising from stale claims, and ensuring that the reality of unopposed occupation of land and its legal ownership coincided – the Chamber considered that the importance of these aims was more questionable in the case of registered land where the ownership of the land was readily identifiable by inspecting the proprietorship register of the relevant title at the Land Registry. However, the Chamber noted that, despite the major changes to the law of adverse possession made by the Land Registration Act 2002 (“the 2002 Act”), in the case of registered land the law itself had not been abolished, and it rejected the applicant companies ’ argument that it served no continuing public interest so far as registered land was concerned.

As to the proportionality of the provisions in issue, the Chamber accepted that the limitation period of twelve years was relatively long, that the law of adverse possession was well established and had not changed during the applicant companies ’ period of ownership, and that limited steps taken by the applicant companies would have avoided the loss of title. The Chamber noted criticism of the state of the law by the domestic courts and the Law Commission, and further noted that the result for the applicant companies was one of exceptional severity in that not only were they deprived of their property but they received no compensation for their loss. The lack of compensation had to be viewed in the light of the lack of procedural protection for the right of property within the legal system in force at the relevant time. In this respect the Chamber attached weight to the fact that since the present case the law had been amended to provide for notice to be given to a paper owner before title is transferred, thereby giving the paper owner an opportunity to stop the running of the limitation period. The Chamber saw the changes in the law as an indication that Parliament had recognised the deficiencies in the procedural position of registered landowners before the 2002 Act. The Chamber concluded that the fair balance between the public interest and the applicant companies ’ right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions had been upset, such that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Firstly, they saw no justification for the applicant companies, as owners of the land, to lose their right to ownership of the registered land. Secondly, they saw no justification for depriving them of the land without having to pay any compensation. The result was disproportionate to any legitimate aim as it imposed an excessive burden on the applicant companies and constituted a substantial windfall for the squatters. There were no exceptional circumstances which justified the taking of property without compensation. Thirdly, there was no justification for depriving them of their land when there was no procedural protection providing that the person in adverse possession only acquired title if he or she first stated a claim to which the formal title owner had an opportunity to respond."

They considered, in the first place, that the matter should be determined by reference to Article 6 of the Convention and not Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Unlike in previous cases, the Government in this case had not appropriated property to its own use, and had not introduced legislation for the involuntary transfer of private property from one person to another in pursuit of a social- policy objective. The only interference with the applicant companies ’ land came about through the actions of private individuals, the squatters, who obtained adverse possession in 1983- 8 4. The outcome of the proceedings was dictated by the applicant companies ’ own inaction. They contended that the application to the present facts of the conventional case-law as to the necessity, in principle, for compensation to be paid in respect of deprivations of property confirmed the logic of analysing the case by reference to Article 6: the purpose of a limitation period is to deprive a claimant, at the end of the relevant time period, of any opportunity of enforcing his rights through the courts. That objective would be frustrated if a limitation provision could only be compatible with the Convention if the claimant was provided with compensation against the very person against whom his claim was barred."

That risk had to be viewed as an incident of their property. They pointed out that the second applicant company had acquired the land from the first applicant company in April 1 986, at which time the Grahams had been in adverse possession for some one and a half years.

The relevant rules reflect social policies against the background of the local conception of the importance and role of property. Even where title to real property is registered, it must be open to the legislature to attach more weight to lengthy, unchallenged possession than to the formal fact of registration. The Court accepts that to extinguish title where the former owner is prevented, as a consequence of the application of the law, from recovering possession of land cannot be said to be manifestly without reasonable foundation. There existed therefore a general interest in both the limitation period itself and the extinguishment of title at the end of the period.",

                "75. The second paragraph of Article 1 is to be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the opening sentence. There must, in respect of a “control of use”, also exist a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. In other words, the Court must determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest and the interest of the individuals concerned. In determining whether a fair balance exists, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation, with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see AGOSI, cited above, § 52, and, for a more recent authority concerning a deprivation of possessions, Jahn and Others, cited above, § 93 ). In spheres such as housing, the Court will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation ( see Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, § 49, ECHR 1999- V ). In other contexts, the Court has underlined that it is not in theory required to settle disputes of a private nature. It can nevertheless not remain passive, in exercising the European supervision incumbent on it, where a domestic court ’ s interpretation of a legal act appeared “unreasonable, arbitrary or ... inconsistent ... with the principles underlying the Convention ” ( see Pla and Puncernau v. Andorra, no. 69498/01, § 59, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII ). When discussing the proportionality of a refusal of a private television company to broadcast a television commercial, the Court considered that a margin of appreciation was particularly essential in commercial matters ( see VgT Verein gegen Tierfabriken v. Switzerland, no. 24699/94, § 69, ECHR 2001 ‑ VI ). In a case concerning a dispute over the interpretation of patent law, and at the same time as noting that even in cases involving litigation between individuals and companies the State has obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to take measures necessary to protect the right of property, the Court reiterated that its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention, and not to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless Convention rights and freedoms may have been infringed ( see Anheuser-Busch Inc., cited above, § 83)."

The Chamber (at paragraph 55 of its judgment) found that the relevant provisions – section 75 of the 1925 Act in particular – went further than merely precluding the applicant companies from invoking the assistance of the courts to recover possession of their property. The Court observes that the Court of Appeal in the present case was of the view that the Grahams had not established the requisite intention to possess the land, so that time had not started to run against the applicant companies ( see paragraph 17 above). It nevertheless considered that the extinguishment of title at the end of the limitation period of an action for recovery of land was a logical and pragmatic consequence of the barring of the right to bring an action after the expiration of the limitation period. The House of Lords disavowed the Court of Appeal ’ s interpretation of the law on intention to possess, but did not comment on the suggestion that to terminate title at the end of the limitation period was “logical and pragmatic”. Even though the general position in English law is that the expiry of a limitation period bars the remedy but not the right, the Court accepts that where an action for recovery of land is statute-barred, termination of the title of the paper owner does little more than regularise the respective positions, namely to confirm that the person who has acquired title by twelve years ’ adverse possession is the owner. Moreover, the law reflected the aim of the land registration legislation, which was to replicate the preregistration law so far as practicable. As already noted above ( see paragraph 74 ), such a regime cannot be considered as “manifestly without reasonable foundation”."

The Court has rejected the Government ’ s contention that the pre-existing nature of the regime of adverse possession excluded the facts of the case from consideration under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 ( see paragraphs 62 and 63 above). The fact that the rules contained in both the 1925 and 1980 Acts had been in force for many years before the first applicant even acquired the land is nevertheless relevant to an assessment of the overall proportionality of the legislation. In particular, it is not open to the applicant companies to say that they were not aware of the legislation, or that its application to the facts of the present case came as a surprise to them. Indeed, although the case proceeded domestically as far as the House of Lords, the applicant companies do not suggest that the conclusions of the domestic courts were unreasonable or unforeseeable, in the light of the legislation."

It has been unable, however, to derive any assistance from the comparative material submitted by the parties in this connection, beyond noting that there is no clear pattern as regards the length of limitation periods. It is in any event the case that very little action on the part of the applicant companies would have stopped time running. The evidence was that if the applicant companies had asked for rent, or some other form of payment, in respect of the Grahams ’ occupation of the land, it would have been forthcoming, and the possession would no longer have been “adverse”. Even in the unlikely event that the Grahams had refused to leave and refused to agree to conditions for their occupation, the applicant companies need only have commenced an action for recovery, and time would have stopped running against them."

                "79. The Chamber and the applicant companies emphasised the absence of compensation for what they both perceived as a deprivation of the applicant companies ’ possessions. The Court has found that the interference with the applicant companies ’ possessions was a control of use, rather than a deprivation of possessions, such that the case-law on compensation for deprivations is not directly applicable. Further, in the cases in which a situation was analysed as a control of use, even though the applicant had lost possessions ( see AGOSI and Air Canada, both cited above), no mention was made of a right to compensation. The Court would note, in agreement with the Government, that a requirement of compensation for the situation brought about by a party failing to observe a limitation period would sit uneasily alongside the very concept of limitation periods, whose aim is to further legal certainty by preventing a party from pursuing an action after a certain date. The Court would also add that, even under the provisions of the 2002 Act, which the applicant companies use as confirmation that the provisions of the earlier legislation were not compatible with the Convention, no compensation is payable by a person who is ultimately registered as the new owner of registered land on expiry of the limitation period."

The Chamber and the applicant companies were also exercised by the absence of procedural protection for a paper owner whose property rights are about to be extinguished by the running of the limitation period under section 15 of the 1980 Act, at least in so far as it applied to registered land. The Court would note here that the applicant companies were not without procedural protection. While the limitation period was running, and if they failed to agree terms with the Grahams which put an end to the “adverse possession”, it was open to them to remedy the position by bringing a court action for repossession of the land. Such an action would have stopped time running. After expiry of the period, it remained open to the applicant companies to argue before the domestic courts, as they did, that the occupiers of their land had not been in “adverse possession” as defined by domestic law."

It is true that since the entry into force of the Land Registration Act 2002, the paper owner of registered land against whom time has been running is in a better position than were the applicant companies at the relevant time. The 2002 Act requires, in effect, the giving of notice to a paper owner before the expiry of the limitation period, to give him time, if he wishes, to take action to deal with the adverse possessor. It improves the position of the paper owner and, correspondingly, makes it more difficult for an adverse possessor to acquire a full twelve years ’ adverse possession. The provisions of the 2002 Act do not, however, apply to the present case, and the Court must consider the facts of the case as they are. In any event, legislative changes in complex areas such as land law take time to bring about, and judicial criticism of legislation cannot of itself affect the conformity of the earlier provisions with the Convention."

In a case such as the present, where the Court is considering, principally, the statutory regime by which title is extinguished at the end of the limitation period, rather than the specific facts of the case, the relevance of the individual applicant ’ s conduct is correspondingly restricted."

The Court would first note that, in James and Others, it found that the view taken by Parliament as to the tenants ’ “moral entitlement” to ownership of the houses in issue fell within the State ’ s margin of appreciation. In the present case, too, whilst it would be strained to talk of the “acquired rights” of an adverse possessor during the currency of the limitation period, it must be recalled that the registered land regime in the United Kingdom is a reflection of a long-established system in which a term of years ’ possession gave sufficient title to sell. Such arrangements fall within the State ’ s margin of appreciation, unless they give rise to results which are so anomalous as to render the legislation unacceptable. The acquisition of unassailable rights by the adverse possessor must go hand in hand with a corresponding loss of property rights for the former owner. In James and Others, the possibility of “undeserving” tenants being able to make “windfall profits” did not affect the overall assessment of the proportionality of the legislation ( see James and Others, cited above, § 69), and any windfall for the Grahams must be regarded in the same light in the present case."

In these circumstances, and having regard to the State ’ s margin of appreciation, the Court accepts that the deprivation of property experienced by the applicant served not only the interests of the original owners of the land in question, but also the general interests of society as a whole (see Bečvář and Bečvářová v. the Czech Republic, no. 58358/00, § 67, 14 December 2004, and Padalevičius, cited above, § 65 )."

Situated on a slope overlooking a valley, the site spread out over a surface area of approximately 35 hectares and from 1972 onwards was used as a rubbish tip by the districts of Beykoz, Üsküdar, Kadıköy and Ümraniye under the authority and responsibility of the city council and, ultimately, the ministerial authorities.",

Methane (CH 4 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) are the two main products of methanogenesis, which is the final and longest stage of anaerobic fermentation (that is, a process taking place in the absence of air). These substances are generated, inter alia, by the biological and chemical decomposition of waste. The risks of explosion and fire are mainly due to the large proportion of methane in the biogas. The risk of an explosion occurs when the level of CH 4 in the air is between 5% and 15%. If the level rises above 15%, methane will catch fire but will not explode."

                "As regards the last-mentioned priority, the recommended method for decontaminating sites appears to entail setting up a drainage system for fermentation gases whereby gases are pumped out and treated using a biological filter as the site continues to operate. A gas-extraction system of this kind, provision for which is also made in the Regulations of 14 March 1991 in force in Turkey, generally consists of perforated vertical ducts drilled into the waste or horizontal drains buried in the mass of waste, a ventilation system, a biological filter and a network of suction pipes.",

However, the Court considers that those steps are more indicative of a conflict of powers between different authorities, or indeed delaying tactics. In any event, the proceedings to have the report set aside were in fact abortive, having not been pursued by the councils’ lawyers, and the report was never declared invalid. On the contrary, it was decisive for all the authorities responsible for investigating the accident of 28 April 1993 and, moreover, was subsequently confirmed by the report of 18 May 1993 by the committee of experts appointed by the Üsküdar public prosecutor (see paragraph 23 above) and by the two scientific opinions referred to in the report of 9 July 1993 by the chief inspector appointed by the Ministry of the Interior (see paragraph 28 above)."

No such recognition had ever been forthcoming under domestic law, either explicitly or tacitly, and the Government observed that the applicant had, moreover, been unable to produce any documents or title deeds in support of his claims. In that connection, the applicant had been mistaken in relying on the laws for the regularisation of illegal dwellings, since those laws had not on any account had the effect of giving him title to publicly owned land, which, pursuant to the Land Registry Act (Law no. 3402), was inalienable and could not be acquired by adverse possession.",

Poland, no. 34049/96, § 63, ECHR 2001-VI). Accordingly, as well as physical goods, certain rights and interests constituting assets may also be regarded as “property rights”, and thus as “possessions” for the purposes of this provision (see Iatridis v.

In the first place, the criminal proceedings were conducted in such a way that the focus was shifted from the all-important life-endangering aspect of the case to a determination of whether or not the mayors could be held liable for “negligence in the performance of their duties”.

The Government observed that neither the Convention nor its case-law compelled the authorities to secure the conviction of a defendant. The Chamber’s suggestion that the verdict handed down against the mayors was tantamount to granting them almost total impunity had ignored both this point and the national authorities’ discretion to classify criminal charges in the light of the circumstances of a particular case, including situations like the one obtaining in the present case, where the applicant had never complained that the mayors were guilty of unlawful killing through negligence."

The Government further contended that, contrary to the Chamber’s finding, the compensation claim had been determined within a reasonable time, and certainly within a much shorter time-frame than, for example, in Calvelli and Ciglio (cited above), where the Court had found that the period of six years and three months taken to determine a civil claim for death by negligence could not be said to raise an issue under Article 2.

As to the alleged loss resulting from the destruction of the applicant’s dwelling, the Court observes at the outset that, in the absence of any substantiation, the sum claimed would appear excessive. In this connection, it considers that the economic interest which the subsidised housing acquired by the applicant may have represented should be taken into account in the assessment of damage (see paragraph 156 above), although this task is complicated both by the constant fluctuation in the rates of exchange and inflation in Turkey and by the transactions carried out by the applicant in relation to his flat (see paragraph 30 above).",
                "The Chamber’s assessment was based on the assumption that the value of the applicant’s dwelling that was destroyed amounted to 50% of the cost of decent housing offered at the time by Istanbul City Council in the Çobançeşme area. The Grand Chamber notes in this connection that, according to a list drawn up on 20 March 2001 by the city council, the council was offering housing in the Çobançeşme area for approximately TRL 10,400,000,000, which on that date was equivalent to EUR 11,800.",
                "That information apart, the Court observes, again on the basis of its own – inevitably approximate – calculations, that on 13 November 1993, when the contract for the sale of the flat to the applicant was signed, the agreed price of TRL 125,000,000 was equivalent to approximately EUR 8,500, a quarter of which (EUR 2,125) was paid immediately. The remainder (equivalent to EUR 6,375) was to be paid in 120 monthly instalments of TRL 732,844. On 13 November 1993 the monthly instalments were equivalent to approximately EUR 53. However, on 24 March 1998, the date on which the applicant promised to sell his flat to E.B., the instalments corresponded to only EUR 3. According to calculations on the basis of the exchange rates in force between 13 November 1993 and 24 March 1998, the average value of the instalments was EUR 15. As there is no reason to believe that the applicant continued to pay the instalments after 24 March 1998, it can be presumed that by that date he must have paid, in addition to the down payment, the equivalent of approximately EUR 780 in monthly instalments towards the purchase of the flat, making a total of approximately EUR 3,000, which is significantly lower than the initial value of the flat.",
                "It should also be borne in mind that from at least February 1995 onwards, if not well before that date, the flat in question had been let to a certain H.Ö. for a monthly rent of TRL 2,000,000 (approximately EUR 41). In the thirty ‑ seven months during which the flat was leased, ending on 24 March 1998 when the undertaking to sell it was signed, the applicant must therefore have received a minimum of approximately EUR 1,500 in rent, whereas during the same period he had had to pay only EUR 550 in monthly instalments.",
                "Furthermore, on signing the undertaking to sell the flat, the applicant received 20,000 German marks from E.B.; that sum, equivalent at the time to EUR 10,226, is significantly higher than any amount the applicant would ultimately have had to spend on the purchase of his flat.",
                "In the light of the foregoing, assuming that the market value of the applicant’s slum dwelling may be estimated according to the criterion adopted by the Chamber and that he must have spent a certain amount on accommodation while his flat was being let out, there is still no reason for the Court to conclude that those circumstances resulted in a loss greater than the profit the applicant seems to have made from the transactions relating to his flat.",

In making that award, however, the court refused to take into account any electrical appliances allegedly owned by the applicant, on the ground that his dwelling did not have electricity (see paragraph 40 above). Furthermore, the compensation awarded has never been paid to the applicant.

The Court considers that that sequence of events taken as a whole created a continuing situation with which the applicant company still has to contend, as it has yet to receive adequate compensation. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the mere fact that some of the events material to the case occurred prior to the relevant date does not render the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 incompatible ratione temporis.",

By a judgment of 26 April 2002 the Supreme Economic Court dismissed the applicant company's appeal on the ground that it had been lodged outside the one-month time-limit.",
                "The Court notes, therefore, that the applicant company's appeal on points of law was not examined on the merits owing to its failure to comply with the statutory rules, a state of affairs that might be regarded as showing that the applicant company has failed to exhaust domestic remedies. However, the Court reiterates that, in accordance with its settled case-law on the subject, the rule on the exhaustion of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism and is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case (see, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 59, ECHR 2000-VII). It considers that like considerations apply, mutatis mutandis, to the present case.",

In addition, the Court considers that the Supreme Economic Court must have been aware, when it informed the applicant company that it could reinstate its appeal once it had complied with the procedural rule concerned, that the one-month time-limit for lodging appeals would have expired. However, it did not touch upon that issue in its judgment of 2 April 2002 or grant the applicant company a specific period in which to validate its appeal. As a consequence, by a judgment of 26 April 2002 the Supreme Economic Court dismissed the applicant company's appeal on points of law as being out of time.",

The applicant company said that executive councils' powers to ratify resolutions and decisions of limited-liability companies were delegated by the State and strictly regulated by domestic legislation. Under Ukrainian law executive councils were required to observe the rule of law when performing their duties and to follow procedures established by law. They were, therefore, not relieved from liability in the exercise of their powers and could incur constitutional (by virtue of Article 56 of the Constitution) or statutory liability."

The applicant company further argued that the basis for the Executive Council's liability was the clause requiring it to turn down requests for ratification by companies of resolutions and decisions whose content or form was unlawful. A refusal by the executive council to ratify a corporate resolution or decision was but one aspect of the liability faced by companies. However, the company's liability did not exclude liability on the part of the executive council, which was also under a duty to follow a specific procedure prior to ratification. The statute laid down, inter alia, an exhaustive list of the documents that had to be lodged with the executive council to enable a resolution altering the memorandum and articles of association or increasing the capital to be ratified and thus validated. One of the documents that had to be produced to the executive council was the minutes of the meeting of shareholders in which the resolution concerned was adopted. That document had to be signed by all the shareholders. In the instant case, the signatures of individual shareholders should also have been legalised by a notary. However, the Executive Council had ratified all the decisions and resolutions for the increases in capital and alterations to the memorandum and articles of association of the Ukrainian company without requiring production of the relevant minutes. In such circumstances, the Executive Council should have turned down the request for ratification of the decisions and resolutions. Its failure to exercise its statutory powers as a public body to supervise the activities of a limited-liability company rendered it liable. If executive councils merely acted as a registration office, their supervisory powers would serve no purpose. In addition, under Ukrainian law, an action could be brought against an executive council in its capacity as “a public entity responsible for its acts”, as compensation for damage sustained as a result of the unlawful acts or omissions of executive councils was guaranteed by both statute and the Constitution (Article 56)."

The Securities Exchange Commission had examined Sovtransavto- Lugansk's activities in March 1998 and found a number of breaches of the legislation in force by the company.

In the present case the assessment of the inheritance tax had thus taken into account the building right existing in respect of part of the inherited – but not expropriated – land. Apart from compensation for the expropriated land, Mr Jokela had been awarded a further FIM 700,000 (about 118,000 euros) in compensation for the buildings, the equipment and the vegetation removed from that area.

Nevertheless, the starting-point when determining the market value of the expropriated land had to be the price level in the autumn of 1990, when the Roads Authority had taken over the land in question. Domestic practice likewise spelled out the principle of basing the market value on the reference prices dating back to the time of the initial interference with the property. Any domestic law or practice to the contrary would in itself be in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1: if the compensation were not based on the price level at the time when the property had been interfered with, the property owner's right to compensation would depend solely on the efficiency of the authorities in processing the matter."

                "63. The Court acknowledges that the Italian procedure for the enforcement of orders for possession differs in a number of ways from enforcement proceedings in the strict sense and notes that it has examined this issue before, in the case of Scollo v. Italy, in which it concluded that “ [e]ven if, in the instant case, it is not possible to speak of enforcement proceedings in the strict sense, ... Article 6 § 1 is applicable, regard being had to the purpose of the proceedings which was to settle the dispute between the applicant and his tenant ” (judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 315-C, p. 55, § 44). The Court observes that the applicant company issued proceedings before the Livorno magistrate for an order confirming termination of the lease and requiring the tenant to vacate the premises. As the tenant did not contest termination, the only outstanding point concerned the date of repossession. For so long as that date was put back owing to the tenant’s refusal to leave voluntarily, which entailed a de facto extension to the lease and a subsequent restriction on the applicant company’s right of property, there continued to be a “dispute” (“ contestation ”) for the purposes of Article 6.",
                "In any event, the Court recalls that the right to a court would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 (see the Hornsby v. Greece judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, p. 510, § 40).",

In conclusion, while it may be accepted that Contracting States may, in exceptional circumstances and, as in this instance, by availing themselves of their margin of appreciation to control the use of property, intervene in proceedings for the enforcement of a judicial decision, the consequence of such intervention should not be that execution is prevented, invalidated or unduly delayed or, still less, that the substance of the decision is undermined.",
                "In the present case, as the Court explained in paragraphs 54-56 above in connection with the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the impugned legislation rendered nugatory the Livorno magistrate’s ruling in his order of 21 November 1983. Further, from the moment the prefect became the authority responsible for determining when the order for possession would be enforced, and in the light of the fact that there could be no effective judicial review of his decisions, the applicant company was deprived of its right under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to have its dispute ( contestation ) with its tenant decided by a court. That situation is incompatible with the principle of the rule of law.",

As regards the first limb of the objection, the Court observes that prior to 1 January 1990 the enforcement of orders for possession was suspended by statute (see paragraphs 23-26 above). As Immobiliare Saffi did not satisfy the conditions laid down in the applicable statutory provisions to escape the suspension, it was not able to apply to the prefect for police assistance; nor, in the event of such an application being turned down, could it have applied to the administrative courts to challenge the prefect’s decision. It follows that such a remedy would have had no prospect of success (see the Spadea and Scalabrino v. Italy judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 315-B, p. 24, § 24 in fine ).",

While it is true that the applicant company could have sought judicial review in the administrative courts of the Livorno Prefect’s refusal to grant it police assistance, the Court observes that the administrative courts would only have had jurisdiction to set aside decisions of the prefect that failed to apply the criteria governing priority. In the instant case, Immobiliare Saffi’s complaint was not that the prefect’s decisions were arbitrary, but that the application of the criteria for determining priority had had a disproportionate impact on its right of property. Accordingly, as there was no basis for challenging the criteria for establishing priority (most of which were laid down by statute), an application to the administrative courts cannot be regarded as having been an effective remedy. Moreover, the Government have not cited any decisions of the Italian courts showing otherwise.",

For a period of more than six years starting on 1 January 1990, enforcement of the order for possession in favour of I.B. was postponed on a number of occasions (see paragraphs 28-29 above). Indeed, the tenant was never actually evicted as Immobiliare Saffi recovered its apartment after his death. The legislature, presuming that the risk that had been noted in 1984 of serious breaches of public order remained – as a large number of evictions had to be enforced at the same time – conferred a power, and possibly a duty, on prefects, as the authority responsible for maintaining public order, to intervene systematically in the enforcement of orders for possession, while at the same time defining the scope of that power."

It should be noted in this connection that the decision on whether police assistance should be provided is made on the basis of the same factors – the situation of the landlord and tenant, and the grounds for eviction – as those the magistrate takes into consideration under section 56 of Law no. 392/78."

Further, from the moment the prefect became the authority responsible for determining when the order for possession would be enforced, and in the light of the fact that there could be no effective judicial review of his decisions, the applicant company was deprived of its right under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to have its dispute ( contestation ) with its tenant decided by a court.

In its decision the court held that the statutory restrictions imposed on property rights under Article 42 of the Constitution, with a view to ensuring social justice, made it possible to regard controls imposing restrictions as legitimate, provided that such controls were of an exceptional and temporary nature, but that perpetuating such restrictions was incompatible with the protection of property rights embodied in Article 42 of the Constitution.",
                "In its decision the Constitutional Court also pointed out that the statutory six-month extension of leases prescribed by Law no. 118 should not be considered in isolation but within the context of tenancy provisions as a whole. The court drew particular attention to the fact that this extension succeeded other statutory extensions and could mark the beginning of new restrictions on freedom of contract in this field. Moreover, the statutory extension of leases had the effect of prolonging contracts in which the rent, notwithstanding the increases allowed in accordance with rises in the cost of living, were not even approximately in line with current socio-economic conditions. Further, the Law concerned did not give the lessor the possibility of regaining possession of the property except in cases of absolute necessity.",
                "The Constitutional Court also held that Law no. 118, inasmuch as it provided for a blanket extension of current leases without taking into consideration the particular economic circumstances of lessors and lessees - as would have been necessary to ensure social justice -, infringed the principle of the equality of citizens before the law embodied in Article 3 of the Constitution.",

The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph (P1-1), covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph (P1-1), recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose. However, the rules are not \"distinct\" in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property.

Furthermore, the Third Protocol of London adopted by the protecting powers on 3 February 1830, and ratified in Greece by the Greek Senate’s Memorandum of 10 April 1830, … did not confer on the bishops of the Western Church any jurisdiction other than spiritual and administrative, that is to say relating to that Church’s domestic order, and the provisions of the canon law that governs the Roman Catholic Church which attribute legal personality to convents and other Church establishments founded by decisions of the bishops of that Church were not adopted.",

However, the special provisions of the treaty which are not reproduced in the Rome Convention and do not conflict with it must be regarded as still being in force. By means of the Convention Greece protects, inter alia, the religious freedom not only of minorities but of any person within its jurisdiction, irrespective of religion, national origin, membership of an ethnic minority, etc. Article 13 § 2 of the Constitution, which provides for freedom to practise any ‘known’ religion and for freedom to perform religious obligations without hindrance, likewise corresponds to the content [of the Convention].",

Furthermore, since section 13 of the Introductory Law to the Civil Code … provides that only legal persons ‘lawfully constituted’ at the date of adoption of the Civil Code continue to exist, the court below rightly held that Article 20 of the Constitution did not apply in the instant case as the formalities required by Greece’s laws for the acquisition of legal personality had not been complied with by the appellants.”",

It was inconceivable that Orthodox priests or leaders of other faiths and sects should quite simply be able, on their own authority, to disregard provisions making it necessary for that type of legal personality to be registered.",

Religious communities were thereby empowered to set up, on their own initiative, separate, independent legal entities like the associations, religious foundations and partnerships referred to in Article 784 of the Civil Code or, if they did not wish to do so, to operate as unions of persons and protect their property by virtue of that status (Article 61 of the Civil Code and Article 62 of the Code of Civil Procedure).",

Settled case-law and administrative practice had, over the course of the years, created legal certainty, both in property matters and as regards the representation of the various Catholic parish churches in legal proceedings, and the applicant church could reasonably rely on that. In this connection, the Court notes that in the instant case the Canea District Court gave no consideration to the question of legal personality (see paragraph 9 above) and the reporting judge of the Court of Cassation – relying on the well-established case-law – had invited that court to quash the judgment of the Court of First Instance sitting as an appellate court (see paragraph 12 above).",

Quite apart from the difficulties of adapting a church to that kind of structure and the procedural problems which might arise in the event of litigation, such late compliance with the relevant rules of domestic law might be interpreted as an admission that countless acts of the applicant church in the past were not valid.

Moreover, he did not respond in any way to the repeated actions by the Tax Authority between July 2002, when it first ordered him to submit his tax return, and April 2003, when it reminded him of his duty to pay the tax debt established by the Tax Authority ’ s discretionary assessment. The Court further observes that the applicant continued to remain passive after the tax debt had been transferred to the Enforcement Authority, of which the applicant was aware at least as from the end of April 2003 when an enforcement officer had come to his home for a pre-planned visit and he was absent. On this occasion, the officer had left a note for the applicant requesting him to contact the Enforcement Authority, which he failed to do."

                "116. Here the Court notes the applicant ’ s submission that he had been suffering from serious depression and therefore had not been capable of acting to protect his interests. In this respect, the Court observes that his tax return was due in March 2002 and that the applicant only sought help for his depression seven months later, in October 2002, and did not start treatment for it until February 2003. Thus, for more than one year, he neither sent a letter to the Tax Authority informing it of his illness, nor did he ask his wife to help him do so. He also did not contact a lawyer or accountant to deal with the matter on his behalf. It should be recalled that the applicant was the owner of a close company and thus it must be expected that he was aware of his statutory obligations and the likely consequences if he failed to fulfil them. The Court therefore agrees with the Government that the applicant had time and the opportunity to avoid enforcement measures being taken against him to ensure the payment of his tax debts."

            [
                "117. On the other hand the Court notes that tax debts to the State are enforceable following the Tax Authority ’ s decision on final tax even if there has been a request for reconsideration or an appeal to the administrative courts (Chapter 23, sections 7 and 8, of the Tax Payment Act). Likewise, enforcement measures are not automatically suspended when a debtor appeals against such measures (Chapter 2, section 19, of the Enforcement Code). While such mechanisms must be considered acceptable and falling within the State ’ s wide margin of appreciation under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court considers that it is necessary that they are accompanied by procedural safeguards to ensure that individuals are not put in a position where their appeals are effectively circumscribed and they are unable to protect correctly their interests. The Court observes that such safeguards exist under Swedish law, inter alia, through the possibility to request the Tax Authority to grant respite from the payment of taxes (Chapter 17, sections 2, 2 ( a ) and 3, of the Tax Payment Act). If such a request has been granted, no enforcement measures may be taken for the amount covered by the respite (Chapter 17, section 10, of the Tax Payment Act). Moreover, a debtor may request the Enforcement Authority to grant deferment of payment ( sections 7 and 8 of the Debt Collection Act) or a stay on the enforcement measure (Chapter 8, section 3, of the Enforcement Code)."

                "118. In the present case, the applicant used some of these possibilities. Hence, on 28 July 2003, after he had been informed that the Enforcement Authority had decided to sell his property at public auction, he requested it to stay the sale for a period of two months on the ground that he had not been able to submit his tax return in time due to personal reasons. On the same day, he also requested the Tax Authority to grant him respite from the payment of his tax debt as he intended to submit his income tax return for 2002. The applicant further asked the Enforcement Authority to provide him with a copy of the writ of execution so that he could appeal against it to the District Court, which indeed he did on 10 August 2003, after having received the decision. Thus, in the Court ’ s opinion, at this point in time, the applicant took advantage of the procedural safeguards provided by law to protect his interests."

            [
                "119. As to the authorities ’ handling of these requests, the Court first notes that nothing indicates that the writ of execution was ever formally served on the applicant but sent to him by ordinary mail and allegedly not received by him. The Court finds this rather remarkable, considering the obligation laid down in section 9 of the Enforcement Ordinance and the importance of the decision and the effects on the applicant ’ s possibilities to appeal against it. This is particularly so as Chapter 12, section 11, of the Enforcement Code stipulates that property should be sold within four months of the decision to attach it. In any event, as noted above, the applicant was made aware of the writ of execution in July 2003 and received a copy of the decision at the beginning of August 2003, at which point he appealed against it. The Court observes that the District Court rejected the appeal on 28 August 2003. It thereby ensured that the writ of execution benefitted from judicial review before the public auction took place. The Court has regard though to the fact that the writ of execution had not gained legal force when the property was actually sold and that, on 15 September 2003, within the statutory time-limit, the applicant made a further appeal to the Court of Appeal."

            [
                "120. With regard to the request for a stay on the sale at public auction, the Court notes that the Enforcement Authority rejected the request two days after receiving it, finding that there was an enforceable debt, that the petitioner (the State) opposed a stay on execution and that there were no special circumstances to justify a stay. Upon appeal to the District Court, where the applicant submitted a medical certificate and stated that he had requested respite from the payment of his tax debt and would submit his tax return, the court, on 28 August 2003, upheld the Enforcement Authority ’ s decision in full. Thus, the Court considers that the applicant ’ s request was dealt with expeditiously by the Enforcement Authority and the District Court, guaranteeing him access to court before the decision to sell the property was enforced by the public auction. Again, however, even though the law provides for further appeal to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, the applicant was effectively deprived of this right since the enforcement took place before the Court of Appeal could consider the appeal and it therefore struck the case out of its list of cases."
            ],
            [
                "121. Turning to the request for respite from the payment of his tax debts, the Court observes that the applicant sent this to the Tax Authority by fax and letter on 28 July 2003 but that, apparently, it was sorted wrongly or lost in the incoming mail and therefore not dealt with by the Authority. The Government have acknowledged that, if the request had been dealt with, it might, directly or indirectly through further actions by the applicant, have influenced the Enforcement Authority ’ s decision to sell the property. The Court does not consider that it is in a position to speculate about whether such a request would have been granted or not, or what a positive or negative decision would have led the applicant to do or how it might have influenced the Enforcement Authority in its decision to proceed with the public auction. It suffices for the Court to note that this error may have had an impact on how the case developed and showed a lack of due diligence on the part of the authorities."
            ],
            [
                "122. In any event, it notes that the applicant reiterated his request to the Tax Authority for respite from the payment of his taxes on 28 August 2003 and, at the same time, submitted his tax return for 2002 and a medical certificate concerning his illness. He also informed the Tax Authority of the urgency of the matter, albeit without stating that the date for the public auction had been set for 3 September 2003. A few days later, on 1 September, he sent another fax to the Tax Authority stressing that it was of the highest importance to him that the request be considered promptly. The Court finds that these repeated requests within a few days of each other and stating the urgency must be considered enough for the Tax Authority to have realised the importance of treating the request without delay. This is particularly so since the Tax Authority knew about the enforcement proceedings and since, according to Chapter 12, section 11, of the Enforcement Code, the sale of real property and site-leasehold rights should take place within four months of the attachment. Moreover, the Court observes that the Tax Authority and the Enforcement Authority have access to each other ’ s databases (see above § 7 4 ) and the Tax Authority could therefore easily have verified the status of the enforcement proceedings concerning the applicant in the Enforcement Authority ’ s database. It would then have seen that the public auction to sell the applicant ’ s property was scheduled for 3 September 2003. The Tax Authority does not appear to have done so. As it was, the Tax Authority took two days to grant respite which, in the Court ’ s opinion, under normal circumstances may be acceptable but in the particular circumstances of the present case, as set out above, was not sufficiently prompt, noting that the request was only granted on the same day that the public auction took place."
            ],
            [
                "123. The Court does not find it necessary to establish whether the public auction took place just before respite was granted or just after, which is in dispute between the parties. It considers that, since the Tax Authority was not aware that the public auction was taking place on 3 September 2003, there was no special reason for it to inform the Enforcement Authority of its decision the same day by fax or a telephone call. As it was, the Enforcement Authority was officially informed of the decision on 8 September 2003. However, the Court stresses that, on the day of the decision, the Tax Authority registered the respite in the applicant ’ s tax account in its database to which the Enforcement Authority had access. Consequently, the Enforcement Authority could have seen that respite had been granted if it had verified that account late on 3 September or the next day. In any event, it would have been after the sale had taken place. Here, the Court points out that the petitioner in the present case was the State, represented by the Enforcement Authority, following an enforceable tax debt submitted by the Tax Authority to the Enforcement Authority. In such a situation, the Court considers that it is not unreasonable to expect the authorities involved to keep each other informed about developments of direct relevance to the enforcement proceedings, such as a request for, and the grant of, respite. In the present case, there appears to the Court to have been a lack of effective communication between the two authorities. Moreover, the Court observes that the applicant, in his appeal to the District Court dated 3 August 2003 against the Enforcement Authority ’ s decision not to stay the sale of his property, stated that he had requested respite from the payment of his tax debt. Thus, the Enforcement Authority was aware of this circumstance well before the public auction took place and could therefore reasonably have been expected to verify its state of proceedings and/or outcome directly with the Tax Authority before selling the applicant ’ s property."
            ],
            [
                "124. The Court further observes that the Enforcement Authority was informed that the applicant had paid some of his other debts (to the TPMD) in July 2003, a fact it acknowledged in its submission to the District Court in reply to the applicant ’ s appeal concerning the request for a stay on the sale of his property at the beginning of August 2003, before the public auction took place. Still, in its reply of 17 September 2003 to the District Court, in the proceedings relating to the applicant ’ s appeal against the actual sale of his property at public auction, the Enforcement Authority included these previously discharged debts to justify the sale of the property despite the respite from payment of the tax debt. The Court finds that this conduct on the part of the Enforcement Authority showed a serious lack of diligence having regard to the very grave consequences that the sale and later the eviction entailed for the applicant."
            ],
            [
                "125. Furthermore, the Court observes that in accordance with Chapter 3, section 21, of the Enforcement Code a measure for enforcement already taken shall lapse, if possible, if respite from payment has been granted. Since the Enforcement Authority was officially informed about the respite on 8 September 2003, less than one week after the sale of the property and over one month before the eviction took place, and knew that the applicant ’ s enforceable debt then amounted to only SEK 6,721, the Court notes that the Enforcement Authority could have repealed the sale, as could the domestic courts upon appeal by the applicant. To the Court, both the decision to uphold the sale and the ensuing eviction of the applicant appear excessive and disproportionate, especially since the applicant had other assets, such as a car, which could have been seized and sold to cover what little remained of his enforceable debts. This is particularly so because the authorities knew that the proceedings concerning the writ of execution were still ongoing and thus had not yet gained legal force."

However, having failed that, in July 2002, the Tax Authority ( Skattemyndigheten ) in Stockholm ordered him to submit his tax return within two weeks from receiving the order.

The applicant was given two weeks to comment on it, but did not do so. In November 2002, the Tax Authority decided to maintain the proposal and, as it found no grounds for exemption, imposed tax surcharges on him.

It will, however, depend on the particular circumstances whether the unilateral declaration offers a sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention does not require the Court to continue its examination of the case (see Tahsin Acar v.

Regretting the inconvenience caused to the applicant by the sale of his property at public auction and the ensuing eviction cannot, in the Court ’ s view, be considered equivalent to an acknowledgment of a violation of the Convention. Moreover, although the measure proposed by the Government to remedy the situation, namely, paying an appropriate amount of money to the applicant, appears reasonable and sufficient, it cannot outweigh the absence of an acknowledgment of a violation having regard to the specific context in which unilateral declarations are intended to be used."

It would appear to the Court that, at best, the applicant would have been financially compensated for the loss of his home. However, even this is not certain since the provision referred to above by the Government states that later decisions may be revoked, indicating that it is an option for the authorities but not an obligation. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the fact that the applicant did not exhaust the remedies indicated by the Government in relation to the writ of execution cannot lead to the conclusion that the applicant ’ s complaints relating to the sale of his property and the eviction from his home are also automatically inadmissible for non-exhaustion.

In such cases, the States ’ margin of appreciation should be very narrow. This was in particular so when the creditor demanding payment was the State itself."

The Tax Authority ought to have known that there was an impending risk of his property being sold since it was the Tax Authority that had sought the enforcement in the first place. Moreover, the Tax Authority also failed to treat his request for respite promptly, granting it only on 3 September 2003, more than a month after he had submitted the first request and despite him having informed the Authority about the urgency of the matter and having submitted his tax return. To the applicant this revealed a flaw in the system which weighed heavily when considering the proportionality of the measure."

As concerned the proportionality of the enforcement measures against him, the applicant submitted that when using a system of early enforcement of tax debts as applied in Sweden, the State had to provide extra safeguards especially if, as in his case, there were indications prior to the fait accompli that the debt should not be enforced. He pointed out that, according to the Court ’ s case-law, proceedings leading to a possible interference with a person ’ s property rights must afford the individual a reasonable opportunity of putting his or her case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures ( Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, § 45, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV ). In the present case, a tax debt had been enforced after the Tax Authority had granted respite from payment. Although the remaining debt amounted to no more than SEK 6,721, he was never given the chance to pay that sum even though he had assets, such as a car, to cover it."

They were also aware that his property had a taxation value of SEK 1,372,000 while his mortgage amounted to SEK 960,000, leaving room for him to take a supplementary loan to cover the debt. By not guiding him to find a solution and having ignored the seriousness of his illness, of which it was aware, the Enforcement Authority had not acted in good faith."

Pye (Oxford) Land Ltd v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44302/02, § § 65-66, ECHR 2007 ‑ III, and Gasus Dosier- und Fördertechnik GmbH v. the Netherlands, 23 February 1995, § 59, Series A no. 306 ‑ B ), should be considered as a control of use of the applicant ’ s property not as a deprivation of it.

As concerned the proportionality of the interference, the Government noted that according to Swedish law, taxpayers are entitled to appeal against decisions on taxes and tax surcharges or request that they be reconsidered until the end of the fifth year following the tax assessment year. In view of that, they submitted that it would be unreasonable if enforcement could not take place until a tax debt had become final and that this was one reason that taxes and tax surcharges could be enforced before they had gained legal force in Sweden.

Moreover, when he had finally submitted his tax return on 28 August 2003, he had not informed the Tax Authority that his property would be sold on 3 September 2003 even though he knew about it. Furthermore, the Government argued that the applicant could easily have avoided the sale of his property by paying the tax debt, using his property as security for a loan.

As regards the actions of the Enforcement Authority, the Government noted that it had carried out an investigation into the applicant ’ s assets and found that his property was the only asset of sufficient value to cover the debts that were payable and enforceable. It thus had had regard to the principle of proportionality contained in Chapter 4, section 3, of the Enforcement Code. Moreover, the Enforcement Authority had verified that no respite from payment had been granted before the public auction took place. However, the Government acknowledged that the Tax Authority had failed to deal with the applicant ’ s first request for respite from payment dated 28 July 2003 because the letter had been wrongly sorted in the incoming mail. They assumed that, had the application been dealt with in due time and granted, the Enforcement Authority would have been notified of the respite before the public auction. Still, the Government claimed that it was impossible to know the outcome of such a first request since, at that point, the applicant had not yet submitted his tax return or requested reconsideration of the tax assessment decision, nor had he appealed against it. They did note though that, if a first request had been refused, the applicant might have submitted his tax return sooner and then been granted respite sooner, which could have influenced the Enforcement Authority ’ s decision to sell the property."

Turning to the applicant ’ s second request for respite, the Government observed that the Tax Authority ’ s decision was taken, and the public auction took place, on the same afternoon. Since the applicant had not informed the Tax Authority that the sale would take place on 3 September, despite having been informed of this fact at the end of July, the Tax Authority was not aware of it and, thus, could not have been expected to notify the Enforcement Authority immediately. Even if the Tax Authority had known about the sale, it was not certain that a notification would have been prompt enough to stop the sale. In view of this, the Government contended that the second request for respite had been decided with sufficient promptness by the Tax Authority as the responsible office had dealt with it within two days of receipt. Moreover, the Enforcement Authority was officially notified of the respite on Monday 8 September, five days after the decision had been taken, on Wednesday 3 September. The Government observed, however, that if the Enforcement Authority had known about the respite, it was quite possible that it would have postponed the sale in order to try to find out whether the part of the debt that was still enforceable could be paid by the applicant or obtained through the sale of some other assets belonging to the applicant."

However, in view of the fact that the Tax Authority, by mistake, had not dealt with the applicant ’ s first request for respite and considering that there was a chance that a decision based on that application and taken in due time could have led to the postponement of the sale, the Government preferred to leave it to the Court ’ s discretion whether this complaint revealed a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention."

The Enforcement Authority then decided to sell the property, informing the applicant of this on 4 July 2003, and a few weeks later decided that the public auction should take place on 3 September 2003. The applicant was informed of this by letter dated 31 July 2003. In the Court ’ s opinion, these two decisions were the logical consequences of the first, in particular in the absence of any action on the part of the applicant to halt the procedure. Moreover, the Court observes that the Enforcement Authority ’ s procedure and all of the above decisions had their basis in Swedish legislation regulating the collection and enforcement of tax debts to the State, namely in the Tax Payment Act (Chapter 20, section 1, and Chapter 23, sections 7 and 8) and the Enforcement Code (Chapter 3, section 23, Chapter 4, section 10, Chapter 8, section 19, and Chapter 12, sections 1 and 11).

However, the Court observes that the documents submitted by the applicant in support of his claim are not sufficiently specific to substantiate that the evaluation of the market value of his property by an independent company in July 2003 was incorrect or inaccurate. Moreover, it notes that the Enforcement Authority rejected a first round of bidding, as the final bid was considered too low, and that in the second round of bidding, the final bid which was accepted amounted to 80% of the estimated market value.

As concerns the proportionality of the actual sale of his property on public auction and the ensuing eviction, the Court notes on the one hand that the applicant failed to fulfil his legal obligation to submit his tax return for the tax assessment year 2002 by the prescribed deadline of 31 March 2002. Moreover, he did not respond in any way to the repeated actions by the Tax Authority between July 2002, when it first ordered him to submit his tax return, and April 2003, when it reminded him of his duty to pay the tax debt established by the Tax Authority ’ s discretionary assessment. The Court further observes that the applicant continued to remain passive after the tax debt had been transferred to the Enforcement Authority, of which the applicant was aware at least as from the end of April 2003 when an enforcement officer had come to his home for a pre-planned visit and he was absent. On this occasion, the officer had left a note for the applicant requesting him to contact the Enforcement Authority, which he failed to do."

                "116. Here the Court notes the applicant ’ s submission that he had been suffering from serious depression and therefore had not been capable of acting to protect his interests. In this respect, the Court observes that his tax return was due in March 2002 and that the applicant only sought help for his depression seven months later, in October 2002, and did not start treatment for it until February 2003. Thus, for more than one year, he neither sent a letter to the Tax Authority informing it of his illness, nor did he ask his wife to help him do so. He also did not contact a lawyer or accountant to deal with the matter on his behalf. It should be recalled that the applicant was the owner of a close company and thus it must be expected that he was aware of his statutory obligations and the likely consequences if he failed to fulfil them. The Court therefore agrees with the Government that the applicant had time and the opportunity to avoid enforcement measures being taken against him to ensure the payment of his tax debts."

On the other hand the Court notes that tax debts to the State are enforceable following the Tax Authority ’ s decision on final tax even if there has been a request for reconsideration or an appeal to the administrative courts (Chapter 23, sections 7 and 8, of the Tax Payment Act). Likewise, enforcement measures are not automatically suspended when a debtor appeals against such measures (Chapter 2, section 19, of the Enforcement Code). While such mechanisms must be considered acceptable and falling within the State ’ s wide margin of appreciation under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court considers that it is necessary that they are accompanied by procedural safeguards to ensure that individuals are not put in a position where their appeals are effectively circumscribed and they are unable to protect correctly their interests. The Court observes that such safeguards exist under Swedish law, inter alia, through the possibility to request the Tax Authority to grant respite from the payment of taxes (Chapter 17, sections 2, 2 ( a ) and 3, of the Tax Payment Act). If such a request has been granted, no enforcement measures may be taken for the amount covered by the respite (Chapter 17, section 10, of the Tax Payment Act). Moreover, a debtor may request the Enforcement Authority to grant deferment of payment ( sections 7 and 8 of the Debt Collection Act) or a stay on the enforcement measure (Chapter 8, section 3, of the Enforcement Code)."

Hence, on 28 July 2003, after he had been informed that the Enforcement Authority had decided to sell his property at public auction, he requested it to stay the sale for a period of two months on the ground that he had not been able to submit his tax return in time due to personal reasons. On the same day, he also requested the Tax Authority to grant him respite from the payment of his tax debt as he intended to submit his income tax return for 2002. The applicant further asked the Enforcement Authority to provide him with a copy of the writ of execution so that he could appeal against it to the District Court, which indeed he did on 10 August 2003, after having received the decision. Thus, in the Court ’ s opinion, at this point in time, the applicant took advantage of the procedural safeguards provided by law to protect his interests."

As to the authorities ’ handling of these requests, the Court first notes that nothing indicates that the writ of execution was ever formally served on the applicant but sent to him by ordinary mail and allegedly not received by him. The Court finds this rather remarkable, considering the obligation laid down in section 9 of the Enforcement Ordinance and the importance of the decision and the effects on the applicant ’ s possibilities to appeal against it. This is particularly so as Chapter 12, section 11, of the Enforcement Code stipulates that property should be sold within four months of the decision to attach it. In any event, as noted above, the applicant was made aware of the writ of execution in July 2003 and received a copy of the decision at the beginning of August 2003, at which point he appealed against it. The Court observes that the District Court rejected the appeal on 28 August 2003. It thereby ensured that the writ of execution benefitted from judicial review before the public auction took place. The Court has regard though to the fact that the writ of execution had not gained legal force when the property was actually sold and that, on 15 September 2003, within the statutory time-limit, the applicant made a further appeal to the Court of Appeal."

With regard to the request for a stay on the sale at public auction, the Court notes that the Enforcement Authority rejected the request two days after receiving it, finding that there was an enforceable debt, that the petitioner (the State) opposed a stay on execution and that there were no special circumstances to justify a stay. Upon appeal to the District Court, where the applicant submitted a medical certificate and stated that he had requested respite from the payment of his tax debt and would submit his tax return, the court, on 28 August 2003, upheld the Enforcement Authority ’ s decision in full. Thus, the Court considers that the applicant ’ s request was dealt with expeditiously by the Enforcement Authority and the District Court, guaranteeing him access to court before the decision to sell the property was enforced by the public auction. Again, however, even though the law provides for further appeal to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, the applicant was effectively deprived of this right since the enforcement took place before the Court of Appeal could consider the appeal and it therefore struck the case out of its list of cases."

Turning to the request for respite from the payment of his tax debts, the Court observes that the applicant sent this to the Tax Authority by fax and letter on 28 July 2003 but that, apparently, it was sorted wrongly or lost in the incoming mail and therefore not dealt with by the Authority. The Government have acknowledged that, if the request had been dealt with, it might, directly or indirectly through further actions by the applicant, have influenced the Enforcement Authority ’ s decision to sell the property. The Court does not consider that it is in a position to speculate about whether such a request would have been granted or not, or what a positive or negative decision would have led the applicant to do or how it might have influenced the Enforcement Authority in its decision to proceed with the public auction. It suffices for the Court to note that this error may have had an impact on how the case developed and showed a lack of due diligence on the part of the authorities."

In any event, it notes that the applicant reiterated his request to the Tax Authority for respite from the payment of his taxes on 28 August 2003 and, at the same time, submitted his tax return for 2002 and a medical certificate concerning his illness. He also informed the Tax Authority of the urgency of the matter, albeit without stating that the date for the public auction had been set for 3 September 2003. A few days later, on 1 September, he sent another fax to the Tax Authority stressing that it was of the highest importance to him that the request be considered promptly. The Court finds that these repeated requests within a few days of each other and stating the urgency must be considered enough for the Tax Authority to have realised the importance of treating the request without delay. This is particularly so since the Tax Authority knew about the enforcement proceedings and since, according to Chapter 12, section 11, of the Enforcement Code, the sale of real property and site-leasehold rights should take place within four months of the attachment. Moreover, the Court observes that the Tax Authority and the Enforcement Authority have access to each other ’ s databases (see above § 7 4 ) and the Tax Authority could therefore easily have verified the status of the enforcement proceedings concerning the applicant in the Enforcement Authority ’ s database. It would then have seen that the public auction to sell the applicant ’ s property was scheduled for 3 September 2003. The Tax Authority does not appear to have done so. As it was, the Tax Authority took two days to grant respite which, in the Court ’ s opinion, under normal circumstances may be acceptable but in the particular circumstances of the present case, as set out above, was not sufficiently prompt, noting that the request was only granted on the same day that the public auction took place."
            ],
            [
                "123. The Court does not find it necessary to establish whether the public auction took place just before respite was granted or just after, which is in dispute between the parties. It considers that, since the Tax Authority was not aware that the public auction was taking place on 3 September 2003, there was no special reason for it to inform the Enforcement Authority of its decision the same day by fax or a telephone call. As it was, the Enforcement Authority was officially informed of the decision on 8 September 2003. However, the Court stresses that, on the day of the decision, the Tax Authority registered the respite in the applicant ’ s tax account in its database to which the Enforcement Authority had access. Consequently, the Enforcement Authority could have seen that respite had been granted if it had verified that account late on 3 September or the next day. In any event, it would have been after the sale had taken place. Here, the Court points out that the petitioner in the present case was the State, represented by the Enforcement Authority, following an enforceable tax debt submitted by the Tax Authority to the Enforcement Authority. In such a situation, the Court considers that it is not unreasonable to expect the authorities involved to keep each other informed about developments of direct relevance to the enforcement proceedings, such as a request for, and the grant of, respite. In the present case, there appears to the Court to have been a lack of effective communication between the two authorities. Moreover, the Court observes that the applicant, in his appeal to the District Court dated 3 August 2003 against the Enforcement Authority ’ s decision not to stay the sale of his property, stated that he had requested respite from the payment of his tax debt. Thus, the Enforcement Authority was aware of this circumstance well before the public auction took place and could therefore reasonably have been expected to verify its state of proceedings and/or outcome directly with the Tax Authority before selling the applicant ’ s property."

The Court further observes that the Enforcement Authority was informed that the applicant had paid some of his other debts (to the TPMD) in July 2003, a fact it acknowledged in its submission to the District Court in reply to the applicant ’ s appeal concerning the request for a stay on the sale of his property at the beginning of August 2003, before the public auction took place. Still, in its reply of 17 September 2003 to the District Court, in the proceedings relating to the applicant ’ s appeal against the actual sale of his property at public auction, the Enforcement Authority included these previously discharged debts to justify the sale of the property despite the respite from payment of the tax debt. The Court finds that this conduct on the part of the Enforcement Authority showed a serious lack of diligence having regard to the very grave consequences that the sale and later the eviction entailed for the applicant."

Furthermore, the Court observes that in accordance with Chapter 3, section 21, of the Enforcement Code a measure for enforcement already taken shall lapse, if possible, if respite from payment has been granted. Since the Enforcement Authority was officially informed about the respite on 8 September 2003, less than one week after the sale of the property and over one month before the eviction took place, and knew that the applicant ’ s enforceable debt then amounted to only SEK 6,721, the Court notes that the Enforcement Authority could have repealed the sale, as could the domestic courts upon appeal by the applicant. To the Court, both the decision to uphold the sale and the ensuing eviction of the applicant appear excessive and disproportionate, especially since the applicant had other assets, such as a car, which could have been seized and sold to cover what little remained of his enforceable debts. This is particularly so because the authorities knew that the proceedings concerning the writ of execution were still ongoing and thus had not yet gained legal force."

Moreover, States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation since the national authorities, by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. However, this margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right at stake, its importance for the individual as well as the public interest.

While this may have been in the interest of efficient enforcement proceedings, the Court is not convinced that the applicant ’ s interests were adequately protected in view of this most extreme form of interference with his right to respect for his home. It notes that, on 6 October 2003, when the Enforcement Authority decided that the applicant should be evicted, it knew that the applicant had been granted respite from payment of his enforceable tax debt and that only a very minor debt remained enforceable. Furthermore, it knew that the applicant ’ s appeal against the writ of execution was still pending before the Court of Appeal and that his appeal against the actual sale of the property was pending before District Court. Although the District Court rejected the appeal on 15 October 2003, a week before the actual eviction took place, the Court notes that this decision did not become final since the applicant appealed against it to the Court of Appeal within the statutory time-limit.

The Court reiterates that it has found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention as well as of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in respect of the sale of the applicant ’ s property at public auction and the ensuing eviction. The applicant is therefore entitled to compensation for pecuniary damage in so far as there is a causal link between the violations and the damaged suffered. The applicant must also substantiate the value of the damage suffered and costs incurred. For its part, the respondent State is under a legal obligation to put an end to the breach and make reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach ( see Iatridis v.

                "151. In the present case, the Court first notes that the applicant argues that he should be compensated for the cost of a replacement property today. The Government has disputed this. The Court observes that, in cases where the interference in question has satisfied the condition of lawfulness and was not arbitrary, it has considered that compensation at the level of the market value of the property at the time of the interference was appropriate (see, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § § 148 and 257-258, ECHR 2006 ‑ V ). It sees no reason to make another assessment in the present case. Since the applicant ’ s property was inspected by an independent company before the sale and at that point valued at between SEK 1,850,000 and SEK 2,150,000, the Court finds that the market value can reasonably be estimated at SEK 2 million. The reference made by the applicant to sales of equivalent properties between January and July 2002 is, in the Court ’ s view, not reliable since none of those properties were the same as the applicant ’ s property in size, age, condition or situation. It follows that the applicant should be compensated for the difference between the market value, SEK 2 million, and the price at which the property was sold, SEK 1,6 million, that is SEK 400,000.",

The Court notes that it has found that the eviction took place in violation of Article 8 and the applicant is therefore entitled to reimbursement for costs in this respect. Moreover, the costs directly linked to the eviction have been substantiated by the Enforcement Authority ’ s letter to the applicant, dated 18 May 2004, in the amount of SEK 71,115;",

                "(vi) as noted by the Government, the hotel bills were all addressed to the social authorities and stamped as received by them. Thus, there is no indication that the applicant was even requested to pay these bills. Moreover, he has submitted no proof of other “increased living expenses” during the 27 days following the eviction;",
                "(vii) the Court notes that the applicant has not specified why he has calculated the interest rate at 8%. In any event, most of the costs included have been rejected by the Court, for which reason the sum must be substantially reduced;",
                "(viii) the applicant has not substantiated that his new home after the eviction was more expensive in monthly charges than his property had been, as he has only submitted a copy of the rental contract for his new home and no other supporting documents. Thus, he has failed to show a causal link between these alleged costs and the violation found;",

The relevant passage reads as follows:",

An interference will be considered ‘ necessary in a democratic society ’ for a legitimate aim if it answers a ‘ pressing social need ’ and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.

In this regard, a margin of appreciation must, inevitably, be left to the national authorities, who by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The margin will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual ’ s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights .... On the other hand, in spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, there is authority that the margin of appreciation is wide, as in the planning context where the Court has found that ‘ [i]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation ’ .... The Court has also stated that in spheres such as housing, which play a central role in the welfare and economic policies of modern societies, it will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation .... It may be noted however that this was in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, not Article 8 which concerns rights of central importance to the individual ’ s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community .... Where general social and economic policy considerations have arisen in the context of Article 8 itself, the scope of the margin of appreciation depends on the context of the case, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the applicant ....",

The procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has, when fixing the regulatory framework, remained within its margin of appreciation.

The court was unable to accept this submission: in its judgment of 29 October 1971 it pointed out that there was an almost infinite variation in the relevant background of the children who would be in one way or another affected by the book, so that it was difficult to speak of \"true facts\" in this case. The views of the applicant's witnesses had been those approaching the extreme of one wing of the more broadly varied outlook on the education and upbringing of children, whereas the evidence given on behalf of the prosecution tended to cover the views of those who, although clearly tending in the opposite direction, were less radical. Particularly, when looking at the evidence on behalf of the applicant, the court had been driven to the conclusion that most of the witnesses were so uncritical of the book looked at as a whole, and so unrestrained in their praise of it, as to make them at times less convincing than otherwise they might have been. In summary the court considered that a good deal of the witnesses had been so single-minded in an extreme point of view as to forfeit in a large measure the power to judge with that degree of responsibility which makes the evidence of any great value on a matter of this sort."

At such a time a very high degree of responsibility ought to be exercised by the courts. In the present case, they had before them, as something said to be a perfectly responsible adult opinion, a work of an extreme kind, unrelieved by any indication that there were any alternative views; this was something which detracted from the opportunity for children to form a balanced view on some of the very strong advice given therein."

Mixing a very one-sided opinion with fact and purporting to be a book of reference, it would tend to undermine, for a very considerable proportion of children, many of the influences, such as those of parents, the Churches and youth organisations, which might otherwise provide the restraint and sense of responsibility for oneself which found inadequate expression in the book.",
                "The court reached the conclusion that, on the whole, and quite clearly through the mind of the child, the Schoolbook was inimical to good teacher/child relationships; in particular, there were numerous passages that it found to be subversive, not only to the authority but to the influence of the trust between children and teachers."

Passing to the tendency to deprave and corrupt, the court considered the atmosphere of the book looked at as a whole, noting that the sense of some responsibility for the community as well as to oneself, if not wholly absent, was completely subordinated to the development of the expression of itself by the child. As indications of what it considered to result in a tendency to deprave and corrupt, the court quoted or referred to the following:",
                "A. Passage headed \"Be yourself\" (p. 77):",
                "\"Maybe you smoke pot or go to bed with your boyfriend or girlfriend - and don't tell your parents or teachers, either because you don't dare to or just because you want to keep it secret.",

                "The objectionable point was that there was no reference there to the illegality of smoking pot which was only to be found many pages further on in an entirely different part of the book. Similarly there was no specific mention at all in the book of the illegality of sexual intercourse by a boy who has attained the age of fourteen and a girl who has not yet attained sixteen. It had to be remembered that the Schoolbook was indicated as a work of reference and that one looked up the part which one wanted rather than read it as a whole book.",

The passage (pp. 97-98) headed \"Intercourse and petting\" under the main heading \"Sex\": to lay this before children as young as many of those who the court considered would read the book, without any injunction about restraint or unwisdom, was to produce a tendency to deprave and corrupt.",
                "C. The passage - (pp. 103 to 105) - under the heading of \"Pornography\" and particularly the following:",

                "Unfortunately, the sane and sensible first paragraph quoted above was immediately followed by a passage suggesting to children that in pornography they might find some good ideas which they might adopt. This was to raise the real likelihood that a substantial number of children would feel it incumbent upon them to look for and practise such things. Moreover, just on the previous page there was the following passage: \"But there are other kinds - for example pictures of intercourse with animals or pictures of people hurting each other in various ways. Pornographic stories describe the same sort of thing.\" The court considered that, although it was improbable that young people would be likely to commit sexual offences with animals as a result of this, the possibility that they should practise some other forms of cruelty to one another, for sexual satisfaction, was a real likelihood in the case of a significant number of children if this got into the hands of children at a disturbed, unsettled and sexually excited stage of their lives. Such acts might very well be criminal offences just like smoking pot and sexual intercourse between a boy of at least fourteen and a girl not yet sixteen. The expression \"to deprave and corrupt\" must include the admission of or the encouragement to commit criminal offences of that kind."

Such children would, it was satisfied, include a very substantial number aged under sixteen."

It stated that no doubt there were many features about the book which, taken by themselves, were good. The unfortunate thing was that so frequently the good was intermixed with things that were bad and detracted from it.",
                "For example, much of the information about contraceptives (pp. 98-102) was very relevant and desirable which should be laid before very many children who might not otherwise readily have access to it. But it was damaged by the suggestion, backed by the recommendation to take direct action if the school authorities would not give way that every school should have at least one contraceptive vending machine (p. 101).",
                "Similarly, the treatment of the subject of homosexuality (pp. 105-107) was a factual, very compassionate, understanding and valuable statement. But again, no matter how good one assessed the value of this section, it was hopelessly damning by its setting and context, and the fact that it, only, contained any suggestion of a stable relationship in relation to sex and that marriage received no such treatment at all. Moreover, there was a very real danger that this passage would create in the minds of children a conclusion that that kind of relationship was something permanent.",
                "Again, there were passages with regard to venereal diseases (pp. 110-111), contraception (pp. 98-102) and abortion (pp. 111-116), containing dispassionately and sensibly, and on the whole completely accurately, a great deal of advice which ought not to be denied to young children. However, on the balance of probabilities, these matters could not outweigh what the court was convinced had a tendency to deprave and corrupt. The court asked itself whether, granted the degree of indecency which it found, the good likely to result from the Schoolbook was such that it ought, nevertheless, to be published in the public interest; it regretfully came to the conclusion that the burden on the appellant to show that \"publication of the article in question is justified as being for the public good\" had not been discharged.",

The Convention leaves to each Contracting State, in the first place, the task of securing the rights and liberties it enshrines. The institutions created by it make their own contribution to this task but they become involved only through contentious proceedings and once all domestic remedies have been exhausted (Article 26) (art. 26).",

In particular, it is not possible to find in the domestic law of the various Contracting States a uniform European conception of morals. The view taken by their respective laws of the requirements of morals varies from time to time and from place to place, especially in our era which is characterised by a rapid and far-reaching evolution of opinions on the subject. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements as well as on the \"necessity\" of a \"restriction\" or \"penalty\" intended to meet them. The Court notes at this juncture that, whilst the adjective \"necessary\", within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2), is not synonymous with \"indispensable\" (cf., in Articles 2 para. 2 (art. 2-2) and 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), the words \"absolutely necessary\" and \"strictly necessary\" and, in Article 15 para. 1 (art. 15-1), the phrase \"to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation\"), neither has it the flexibility of such expressions as \"admissible\", \"ordinary\" (cf. Article 4 para. 3) (art. 4-3), \"useful\" (cf. the French text of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) (P1-1), \"reasonable\" (cf.

The domestic margin of appreciation thus goes hand in hand with a European supervision. Such supervision concerns both the aim of the measure challenged and its \"necessity\"; it covers not only the basic legislation but also the decision applying it, even one given by an independent court. In this respect, the Court refers to Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention (\"decision or ... measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority\") as well as to its own case-law (Engel and others judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 41-42, para. 100).",

It was aimed above all at children and adolescents aged from twelve to eighteen. Being direct, factual and reduced to essentials in style, it was easily within the comprehension of even the youngest of such readers. The applicant had made it clear that he planned a widespread circulation. He had sent the book, with a press release, to numerous daily papers and periodicals for review or for advertising purposes. What is more, he had set a modest sale price (thirty pence), arranged for a reprint of 50,000 copies shortly after the first impression of 20,000 and chosen a title suggesting that the work was some kind of handbook for use in schools.",
                "Basically the book contained purely factual information that was generally correct and often useful, as the Quarter Sessions recognised. However, it also included, above all in the section on sex and in the passage headed \"Be yourself\" in the chapter on pupils (paragraph 32 above), sentences or paragraphs that young people at a critical stage of their development could have interpreted as an encouragement to indulge in precocious activities harmful for them or even to commit certain criminal offences. In these circumstances, despite the variety and the constant evolution in the United Kingdom of views on ethics and education, the competent English judges were entitled, in the exercise of their discretion, to think at the relevant time that the Schoolbook would have pernicious effects on the morals of many of the children and adolescents who would read it.",
                "However, the applicant maintained, in substance, that the demands of the \"protection of morals\" or, to use the wording of the 1959/1964 Acts, of the war against publications likely to \"deprave and corrupt\", were but a pretext in his case. The truth of the matter, he alleged, was that an attempt had been made to muzzle a small-scale publisher whose political leanings met with the disapproval of a fragment of public opinion. Proceedings were set in motion, said he, in an atmosphere little short of \"hysteria\", stirred up and kept alive by ultra-conservative elements. The accent in the judgment of 29 October 1971 on the anti-authoritarian aspects of the Schoolbook (paragraph 31 above) showed, according to the applicant, exactly what lay behind the case.",
                "The information supplied by Mr. Handyside seems, in fact, to show that letters from members of the public, articles in the press and action by Members of Parliament were not without some influence in the decision to seize the Schoolbook and to take criminal proceedings against its publisher. However, the Government drew attention to the fact that such initiatives could well have been explained not by some dark plot but by the genuine emotion felt by citizens faithful to traditional moral values when, towards the end of March 1971, they read in certain newspapers extracts from the book which was due to appear on 1 April. The Government also emphasised that the proceedings ended several months after the \"campaign\" denounced by the applicant and that he did not claim that it had continued in the intervening period. From this the Government concluded that the \"campaign\" in no way impaired dispassionate deliberation at the Quarter Sessions.",
                "For its part the Court finds that the anti-authoritarian aspects of the Schoolbook as such were not held in the judgment of 29 October 1971 to fall foul of the 1959/1964 Acts. Those aspects were taken into account only insofar as the appeal court considered that, by undermining the moderating influence of parents, teachers, the Churches and youth organisations, they aggravated the tendency to \"deprave and corrupt\" which in its opinion resulted from other parts of the work. It should be added that the revised edition was allowed to circulate freely by the British authorities despite the fact that the anti-authoritarian passages again appeared there in full and even, in some cases, in stronger terms (paragraph 35 above). As the Government noted, this is hard to reconcile with the theory of a political intrigue.",
                "The Court thus allows that the fundamental aim of the judgment of 29 October 1971, applying the 1959/1964 Acts, was the protection of the morals of the young, a legitimate purpose under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2). Consequently, the seizures effected on 31 March and 1 April 1971, pending the outcome of the proceedings that were about to open, also had this aim."

The Court does not share this view since the police had good reasons for trying to lay their hands on all the stock as a temporary means of protecting the young against a danger to morals on whose existence it was for the trial court to decide. The legislation of many Contracting States provides for a seizure analogous to that envisaged by section 3 of the English 1959/1964 Acts."

                "Firstly, they drew attention to the fact that the original edition of the Schoolbook was the object of no proceedings in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands and of no conviction in Scotland and that, even in England and Wales, thousands of copies circulated without impediment despite the judgment of 29 October 1971.",
                "The Court recalls that section 5 (3) of the 1959/1964 Acts provides that they shall not extend to Scotland or to Northern Ireland (paragraph 25 in fine above). Above all, it must not be forgotten that the Convention, as is shown especially by its Article 60 (art. 60), never puts the various organs of the Contracting States under an obligation to limit the rights and freedoms it guarantees. In particular, in no case does Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) compel them to impose \"restrictions\" or \"penalties\" in the field of freedom of expression; it in no way prevents them from not availing themselves of the expedients it provides for them (cf. the words \"may be subject\"). The competent authorities in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands may, in the light of local conditions, have had plausible reasons for not taking action against the book and its publisher, as may the Scottish Procurator Fiscal for not summonsing Mr. Handyside to appear in person in Edinburgh after the dismissal of the complaint under Scottish law against Stage 1 in respect of the revised edition (paragraph 19 above). Their failure to act – into which the Court does not have to enquire and which did not prevent the measures taken in England from leading to revision of the Schoolbook - does not prove that the judgment of 29 October 1971 was not a response to a real necessity, bearing in mind the national authorities'margin of appreciation.",
                "These remarks also apply, mutatis mutandis, to the circulation of many copies in England and Wales."

The Government claimed that the Director of Public Prosecutions must have taken the view that the changes dispensed him from invoking the 1959/1964 Acts again.",
                "In the Court's view, the absence of proceedings against the revised edition, which differed fairly extensively from the original edition on the points at issue (paragraphs 22-23 and 35 above), rather suggests that the competent authorities wished to limit themselves to what was strictly necessary, an attitude in conformity with Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention."

                "56. The treatment meted out to the Schoolbook and its publisher in 1971 was, according to the applicant and the minority of the Commission, all the less \"necessary\" in that a host of publications dedicated to hard core pornography and devoid of intellectual or artistic merit allegedly profit by an extreme degree of tolerance in the United Kingdom. They are exposed to the gaze of passers-by and especially of young people and are said generally to enjoy complete impunity, the rare criminal prosecutions launched against them proving, it was asserted, more often than not abortive due to the great liberalism shown by juries. The same was claimed to apply to sex shops and much public entertainment.",

The Contracting States have each fashioned their approach in the light of the situation obtaining in their respective territories; they have had regard, inter alia, to the different views prevailing there about the demands of the protection of morals in a democratic society. The fact that most of them decided to allow the work to be distributed does not mean that the contrary decision of the Inner London Quarter Sessions was a breach of Article 10 (art. 10). Besides, some of the editions published outside the United Kingdom do not include the passages, or at least not all the passages, cited in the judgment of 29 October 1971 as striking examples of a tendency to \"deprave and corrupt\"."

Both measures interfered with Mr. Handyside's right \"to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions\". The Government do not contest this but, in agreement with the majority of the Commission, maintain that justification for the measures is to be found in the exceptions attached by Article 1 of the Protocol (P1-1) to the principle enunciated in its first sentence."

Admittedly the expression \"deprived of his possessions\", in the English text, could lead one to think otherwise but the structure of Article 1 (P1-1) shows that that sentence, which originated moreover in a Belgian amendment drafted in French (Collected Edition of the\" travaux préparatoires \", document H (61) 4, pp. 1083, 1084, 1086, 1090, 1099, 1105, 1110-1111 and 1113-1114), applies only to someone who is \"deprived of ownership\" (\" privé de sa propriété \").",

Unlike Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) of the Convention, this paragraph sets the Contracting States up as sole judges of the \"necessity\" for an interference. Consequently, the Court must restrict itself to supervising the lawfulness and the purpose of the restriction in question. It finds that the contested measure was ordered pursuant to section 3 of the 1959/1964 Acts and following proceedings which it was not contested were in accordance with the law. Again, the aim of the seizure was \"the protection of morals\" as understood by the competent British authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (paragraph 52 above). And the concept of \"protection of morals\" used in Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) of the Convention, is encompassed in the much wider notion of the \"general interest\" within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of the Protocol (P1-1).",

As regards the first limb of the objection, the Court observes that prior to 1 January 1990 the enforcement of orders for possession was suspended by statute (see paragraphs 23-26 above). As Immobiliare Saffi did not satisfy the conditions laid down in the applicable statutory provisions to escape the suspension, it was not able to apply to the prefect for police assistance; nor, in the event of such an application being turned down, could it have applied to the administrative courts to challenge the prefect’s decision. It follows that such a remedy would have had no prospect of success (see the Spadea and Scalabrino v. Italy judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 315-B, p. 24, § 24 in fine ).",

While it is true that the applicant company could have sought judicial review in the administrative courts of the Livorno Prefect’s refusal to grant it police assistance, the Court observes that the administrative courts would only have had jurisdiction to set aside decisions of the prefect that failed to apply the criteria governing priority. In the instant case, Immobiliare Saffi’s complaint was not that the prefect’s decisions were arbitrary, but that the application of the criteria for determining priority had had a disproportionate impact on its right of property. Accordingly, as there was no basis for challenging the criteria for establishing priority (most of which were laid down by statute), an application to the administrative courts cannot be regarded as having been an effective remedy. Moreover, the Government have not cited any decisions of the Italian courts showing otherwise.",

In 1982 and 1983, when the last statutory extension expired, the Italian State considered it necessary to resort to emergency provisions to suspend the enforcement of non-urgent orders for possession (see paragraphs 20-26 above).",

From January 1990 onwards requests for police assistance were dealt with, as provided for by Law no. 61/89, in order of priority, without any adjustment being made to the system, even though the number of urgent evictions was going up, not down, and the existence of outstanding urgent eviction proceedings was to all intents and purposes preventing non-urgent cases, whose number was rising substantially, from being processed.",

Like the Commission, the Court considers that, in principle, a system of temporary suspension or staggering of the enforcement of court orders followed by the reinstatement of the landlord in his property is not in itself open to criticism, having regard in particular to the margin of appreciation permitted under the second paragraph of Article 1. However, such a system carries with it the risk of imposing on landlords an excessive burden in terms of their ability to dispose of their property and must accordingly provide certain procedural safeguards so as to ensure that the operation of the system and its impact on a landlord’s property rights are neither arbitrary nor unforeseeable.",
                "The Court observes that the Italian system suffered from a degree of inflexibility: by providing that cases in which the lease has been terminated on the ground that the landlord urgently needs to recover the apartment for himself or his family should always be given priority, it automatically made the enforcement of non-urgent orders for possession dependent on there being no requests warranting priority treatment. It followed that, since there were always a large number of priority requests outstanding, non-urgent orders were in practice never enforced after January 1990.",
                "The provision of police assistance, which the prefect determined by reference to an order of priority, therefore ended up depending almost entirely on the volume of prior-ranking requests for police assistance and the number of police officers at the prefect’s disposal.",

Over the ensuing six years until 1990, first I.B., and then Immobiliare Saffi, were caught by the effects of legislation that suspended, on each occasion for a period of a few months, enforcement of non-urgent possession orders (see paragraphs 23-26 above). In 1989 Immobiliare Saffi, one of 722 landlords not entitled to priority treatment in the provision of police assistance (see paragraph 16 above), gained the right under Law no. 61/89 to such assistance at some stage between 1 January 1990 and the end of 1993, at the latest. In December 1993, however, the final deadline was extended to 31 December 1995, only subsequently to be extended to 29 February 1996 and, lastly, to 26 April 1996 (see paragraphs 28-29 above).

The Court acknowledges that the Italian procedure for the enforcement of orders for possession differs in a number of ways from enforcement proceedings in the strict sense and notes that it has examined this issue before, in the case of Scollo v. Italy, in which it concluded that “ [e]ven if, in the instant case, it is not possible to speak of enforcement proceedings in the strict sense, ... Article 6 § 1 is applicable, regard being had to the purpose of the proceedings which was to settle the dispute between the applicant and his tenant ” (judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 315-C, p. 55, § 44). The Court observes that the applicant company issued proceedings before the Livorno magistrate for an order confirming termination of the lease and requiring the tenant to vacate the premises. As the tenant did not contest termination, the only outstanding point concerned the date of repossession. For so long as that date was put back owing to the tenant’s refusal to leave voluntarily, which entailed a de facto extension to the lease and a subsequent restriction on the applicant company’s right of property, there continued to be a “dispute” (“ contestation ”) for the purposes of Article 6.",
                "In any event, the Court recalls that the right to a court would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 (see the Hornsby v. Greece judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, p. 510, § 40).",

It held that the law at issue restricted the use of property; thus, the interference suffered by the applicant constituted control of the use of property, which had been legitimate and in the general interest, falling within the State ’ s wide margin of appreciation. In view of the housing situation in Malta, the new law was meant to protect persons occupying premises as their ordinary residence for a certain period of time from being evicted. The law also allowed for the rent to be reviewed as mentioned by the first-instance court. The Constitutional Court found that the sum of MTL 180 (approximately EUR 420) per year was certainly low and that it would be preferable for the executive to revise the laws determining such compensation, a task which fell outside the competence of the courts. However, the sum was higher than that payable under other rent laws in force in the country. Hence, having considered all the circumstances, it held that, although the amount of rent was close to the demarcation line below which it would qualify as unjust compensation, it did not result in a violation of the applicant ’ s property rights. In respect of Article 14, the Constitutional Court upheld the first-instance judgment, ruling that no comparison could be made in the absence of an analogous situation."

According to the applicant, for the RRB to have jurisdiction and competence, the owner must have accepted as a precondition that the act depriving him of his possessions respected his fundamental rights. This was not so in the present case. A decision by the RRB regarding the rent would be futile if the act of deprivation was found to be null and void. Moreover, it was established by law that the amount of rent the RRB could grant could not exceed MTL 180 (approximately EUR 420). The applicant further submitted that the second remedy proposed by the Government, was not applicable to the present proceedings, according to section 12 (3) of the Housing Decontrol Ordinance (see paragraph 24 above). However, even if it were, it appeared from domestic case- law that such proceedings did not generally have prospects of success. The applicant argued that it was for the Government, who were better placed to acquire the relevant information, to prove that any other property owned by a tenant was fit for use as accommodation.

The RRB ’ s minutes of the hearing held on 17 January 2002 stated that the proceedings were being adjourned pending the examination of the constitutional claim.

France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 74, ECHR 1999-V). Thus the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits.

Even if this were so, the Court does not see how applicants could be expected to be aware of tenants ’ financial situation and alternative accommodation.

Although the original grant in temporary emphyteusis had expired, contrary to his expectation that the property would revert to him vacant on termination of the contract, the 1979 Act gave the tenants the right to retain possession of the property under a new lease. Thus, the fact that he retained ownership in circumstances in which he was unable to foresee when, if ever, the property would revert to him, could not exclude a deprivation of property in the Convention sense. Indeed the concept of tenant was a wide one (see “Relevant domestic law ” paragraph 22 above) and the applicant had legitimate fears that the property would not revert to him in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the sums paid in succession tax related to a time when the property was still under the original emphyteusis and could not justify the subsequent interference."

Firstly, the law did not distinguish between tenants who owned other property and those who did not – in the present case the tenants owned other property which they occasionally rented out to third parties. Neither did it distinguish between those who did not have the means to find a residence on the free market and those who did. Secondly, the law failed to restrict the application of such measures to a reasonable time that would enable the owner to foresee the length of time for which he or she would be unable to exercise rights over the property. Thirdly, it failed to give the owner fair and adequate compensation."

Indeed, the Government ’ s argument that liberalisation of the rent laws would decrease a property ’ s market value was counter- productive. Had that been the case, it would have been a more proportionate measure to ensure availability of property at cheaper prices, without introducing arbitrary control. Furthermore, since the Government referred to the national minimum wage, it was useful to note that according to the National Statistics Office the current gross salaries in various industries amounted to approximately EUR 240 per week and therefore were more than the amount of the minimum wage. Thus, official statistics showed that the minimum salary was not the salary being generally earned. Similarly, the Government ’ s contention that market prices were inflated as a result of foreigners purchasing property did not tally with the results provided by the Government department responsible for issuing permits to such foreigners for purchasing residential premises."

Thus, even the maximum amount of rent allowed by law, namely MTL 180 (approximately EUR 420) per year, amounted to only 12.5% of its real value. This illusory compensation would be of more concern with the passage of time, since the lease was of indefinite duration. It followed that notwithstanding the State ’ s margin of appreciation, the applicant had been made to bear an excessive burden which was disproportionate to the general interest pursued."

In fact, Act XXIII only limited the already existent protection of tenants to Maltese citizens occupying the premises as their ordinary residence. Moreover, the applicant had inherited an undivided half- share of the premises from his late father in December 1995 and the rest in 1997. Thus, at the time the applicant had acquired possession, the property was already governed by the new law. What he had inherited was the “ subdirectum dominium ” of the premises, which granted him the right to receive the ground rent previously established. This had also affected the duty on succession, since at the time when he had acquired full ownership on the basis of these conditions the premises as a whole were valued at MTL 13,000. Moreover, he retained ownership of the property, albeit subject to a tenancy in favour of Mr and Mrs P. , with limited possibilities of inheritance. Given the above and the fact that the applicant ’ s possession was not worth less than when he had inherited it and what he had paid succession duty on, it could not be said that he had suffered interference with his rights."

Malta, ( no. 16756/90, Commission report of 12 January 1991, Decisions and Reports 68, pg 312 ) which dealt with a similar complaint. Indeed, the 1979 Act was aimed at preventing large scale evictions in the 1950s and 1960s of persons who had acquired houses in emphyteusis for periods in excess of sixteen years."

In the latter, in respect of similar facts, the Commission had noted that the applicants remained owners of their property interest, which they were free to dispose of, and that they continued to receive rent from the occupiers. Thus, bearing in mind the wide margin of appreciation afforded to States in regulating housing problems, the control of use was justified within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention."

Moreover, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 did not confer a right to receive a profit. The rent payable to the applicant was reasonable in view of the value of the property at the time when he inherited it. Furthermore, it was not clear on what basis the applicant ’ s valuations, which contrasted with those relied on for succession purposes, had been carried out. They were speculative and appeared to be based on the assumption that similar properties would fetch the same price on the open market. The valuation did not take into account the change in market conditions which would be brought about if all the rent laws affecting general social conditions were to be abolished."

Reiterating the reasoning of the Constitutional Court, the Government further submitted that the issue of proportionality had to be examined in the light of the necessity of such social measures and the average monthly income of the population ( the minimum wage in 2007 had been approximately EUR 140 per week). Therefore, one had to consider the economic and social reality in the country as a whole and not just property speculation. Indeed, if market rents, which were also inflated beyond local market conditions because of foreigners ’ interest in purchasing such properties at higher prices, were to be applied to all premises this would result in severe hardship for many."

Section 12( 2 )(b) (i) of the Housing (Decontrol) Ordinance (see “Relevant domestic law ” above ) provided for the rent payable to be a reflection of the original ground rent and was therefore a fair and proportionate rent in the circumstances.

Finally the Government submitted that the law was not arbitrary and that it provided for procedural safeguards in the form of recourse to an impartial tribunal established by law, namely the RRB for the establishment of rent conditions, with an appeal on points of law to the Court of Appeal. Moreover, the operation of the whole system, although not based on means testing of tenants, did not allow for any reductions in rent and applied only to tenants who used the property as their ordinary residence and did not have suitable alternative accommodation. This provided sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness. Referring to Mellacher and Others v. Austria ( 19 December 1989, Series A no. 169 ), they recalled that legislation instituting a system of rent control and aiming, inter alia, at establishing a standard of rents for equivalent flats at an appropriate level must, perforce, be general in nature. It would hardly be consistent with these aims nor would it be practicable to make the reductions of rent dependent on the specific situation of each tenant.",

As the Court has stated on a number of occasions, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 comprises three distinct rules: the first rule, set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property; the second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions; the third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, inter alia, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, § 37; Beyeler v.

The Government contested the assertion that there had been an interference with the applicant ’ s property rights within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention on the basis that the law at issue was already in force when the applicant inherited the property. The Court notes that the application of legislation affecting landlords ’ rights over many years constitutes a continued interference for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Hutten-Czapska v. Poland [GC], no. 35014/97, § 210, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... ). Thus, even considering that the interference in question, as in Hutten-Czapska, was the result of subsequent regulatory regimes limiting owners ’ rights, this does not mean that there was no interference. On the contrary, this means that both the applicant ’ s parents and subsequently the applicant suffered interference with their property rights. For the purposes of this case, however, the complaint is confined to the application of Act XXIII of 1979 to the applicant ’ s rights over his property."

In particular, the second paragraph of Article 1, while recognising that States have the right to control the use of property, subjects their right to the condition that it be exercised by enforcing “laws”. Moreover, the principle of lawfulness presupposes that the applicable provisions of domestic law are sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v.

Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the “general” or “public” interest. The notion of “public” or “general” interest is necessarily extensive. In particular, spheres such as housing of the population, which modern societies consider a prime social need and which plays a central role in the welfare and economic policies of Contracting States, may often call for some form of regulation by the State. In that sphere decisions as to whether, and if so when, it may fully be left to the play of free market forces or whether it should be subject to State control, as well as the choice of measures for securing the housing needs of the community and of the timing for their implementation, necessarily involve consideration of complex social, economic and political issues. Finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, the Court has on many occasions declared that it will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is in the “public” or “general” interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Hutten-Czapska, cited above, §§ 1 6 5-166 )."

As the Court has repeatedly stated, a fair balance must be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights, the search for such a fair balance being inherent in the whole of the Convention. The requisite balance will not be struck where the person concerned bears an individual and excessive burden (see Sporrong and Lönnroth cited above, §§ 69-74, and Brumărescu v.

In assessing compliance with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court must make an overall examination of the various interests in issue, bearing in mind that the Convention is intended to safeguard rights that are “practical and effective”. It must look behind appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of. In cases concerning the operation of wide-ranging housing legislation, that assessment may involve not only the conditions of the rent received by individual landlords and the extent of the State ’ s interference with freedom of contract and contractual relations in the lease market, but also the existence of procedural and other safeguards ensuring that the operation of the system and its impact on a landlord ’ s property rights are neither arbitrary nor unforeseeable. Uncertainty – be it legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities – is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State ’ s conduct. Indeed, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time, and in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy, [GC], no. 22774/93, § 54, ECHR 1999-V; and Broniowski, cited above, § 151)."

Nevertheless, that discretion, however considerable, is not unlimited and its exercise cannot entail consequences at variance with the Convention standards (see, mutatis mutandis, Hutten-Czapska, cited above, § 223)."

Indeed, in analogous circumstances the Commission found that the said interference had been justified in view of the wide margin of appreciation of States in this sphere. However, the Court recalls that this margin is still subject to European supervision and what might have been justified eighteen years ago, the Commission decision having been delivered in 1991, will not necessarily be justified today. As stated by the Government, Act XXIII of 1979 had as its aim to prevent large- scale evictions in the 1950s and 1960s. Thus, in its balancing exercise the Court will have to determine whether such a degree of tenant protection, to the detriment of owners, is still justified fifty years later. It notes that, as stated by the Government, the minimum wage in 2007 was approximately EUR 600 per month, while back in 1974 ( the date when Malta adopted a national minimum wage ), it amounted to less than EUR 100 per month."

It notes that the applicant could not exercise his right of use in terms of physical possession as the house was occupied by the tenants and he could not terminate the lease. Thus, while the applicant remained the owner of the property he was subjected to a forced landlord-tenant relationship for an indefinite period of time. It has already been established that the applicant did not have an effective remedy enabling him to evict the tenants (see, a contrario, Velosa Barreto, cited above), either on the basis of his own need or that of his relatives or on the basis that Mr and Mrs P. were not deserving of such protection, as they owned alternative accommodation. Consequently, the application of the law itself lacked adequate procedural safeguards aimed at achieving a balance between the interests of the tenants and those of the owners. The Court further considers that the possibility of the tenant leaving the premises voluntarily was remote, especially since the tenancy could be inherited. The Government ’ s contention that transfer of the tenancy by inheritance was improbable was not substantiated and remains to be considered as pure speculation. It follows that these circumstances inevitably left the applicant in uncertainty as to whether he would ever be able to recover his property."

Moreover, both the amount of rent received by the applicant, namely EUR 210 per year and the maximum amount of rent the applicant could obtain, namely EUR 420, were, as confirmed by the Constitutional Court, “certainly low”. Indeed, the amount of rent contrasts starkly with the market value of the premises as submitted by the applicant. The Court considers that, State control over levels of rent falls into a sphere subject to a wide margin of appreciation by the State and its application may often cause significant reductions in the amount of rent chargeable (see, in particular, Mellacher and Others, cited above, § 45). Nevertheless, this may not lead to results which are manifestly unreasonable, such as amounts of rent allowing only a minimal profit."

The latter was requested to bear most of the social and financial costs of supplying housing accommodation to Mr and Mrs P. (see, mutatis mutandis, Hutten-Czapska, cited above, § 225).

The assumption that she would have had to make a considerable mental and physical effort in order to provide for her basic living needs (all the citizens of Zadar who remained in the town, from the youngest to the oldest, were exposed to the same living conditions) does not justify her failure to return to Zadar and, accordingly, does not constitute a justified reason for the non-use of the flat.”"

In the case of Phosphates in Morocco (Preliminary Objections) between Italy and France, the Italian Government maintained, inter alia, that the dispossession of certain Italian nationals resulting from the decision of the French Mines Department of 8 January 1925, and the denial of justice that had followed, were inconsistent with international obligations incumbent on France. The ratification of the declaration by which France accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the PCIJ was filed on 25 April 1931. In its judgment of 14 June 1938 ( PCIJ, Series A/B, no. 74, pp. 10-30 ), when examining France ’ s preliminary objection based on the lack of jurisdiction ratione temporis, the PCIJ held:",

                "[The Court ’ s compulsory jurisdiction ] only exists within the limits within which it has been accepted. In this case, the terms on which the objection ratione temporis submitted by the French Government is founded, are perfectly clear: the only situations or facts falling under the compulsory jurisdiction are those which are subsequent to the ratification and with regard to which the dispute arose, that is to say, those which must be considered as being the source of the dispute. [p. 23]",
                "... The situations and the facts which form the subject of the limitation ratione temporis have to be considered from the point of view both of their date in relation to the date of ratification and of their connection with the birth of the dispute. Situations or facts subsequent to the ratification could serve to found the Court ’ s compulsory jurisdiction only if it was with regard to them that the dispute arose. [p. 24]",
                "[The] decision of the Mines Department, owing to its date, falls outside the Court ’ s jurisdiction. The Italian Government has sought to avert this consequence by arguing ... that the decision of 1925 constituted only an uncompleted violation of international law; that this violation only became definitive as a result of certain acts subsequent to the crucial date and of the final refusal to remedy in any way the situation created in 1925, and that these acts gave rise to the dispute between the two Governments. [p. 27]",
                "The Court cannot regard the denial of justice alleged by the Italian Government as a factor giving rise to the present dispute. In its Application, the Italian Government has represented the decision of the Department of Mines as an unlawful international act ... That being so, it is in this decision that we should look for the violation of international law – a definitive act which would, by itself, directly involve international responsibility. This act being attributable to the State and described as contrary to the treaty right of another State, international responsibility would be established immediately as between the two States. In these circumstances the alleged denial of justice ... merely results in allowing the unlawful act to subsist. It exercises no influence either on the accomplishment of the act or on the responsibility ensuing from it. [p. 28]",
                "... [ T]he complaint of a denial of justice cannot be separated from the criticism which the Italian Government directs against the decision of the Department of Mines of January 8th, 1925, for the Court could not regard the denial of justice as established unless it had first satisfied itself as to the existence of the rights of the private citizens alleged to have been refused judicial protection. But the Court could not reach such a conclusion without calling in question the decision of the Department of Mines of 1925. It follows that an examination of the justice of this complaint could not be undertaken without extending the Court ’ s jurisdiction to a fact which, by reason of its date, is not subject thereto.",

Germany ), Preliminary Objections, Liechtenstein maintained that certain decisions by German courts delivered in the period between 1995 and 1998 declaring inadmissible the action of Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein for restitution of a painting, which had been confiscated by Czechoslovakia on 21 June 1945 under “the Beneš Decrees”, were in breach of international law. In these inadmissibility decisions the German courts relied on the Convention on the Settlement of Matters Arising out of the War and the Occupation, signed in 1952, as amended in 1954, which had come into force on 5 May 1955 (“the Settlement Convention”). In order to found the jurisdiction of the ICJ, Liechtenstein relied in its Application on Article 1 of the European Convention for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes of 29 April 1957, which came into force between Liechtenstein and Germany on 18 February 1980.

The Court concludes that, although these proceedings were instituted by Liechtenstein as a result of decisions by German courts regarding a painting by Pieter van Laer, these events have their source in specific measures taken by Czechoslovakia in 1945, which led to the confiscation of property owned by some Liechtenstein nationals, including Prince Franz Josef II of Liechtenstein, as well as in the special regime created by the Settlement Convention. The decisions of the German courts in the 1990s dismissing the claim filed by Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein for the return of the painting to him were taken on the basis of Article 3, Chapter Six, of the Settlement Convention. While these decisions triggered the dispute between Liechtenstein and Germany, the source or real cause of the dispute is to be found in the Settlement Convention and the Beneš Decrees.

In its admissibility decision the Chamber had erred when emphasising the difference between the instantaneous character of the dismissal decision in Jovanović and the proceedings for the termination of a specially protected tenancy in the present case. It had overlooked the fact that the proceedings against the applicant had been instituted because she had ceased to occupy her flat for an uninterrupted period exceeding six months. That situation had begun when the applicant left the flat in July 1991 and continued until February 1992, when the Zadar Municipality brought a civil action against her. All of the domestic court decisions had been based exclusively on the applicant ’ s absence during that period and on whether or not there was a justified reason for that absence. In its decision, which was the only one given in the case after the date of Croatia ’ s ratification of the Convention on 5 November 1997 (“ the critical date ”), the Constitutional Court had limited itself to examining whether the substantive law in force during the above-mentioned period had been properly applied.

That aim had not been achieved until the final outcome of the proceedings in late 1999. The directly decisive decision was therefore that of the Constitutional Court since that court had examined whether her rights to respect for her home and to the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions had been violated; and it had the power to quash the Supreme Court ’ s judgment and remit the case for a fresh decision. Therefore, the crucial facts of the case had been those State acts, subsequent to her absence from the flat, which had breached her Convention rights.

Since the scope of the Court ’ s jurisdiction is determined by the Convention itself, in particular by Article 32, and not by the parties ’ submissions in a particular case, the mere absence of a plea of incompatibility cannot extend that jurisdiction. To hold the contrary would mean that where a respondent State waived its right to plead or omitted to plead incompatibility, the Court would have to rule on the merits of a complaint against that State concerning a right not guaranteed by the Convention or on a Convention right not yet binding on it, for example by virtue of a valid reservation clause (incompatibility ratione materiae ) or because it has not yet ratified an additional Protocol (incompatibility ratione personae ).",

In reaching that conclusion it explained that the six - month rule, in reflecting the wish of the Contracting Parties to prevent past decisions being called into question after an indefinite lapse of time, served the interests not only of the respondent Government but also of legal certainty as a value in itself. It added that the rule marked out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the organs of the Convention and signalled to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision was no longer possible. Having regard to the fact that the purpose of limitations ratione temporis is to preclude the possibility of submitting to the Court, by means of an application, facts dating from a period when the respondent State was not in a position to foresee the international responsibility or legal proceedings to which these facts might give rise, the Court considers that the above reasoning concerning the six - month rule applies a fortiori in the present instance."

Turkey accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court only in respect of facts and events which had occurred subsequent to 22 January 1990, the day on which it filed its declaration. The Court did not accept the Turkish Government ’ s argument that the relevant principal fact for establishing jurisdiction ratione temporis was the applicant ’ s statement to the journalists. Rather, the principal fact was the applicant ’ s conviction, since it was that conviction which constituted interference with the applicant ’ s rights under Article 10.

It directly creates rights for private individuals within their jurisdiction ( see, inter alia, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 239, Series A no. 25 ). Therefore the above rule on non-retroactivity of treaties is relevant not only for the Court itself but also, first and foremost, for the domestic courts when they are called upon to apply the Convention.

Moreover, since the Convention was incorporated into the Croatian legal system in the form of a statute (see paragraph 36 above), and given that under the 1990 Croatian Constitution statutes could not be applied retroactively (see paragraph 34 above), the Constitutional Court could not in the instant case have applied the Convention when reviewing the Supreme Court ’ s judgment.

Consequently, the applicant could not be certain of the outcome of her application.

It was aimed at providing a substitute source of income in cases where persons had lost their wages owing to the need to terminate their employment in order to take care of their sick children on a permanent basis.

Despite the margin of appreciation given to the State, the Court must nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review, determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant ’ s right to property (see Rosinski v Poland, no. 17373/02, § 78, 17 July 2007). The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as a whole, including therefore the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, § 38, Series A no. 332, and The former King of Greece and Others, cited above, § 89). Thus the balance to be maintained between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of fundamental rights is upset if the person concerned has had to bear a “disproportionate burden” (see, among many other authorities, The Holy Monasteries v. Greece, 9 December 1994, §§ 70-71, Series A no. 301-A)."

The amount of the applicant ’ s pre-retirement benefit is approximately 50 % lower that her “EWK” pension (see paragraph 26 above). Even though the decision to grant the benefit was backdated, the benefit due for the period between 25 October 2002 and 31 July 2004 was paid without any interest (see paragraph 26 above).

[GC], no. 48321/99, § 121, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; and Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 35 (b), ECHR 2004 ‑ IX). Nor does it guarantee, as such, any right to a pension of a particular amount (see, among other authorities, Müller v. Austria, no. 5849/72, Commission’s report of 1 October 1975, Decisions and Reports (DR) 3, p. 25; T. v. Sweden, no. 10671/83, Commission decision of 4 March 1985, DR 42, p. 229; Janković v.

However, where a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a pension – whether or not conditional on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation has to be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 64, ECHR 2010 ‑ ...). The reduction or the discontinuance of a pension may therefore constitute interference with possessions that needs to be justified (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 40; Rasmussen v. Poland, no. 38886/05, § 71, 28 April 2009; and Wieczorek, cited above, § 57)."

According to the Court’s case ‑ law, the national authorities, because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the Convention system, it is thus for those authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. Moreover, the notion of “public interest” is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws concerning pensions or welfare benefits involves consideration of various economic and social issues. The Court accepts that in the area of social legislation including in the area of pensions States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation, which in the interests of social justice and economic well-being may legitimately lead them to adjust, cap or even reduce the amount of pensions normally payable to the qualifying population including, like in the instant case, by means of rules on incompatibility between the receipt of a pension and paid employment. However, any such measures must be implemented in a non-discriminatory manner and comply with the requirements of proportionality. Therefore, the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing such policies should be a wide one, and its judgment as to what is “in the public interest” should be respected unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see, for example, Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 61, 16 March 2010; Andrejeva v.

After meeting the legal criteria for retirement, and encouraged by the pension system to which they had contributed over a number of years, the applicants reopened their private practices on a part-time basis whilst at the same time receiving their pensions (see, mutatis mutandis, Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 44, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX)."

Even though the applicants have submitted no data as to how much exactly they earned in their private practice, and as the Government have offered no evidence to the contrary, in view of the fact that they worked on a part-time basis only the Court considers that the pension still constituted a considerable part of their gross monthly income (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 44)."

She claimed that the value of her personal savings that had accrued in her accounts by 1991 had significantly dropped following the economic reforms. Her savings were the result of decades of hard work, and she had intended to buy a flat with the money. However, the State had not revalued the amounts on deposit to offset the effects of inflation, as it had been required to do by the Law on revaluation and protection of the savings of citizens of the Russian Federation enacted on 10 May 1995 ( Федеральный закон «О восстановлении и защите сбережений граждан Российской Федерации» – “the Savings Act”).",

The court rejected the defendants'main argument that the reimbursement scheme under the Savings Act could not be implemented in practice since no special secondary legislation had been passed. Noting that the Savings Act recognised the guaranteed deposits as the State's internal debt and that the State had not introduced the necessary rules in time to enable the debt to be repaid, the court held that the defendants were liable under the civil law."

It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see Hornsby v.

By lodging an application for judicial review with the State ’ s highest administrative court, the litigant seeks not only the annulment of the impugned decisions but also and above all the removal of its effects. The effective protection of a party to such proceedings and the restoration of legality presuppose an obligation on the administrative authorities ’ part to comply with the judgment of that court. The administrative authorities form one element of a State subject to the rule of law and their interests accordingly coincide with the need for the proper administration of justice.

There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 75, ECHR 1999-III, and Immobiliare Saffi, cited above, § 49)."

However, it finds that those actions did not significantly slow down the bankruptcy proceedings because, apart from the request for a composition with the creditors (the date of which has not been given), all the applications were made in or after 1996 and were decided expeditiously by the courts concerned (for instance, the application for a referral to the Constitutional Court was decided within twelve days and the application for a stay of the order for sale within one day).",

The Government contended that the purpose of preventing bankrupts from taking legal proceedings was to protect a third-party right, namely “the interests of the bankrupt's creditors”. Furthermore, the restriction applied solely to issues concerning pecuniary rights and, accordingly, was within the State's margin of appreciation. The Government added that the bankrupt was in any event represented in court by the trustee in bankruptcy. Lastly, the applicant had not sustained any loss, as he had instituted various court proceedings while the bankruptcy proceedings were pending ( for instance, an application on 5 April 1996 for a referral to the Constitutional Court and an application on 17 April 1996 for a stay of execution of the order for sale)."

It reiterates that Article 6 § 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way it embodies the “right to a court”, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, pp. 17-18, §§ 35-36). This right extends only to disputes (“ contestation ”) over “civil rights and obligations ” which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law (see, inter alia, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, pp. 46-47, § 81, and Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, pp. 16-17, § 36)."

However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce a person's access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired; lastly, such limitations will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if they do not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Levages Prestations Services v. France, judgment of 23 October 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, p. 1543, § 40 )."

The Court considers that the purpose of the restriction on the applicant's capacity to take legal proceedings is to assign the role of representing the bankrupt in court in respect of issues arising over the bankrupt's pecuniary rights to the trustee in bankruptcy as, once the bankruptcy order has been lodged, he is responsible for the administration of the bankrupt's assets. Indeed, it is self-evident in the Court's view that disputes over such matters may have major repercussions on the assets and liabilities of the bankrupt estate. The Court consequently finds that the restriction is intended to protect the rights and interests of others, namely those of the bankrupt's creditors. The Court must go on to examine whether the consequences suffered by the applicant were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."

Two or more basic banks could form an associated bank through a self-management agreement, while preserving their legal personality. In the SFRY, there were more than 150 basic banks and nine associated banks ( namely Jugobanka Beograd, Beogradska udružena banka Beograd, Vojvođanska banka Novi Sad, Kosovska banka Priština, Udružena banka Hrvatske Zagreb, Ljubljanska banka Ljubljana, Privredna banka Sarajevo, Stopanska banka Skopje and Investiciona banka Titograd )."

In addition, the National Bank of Yugoslavia was required to grant national-currency loans (initially, interest-free) to commercial banks to the value of the redeposited foreign currency. It should be underlined, however, that such redepositing was as a rule only a paper transaction, because commercial banks had insufficient liquid funds: it would appear that commercial banks redeposited in total 12. 2 billion United States dollars (USD), out of which only USD 1. 7 billion (approximately 14%) was actually transferred to the National Bank of Yugoslavia (see Kovačić and Others v. Slovenia [GC], nos. 44574/98, 45133/98 and 48316/99, § § 36 and 39, ECHR 2008 -...; see also decision AP 164/04 of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 1 April 2006, § 53).

It suspended the legal authority of the Entities within the whole territory of the pre-war Brčko municipality and transferred all of the Entity powers to the newly-created Brčko District under the exclusive sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina and international supervision. The Brčko District was formally inaugurated on 8 March 2000. Nevertheless, Entity legislation continued to apply in the District until modified by the Supervisor of Brčko or the District Assembly.

One of the effects of this is that the existence of a “public interest” required under the second sentence, or the “general interest” referred to in the second paragraph, are in fact corollaries of the principle set forth in the first sentence, so that an interference with the exercise of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 must also pursue an aim in the public interest."

                "51. To begin with, it is a well - known fact that the global economic crisis of the 1970s hit the SFRY particularly hard. The SFRY turned to international capital markets and soon became one of the most indebted countries in the world. When the international community backed away from the loose lending practices of the 1970s, the SFRY resorted to foreign-currency savings of its citizens to pay foreign debts and finance imports. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has established that, as a result, a major part of the original deposits ceased to exist before the dissolution of the SFRY (see its Resolution 1410 (2004) adopted on 23 November 2004 – reproduced in Kovačić and Others, cited above, § 188 – as well as the explanatory memorandum by Mr Erik Jurgens). While it is true that “old” foreign-currency claims as such survived the dissolution of the SFRY and that Bosnia and Herzegovina assumed full liability for such claims in locally based banks, the fact that the original deposits had been spent, in all probability, by the former regime explains why Bosnia and Herzegovina has not been able to allow the uncontrolled withdrawal of these deposits."

The Court observes, however, that the applicant is entitled to receive his entire “old” foreign-currency savings by 27 March 2015 in eight instalments and has already thus received BAM 5,237.44. Given the catastrophic effects of the 1992-95 war and the ongoing reforms of the State's political, legal and economic structure, the Court accepts that this solution remained within the respondent State's margin of appreciation."

While understandable in view of past abuses (see paragraphs 19 and 47 above), such concerns are unsubstantiated. Unlike privatisation certificates under the former legislation, government bonds under the current legislation may be traded on the Stock Exchange, which, together with the interest on the bonds (at an annual rate of 2.5%) and the relatively short amortisation period, should ensure a significantly higher price. Indeed, such bonds are at present sold in the Republika Srpska for around 90% of their nominal value. There is no reason why such bonds should be traded for anything less in the Brčko District or, once issued, in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Anyhow, the applicant is not required to sell government bonds in order to obtain his “old” foreign-currency savings. He could instead opt for cash payments in eight instalments. As opposed to privatisation certificates under the former legislation, government bonds under the current legislation are not designed to replace cash payments. On the contrary, their function is to make early cash payments possible for those who are unable or unwilling to wait until the end of the amortisation period ( 27 March 2015 in the applicant's case)."

As regards the interest rate for the period from 1 January 1992 until 15 April 2006, which the applicant and the third parties considered to be too low, the Government submitted that it corresponded to the average interest rate applicable to overnight foreign-currency deposits. However, according to an official report submitted by the Government, at the request of the Court, in another case ( Kudić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 28971/05, 9 December 2008 ), the relevant interest rate appears to be much higher – 2.33% on average ( 4.06% in 1992, 2.82% in 1993, 2.43% in 1994, 2.70% in 1995, 2.49% in 1996, 3.16% in 1997, 3.01% in 1998, 2.78% in 1999, 2.4% in 2000, 2.2% in 2001, 1.64% in 2002, 1.22% in 2003, 0.9% in 2004, 0.82% in 2005 ).",

In the Brčko District, government bonds, although due on 31 March 2008, were issued only on 30 June 2009. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it appears that bonds, likewise due on 31 March 2008, have not yet been issued. As a result, the applicant is still unable to sell them on the Stock Exchange and thus obtain early cash payments (see paragraph 53 above ). Moreover, the instalments due under the current legislation on 27 September 2008 were paid almost three months later ( on 24 December 2008 ) in the Brčko District and almost eight months later ( on 14 May 2009 ) in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Such measures must also be taken in respect of other persons in the applicant's position, notably by solving the problems that have led to the Court's findings (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000- VIII; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 120, ECHR 2002- VI; Lukenda v.

Poland [GC], no. 35014/97, §§ 231- 39, ECHR 2006- VIII ).

Another important aim of the pilot-judgment procedure is to induce the respondent State to resolve large numbers of individual cases arising from the same structural problem at domestic level, thus implementing the principle of subsidiarity which underpins the Convention system. Indeed, the Court's task as defined by Article 19, that is, to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto”, is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in large series of cases (see, by analogy, E. G. v. Poland (dec.), no. 504 25/99, § 27, ECHR 2008- ... ). The object of the pilot-judgment procedure is to facilitate the speediest and most effective resolution of a dysfunction affecting the protection of the Convention rights in question in the national legal order (see Wolkenberg and Others v. Poland (dec.), no. 50003/99, § 34, ECHR 2007 ‑ XIV ). While the respondent State's action should primarily aim at the resolution of such a dysfunction and at the introduction, where appropriate, of effective domestic remedies in respect of the violations in question, it may also include ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements. The Court may decide to adjourn the examination of all similar cases, thus giving the respondent State an opportunity to settle them in such various ways (see, by analogy, Broniowski, cited above, § 198, and Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey, no. 46347/99, § 50, 22 December 2005 ). If, however, the respondent State fails to adopt such measures following a pilot judgment and continues to violate the Convention, the Court will have no choice but to resume the examination of all similar applications pending before it and to take them to judgment so as to ensure effective observance of Convention (see, by analogy, E.G. v.

Notably, the Court considers that government bonds must be issued and any outstanding instalments must be paid in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina within six months from the date on which the present judgment becomes final. Within the same time-limit, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina must also undertake, as the Republika Srpska and the Brčko District did (see paragraph 31 above), to pay default interest at the statutory rate in the event of late payment of any forthcoming instalment.

The possibility of discrimination [between servicemen who retired after the entry into force of Ordinance no. 136/2000, whose allowances were calculated in relation to net pay, and those who retired before that date, who were entitled to allowances based on gross pay] is not left to the discretion of the employer or of the courts, but is a matter for the legislature, which should have taken this into account and found an appropriate solution in the course of the legislative process, by means of precise and specific regulatory provisions.

These include an obligation to nullify all the illegal consequences of a violation of Community law either directly or, in default, by providing effective reparation for the resulting damage. It follows that the fact that a taxpayer which alleges that it has been taxed on the basis of a statutory provision that is incompatible with the objectives of a Community directive has first referred the issue of taxation to the tax court, which refused to accept that such incompatibility could serve as a cause of action, cannot by itself render inadmissible a claim made by the taxpayer on the basis of the obligations arising under the aforementioned Treaty for reparation for the damage it has sustained as a result of a failure to transpose the objectives of the directive into domestic law.",

Although the Ninth Directive of 26 June 1978, which was notified to the French State on 30 June 1978, granted France an extension of time – until 1 January 1979 – in which to transpose the provisions of the Sixth Directive, it is construed by the Court of Justice of the European Economic Communities as having no retroactive effect. Thus, the provisions of Article 256 of the General Tax Code as worded prior to 1 January 1979 requiring payment of value-added tax on insurance broking activities of the type carried on by the Jacques Dangeville company were for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978 incompatible with the objectives set by the Sixth Directive. Accordingly, contrary to the Administrative Court 's decision, the applicant company's claim that the State is liable for the situation that has thus arisen and should be ordered to make good the loss it has sustained as a result of the illegal situation brought about by its being required to pay value-added tax for the above-mentioned period is well-founded.",

Thus, the damage for which the company is entitled to claim reparation is equal to the amount of the value-added tax it paid for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978 and comes to FRF 129,845.86.”"

The claim by S.A. Jacques Dangeville which the Administrative Court of Appeal examined in the impugned judgment was for payment of 'compensation' in an amount equal to the amount of value-added tax that had thus been paid, by way of reparation for the 'damage' which that tax liability had caused the company to sustain, on the ground that that damage was attributable to the French State's delay in transposing the objectives of the Directive into domestic law. It follows that, as submitted by the Minister of the Budget, the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the fact that the company '[had] first referred the issue of taxation to the tax court' did not render inadmissible a claim for reparation in which the only alleged damage was the damage resulting from the payment of the tax.

Although the Ninth Directive of 26 June 1978, which was notified to the French State on 30 June 1978, granted France an extension of time – until 1 January 1979 – in which to transpose the provisions of the Sixth Directive, it is construed by the Court of Justice of the European Economic Communities as having no retroactive effect. Thus, before 30 June 1978 it was unable to afford the French authorities a defence for their failure to enact provisions complying with the objectives of the Sixth Directive on time.",

Accordingly, it is to that extent necessary to rule that those provisions of Articles 256 and 261-4-1 o were inapplicable for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978. It follows that the submission by the S.A. Revert et Badelon firm, which carries on an activity as insurance brokers, that there was no basis in law for the demand for it to pay value-added tax on its business dealings during the period from 1 April to 30 June 1978 is well-founded.",

Subsequently, the applicant company was rightly charged value-added tax for the period from 1 July to 31 December 1978 on the basis of the provisions of Articles 256 and 261-4-1 o of the General Tax Code that remained applicable.",

The Court has thus acknowledged, in the interests of legal certainty which protects both the taxpayer and the authority concerned, that the setting of reasonable limitation periods for bringing proceedings is compatible with Community law. Such periods cannot be regarded as rendering virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Community law, even if the expiry of those periods necessarily entails the dismissal, in whole or in part, of the action brought (see, in particular, Case 33/76 Rewe v.

Article 56 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community dated 25 March 1957, which does not contain any provision empowering bodies of the European Communities to make regulations on public-policy grounds that are directly applicable in the member States, provides that the coordination of provisions laid down by law or regulation 'providing for special treatment for foreign nationals on grounds of public policy, public security or public health' shall be assured by directives issued by the Council on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the Assembly. It is clear from Article 189 of the Treaty of 25 March 1957 that while such directives are binding upon each member State 'as to the result to be achieved' and while in order to achieve the prescribed results the national authorities are required to adapt the legislation and regulations of the member States to comply with the directives addressed to them, it is solely for those authorities to determine the form implementation of the directives will take and to decide, subject to supervision by the domestic courts, how to give effect to the directives in domestic law. Thus, regardless of any instructions they may contain for the member States, directives cannot be pleaded in aid of appeals by nationals of those States against individual administrative acts. It follows that Mr Cohn- Bendit's submission to the Paris Administrative Court in support of his application for an order quashing the Minister of the Interior's decision of 2 February 1976, on the ground that it contravened the provisions of the Directive issued on 25 February 1964 by the Council of the European Communities with a view to coordinating, in accordance with the conditions laid down by Article 56 of the Treaty of Rome, the special measures taken to control the movement and residence of aliens on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, is unfounded. Accordingly, in the absence of any contention that the regulatory measures taken by the French Government in order to comply with the directives issued by the Council of the European Communities are unlawful, the decision to be taken on Mr Cohn- Bendit's appeal cannot under any circumstances turn upon the interpretation of the Directive of 25 February 1964. It follows, without there being any need to examine the grounds of the appeal, that the Minister of the Interior's submission is well-founded, namely the Paris Administrative Court erred in its impugned judgment of 21 December 1977 in referring to the Court of Justice of the European Communities the issues concerning the interpretation of that Directive and staying the proceedings pending the Court of Justice's decision ...”"

Article 5-1 of the Directive of the Council of the European Communities dated 19 December 1972, which was issued with a view to implementing those provisions with regard to manufactured tobacco and the provisions of Article 30 of the Treaty, which prohibits quantitative restrictions and all measures having equivalent effect, provides: 'Manufacturers and importers shall be free to determine the maximum retail selling price for each of their products. This provision may not, however, hinder implementation of the national systems of legislation regarding the control of price levels or the observance of imposed prices.' As the Court of Justice of the European Communities ruled in finding infringements in its judgments of 21 June 1983 and 13 July 1988, the only provisions whose application is reserved by Article 5-1 of the Directive are provisions of national legislation of a general nature that are intended to curb increases in prices. The aforementioned provisions of section 6 of the Law of 24 May 1976 confer on the government a special power to fix the price of tobacco imported from member States of the European Community, independently of the application of the national legislation regarding the control of price levels. They thus enable the government to fix the sale price of imported tobacco in conditions that were not contemplated by Article 5-1 of the Directive of 19 December 1972 and are incompatible with the objectives set out in that Directive. It follows from this that Article 10 of the decree of 31 December 1976 referred to above, which was issued on the basis of section 6 of the Law of 24 May 1976, which must be regarded as inapplicable, is itself devoid of statutory basis.

Consequently, French courts will refuse to apply French law if it is contrary to European law. In other words, they carry out a form of verification of the compatibility of the statute with Community law that is very similar to a review of constitutionality. Basically, the reasoning of the Court of Cassation extends the principle established by Article 55 of the Constitution that international treaties take precedence over statutes. The Court of Cassation relies on two series of arguments: firstly, implicit in the initial treaties is a move towards abandonment of sovereignty by the States and the creation of genuine supra-sovereignty in favour of the Community bodies. Secondly, since the national courts are responsible for applying the provisions emanating from that supra-sovereignty directly, they cannot give precedence to domestic law as, in this system, it is necessarily infra-sovereign (Court of Cassation, Société des cafés Jacques Vabre, 24 May 1975 ...).",

It has shown itself to be 'essentially a national jurisdiction, which is persuaded of the excellence of the national system and has resolved to act as the guardian of national legality' (C.-A.

Firstly, it has proscribed all verification of the compatibility of legislation with Community law: according to a Government Commissioner, the administrative courts 'may not criticise or disregard a statute, even on the ground that it violates international law or, more particularly, Community law'. Secondly, on a more specific point, the Conseil d'Etat has chosen not to follow the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities that has blurred the distinction between regulations and directives... The Conseil d'Etat affirms, on the contrary, [that] 'regardless of any instructions they may contain' [directives] cannot be pleaded in aid of an application for review of an individual act. Directives do, however, impose an obligation on the national authorities to adapt their legislation and regulations so as to comply with the directive (see Cohn- Bendit, cited above). Consequently, nationals of member States may challenge the validity of domestic regulatory measures by reference to the Community directives which they purport to implement or which they disregard.”",

It also had a legitimate expectation of recovering its debt. From 1 January to 30 June 1978 the French value-added tax (VAT) legislation had contravened Community law as set out in Article 13-B-a of the Sixth Directive of 17 May 1977. The applicant company pointed out that the administrative circular of 2 January 1986 had been issued before the Conseil d'Etat 's judgment of 19 March 1986 dismissing its appeal.

In addition, the administrative courts did accept jurisdiction to verify the compatibility of international and French norms, as the new precedent laid down in 1996 in S.A. Revert et Badelon did no more than to apply a line of authorities that dated back to 1989 to tax proceedings ( Conseil d'Etat, 20 October 1989, Nicolo, Recueil 190). The Conseil d'Etat had in several earlier decisions held that the State's responsibility was engaged in the event of a violation of Community law, in particular, if it was at fault for allowing an illegal situation to develop through the incompatibility of a domestic measure with a community directive (Judicial Assembly of the Conseil d'Etat, 28 February 1992, Arizona Tobacco Products and S.A. Philip Morris France ). It followed that the judgment of the Administrative Court of Appeal was not an isolated authority and, indeed, it was only overturned by the Conseil d'Etat on procedural grounds based on the “classification of proceedings” rule ( principe de la distinction des contentieux ).",

                "Lastly, since the implementation of the administrative circular of 1986 had created a difference in treatment between taxpayers of the same category, it afforded at minimum a basis on which the applicant company could lay claim to its debt by a second application for compensation (see National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII).

There were two primary reasons why the applicant company's new appeal could not succeed. Firstly, its action had been brought on the basis that the tax authorities had been at fault in imposing the tax, whereas the existence of any such fault was necessarily excluded by the Conseil d'Etat 's ruling in its judgment on the first appeal that the tax in issue had been lawfully levied. As regards the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal's judgment of 1 July 1992 allowing the applicant company's appeal, the Government argued that it was not in line with the case-law at the time the second appeal was lodged. Secondly, the Government referred to the “classification of remedies” rule ( règle de la distinction des voies de recours ), which, as the Conseil d'Etat had held in its judgment of 30 October 1996, precluded the applicant company from successfully bringing an action in tort after failing in its tax appeal."

Further, the Court reiterates that the fact that the Conseil d'Etat relied on a long-standing principle cannot by itself justify a failure to comply with the present requirements of European law (see, mutatis mutandis, Delcourt v.

The applicant company rejected the Government's submission that the requirement of lawfulness had been complied with, contending that it was contrary to that requirement to allow the “classification of proceedings” rule to prevail over the rule that Community directives enjoyed primacy. It submitted in particular that the “classification of proceedings” rule and the estoppel by record relied on by the Government were only relative in scope, as had being confirmed by recent decisions of the Conseil d'Etat and the CJEC. It should therefore have been allowed to assert the rights it held by virtue of a Community directive. Since it had been prevented from obtaining satisfaction from the tax courts when the first judgment was delivered in 1986, it had been obliged to issue a second set of proceedings for compensation in order to obtain satisfaction."

The Government argued that even assuming, purely for the sake of argument, that the applicant company had been deprived of a legitimate expectation by the decisions of the domestic courts, those decisions complied with the lawfulness requirement and constituted a proportionate measure taken in the public interest. As regards compliance with the lawfulness requirement, the Government said in particular that the claim had been dismissed on the basis of established jurisprudential principles applicable to both private and public law. In ruling that the applicant company's claim was estopped per rem judicatam as a result of its first judgment of 1986, the Conseil d'Etat had applied the “classification of remedies” rule, which prevented a party from bringing an action under the general law of tort for a remedy it had been refused under a special procedure. The justification for the rule lay in the need to ensure compliance with special rules applicable to contentious proceedings, or at least to prevent their being circumvented in a way that rendered them meaningless. Without such a rule, there was a risk of identical situations been treated differently and of a direct breach of the res judicata rule. Lastly, with regard to the compatibility of the “classification of remedies” rule with Community law, the Government argued that the decision of the CJEC in Emmott (C-208/90, Emmott v. Minister for Social Welfare and Attorney General [1991] ECR I-4269) was no longer good law, as, since its Fantask decision of 2 December 1997 (C-188/95, Fantask and others v. Industriministeriet [1997] ECR I-6783), the CJEC now accepted that, subject to certain conditions, it was for the domestic legal system of each member State to lay down the detailed procedural rules for actions seeking the recovery of sums wrongly paid. The “classification of remedies” rule was not, therefore, at variance with the CJEC's case-law.",

With regard to the judgments of the Conseil d'Etat, the Court notes that the Government's case is based on the application of an established jurisprudential principle, namely the “classification of remedies” or “classification of proceedings” rule. The rule prevents a claim being brought under the general law of tort for a remedy that has previously been refused in a special form of action. According to the Government, the Conseil d'Etat had merely applied that rule when it held that the first judgment of 1986 gave rise to an estoppel by record.",

Furthermore, in the circumstances of the present case the Conseil d'Etat 's particularly strict interpretation of that procedural rule deprived the applicant company of the sole domestic procedure that was capable of affording it a sufficient remedy to ensure compliance with the provisions of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Miragall Escolano and Others v.

As to the CJEC's Fantask judgment cited by the Government (see paragraph 54 above), the Court fails to see why it should offer any justification either, since it deals with time-limits for appeals and reliance on limitation periods under national law to resist actions for repayment of charges when they become payable, and not, as in the instant case, a refusal to take the right to reimbursement itself into account (see paragraph 36 above)."

In any event, the Court notes that the interference resulted not from any legislative intervention, but on the contrary from the legislature's failure to bring the domestic law into line with a Community directive, such that the relevant administrative courts were forced to rule on that issue. The Court can but note that charging VAT on the activities of insurance brokers for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978 contravened Article 13-B-a of the Sixth Directive of the Council of European Communities of 17 May 1977. The French authorities sought to render French law compliant by issuing the administrative circular of 2 January 1986. In its judgment of 19 March 1986, the Conseil d'Etat likewise failed to have due regard to the effects of the incompatibility of French law with Community law, notwithstanding the applicant company's failure to draw its attention to that point. The Court further notes that the Conseil d'Etat 's case-law regarding verification of the conformity of national law with international law has substantially evolved since 1989 (see paragraphs 39-40 above) and that the applicant company successfully appealed to the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 21-22 above).",
                "It further notes that the domestic authorities appear to have had difficulty in comprehending Community law, a fact that is, incidentally, confirmed by the Conseil d'Etat 's reference in its S.A. Revert et Badelon decision to “... [the] failure [of the French authorities] to enact provisions that were consistent with the objectives of the Sixth Directive on time”. Thus, the administrative circular bringing French law into line with the Sixth Directive was not issued until 2 January 1986, that is to say more than seven years after the Ninth Directive was notified to the French State (see paragraph 11 above), and in any event concerned only those taxpayers who had refused to the pay the VAT concerned. It is true that the Government have explained that by not referring to the case of taxpayers who had already paid the VAT, the administrative circular left open the possibility of a court action for reimbursement. However, the Conseil d'Etat did not share that view, as it dismissed the applicant company's first appeal more than two and a half months after the administrative circular was issued. Lastly, the Court notes that the Court of Cassation – the highest ranking judicial court – has for its part already accepted that it has jurisdiction to verify whether a domestic norm is consistent with international law (see paragraph 41 above). In the Court's view, the applicant company cannot be required to suffer the consequences of the difficulties that were encountered in assimilating Community law or of the divergences between the various national authorities."

Nor was the interference justified by the 1996 judgment, as the Conseil d'Etat had dismissed the applicant company's second appeal merely on the grounds that it was inadmissible, without ruling on the merits. The applicant company submitted that no estoppel by record had arisen, since there had been no identity of subject matter between its actions for restitution of the VAT and in tort: the former was based on the failure to transpose the Sixth Directive within the prescribed period, while the latter concerned the application of invalid statutory provisions.",

Revert et Badelon. It therefore contended that it had been a victim of the difficulties caused by the Conseil d'Etat 's case-law, which it said constituted an “individual and excessive burden” such that “the fair balance which should [have been] struck between the protection of the right of property and the requirements of the general interest [had been] upset” (see Hentrich v.

Firstly, the fact that the applicant company had restricted its action to a tax appeal had not deprived it of the possibility of asserting its rights. Secondly, to have made an exception would have meant unreasonably undermining the principle of legal certainty. Lastly, the Government noted that, since the applicant company had shown that the “classification of remedies” principle was relative in its effects, in particular owing to the requirement for identity of subject matter, it could have taken that factor into account when preparing its second appeal and based its claim not on the VAT paid, an issue that had been dealt with in 1986, but on the commercial and financial damage actually sustained. Thus, the inadmissibility of the applicant company's appeal was the result of its choice of cause of action and had by no means been inevitable.",
                "The administrative circular was based on an objective difference in the situation of the companies concerned. Furthermore, it had not placed exempted companies in a radically different situation from those that were not: companies such as the applicant company that had been charged VAT could deduct the VAT they had paid and pass it on to their customers, notably by increasing the prices they invoiced for their services. While it was true that the exempted companies had the benefit of the unpaid VAT, the corollary of that was that they could not pass it on to their customers.

                "It pointed out that in National & Provincial Building Society, the Court held that there had been no violation after noting that the applicant building societies had failed to take proceedings challenging the regulations in issue and were accordingly not in the same situation as that of the Woolwich Building Society. It noted that although in Fredin v. Sweden the Court had found no violation of Article 14, on the ground that different classes of complainants could be created (judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 192), it had ruled that a distinction made to the detriment of persons whose situations were similar was discriminatory (see Darby v. Sweden, judgment of 23 October 1990, Series A no. 187). In the instant case, the applicant company said that it was in an identical situation to all those companies carrying on business as insurance brokers who had not paid VAT for 1978 by the time the administrative circular was issued on 2 January 1986. The difference in treatment was directly attributable to the administrative circular, which excluded from its ambit only those businesses that had paid VAT voluntarily. While it was true that the latter were entitled to request a refund of the VAT, the Conseil d'Etat had dismissed the applicant company's claim for such a refund. In practice, an application for judicial review of the administrative circular, which as a regulatory circular was in any event not amenable to such review, would have had no effect.",

If the purpose of the administrative circular had been to transpose the Sixth Directive of 1977 into domestic law, there was no justification for the difference in treatment between the companies concerned by the Sixth Directive. Those companies that had voluntarily paid the VAT, even though it had been levied unlawfully, had not received any benefit in exchange.",

Both companies had paid the same tax, made an initial claim for a refund, appealed to the administrative court and, following the dismissal of their claims, lodged almost simultaneous appeals to the Conseil d'Etat in 1982. The Conseil d'Etat had dismissed the applicant company's appeal in 1986, whereas S.A. Revert et Badelon's appeal papers had been lost and consideration of the appeal consequently delayed until it was set down for hearing at the same session as the applicant company's second appeal. The Conseil d'Etat reached different decisions in the two cases, notwithstanding the fact that the legal position of the two companies was identical, the sole difference being that S.A. Revert et Badelon's case file had been mislaid by the Conseil d'Etat for several years. The appeal by S.A.

                "65. The Government considered that neither the decisions of the Conseil d'Etat nor the administrative circular adopted on 2 January 1986 by the tax authorities amounted to discrimination. The decisions in the applicant company's case and in S.A. Revert et Badelon did not concern the same issue of law or appellants in identical situations. The European Court of Human Rights had held that there could be no discrimination unless the difference in treatment concerned persons in identical situations (see Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, and Johnston and Others v. Ireland, judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112). The Government noted that the appeals lodged concurrently with the applicant company's first appeal had likewise been dismissed. Nonetheless, the Government accepted that the 1986 decisions of the Conseil d'Etat on the applicant company's appeal and its decision on Revert et Badelon's appeal were at variance. The reason for the difference was that the Conseil d'Etat, which in this instance had identical arguments before it, decided in the second case – which, ten years after the first, raised the same question of law – to depart from its previous case-law. Changes in the case-law, which by definition entailed a conflict between decisions delivered before and after the change, could not be regarded as violating Article 14. For them to be regarded otherwise would be contrary to the Court's traditional interpretation of the provisions of Article 14 (see Case relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium (merits), judgment of 23 July 1968, Series A no. 6).",
                "The Government said that the indisputable effect of the administrative circular of 2 January 1986 was to put the applicant company in an ostensibly less favourable position than that of the companies referred to in the circular. As the “ Belgian linguistic ” case showed, the Court took into consideration the extent of the difference in treatment and whether it was proportionate to the situation of the persons concerned. The States thus enjoyed a margin of appreciation that varied according to the circumstances, the domain and the background (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98). In the instant case the administrative circular had been issued because of the primacy of the Community norm, in accordance with an undertaking given to the Commission of the Communities. The circular was therefore in the public interest and satisfied an existing legal obligation, but without depriving the companies concerned of their prospects of recovering the tax in the pending legal proceedings. Furthermore, the difference in treatment was based on an objective difference in the situation of the companies concerned. Some of the companies had decided not to seek a refund of the tax, while others had made an application to the courts for a refund which, in view of the genuine doubt as to the validity of the tax liability, the authorities had, as in the instant case, quite legitimately left for the courts to decide in the proceedings that were pending at that stage. Lastly, the authorities had logically enough, in view of the high degree of uncertainty over their outcome, chosen not to issue proceedings against those companies that had simply refrained from paying the tax. The Government noted that the Court had recognised that it was legitimate for public authorities to treat companies differently, depending on whether or not the company concerned had chosen to bring proceedings (see National & Provincial Building Society, cited above).",
                "Lastly, the Government argued that the difference in treatment had to be put into perspective, since companies which, like the applicant company, had paid the VAT had enjoyed an exemption from employment tax and had been able to pass on all or part of the VAT to their customers, unlike the companies that had not paid the VAT."

The above findings clearly require a reconsideration of the modalities for the payment of financial compensation as currently implemented. The revision and update of valuation maps should be subject to transparent and explanatory criteria, taking into account the land development and market fluctuations. The Court urges the authorities, as a matter of priority, to start making use of other alternative forms of compensation as provided for by the 2004 Property Act, which would eventually ease pressure on the budget, and/or to introduce other methods of compensation."

Accordingly, as submitted by the Government and as also evidenced by the list of claimants who had applied for financial compensation between 2005 and 2008 (see the attached Annex), if a claimant obtained partial restitution of the property or other forms of compensation, he would not be eligible to obtain financial compensation. This is the position in two applications (nos. 43628/07 ( Dani ) and 34770/09 ( Muka )).

However, financial compensation is the sole form of compensation currently awarded. Had the applicants therefore applied for and been awarded financial compensation in respect of 200 sq. m, their right to have the remainder of their decisions enforced would have been uncertain. In fact, even though the applicants in application no. 46684/07 ( Ahmatas and Others ) received financial compensation, to date, the remainder of the decision in their favour remains unenforced. Moreover, the Court is not convinced that the award of financial compensation equal to the value of 200 sq. m, irrespective of the plot of land recognised for the purpose of compensation, would ensure effective equality of treatment of claimants as contended by the Government. Persons, whose situations are significantly different, should be treated differently (see Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV)."

The principle of lawfulness also presupposes that the applicable provisions of domestic law be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application (...).",
                "166. Furthermore, any interference with the enjoyment of a right or freedom recognised by the Convention must pursue a legitimate aim. By the same token, in cases involving a positive duty, there must be a legitimate justification for the State’s inaction. The principle of a “fair balance” inherent in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 itself presupposes the existence of a general interest of the community. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures to be applied in the sphere of the exercise of the right of property, including deprivation and restitution of property. Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities accordingly enjoy a certain margin of appreciation.",

In particular, the decision to enact laws expropriating property or affording publicly funded compensation for expropriated property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues. Finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, the Court has declared that it will respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is “in the public interest” unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (...).",

Both an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions and an abstention from action must strike a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measures applied by the State, including measures depriving a person of his of her possessions. In each case involving the alleged violation of that Article the Court must, therefore, ascertain whether by reason of the State’s action or inaction the person concerned had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden (...).",

In assessing compliance with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court must make an overall examination of the various interests in issue, bearing in mind that the Convention is intended to safeguard rights that are “practical and effective”. It must look behind appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of. That assessment may involve not only the relevant compensation terms – if the situation is akin to the taking of property – but also the conduct of the parties, including the means employed by the State and their implementation. In that context, it should be stressed that uncertainty – be it legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities – is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State’s conduct. Indeed, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time, in an appropriate and consistent manner (...).",

The prosecutor submitted that, according to the data provided by the State Forest Management Service ( Valstybinė miškotvarkos tarnyba ), 0.25 hectares of the plot was covered by forest. Since that forest was situated in a city (see paragraph 10 above), it was considered a forest of national importance and could therefore only be owned by the State (see paragraphs 86, 88 and 89 below). The prosecutor noted that the forest had been included in the plan of forests of national importance adopted by the Government in 2002 (see paragraph 12 above), that is before the VCA had adopted its decision to give that land to I.B.

Accordingly, when the VCA had adopted the decision to give that plot to I.B. (see paragraph 13 above), the forest situated on it had already been recognised as a forest of national importance.

It reiterated that the Constitution and several laws prohibited the transfer of forests of national importance from the State into private ownership on any basis whatsoever, including restoration of property rights (see paragraphs 86 and 88 ‑ 91 below). Accordingly, it was immaterial that, as submitted by the VCA, its decision complied with certain regulations adopted during the restitution process. The Court of Appeal considered that the first-instance court had correctly found that the forest on the plot given to I.B. was urban forest and therefore a forest of national importance, and thus property rights in respect of that part had to be annulled. However, it stated that when determining the area covered by forest the information had to be taken not from the Real Estate Register but from the Register of Forests ( Miškų kadastras ), which was administered by the State Forest Management Service. According to the latter, the plot given to I.B. included 0.25 hectares of forest.

The court observed that even though restoration of property rights was a continuous process and included the preparation of various documents, the final decision to restore property rights had to comply with the law in force at the time of the adoption of that decision. It concluded that the VCA ’ s decision to give the plot to I.B.

On 9 April 2009 the prosecutor lodged a claim with the Vilnius City Second District Court, seeking to have the applicant ’ s and G.D. ’ s property rights to the 2.12 hectares of forest annulled (see paragraph 41 above). The prosecutor submitted that the forest was situated in a city (see paragraph 10 above) and was thus considered a forest of national importance which could only be owned by the State (see paragraphs 86, 88 and 89 below). The prosecutor noted that the forest in question had been included in the plan of forests of national importance adopted by the Government in 2002 (see paragraph 12 above), that is before the VCA had adopted its decision to give that forest to the applicant and G.D.

It reiterated that, in line with the Constitution and the Law on Forests, urban forests were considered forests of national importance and could only belong to the State (see paragraphs 86, 88 and 89 below). The court also emphasised the importance of forests to the environment and the obligation of the State to protect them in the public interest. It then noted that the former village of Vaidotai had become part of the Vilnius city municipality in 1996 (see paragraph 10 above), so any forests within that area were urban forests. The court also observed that the forest given to the applicant and G.D. had been included in the list of forests of national importance approved by the Government in 2002 (see paragraph 12 above). Accordingly, the VCA ’ s decision to give that forest to the applicant and G.D. had been adopted after the forest had already become a forest of national importance (see paragraph 41 above). The court held that it was immaterial whether other administrative acts on which the VCA ’ s decision had been based remained valid (see paragraph 44 above) because property rights had been restored to the applicant and G.D. by that decision and not by any other acts. The court therefore annulled the applicant ’ s and G.D. ’ s property rights to the 2.12 hectares of forest."

In response to the applicant ’ s argument that she had lost the opportunity to have her property rights restored (see paragraph 47 above), the Vilnius Regional Court stated that Lithuanian law provided for partial restitution, and that where it was impossible to restore property rights in natura, it could be done in other ways, including by monetary compensation (see paragraphs 92 and 97 below).

In its ruling of 12 April 2012 in a civil case no. 3K-7-165/2012, the Supreme Court stated that there was divergent practice among domestic courts with regard to the effects of the annulment of administrative acts on restoration of property rights, in particular when the persons to whom those rights had been restored had later sold that property to third parties. The Supreme Court observed that, in some cases, the courts annulled all subsequent transfers of the property, ordered each party to return to the other what it had received from the transaction, and stated that the process of restoration of property rights with respect to the initial claimant would have to be started afresh. In other cases, courts considered that the process of restoration in respect of the initial claimant had to be considered completed, and that the State had to reclaim the property from the final purchaser, for adequate compensation. An extended panel of the Supreme Court therefore considered it necessary to harmonise the courts ’ practice. It held:",
                "“In the present case, the State lost its ownership of a forest of national importance as a result of administrative acts on restoration of property rights adopted by its authorised institution, the VCA. These decisions have been declared unlawful and have been annulled ... After the annulment of the administrative acts on restoration of property rights, the State should regain its property rights in respect of the plots of land which were unlawfully transferred to [the claimants], and restoration of the property rights of the latter would have to be decided anew. However, in this case, the plots of land have been transferred to third parties for monetary consideration ...",

In this case, one of the circumstances determining the need for restitution is the fact that, in line with Article 47 of the Constitution, forests of national importance belong exclusively to the State, so they must be returned to it. Other specific features of restitution in this case are determined by the nature of the process of restoration of property rights ...",
                "In this case there was no dispute as to [the claimants ’ ] right to restoration of their property rights, but it was found that the property in question could not be returned to them in natura. It has not been determined that [the claimants] exercised any undue influence on the authorities ’ decisions. Accordingly, the transfer of forests of national importance into [the claimants ’ ] ownership occurred because of the authorities ’ actions, whereas [the claimants] trusted the competence of the authorities. The extended judges ’ panel observes that, contrary to the conclusions of the lower courts in this case, [the claimants ’ ] good faith in the process of restoration of property rights has not been denied. Simply because they, as careful and diligent parties to a legal relationship, ought to have known that the law prohibited the restoration of property rights to forests in urban areas, does not constitute grounds to regard them as having acquired the property in bad faith, since they did not have the competence to make any decisions on the limits of the plots of land to be given to them and, as stated before, there are no grounds to find that they exercised any undue influence on the authorities ’ decisions ... In such circumstances, where persons acting in good faith have [acquired] forests of national importance as a result of the improper actions of the authorities, restitution after the annulment of the relevant administrative acts must be applied in a way as not to deny those persons ’ rights to legal certainty and the protection of their legitimate expectations ...",

In cases such as the present, where restitution has to be applied primarily because of the unlawfulness of authorities ’ decisions, the State must assume the negative effects of restitution, while [the individuals concerned] can only be made to suffer minimal negative effects of returning the property to the State, as provided for by law.",

In view of that, as well as all of the above considerations, the extended judges ’ panel holds that restitution shall not be applied to [the claimants] – they shall not be ordered to return the money received from the sale agreement to the other party, and the restoration process in their respect shall be considered complete; otherwise their situation would be unfairly and disproportionately worsened (Article 6.145 § 2 of the Civil Code) ...",

The Law on Forests also provides that forests situated in cities constitute forests of national importance (see paragraphs 88 and 89 above), and the Law on Restitution similarly provides that urban forests are redeemable by the State (see paragraphs 90 and 91 above). The relevant provisions of that legislation were in force at the time when the applicants ’ property rights were restored (see paragraphs 13, 41 and 62 above). The Court is therefore satisfied that the decisions adopted by the VCA to restore the applicants ’ property rights to plots of land including urban forests did not comply with the aforementioned legislation, and the annulment of those decisions was therefore in accordance with the law. It is also satisfied that the requirement for the applicants, after their property rights had been annulled, to return the relevant plots to the State was in accordance with the law (see Article 1.80 of the Civil Code in paragraph 94 above)."

It appears from the Supreme Court ’ s ruling of 12 April 2012 (see paragraph 103 above) that, at the time when her property rights were annulled and she was ordered to return the money to the purchaser and return the plot to the State (see paragraphs 67, 68 and 70 - 73 above), the practice of the domestic courts was inconsistent. In some cases, the courts annulled all subsequent transfers of the property and ordered the parties to return to the other what they had received from the transaction (like in the fourth applicant ’ s case), whereas in other cases, the courts held that the State had to reclaim the property from the final purchaser. The Supreme Court decided to harmonise the case-law and adopt the latter position (see paragraph 103 above). The Court takes note of the Supreme Court ’ s decision; it also reiterates that divergence of case-law, in itself, cannot be considered contrary to the Convention (see Nejdet Şahin and Perihan Şahin v.

The applicants in the present case disputed the aim of the interference with their property rights by arguing that there were no forests on the land which had been given to them, or that those forests were not of national importance (see paragraph 121 above). In this connection, the Court reiterates that it is not its task to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as such errors may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see, among many other authorities, García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, ECHR 1999-I, and Jantner v. Slovakia, no. 39050/97, § 32, 4 March 2003). In other words, the Court cannot question the assessment of the domestic authorities unless there is clear evidence of arbitrariness (see, among many other authorities, Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia (striking out) [GC], no. 60654/00, § 89, ECHR 2007 ‑ I). It therefore considers that in the present case it was primarily the role of the domestic courts to establish whether the applicants ’ land included forests and whether those forests were of national importance, in accordance with domestic law. The Court cannot overlook the fact that in some of the applicants ’ cases different public registers provided inconsistent information about whether their land was forested (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 67 above), or that the various authorities in charge of the protection of forests had not objected to the restoration of that land to the applicants (see paragraphs 16, 43 and 65 above). However, the domestic courts held that the presence of forests on the applicants ’ land had been sufficiently established by the information provided by the State Forest Management Service (see paragraphs 23, 26 and 67 above). The courts also found that those forests were urban forests because the areas in which they were situated had become part of the Vilnius city municipality in 1996, and that they had been officially designated as forests of national importance in 2000 (see paragraphs 19, 26, 46 and 67 above). Having examined the domestic courts ’ reasoning, the Court cannot regard their findings as arbitrary and sees no reason to substitute them with its own assessment."

However, the need to correct an old “wrong” should not disproportionately interfere with a new right which has been acquired by an individual relying on the legitimacy of the public authority ’ s action in good faith. In other words, State authorities which fail to put in place or adhere to their own procedures should not be allowed to profit from their wrongdoing or to escape their obligations. The risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State itself and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individuals concerned. In the context of revoking ownership of a property transferred erroneously, the good governance principle may not only impose on the authorities an obligation to act promptly in correcting their mistake, but may also necessitate the payment of adequate compensation or another type of appropriate reparation to its former bona fide holder (see Lelas v. Croatia, no. 55555/08, § 74, 20 May 2010; Maksymenko and Gerasymenko v. Ukraine, no. 49317/07, § 64, 16 May 2013; and Bogdel v. Lithuania, no. 41248/06, § 66, 26 November 2013 )."

The Court lastly reiterates that the compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicants. It has held that the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value would normally constitute a disproportionate interference. At the same time, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 95, ECHR 2006 ‑ V; Kozacıoğlu v. Turkey [GC], no. 2334/03, § 64, 19 February 2009; and Vistiņš and Perepjolkins v. Latvia [GC], no. 71243/01, § § 110 and 112, 25 October 2012). The Court has accepted that the principle of partial restitution to rectify old wrongs conformed to the Convention, and that, consequently, the amount of compensation for long-extinguished property rights could be assessed in accordance with calculation methods established in relevant legislation rather than with the full market value of such property (see Kavaliauskas and Others v. Lithuania, no. 51752/10, § § 53-56, 14 March 2017, and the cases cited therein ). However, the Court has previously found that the requisite fair balance was not struck in cases where the disproportion between the market value of the property and the compensation awarded to the applicants was “extreme” or “too significant” (see Vistiņš and Perepjolkins, cited above, § 119; Noreikienė and Noreika v. Lithuania, no. 17285/08, § 39, 24 November 2015; and Tunaitis v. Lithuania, no. 42927/08, § 42, 24 November 2015).",

The Court has already accepted that the plots had been transferred to the applicants in contravention of domestic law (see paragraph 133 above). In line with the general principles established in its case-law (see the references provided in paragraphs 139 and 140 above), the Court therefore considers that the Lithuanian authorities were entitled to correct their mistakes and annul the restoration of the applicants ’ property rights in order to protect forests classified as being of national importance.

                "144. At the same time, the Court underlines that the decisions to restore the applicants ’ property rights were adopted by the authorities, who alone were responsible for making sure that their decisions complied with all relevant legislation. The applicants were ordinary citizens who participated in the restitution process under the same conditions as everyone else; they were not in a privileged position and there are no grounds to find that they acted unlawfully when obtaining their property (see also Pyrantienė, cited above, § 59, and Albergas and Arlauskas v. Lithuania, no. 17978/05, § 68, 27 May 2014 ). The courts which examined the first, second and third applicants ’ cases did not find any indication of bad faith on the part of those applicants either (see paragraphs 18 - 20, 23, 26, 28, 46, 48 and 50 - 51 above). Although the Court of Appeal in the fourth applicant ’ s case held that she could not have been considered a bona fide acquirer of property (see paragraph 71 above), the Court finds this conclusion difficult to accept. It observes that the Court of Appeal did not refer to any actions of the fourth applicant which might have demonstrated her bad faith, nor did it provide any relevant arguments why it had reached that conclusion with regard to the fourth applicant in a situation in which the only unlawful actions had been carried out by the authorities. The Court is not convinced that the fourth applicant (or any other applicants) should have questioned the actions of the relevant authorities instead of expecting the latter to take all measures to avoid mistakes in application of the legislation – especially taking into account the complexity and technical nature of the legal acts governing the process of restoration of land titles (see Misiukonis and Others v. Lithuania, no. 49426/09, § 60, 15 November 2016; see also the position of the Supreme Court of Lithuania in paragraph 103 above ). Therefore, the Court concludes that all the applicants obtained their property in good faith, and thus should not have had to bear the burden of remedying the mistakes for which the authorities were solely responsible (see the references provided in paragraph 140 above). In such circumstances, the Court considers that, contrary to the Government ’ s submissions (see paragraph 129 above), it is immaterial for the assessment of the burden borne by the applicants how long they had owned the property in question before it was taken from them, or how much other property had been restored to them and not annulled."

The Court is mindful that it is not its role to determine the best way for States to correct errors made by authorities in the process of restoring property rights (see Misiukonis and Others, cited above, § 63). However, it reiterates that the correction of those errors should not create disproportionate new wrongs (see the references provided in paragraph 140 above). In the present case, the Court agrees with the applicants that expecting them to undergo a lengthy additional process, without having regard to their particular situation and the reasons why they had lost the previously restored property, had been disproportionate (see also the Vilnius Regional Court ’ s decision in the fourth applicant ’ s case in paragraph 68 above )."

The Court observes that Lithuanian law provides several forms of restoration of property rights, including not only restitution in kind but also monetary compensation, compensation in securities and discharging liabilities to the State (see paragraph 92 above). It reiterates that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention does not guarantee the right to acquire property and it cannot be interpreted as imposing any general obligation on the Contracting States to restore property which was transferred to them before they ratified the Convention; nor does Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 impose any restrictions on the Contracting States ’ freedom to determine the scope of property restitution and to choose the conditions under which they agree to restore property rights of former owners (see Slivenko v. Latvia (dec.) [GC], no. 48321/99, § 121, ECHR 2002-II; Jantner, cited above, § 34; and Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 35, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX).

Therefore, after the applicant ’ s property rights to one hectare of land were annulled by the final court decision of 5 February 2010 (see paragraph 50 above), the authorities were under an obligation to act promptly in order to restore her property rights in one of the forms provided for by law."

The Court observes that initially the authorities acted with relative promptness, informing the applicant about the forms of restitution and asking her to indicate her choice, though each of the letters sent to her during the period from 2010 to 2012 contained slightly different information about the options available to her (see paragraphs 52, 54, 55 and 57 above). It further observes that although during that period the applicant promptly responded to the authorities ’ letters and indicated her choice as to the form of restitution (see paragraphs 52, 53, 55 and 56 above), she was not invited to attend a meeting of candidates to receive land in the relevant area until October 2013 (see paragraph 58 above), that is more than three years after her property rights had been annulled. The Court notes that the authorities were aware of the applicant ’ s individual situation ‑ specifically, that her property rights had already been restored and later had to be annulled because of the mistakes made in the restitution process (see paragraph 57 above). However, there is no indication in the documents provided to the Court that her individual situation was taken into account at any stage."

In the Court ’ s view, the applicant ’ s conduct between 2010 to 2012 cannot be reproached (see paragraph 156 above) – in fact, it appears that during that period contact between the applicant and the authorities was mainly initiated by the applicant, and the authorities only acted in response (see paragraphs 52 ‑ 55 above). However, the Court observes that from the end of 2013 the applicant ’ s attitude was less cooperative – she did not attend the first two meetings to which she was invited (see paragraph 58 above), she failed to send a properly authorised representative to the third meeting (see paragraph 59 above), and at the fourth meeting she refused the plots offered to her, although the minutes did not indicate any reasons for the refusal (see paragraph 60 above). The applicant argued that she had not been informed of the first two meetings and that the plots offered to her at the fourth meeting had not been suitable (see paragraphs 58 and 60 above). Be that as it may, the Court considers that even if the applicant could be regarded as not having fully cooperated, the overall delay in the restitution process was nonetheless imputable to the authorities – in particular, it cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that no action at all appears to have been taken between November 2013 and April 2016 (see paragraphs 58 and 59 above; see also the ruling of the Constitutional Court of Lithuania in paragraph 98 above )."

The Court also reiterates that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention does not impose any restrictions on the Contracting States ’ freedom to determine the scope of property restitution (see the references provided in paragraph 146 above). It observes that, under Lithuanian law, the authorities were entitled to restore property rights by monetary compensation, even without the applicant ’ s consent (see paragraph 93 above ). In several previous cases in which the applicants had failed to properly express their will as to their preferred way of restitution, the Court considered that payment of monetary compensation was compatible with the Convention (see Nekvedavičius v. Lithuania (merits), no. 1471/05, § 62, 10 December 2013, and Valančienė v. Lithuania, no. 2657/10, § 63, 18 April 2017 ). Therefore, even if the applicant had failed to attend some meetings or had refused the plots offered to her, the Court considers that the authorities had the ability to restore her property rights by monetary compensation, in line with the principles established in the Court ’ s case-law (see paragraph 142 above)."

The Court notes that at the meeting of 31 December 2012 the applicant refused to choose any plots of land and stated that she wished to wait for the decision of the Court in the present case (see paragraph 79 above); she did not attend any further meetings despite being invited to them (see paragraphs 81 and 82 above). In this connection, the Court takes note of the Government ’ s position that the cooperation of applicants with the public authorities in the restitution process is of key importance when determining the proportionality of the interference with their property rights (see paragraph 130 above; see also Paukštis, §§ 85-86, and Valančienė, §§ 71-72, both cited above ). In the present case, not only did the applicant not cooperate with the authorities, but she explicitly refused to participate in the restitution process in accordance with domestic law. In the Court ’ s view, such explicit refusal distinguishes the fourth applicant ’ s situation from that of the third applicant (see paragraphs 157 and 158 above) and other cases in which the applicants had failed to express their intentions but the Court nonetheless considered that the authorities should have proceeded with restitution irrespective of the applicants ’ will ( see Nekvedavičius, § 62, and Valančienė, § 63, both cited above ). It observes that the applicant herself effectively suspended the restitution process and any delays which followed after that cannot be considered the responsibility of the authorities. In this connection, the Court also reiterates that within the scheme of the Convention it is intended to be subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 42, ECHR 2008; Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09 and 2 others, § 61, ECHR 2012; and Sargsyan v. Azerbaijan (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 40167/06, §§ 29-32, 12 December 2017 ).

It finds that by failing to comply with the enforceable judgment in the applicant's favour the domestic authorities impaired the essence of his “right to a court” and prevented him from receiving the money he had legitimately expected to receive."
