Particular attention must be paid to individuals suffering from contagious conditions. No later than three days after the detainee ’ s arrival at the detention facility, he should receive an in-depth medical examination, including fluorography. During the in-depth examination a prison doctor should record the detainee ’ s complaints, study his medical and personal history, record injuries if present, and recent tattoos, and schedule additional medical procedures if necessary.

This was due to a combination of factors, including: ( i ) increased poverty, (ii) under-funding of TB services and health services in general, (iii) diagnostic and therapeutic approaches that were designed for a centralized command-and-control TB system, but were unable to cope with the social mobility and relative freedom of the post-Soviet era, and (iv) technical inadequacies and outdated equipment. Migration of populations from ex-Soviet republics with high TB burdens also increased the problem. Prevalence rates were many times higher in the prison system than in the general population. Treatment included lengthy hospitalizations, variations among clinicians and patients in the therapeutic regimen, and frequent recourse to surgery. A shrinking health budget resulted in an erratic supply of anti-TB drugs and laboratory supplies, reduced quality control in TB dispensaries and laboratories, and inadequate treatment. The social conditions favouring the spread of TB, combined with inadequate systems for diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance, as well as increased drug resistance, produced a serious public health problem.",

The system was designed in the 1920s to address the challenges of the TB epidemic. Case detection relied strongly on active mass screening by X-ray (fluorography). Specificity, sensitivity, and cost-effectiveness considerations were not features of this approach. Bacille Calmette -Guerin (BCG) immunization was a key feature of the TB control system...",

At that moment, the share of pulmonary TB cases confirmed by bacterioscopy did not exceed 25%, and the share of such cases confirmed by culture testing was no more than 41% due to suboptimal effectiveness of laboratory diagnosis, which led to poor detection of smear-positive TB cases.

The Government stressed that detection of dormant MBT cannot be made through ordinary radiological methods of screening and a period of several years may pass between the date when a person contracts the illness and the date when the illness fully develops. They drew the Court ’ s attention to the fact that modern science did not clearly identify the factors which led to the reactivation of the tuberculosis process. It is, however, established that persons with a weak immune system are prone to the infection. Hereditary factors should also be taken into account. The Government disputed the possibility of detaining individuals suffering from contagious forms of tuberculosis alongside healthy inmates in Russian detention facilities. They accepted that in September 2000 during detention in the correctional colony the applicant had shared a cell with a person suffering from a non-contagious form of tuberculosis.

In particular, it was almost two months after the infection had revealed itself that he had been admitted to hospital for treatment. The medical services rendered to the applicant had had a large number of defects. The treatment had been sporadic and incomplete. A serious deterioration of his health in March 2004 resulting in his suffering a spontaneous pneumothorax had been a firm evidence of inadequate quality of the medical services. The applicant further disputed the Government ’ s assertion that he had refused to cooperate with the authorities. He explained that his refusals to submit to medical observations and testing in the correctional colony had pursued the single purpose of forcing the colony administration to transfer him to a “proper” medical establishment. His behaviour had been a mere attempt to obtain adequate and effective medical services. In the applicant ’ s opinion, it was indisputable that he wanted to become healthy but that aim was impossible to achieve in a prison hospital."

It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim ’ s behaviour (see, for example, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 119, ECHR 2000-IV). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 162, Series A no. 25)."

However, even in the absence of these, where treatment humiliates or debases an individual, showing a lack of respect for or diminishing his or her human dignity, or arouses feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking an individual ’ s moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition of Article 3 (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 52, ECHR 2002-III, with further references)."

In the context of deprivation of liberty the Court has consistently stressed that, to fall under Article 3, the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering and humiliation connected with the detention (see, mutatis mutandis, Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, 25 April 1978, § 30, Series A no. 26, and Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, § 100, Series A no. 161)."

The State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, §§ 92-94, ECHR 2000-XI, and Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, § 208, 13 July 2006 ). In most of the cases concerning the detention of people who are ill, the Court has examined whether or not the applicant received adequate medical assistance in prison. The Court reiterates in this respect that even if Article 3 does not entitle a detainee to be released “on compassionate grounds”, it has always interpreted the requirement to secure the health and well-being of detainees, among other things, as an obligation on the part of the State to provide detainees with the requisite medical assistance (see Kudła, cited above, § 94; Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, §§ 95 and 100, ECHR 2002-VI; and Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, § 96, ECHR 2006-XII (extracts))."

                "62. The “adequacy” of medical assistance remains the most difficult element to determine. The CPT proclaimed the principle of the equivalence of health care in prison with that in the outside community (see paragraph 44 above). The Court insists that, in particular, authorities must ensure that the diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate (see Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, § 115, 29 November 2007; Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, §§ 104-106, 28 March 2006; and, mutatis mutandis, Holomiov v. Moldova, no. 30649/05, § 121, 7 November 2006), and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at curing the detainee ’ s health problems or preventing their aggravation (see Hummatov, cited above, §§ 109, 114; Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, § 79, 4 October 2005; and Popov v. Russia, cited above, § 211). However, the Court has also held that Article 3 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as securing for every detained person medical assistance at the same level as “in the best civilian clinics” (see Mirilashivili v. Russia ( dec .), no. 6293/04, 10 July 2007). In another case the Court went further, holding that it was “prepared to accept that in principle the resources of medical facilities within the penitentiary system are limited compared to those of civil clinics” (see Grishin v. Russia, no. 30983/02, § 76, 15 November 2007)."

That standard should be “compatible with the human dignity” of a detainee, but should also take into account “the practical demands of imprisonment” (see Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, § 140, 22 December 2008).",

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that following a fluorography test on 30 October 2001, more than four years after the arrest in February 1997, the applicant was diagnosed as having tuberculosis, which, according to him, he had not suffered from prior to his arrest. In fact, the medical certificates submitted by the parties show that he had no history of tuberculosis before his placement in detention facility no. 1 in Oryol. Likewise, no symptoms of tuberculosis were discovered in the period from 25 February 1997, when the applicant underwent his first fluorography exam in detention, to 30 October 2001, when the disease was diagnosed. The eight fluorography tests performed during that period revealed no signs of infection."
            ],
            [
                "65. In this respect, the Court is mindful of the Government ’ s opinion that Mycobacterium tuberculosis, also known as Koch ’ s bacillus, may lie dormant in the body for some time without exhibiting any clinical signs of the illness. At the same time, for the Government to effectively argue that the applicant was infected with Koch ’ s bacillus even before his arrest, it would have been necessary for the authorities to perform on the applicant, upon his admission to the detention facility and in addition to a fluorography examination, the Mantoux test or a special tuberculosis blood test which would have indicated the presence of the latent infection. However, as follows from the parties ’ submissions, apart from fluorography examinations, the Russian penitentiary institutions did not employ any other methods to check for TB at the moment of detainees ’ admission to detention facilities. It is therefore possible to conclude that the applicant was never exposed to the infection prior to his arrest and that he only contracted tuberculosis in detention, particularly taking into account that in October 1998 he had been placed in a cell with an individual suffering from the contagious form of tuberculosis (see paragraph 10 above). In this respect, the Court attributes particular weight to the conclusion recorded in the applicant ’ s medical history and finding the roots of the applicant ’ s tuberculosis in his detention with the sick inmate (ibid). The Court also does not lose sight of the statistical estimations that place Russia among one of the twenty-two highest-burden countries for tuberculosis in the world, recording a drastic increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in the 1990s, with some reports indicating that TB is many times more prevalent in Russian prisons than in civilian life (see paragraph 49 above). With all these considerations in mind and also adding to them the fact that the first eight fluorography tests performed between the applicant ’ s arrest and October 2001 showed no pathology in the applicant ’ s lungs, the Court considers it most probable that the applicant contracted tuberculosis in detention facility no. 1 (see Staykov v. Bulgaria, no. 49438/99, § 81, 12 October 2006; Yakovenko v. Ukraine, no. 15825/06, § § 28 and 95, 25 October 2007; Hummatov, cited above, §§ 108 and 111; and Ghavtadz, v. Georgia, no. 23204/07, § 86, 3 March 2009 ). In these circumstances, the Court does not consider it necessary to establish the veracity of the applicant ’ s argument regarding another alleged instance of his detention with an inmate with TB in September 2000 (see paragraph 11 above)."
            ],
            [
                "66. While finding it particularly disturbing that the applicant ’ s infection with tuberculosis occurred in a penitentiary institution within the State ’ s control, the Court reiterates its constant approach that even if an applicant had contracted tuberculosis while in detention, this in itself would not imply a violation of Article 3, provided that he received treatment for it (see Alver v. Estonia, no. 64812/01, § 54, 8 November 2005, and Pitalev v. Russia, no. 34393/03, § 53, 30 July 2009, with further references). However, the State does have a responsibility to ensure treatment for prisoners in its charge, and a lack of adequate medical assistance for serious health problems not suffered from prior to detention may amount to a violation of Article 3 (see Hummatov, cited above, § 108 et seq.). Absent or inadequate treatment for tuberculosis, particularly when the disease has been contracted in detention, is most certainly a subject of the Court ’ s concern. It is therefore bound to assess the quality of medical services the applicant was provided with in the present case and to determine whether he was deprived of adequate medical assistance as he claims, and if so whether this amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, § 78, 4 October 2005)."

In particular, they argued that after September 2004 the applicant had refused to submit to medical procedures, including X-ray examinations and clinical tests, and had declined prophylactic treatment for his illness. Given the fact that the applicant did not dispute his refusal to follow medical recommendations of the detention authorities, albeit for quite different reasons than those implied by the Government, the Court will assess the quality of the medical care during the two periods of the applicant ’ s detention, accepting September 2004 as the dividing point.",

The Court reiterates that the applicant opened his line of arguments by complaining that the authorities ’ response to his health grievances aired already in the end of September 2000 was belated (see paragraph 11 above) and about delayed diagnosis of the illness. In this connection, while observing no entries in the applicant ’ s medical history recording health complaints before the discovery of the disease in October 2001, the Court still finds strong evidence before it in support of the applicant ’ s claims as to the belated screening of the illness. In particular, it does not escape the Court ’ s attention that almost a year passed between the chest fluorography examinations in 2000 and 2001 (see paragraph 9 above). The Court is troubled by that delay, given the fact that at the time the applicant was, most probably, a carrier of the latent tuberculosis infection following his detention alongside an inmate ill with active tuberculosis, he was in detention, a recognised setting for the transmission and development of tuberculosis (see Ghavtadze, cited above, § 86, and, most recently, Pakhomov v. Russia, no. 44917/08, 30 September 2009, § 64), and there is no indication that following his contact with the inmate who was ill the applicant received the full course of preventive treatment to reduce the risk of the latent infection progressing to active TB later in his life. The Court believes that in these circumstances the Russian authorities were under an obligation to closely monitor the applicant ’ s health to be able to respond promptly to any reactivation of the latent infection, an obligation which they failed to comply with."

The Court further observes that more than a month passed between the discovery of the illness during a fluorography examination on 30 October 2001 and the applicant ’ s admission to the tuberculosis hospital in facility no. 1 on 7 December 2001. The Government did not provide any explanation for the delay, nor did it indicate whether the authorities had ever considered that the delay in the applicant ’ s admission to the hospital could have worsened his untreated condition, as well as made him a source of a secondary spread of infection throughout the prison population and facility staff, should the applicant turn out to be sputum smear positive. Noting that delayed treatment is particularly detrimental to patients suffering from tuberculosis, the Court also finds it striking that it was not until 17 December 2001 that the applicant started receiving antibacterial treatment (see paragraph 13 above). While acknowledging the necessity to perform clinical tests for proper diagnosis, case definition and choice of standard treatment regimen, the Court is concerned that the testing delayed the initiation of the applicant ’ s treatment. It is therefore not convinced that the authorities acted promptly and diligently in identifying the illness and initiating effective therapy, the key measures in the modern strategy of tuberculosis control and treatment."

Although he did not make any complaints pertaining to the quality of the medical services rendered to him in the hospital, the Court still considers it necessary to emphasise that the quality of the hospital care following the initiation of the anti-tuberculosis therapy on 17 December 2001 appears to be adequate. In particular, the evidence placed before the Court shows that, having been placed on a strict medication regime necessary for the tuberculosis therapy when the initial stage of the treatment was followed by the continuation stage, as recommended by the WHO, the applicant received a number of anti-tuberculosis medicines and concomitant antihistamine drugs, which were administered to him in the requisite dosage, at the right intervals and for the appropriate duration. During the entire period of his treatment the applicant was subjected to regular and systematic clinical and radiological assessment and bacteriological monitoring, which formed part of the comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at curing the disease. The authorities also effectively implemented the doctors ’ recommendations in respect of a special dietary ration necessary for the applicant to improve his health (contrast Gorodnitchev v. Russia, no. 52058/99, § 91, 24 May 2007)."

                "71. Furthermore, the Court attributes particular weight to the fact that the facility administration not only ensured that the applicant was attended to by doctors, that his complaints were heard and that he was prescribed a trial of anti-tuberculosis medication, they also created the necessary conditions for the prescribed treatment to be actually followed through (see Hummatov, cited above, § 116). The Court notes that the intake of medicines by the applicant was supervised and directly observed by the facility medical personnel throughout the whole treatment regimen, as required by the DOTS strategy. The authorities ’ actions guaranteed the applicant ’ s adherence to the treatment and compliance with the prescribed regimen, this being a key factor in the treatment ’ s success."

                "72. The applicant ’ s medical history containing his diagnosis following the completion of the treatment in the tuberculosis hospital in the summer of 2002 as “focal tuberculosis of the left lung in the resolution phase” showed positive dynamics in the applicant ’ s treatment, meaning that he was recovering. The applicant was released from the hospital to correctional colony no. 2 with a recommendation to continue treatment on an HE regimen. The medical records indicate that the applicant had been attended to a number of times throughout his detention in the colony in 2002 and 2003 and had been prescribed tests and medication. However, the same records show that the applicant ’ s treatment in the colony was unregulated and erratic. In particular, there is no evidence that the hospital ’ s recommendation to continue treatment with isoniazid and ethmbutol was followed through. In fact, it was not until March 2003 that the applicant finally gained access to treatment with anti-bacteriological drugs (see paragraph 17 above). It also does not appear that the applicant was attended by doctors on a regular or systematic basis. The Court is mindful that the first examination of the applicant was performed by the colony doctor on 9 October 2002, more than three months after the applicant ’ s return to the correctional colony. It also does not lose sight of the fact that the colony authorities regularly delayed quarterly X-ray examination and clinical testing of the applicant. Given that the above tests and examinations were essential for effective monitoring of the applicant ’ s condition and timely diagnosis of possible reappearance of symptoms of TB, it is regrettable that they were performed haphazardly. In addition, the Court notes the authorities ’ inert response to the applicant ’ s health complaints in January 2003 and discovery of certain changes in his left lung during an X-ray examination not long after the complaints had been raised. In the light of these considerations the Court does not deem such medical attention to be adequate and reasonable, given the condition from which the applicant was suffering (see, for similar reasoning, Hummatov, cited above, § § 114-115)."

            [
                "73. Further developments in the applicant ’ s case give even stronger support to the Court ’ s finding of inadequate medical assistance in the colony. In this respect, the Court is particularly mindful of the fact that only days after a special tuberculosis medical panel had, without observing the applicant in person or hearing his complaints, declared him “clinically cured” of tuberculosis (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above), the applicant suffered a spontaneous pneumothorax of the left lung. Furthermore, the authorities ’ reaction to this situation gives rise to criticism. In particular, almost a month passed between the applicant complaining of a deterioration of his health and an X-ray exam revealing a pneumothorax. Despite the applicant ’ s acute condition requiring immediate medical assistance, the colony administration delayed his transfer to the tuberculosis hospital for four days. The applicant ’ s further transfer to the surgical department of the Oryol Regional Tuberculosis Hospital resulted in another two-day delay before he started receiving treatment. The Court is concerned that the authorities ’ failure to promptly and effectively address the applicant ’ s situation could have contributed to a rapid deterioration of his health and resulted in his being exposed to additional suffering and distress concomitant to his medical condition."

                "74. Finally, the Court reiterates that the applicant ’ s release from the Oryol Regional Tuberculosis Hospital was accompanied by an important recommendation to subject him to a two-month chemotherapy regimen with four anti-tuberculosis drugs. Being aware that regular and complete medication intake gives individual TB patients the best chance of cure, the Court finds it disturbing that, having commenced on 14 April 2004, the treatment was stopped less than a month later, on 6 May 2004. The applicant ’ s medical records furnish no explanation for the interruption of his treatment. Given the seriousness of the possible negative effects of interruption of treatment for the applicant, the Court notes that there is no indication that the authorities have ever considered whether the applicant should return to the prescribed treatment or whether that instance of incomplete medication necessitated additional caution and probably additional treatment for the applicant."

To sum up, the evidence put before the Court shows that the authorities failed to promptly diagnose the applicant with tuberculosis and delayed the initiation of effective therapy. It further considers that during the period under examination the applicant did not receive comprehensive, effective and transparent medical assistance in respect of his tuberculosis during detention in correctional colony no. 2. In addition the Court attributes particular weight to the fact that the applicant ’ s state of health suddenly and seriously deteriorated in March 2004, leading to his requiring surgery. The Court believes that, for lack of adequate medical treatment, the applicant was exposed to prolonged mental and physical suffering diminishing his human dignity.

The Court observes that each time the authorities encountered the applicant ’ s refusals to cooperate and his resistance to medical supervision and treatment they took steps to ensure that the applicant ’ s decision was well informed and that he had complete understanding of the consequences of his actions. It appears that the authorities took care to evaluate the refusals and considered individually each refusal of treatment on the applicant ’ s part to determine a proper response and, if possible, to adjust to the applicant ’ s demands. They offered him psychological support and attention, having provided clear and complete explanations of medical procedures, the sought outcome of the treatment and negative side effects of irregular medication (see, by contrast, Gorodnitchev, cited above, § 91; Testa v. Croatia, no. 20877/04, § 52, 12 July 2007; and Tarariyeva v. Russia, no. 4353/03, § 80, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV (extracts) ). The discussions, as well as any limits or conditions that the applicant set on a refusal, were clearly documented in his medical records. Despite the applicant ’ s consistent and occasionally aggressive refusals to comply with medical recommendations, the authorities did not interpret such behaviour as firm and complete refusal of other medical interventions, and did not abandon their attempts to comply with the schedule of medical procedures and treatment, even inviting representatives of the supervising State body and human rights organisations in an attempt to persuade the applicant not to refuse medical care (see paragraphs 22 and 26 above). The authorities ’ openness to dialogue with the applicant is also confirmed by their offers to the applicant of alternative medical facilities for the purpose of medical examinations. However, even when the examinations were performed in full compliance with the applicant ’ s demands and at a hospital of his choice, he still refused to follow the doctors ’ instructions in their entirety."

The Court is of the opinion that, in the absence of any evidence that the applicant ’ s refusals were the result of coercion or manipulation by outsiders or of his insufficient knowledge of the risks faced, as well as in the absence of any indication that the progress of his illness was such as to endanger himself or others, the authorities had no choice ultimately but to accept the applicant ’ s decision to decline medical services. Patients, such as the applicant, have the responsibility to communicate and cooperate with health authorities, to follow treatment and to contribute to community health. The Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant ’ s refusals to undergo treatment or medical examinations were occasionally linked to his requests for those procedures to be performed in a particular medical establishment. In this respect, the Court would like to reiterate its constant jurisprudence according to which a State has a sufficient margin of discretion in defining the manner in which it fulfils its obligation to provide detainees with the requisite medical assistance, inter alia, by choosing an appropriate medical facility, taking into account “the practical demands of imprisonment” as long as the standard of chosen care is “compatible with the human dignity” of a detainee (see Aleksanyan, cited above, § 140).
