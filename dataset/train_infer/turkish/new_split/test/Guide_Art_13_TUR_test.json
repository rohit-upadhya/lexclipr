                "137. The Court considers that in cases of the expulsion of aliens on grounds of national security – as here – reconciling the interest of preserving sensitive information with the individual's right to an effective remedy is obviously less difficult than in the above-mentioned cases where the system of secret surveillance or secret checks could only function if the individual remained unaware of the measures affecting him.",
                "While procedural restrictions may be necessary to ensure that no leakage detrimental to national security would occur and while any independent authority dealing with an appeal against a deportation decision may need to afford a wide margin of appreciation to the executive in matters of national security, that can by no means justify doing away with remedies altogether whenever the executive has chosen to invoke the term “national security” (see the above cited Chahal judgment and paragraph 96 above on possible ways of reconciling the relevant interests involved).",
                "Even where an allegation of a threat to national security is made, the guarantee of an effective remedy requires as a minimum that the competent independent appeals authority must be informed of the reasons grounding the deportation decision, even if such reasons are not publicly available. The authority must be competent to reject the executive's assertion that there is a threat to national security where it finds it arbitrary or unreasonable. There must be some form of adversarial proceedings, if need be through a special representative after a security clearance. Furthermore, the question whether the impugned measure would interfere with the individual's right to respect for family life and, if so, whether a fair balance is struck between the public interest involved and the individual's rights must be examined."

Where an appeal against such an order is submitted to a court, it is not entitled to enquire whether genuine national security concerns are at stake and must reject it. In the applicants' case the same approach was adopted by the Ministry of the Interior, to which Mr Al-Nashif appealed (see paragraph 36 above)."

As regards secret surveillance and the use of secret information for screening job candidates who would have access to sensitive information, Article 13 requires a remedy “as effective as it can be”, having regard to the fact that it is inherent in any system of secret surveillance or secret checks that there would be a restricted scope for recourse (see the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, § 69, and the above cited Leander judgment, § 78). Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law.

Switzerland ([GC], no. 27798/95, ECHR 2000-II) the applicant could appeal to a court. In those cases no violation of Article 13 of the Convention was found.",

The authority must be competent to reject the executive's assertion that there is a threat to national security where it finds it arbitrary or unreasonable. There must be some form of adversarial proceedings, if need be through a special representative after a security clearance. Furthermore, the question whether the impugned measure would interfere with the individual's right to respect for family life and, if so, whether a fair balance is struck between the public interest involved and the individual's rights must be examined."

It was impossible to determine the distance from which the shot had been fired because the surgical operation had obliterated any marks on his head.

Under that provision, police officers could legitimately fire upon any person who did not stop after being warned and a simple warning was apparently sufficient for the prosecuting authorities and the courts to find that the use of firearms had been “a means of last resort” within the provision's meaning. The Court further noted that until 2003 the wording of section 80(1)(4) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act had remained identical (see Tzekov v.

Much like section 42(1)(4), it treated as completely irrelevant the seriousness of the offence in respect of which the detainee was being kept in custody or the danger which he or she represented. Moreover, a reading of the decisions of the military investigating and prosecuting authorities and the military court shows that they apparently considered that a verbal warning and the firing of warning shots were sufficient to find that the use of firearms was “a means of last resort” within the provision's meaning (see paragraphs 25, 27, 33, 36, 40, 41, 42 and 43 above). However, the mere failure of an individual who does not otherwise appear dangerous to heed a verbal warning or stop after the firing of warning shots cannot serve as a basis for the use of deadly force against him or her (see Kakoulli v.

However, without explaining why and in apparent contradiction with the provision's plain textual meaning, they construed it as allowing the police to use firearms to arrest an escaping detainee. It is not the Court's role to question the correctness of that interpretation; it must base its examination on the provisions of the domestic law as they were applied by the national authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, § 35, Series A no. 62, and Vasilescu v. Romania, 22 May 1998, § 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ III )."

In view of the foregoing, the Court cannot but confirm the conclusion that it reached in Tzekov : the legal provisions governing the use of firearms by the police in respect of individuals fleeing from detention, as interpreted and applied in the present case, were fundamentally insufficient to protect those concerned against unjustified and arbitrary encroachments on their right to life (see, mutatis mutandis, Tzekov, cited above, § 56, and Nachova and Others, cited above, §§ 99 and 100, concerning the use of firearms by the military police). As the Court explained in Nachova and Others, the legitimate aim of effecting a lawful arrest can only justify putting human life at risk in circumstances of absolute necessity; there is no such necessity where it is known that the person to be arrested poses no threat to life or limb and is not suspected of having committed a violent offence, even if a failure to use lethal force may result in the opportunity to arrest the fugitive being lost. The principle of strict proportionality inherent in Article 2 requires the national legal framework regulating arrest operations to make recourse to firearms dependent on a careful assessment of the surrounding circumstances, and, in particular, on an evaluation of the nature of the offence committed by the fugitive and of the threat he or she posed. Furthermore, the national law regulating policing operations must secure a system of adequate and effective safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse of force and even against avoidable accident. In particular, law enforcement agents must be trained to assess whether or not there is an absolute necessity to use firearms, not only on the basis of the letter of the relevant regulations, but also with due regard to the pre ‑ eminence of respect for human life as a fundamental value (see Nachova and Others, cited above, §§ 94 ‑ 97, with further references)."

Lithuania, nos. 70659/01 and 74371/01, §§ 79 and 80, 24 April 2008 ). The Court does not overlook the fact that Mr Karandja was killed during an unplanned operation that gave rise to developments to which the police had to react fast and without prior preparation, and understands that the authorities'obligations under Article 2 must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible burden on them (see Tzekov, cited above § 61, with further references). Nevertheless, it cannot accept that in the circumstances of the present case the police could reasonably have believed that Mr Karandja – who had been detained in connection with two non ‑ violent offences, the first of which he committed while he was still a minor (see paragraph 6 above) – was dangerous and that they needed to use firearms to immobilise him. The Court considers that in those circumstances any resort to potentially deadly force was prohibited by Article 2, regardless of the risk that Mr Karandja might escape. Recourse to such force cannot be considered as “absolutely necessary” where it is known that the person to be prevented from escaping poses no threat to life or limb and is not suspected of having committed a violent offence (see Nachova and Others, § 107, and Tzekov, §§ 63 and 64, both cited above)."

By basing themselves on the strict letter of that provision and on their interpretation of Article 12a of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 41, 42, 43 and 46 above), the military investigating and prosecuting authorities and the military court disregarded highly material circumstances, such as the facts that the Sergeant had no reason to believe that Mr Karandja represented a danger to anyone, that other ways of preventing Mr Karandja from fleeing might have existed, and that it was questionable whether the Sergeant was at all entitled to use a firearm to prevent him from escaping. That approach fell short of the requirements of Article 2 (see Nachova and Others, § 114, and Tzekov, § 71, both cited above, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Ivan Vasilev v.

It does not seem that any serious effort was made to identify civilian eyewitnesses and take statements from them, or to find the spent cartridges from all the shots fired by Chief Sergeant G.P. Without the information that such steps could have yielded, it was not possible to check the Sergeant's account of the events, which was all the more important in view of the discrepancy between, on the one hand, his assertion that he had fired several shots, confirmed by the testing of his handgun, and, on the other hand, the fact that the gunshot residue test had turned out negative (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above). Nor did the authorities try to identify – through a ballistics test or other means – the Sergeant's and Mr Karandja's exact positions at the time of the shooting. This made it impossible to determine why, if the Sergeant had been aiming for Mr Karandja's knees (see paragraphs 17 in fine and 22 above), he ended up shooting him in the back of the head. That important question was only addressed, very briefly, in the military court's decision (see paragraph 43 above). Lastly, it does not seem that any measures were taken to prevent the opportunities for collusion between the officers involved (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, § 330, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... ). Against that background, the Court can only reiterate that a prompt and effective response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force is essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 118)."

The Court further notes that for more than two years the investigating authorities failed properly to acquaint the applicant with the results of the investigation (see paragraphs 26, 27, 31, 34 and 37 above) and that, as a result of the automatic system for reviewing discontinuance which was in force between January 2000 and May 2001 (see paragraphs 47 ‑ 49 above), the applicant was ultimately unable effectively to challenge the investigation's findings ( see, by contrast, McShane v. the United Kingdom, no. 43290/98, § 118, 28 May 2002 ). The opportunity to lodge objections with the investigator was clearly insufficient in that regard because it was the investigator himself who had responded to them and because they did not alter in the slightest his final proposal to the prosecuting authorities (see paragraphs 38 ‑ 40 above). In those circumstances, and given the applicant's close and personal concern with the subject matter of the investigation, the Court finds that she cannot be regarded as having been involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard her legitimate interests."

However, the death of her son at the age of twenty, when he was about to start work and support her, had deprived her of such assistance. In the particular circumstances, she was unable to provide documents to corroborate her claim. However, it would be unfair to assume that a son would not provide help and assistance to his sick mother. The applicant therefore asked the Court to rule on her claim in equity. Alternatively, she invited the Court to base the award in respect of loss of income on 30% of the average salary which her son would have received for fifteen years – the period during which she could have reasonably expected to receive financial assistance from him. According to official statistics, the average monthly salary in Bulgaria was 460 Bulgarian levs which, in the applicant's view, was equivalent to EUR 230.

This may, in appropriate cases, include compensation in respect of loss of earnings (see, among other authorities, Angelova and Iliev v. Bulgaria, no. 55523/00, § 125 in limine, ECHR 2007 ‑ IX, and Nikolova and Velichkova v. Bulgaria, no. 7888/03, § 82 in limine, 20 December 2007). In the present case, the Court has found that the authorities were liable under Article 2 for the death of the applicant's son. It also notes that her assertion that her son would have been providing for her financially was not disputed by the Government. In those circumstances, the Court sees no reason to doubt the existence of a sufficient causal link between the breach of Article 2 and the applicant's loss of financial support ( see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 171, and Beker v. Turkey, no. 27866/03, § 62, 24 March 2009 ). However, there is no evidence as to Mr Karandja's actual income, if any (see Nehyet Günay and Others v. Turkey, no. 51210/99, § 122, 21 October 2008 ), and the method used by the applicant to calculate the loss of financial support is far from precise. The calculations submitted by her are based on the assumption that her son would have had a stable income for fifteen years. Various eventualities, such as unemployment or incapacity to work, have not been taken into account (see Sangariyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 1839/04, § 128, 29 May 2008 ), nor has the applicant presented an actuarial report. The Court is therefore obliged to deal with her claim on an equitable basis (see Velikova v. Bulgaria, no. 41488/98, § 102, ECHR 2000 ‑ VI, and Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, § 82 ). Indeed, in cases such as the present one a precise calculation of the sums necessary to make complete reparation ( restitutio in integrum ) in respect of the pecuniary losses suffered by the applicant may be prevented by the inherently uncertain character of the damage flowing from the violation. The question to be decided in such cases is the level of just satisfaction, which is a matter to be determined by the Court at its discretion, having regard to what is equitable (see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 171, with further references)."

This decision, which was the subject of consideration by the Grand Chamber in the above-mentioned Z. and Others v. the United Kingdom case, had held that no duty of care existed in respect of the child applicants’ claims that the local authority in that case had been negligent in failing to remove them from their home where they were victims of abuse and neglect."

However, these developments took place some years after the X. and Others case, which at the time gave the impression that the highest judicial authority had ruled out the possibility of suing local authorities in the exercise of their child protection functions on grounds of public policy. If taking action at the present time, the applicants might, at least on arguable grounds, have a claim to a duty of care under domestic law, reinforced by the ability under the Human Rights Act to rely directly on the provisions of the Convention. The Court is not satisfied that this was the case at the relevant time in 1996.

He recalled visiting W.H. at a separate address in Dumfries during this period and sending mail to that address. He believed that W.H. was living there and not at the applicants’ home. In the precognition annexed to the Government’s observations, Mr M., who was also probation officer for E. and acted as replacement for the family social worker, recalled however that he did have suspicions that W.H. might still be living at the family home and that on visiting the family home two or three times unexpectedly he found W.H. “just leaving”. He did not consider that there was sufficient evidence of W.H. breaching the conditions attached to his probation order to justify taking the matter further."

When Mr M. took over the case, he noted that W.H. was not living there (social work case notes entry of 6 August 1977 ) and that W.H. was not contributing financially to his children. In his later affidavit, he stated that this entry was based on information from the mother. Entries indicated concerns about school attendance and that the mother had been repeatedly told that she should not keep the girls off school. In September 1977, it was noted that the school had expressed concerns about the welfare of T., the fourth applicant, which was attended to by a senior social worker. A school meeting concerning the children’s attendance was arranged but the mother and H., the second applicant, failed to attend. In November 1997, the social worker paid an unexpected visit to the home and found that W.H. was there. Both he and the mother denied that he was living there."

The first incident which she recalled was when she was 6 or 7 when he struck her, sending her flying into the wall. Soon after, he began coming into her room at night and doing things to her, requiring her to masturbate him. If she cried, he would punch her in the face. From the age of 12, he used to make the girls have a bath together and would touch them all over their bodies, inserting his finger into them. Often he would keep her off school and would abuse her sexually. He assaulted her often, coming up behind her to hit her on the back of the head. He also used to stand on her naked feet with his shoes on and twist, pinch her with his nails and punch her. This physical abuse happened on a daily basis. He would also get her and the others to strip to the waist and hit each other with dog chains. This conduct continued regularly until she left home on her 17 th birthday ( 19 October 1977 ). She recalled going to the social services when she was aged 14 and telling them that W.H. was living with them when he was not supposed to. Nothing happened as a result. While the social services were coming to the house, she did not remember them talking to her. She recalled that this period was before she was 14 or 15, before 1974 or 1975. When she was 15, she started running away from home. On one occasion she took pills. When she was visited by the police in hospital, she told them that W.H. was interfering with her. She also told this to a psychiatrist whom she saw soon after. However, W.H. continued interfering with her. W.H. was only arrested after L. had run away from home in January 1977. E. had suffered serious problems since that time, having made several suicide attempts and having developed a severe drink problem. A psychiatric report of 24 April 1992 concluded that her symptoms accorded with a diagnosis of severe post traumatic stress disorder.",

From about the age of 6 or 7, W.H. used to punch him in the stomach and bash him against the wall. He also made him and the others strip to the waist and punch and hit each other with chains. These relentless assaults went on regularly until he left home during 1978. A psychiatric report of 9 June 1992 concluded that he had long term relationship problems, poor self confidence and long standing personality difficulties.",
                "(iii) L. stated that she had suffered sexual and physical abuse from W.H. from 1969 until she left home in about 1979 and on occasion after that. W.H. had started interfering with her when she was about 5 or 6. The first thing she remembered was him bathing her with her sister E. and rubbing her private parts. Hardly a day went past when he did not do something of a sexual nature to her (e.g. touching her breasts or private parts) or batter her. When she was older, he made her touch him on his private parts and perform oral sex. He made her and the other children hit each other with chains and whips and would sometimes join in. She was often left with bad bruises and a bleeding nose. From the age of 11 or 12, he had sexual intercourse with her several times. When she ran away in January 1977, she told the police and he was arrested. However, he returned home and started interfering with her again, having intercourse with her and punching or kicking her if she refused. She ran away again in Spring 1977 and was put into a home, first in Dumfries, then Annan and finally Closeburn, which she eventually left in 1979 when she was 16. At that point, she did not return home but went to stay with her sister and then embarked in a series of relationships. When she visited her mother on 1 January 1980, W.H. put his hands up her skirt but let her go when she threatened to tell her boyfriend. On another occasion in 1981, W.H. tried to fondle her but she got up and left. She had never been able to tell anyone about these things as she was scared of him and thought that he would severely assault her. A psychiatric report of 24 April 1992 concluded that her symptoms, including nightmares and sleep disturbance, accorded with a diagnosis of severe post traumatic stress disorder.",
                "(iv) T. stated that she had suffered sexual and physical abuse from W.H. from about 1971 to 1989. Though she did not remember anything specifically before the age of 9, she slept in the same bed as L. and remembered him coming naked into the bed with them. From an early age, he used to stand on her naked feet in his shoes and twirl round, nip her and punch her in the stomach. She had black eyes occasionally. When she was 9, she remembered him making her touch him and masturbate him. She had to do that to him two or three times a week when he came home from work. He then started keeping her off school and would lie down on the bed naked, making her take her clothes off and masturbate him. This occurred two or three times a week. When she was 10 or 11, he began to touch her breasts and rub his penis over her until he ejaculated. When she was 14, he forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. He did not repeat that but continued touching her and making her masturbate him or have oral sex. This continued until 1984 when she was able to leave home – she deliberately got pregnant by having sex with someone she knew, so that the local authority would provide her with accommodation away from home. In 1987, W.H. started coming to her house and would try to touch and grab her. She became very depressed and suicidal. She then told the Family Centre about the abuse. A psychiatric report of 24 April 1992 concluded that her symptoms, including low self-esteem, fear, mistrust and depression, accorded with a diagnosis of severe post traumatic stress disorder."

There was no real appreciation of the extent to which abusers might continue to abuse their victims over many years or of the skills of abusers in avoiding detection. Social workers were not given any specific training about child sex abuse. There was also the practice at the time of local authorities keeping their probation and child care functions separate, with social workers working separately rather than as part of a team and there was a tendency for there to be relatively little interaction between schools and social work departments."

Even if they had considered the possible breach of probation further, they would not have gone on to consider possible harm to the children. It would have been standard practice to make specific appointments to visit the home in order to avoid wasted time and she would not have expected the social worker to make spot checks or call at unexpected times to check on W.H.. As was the practice, social services provided support for the mother who had considerable problems in running the home, and would have had a tendency not to investigate the causes of any running away or of truancy, particularly where the child was close to school leaving age.

The school problems drawn to the attention of the social services did not appear to have prompted the social worker to suggest a meeting to try to draw together the issues for the family and this meant that the full extent of the problems that L. and the others in the family faced were not discussed by the wider group of professionals who knew the family.

Even if social workers at the time were not aware of the incidence of sexual abuse, the incidents with the two girls and the evident distress shown by them should have usefully led to an attempt to discuss with them individually how things were at home, in particular to establish the severity of past incidents and whether any other children in the house were at risk of sexual or physical abuse."

Mr R. did not appear to have issued any warning to them about the consequences of breaching the probation order.

After the report on E. in June, it could have been expected that the workers involved in the family would have increased their scrutiny of the living arrangements in the family.

When an offender is placed on probation he is allowed to retain his liberty during the period of probation but must comply with the requirements of the probation order. In all cases the order requires the offender to be of good behaviour, conform to the directions of the supervising officer and to inform the supervising officer if he changes residence or employment. Other requirements may be imposed, such as conditions as to the place of residence. If the offender fails to comply with requirements of the probation order, that failure may be reported to the sentencing court by the supervisory officer or other responsible officials of the Social Work Department. The supervising officer has a degree of discretion where there is an apparent breach of the order. He may warn the probationer about the conduct if he considers a warning is likely to alter the probationer’s behaviour. If he reports the matter to the court, the court then investigates the matter.

Even if the social services were not aware he was inflicting abuse at this time, they should have been aware that the children remained at potential risk. The fact that at the relevant time there was not the knowledge of the prevalence of, and persistence of, sexual offenders victimising children within a family that there exists now, is not significant in this case where, as the applicants emphasise, the social services knew that there had been incidences of sexual abuse resulting in criminal offences and were under an obligation to monitor the offender’s conduct in the aftermath of the conviction."

Where the damage was caused directly by a perpetrator of abuse and the liability of the local authority was subsidiary or derivative, the requirement for compensation could be met through remedies against the abuser himself or by the State providing awards under a compensation scheme such as the CICB. The applicants could also have obtained a determination of liability through judicial review proceedings, civil proceedings against the local authority (which they chose to withdraw) and the local authority ombudsman. It was not apparent that the applicants’ civil claims would have been rejected for lack of a cause of action as they arguably raised operational matters not affected by the ruling in the X. and Others case, though in the Government’s view it would have failed on the merits.

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law.

However, these developments took place some years after the X. and Others case, which at the time gave the impression that the highest judicial authority had ruled out the possibility of suing local authorities in the exercise of their child protection functions on grounds of public policy. If taking action at the present time, the applicants might, at least on arguable grounds, have a claim to a duty of care under domestic law, reinforced by the ability under the Human Rights Act to rely directly on the provisions of the Convention.

Efforts have been made by myself and other workers to improve matters, including a “family group” meeting on a weekly basis, but progress is slow and the basic problems remain. Whilst these efforts will be maintained it is considered that [the first applicant] the eldest is now beyond the control of her parents and this is not likely to improve.

On occasions N.C. would require the second applicant to touch his twin sister J. on the vagina and would require J. to masturbate the second applicant. The second applicant did this unwillingly and because N.C. threatened him that there would be trouble if he did not. The second applicant did not report to his mother for fear of not being believed and from fear of N.C.

The House of Lords there held that local authorities could not be sued for negligence or for breach of statutory duty in respect of the discharge of their functions concerning the welfare of children. The children in that case had suffered severe neglect and abuse from their parents and had alleged that the local authority had failed to protect them, inter alia, by not exercising their power to take them into care at an earlier stage. As regards the claims that the local authority owed a duty of care to the applicants pursuant to the tort of negligence, Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated inter alia :",
                "“I turn then to consider whether, in accordance with the ordinary principles laid down in Caparo [1990] 2 A.C. 605, the local authority ... owed a direct duty of care to the plaintiffs. The local authority accepts that they could foresee damage to the plaintiffs if they carried out their statutory duties negligently and that the relationship between the authority and the plaintiffs is sufficiently proximate. The third requirement laid down in Caparo is that it must be just and reasonable to impose a common law duty of care in all the circumstances ...",
                "The Master of the Rolls took the view, with which I agree, that the public policy consideration that has first claim on the loyalty of the law is that wrongs should be remedied and that very potent counter considerations are required to override that policy (see [1994] 4 AER 602 at 619). However, in my judgment there are such considerations in this case.",
                "First, in my judgment a common law duty of care would cut across the whole statutory system set up for the protection of children at risk. As a result of the ministerial directions contained in “Working Together” the protection of such children is not the exclusive territory of the local authority’s social services. The system is inter-disciplinary, involving the participation of the police, educational bodies, doctors and others. At all stages the system involves joint discussions, joint recommendations and joint decisions. The key organisation is the Child Protection Conference, a multi -disciplinary body which decides whether to place the child on the Child Protection Register. This procedure by way of joint action takes place, not merely because it is good practice, but because it is required by guidance having statutory force binding on the local authority. The guidance is extremely detailed and extensive: the current edition of “Working Together” runs to 126 pages. To introduce into such a system a common law duty of care enforceable against only one of the participant bodies would be manifestly unfair. To impose such liability on all the participant bodies would lead to almost impossible problems of disentangling as between the respective bodies the liability, both primary and by way of contribution, of each for reaching a decision found to be negligent.",
                "Second, the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with children at risk is extraordinarily delicate. Legislation requires the local authority to have regard not only to the physical well-being of the child but also to the advantages of not disrupting the child’s family environment. ... In one of the child abuse cases, the local authority is blamed for removing the child precipitately; in the other for failing to remove the children from their mother. As the Report of the Inquiry into Child Abuse in Cleveland 1987 ( Cmnd. 412) (“Cleveland Report 1987”) said, at p. 244:",
                "‘... It is a delicate and difficult line to tread between taking action too soon and not taking it soon enough. Social services whilst putting the needs of the child first must respect the rights of the parents; they also must work if possible with the parents for the benefit of the children. These parents themselves are often in need of help. Inevitably a degree of conflict develops between those objectives.’",
                "Next, if liability in damages were to be imposed, it might well be that local authorities would adopt a more cautious and defensive approach to their duties. For example, as the Cleveland Report makes clear, on occasions the speedy decision to remove the child is sometimes vital. If the authority is to be made liable in damages for a negligent decision to remove a child (such negligence lying in the failure properly first to investigate the allegations) there would be a substantial temptation to postpone making such a decision until further inquiries have been made in the hope of getting more concrete facts. Not only would the child in fact being abused be prejudiced by such delay, the increased workload inherent in making such investigations would reduce the time available to deal with other cases and other children.",
                "The relationship between the social worker and the child’s parents is frequently one of conflict, the parent wishing to retain care of the child, the social worker having to consider whether to remove it. This is fertile ground in which to breed ill-feeling and litigation, often hopeless, the cost of which both in terms of money and human resources will be diverted from the performance of the social service for which they were provided. The spectre of vexatious and costly litigation is often urged as a reason for not imposing a legal duty. But the circumstances surrounding cases of child abuse make the risk a very high one which cannot be ignored.",
                "If there were no other remedy for maladministration of the statutory system for the protection of children, it would provide substantial argument for imposing a duty of care. But the statutory complaints procedures contained in section 76 of the 1980 Act and the much fuller procedures now available under the 1989 Act provide a means to have grievances investigated though not to recover compensation. Further, it was submitted (and not controverted ) that the local authorities Ombudsman would have power to investigate cases such as these.",
                "Finally, your Lordships’ decision in Caparo [1990] 2 A.C. 605 lays down that in deciding whether to develop novel categories of negligence the court should proceed incrementally and by analogy with decided categories. We were not referred to any category of case in which a duty of care has been held to exist which is in any way analogous to the present cases. Here, for the first time, the plaintiffs are seeking to erect a common law duty of care in relation to the administration of a statutory social welfare scheme. Such a scheme is designed to protect weaker members of society (children) from harm done to them by others. The scheme involves the administrators in exercising discretion and powers which could not exist in the private sector and which in many cases bring them into conflict with those who, under the general law, are responsible for the child’s welfare. To my mind, the nearest analogies are the cases where a common law duty of care has been sought to be imposed upon the police (in seeking to protect vulnerable members of society from wrongs done to them by others) or statutory regulators of financial dealing who are seeking to protect investors from dishonesty. In neither of these cases has it been thought appropriate to superimpose on a statutory regime a common law duty of care giving rise to a claim in damages for failure to protect the weak against the wrongdoer. ... In my judgment, the courts should proceed with great care before holding liable in negligence those who have been charged by Parliament with the task of protecting society from the wrong doings of others.”"

The local authority had applied to strike out the case as disclosing no cause of action. The House of Lords, upholding the plaintiff’s appeal, unanimously held that the case of X and Others v.

                "“(1) Although the word ‘immunity’ is sometimes incorrectly used, a holding that it is not fair, just and reasonable to hold liable a particular class of defendants whether generally or in relation to a particular type of activity is not to give immunity from a liability to which the rest of the world is subject. It is a prerequisite to there being any liability in negligence at all that as a matter of policy it is fair, just and reasonable in those circumstances to impose liability in negligence. (2) In a wide range of cases public policy has led to the decision that the imposition of liability would not be fair and reasonable in the circumstances, e.g. some activities of financial regulators, building inspectors, ship surveyors, social workers dealing with sex abuse cases. In all these cases and many others the view has been taken that the proper performance of the defendant’s primary functions for the benefit of society as a whole will be inhibited if they are required to look over their shoulder to avoid liability in negligence. In English law the decision as to whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a liability in negligence on a particular class of would-be defendants depends on weighing in the balance the total detriment to the public interest in all cases from holding such class liable in negligence as against the total loss to all would-be plaintiffs if they are not to have a cause of action in respect of the loss they have individually suffered. (3) In English law, questions of public policy and the question whether it is fair and reasonable to impose liability in negligence are decided as questions of law. Once the decision is taken that, say, company auditors though liable to shareholders for negligent auditing are not liable to those proposing to invest in the company (see Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 1 All ER 568, [1990] 2 AC 605), that decision will apply to all future cases of the same kind. The decision does not depend on weighing the balance between the extent of the damage to the plaintiff and the damage to the public in each particular case.”"

The local authority was under a positive obligation imposed by Article 3 of the Convention to take preventive measures to protect them from N.C. That had required them to take the steps reasonably available to them to end the abuse of which they knew, or of which they ought to have had knowledge. They submit that the authorities were aware of the abuse. The first applicant recalled mentioning to the social worker, Mr C., that N.C. had hit them and “other things”.

This should have led the social services to make serious investigation into the situation. They should inter alia have ensured that the applicants’ names were on the “at risk” register, that there was active case management, held more regular case conferences and involved social workers of sufficient experience and adequate training. Instead, they failed to take control of the situation or to react effectively, inter alia, by removing the children on 8 July 1980 after there had been complaints that N.C. had been hitting the second applicant and his twin.

They pointed out that a delicate balance had to be struck with Article 8 of the Convention, which protected family and private life, and that the removal of children from their family was potentially very harmful and should not be done without the appropriate evidence. The records of the social services showed that there was no suggestion of sexual abuse occurring in the family. They concentrated considerable energy and resources on the severe problems of the family which were known to them. The later evidence from the criminal investigation suggested a history of inter- generational abuse where the mother was complicit, and there was a culture of absolute silence on the issue between members of the family. The first applicant’s complaints to the social worker referred to instances of physical assault and there was no mention of sexual abuse. The interpretation of the situation by the social workers must be viewed in its historical context, in particular the limited awareness of sexual abuse which existed at that time. It is likely that, given even today’s level of awareness, the social workers would not have considered the case to suggest sexual abuse. Signs such as soiling, advanced sexualisation and truancy, are considered low risk indicators which could have a number of explanations and which do not include abuse.

The obligation on High Contracting Parties under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention, taken together with Article 3, requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see A. v. the United Kingdom judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VI, p. 2699, § 22).

                "112. On the basis of these materials, the Court has considered whether the local authority should have been aware that the applicants were suffering sexual abuse from their stepfather. From 1967, the social services were in almost constant contact with the family, providing relief for the mother, practical help with housing and threats from the Electricity Board to cut off their electricity, assistance with chronic financial problems, and, increasingly involved in the difficulties experienced by the children. From 1973, the social service records refer to the second applicant’s problem of soiling, which led to the involvement of medical professionals and his admittance as an inpatient. From at least 1978, there were concerns about truanting by a number of the children in the family and involvement of the Education Welfare Officer. Incidents of violence were reported but these were sporadic - an incident on 29 June 1978 when the children complained that N.C. had hit them, on 7 July 1980 when the child A. complained that she had been hit during a family row, a complaint by J. on 29 May 1981 that N.C. had hit her and on 27 November 1981 when it was N.C. who complained that the second applicant had been smashing up the house. These cannot be regarded as revealing a clear pattern of victimisation or abuse. The Court is not persuaded therefore that there were any particular aspects of the turbulent and volatile family situation which should have led the social services to suspect a deeper, more insidious problem in a family which was experiencing financial hardship, occasional criminal proceedings and with a mother observed to be “less caring” than she should be. Far from N.C. being perceived as a risk element in this scenario, the social services considered that there was grounds for believing, at least in the early years, that he was a positive influence, providing a father figure for the growing number of children, support for the mother and some added wage-earning capacity. In view of the apparent assistance of the mother in covering for N.C. and the silence of all the children notwithstanding their numerous contacts with various professionals over the years, the Court does not consider that the social services can be criticised for failing to instigate an investigation into the possibility of some additional underlying problem."

The Court has had previous occasion to acknowledge the difficult and sensitive decisions facing social services and the important and countervailing principle of respecting and preserving family life. While there were times when both applicants showed significant distress in the family environment, both also showed strong ties to the family. After the first applicant was placed in temporary foster care in May 1980, she returned home at her own request. The second applicant was placed in a Children’s Home from 1982 to 1984, with alternate weekends at home and though on some occasions he showed reluctance to go home on other occasions he appeared to enjoy the visits. For the social services to be justified in taking the draconian step of cutting permanently both applicants’ links with their family would have required convincing reasons, which were not apparent at that time."

The Court reiterates that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law (see the Aksoy v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2286, § 95; the Aydın v. Turkey judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports 1997-VI, pp. 1895-96, § 103; the Kaya v. Turkey judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, pp. 329-30, § 106)."

Turkey judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, pp. 330-31, § 107). Where alleged failure by the authorities to protect persons from the acts of others is concerned, Article 13 may not always require that the authorities undertake the responsibility for investigating the allegations. There should however be available to the victim or the victim’s family a mechanism for establishing any liability of State officials or bodies for acts or omissions involving the breach of their rights under the Convention. Furthermore, in the case of a breach of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, which rank as the most fundamental provisions of the Convention, compensation for the non-pecuniary damage flowing from the breach should in principle be available as part of the range of redress (see Z. and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, § 109; Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, ECHR 2001-III, §§ 122, 129; Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, judgment of 14 March 2002, § 97).",

This does not however mean, for the purposes of Article 13, that their complaints fall outside the scope of its protection. These complaints were not declared inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded and necessitated an examination on the merits. It is not disputed that the applicants did suffer appalling abuse at a time when they were under the supervision of the local authorities. The issue as to whether the local authority should have been aware of what was going on and taken steps to safeguard the applicants required consideration of documentary records going back over thirty years. While the Court was not persuaded on the materials available before it that these disclosed a situation where the local authorities knew of, or had reason to suspect, the sexual abuse, this Court’s role is essentially subsidiary to that of the domestic courts who are better placed and equipped as fact-finding tribunals. An effective domestic procedure of enquiry would have offered more prospect of establishing the facts and throwing light on the conduct reasonably to be expected from the social services in a situation where the applicants demonstrated long-term and serious problems that arguably might have called for additional efforts of investigation to uncover the reality of the family dynamics."

[was] unacceptable, having regard inter alia to the material conditions and possible duration of travel”. It recommended, as an immediate measure, that the national authorities take steps, in particular, to reduce significantly the maximum number of prisoners per compartment in railway carriages: 3.5 sq. m compartments should never contain more than six persons, and 2 sq. m compartments never more than three persons (Ukraine: Visit 2000, CPT/Inf (2002) 23). By contrast, it found the conditions satisfactory during a contemporaneous visit to Switzerland, where most prisoners were accommodated in single bar-fronted compartments. Compartments had a surface area of 0.9 by 1.5 metres and a height of 1.95 metres, and were fitted with one padded bench (Switzerland: Visit 2001, CPT/Inf (2002) 4).",

Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000-XI). However, the Government’s declarations by which they sought to settle these cases did not contain any undertaking to address the crucial Convention issue under the Convention which continues to affect hundreds of prisoners in Russia.

Acceptance of the Government’s request to strike the present applications out of the Court’s list would leave the current situation unchanged, without any guarantee that a genuine solution would be found in the near future (compare Gerasimov and Others, cited above, § 138).

Russia (no. 2), no. 14248/05, § 133, 16 December 2010).

Insufficient ventilation on hot days and a lack of heating when the van was stationary with the engine turned off, were also noted as aggravating factors (see Vlasov, § 94, and Yakovenko, § 109, both cited above)."

Whether such cramped conditions result from an excessive number of detainees being transported together or from the restrictive design of compartments is immaterial for the Court’s analysis, which is focused on the objective conditions of transfer as they were and their effect on the applicants, rather than on their causes. The low height of the ceiling, especially of single-prisoner cubicles, which forces prisoners to stoop, may exacerbate physical suffering and fatigue. Inadequate protection from outside temperatures, when prisoner cells are not sufficiently heated or ventilated, will constitute an aggravating factor (see the case-law cited in paragraph 118 above)."

There is no indication that train compartments had been filled beyond their normative capacity, with the exception of Mr Vasilyev’s compartment on the way to Yekaterinburg, which had accommodated thirteen people. However, formal compliance with domestic regulations is not decisive for the Court’s assessment of an alleged violation of Article 3. What is important is that each journey involved at least one overnight ride, whereas only six sleeping places were available in the large compartments and three in the small ones (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). Prisoners outnumbered the available sleeping places sometimes by a factor of two, and the sixty-centimetre bunks were too narrow to accommodate more than one person under normal conditions. The “bridge” half-bunk did not help in the matter of insufficient sleeping places as it was too short for the average person.

The applicable regulations required that certain categories of vulnerable detainees, including women, be transferred separately from other prisoners (see paragraph 66 above). That requirement pursued the legitimate aims of preventing security incidents, inter-prisoner violence and sexual harassment. However, owing to the gender imbalance among the general prison population in which men significantly outnumber women, multi-prisoner cells are routinely allocated to male prisoners, while female prisoners are relegated to cramped metal cubicles for the duration of transfers.

Afflicted with diabetes, she had a corpulent body. Her condition called for a generous allocation of seating space and good access to ventilation, so as to make her conditions of transfer more bearable. However, the authorities in charge of the transfer did not consider her special needs. To make matters worse, they put another woman together with her for the duration of each journey. The Court concedes that in doing so, they were following to the letter the regulations requiring separation of the sexes, and that is what the officials relied on to justify their conduct (see paragraph 35 above). The Court cannot accept it, however, as justification for putting Ms Kostromina in a situation of extreme physical hardship.

One specific feature of the cell design stands out. The cell was assembled from metal sheets that formed a fully enclosed cubicle with air holes in the door (see paragraph 17 above). This design guaranteed complete isolation of the prisoner from the non-secure area of the van. However, it also had the effect of thermally insulating the cell, blocking the flow of heat from the heater located in the central aisle into the cubicle. There was no heating inside the cell and, as the rear panel was attached directly to the outer panel of the van, the cold was transferred from the outside.

The subsequent decisions in Mr Vasilyev’s cases and many others followed that line of reasoning.

A new model of prisoner railway carriage, no. 61-4495, had been developed and launched in 2015. It was equipped with air conditioning, chemical toilets, and enhanced lighting and video-surveillance systems. In 2016, the Ministry of the Interior received a first shipment of twenty-six such railway carriages and put them into operation.

The Conveyance Instruction made no provision for distributing bed linen or hot water, or for securing adequate access to a toilet. Prisoners were not allowed access to the toilet in old-style Soviet prisoner carriages while they were stationary because human waste was discharged directly onto the railway tracks. The replacement of twenty ‑ six carriages in 2016 to which the Government had referred was part of an ongoing renewal of rolling stock, but new carriages had been built to the same obsolete standards as the old ones. As regards prison vans, the domestic standards defining space allocation in single and multi-prisoner cells were likewise exceedingly restrictive, providing no more than 0.3 square metres per person. The applicants concluded that the structural problem would persist until the domestic standards had been reviewed."

A number of provisions of the Conveyance Instruction, such as the excessively high occupancy limits, negatively affected the conditions of prisoners’ transfers and failed to adequately protect their rights in line with international standards.

According to the Court’s case management database, more than 680 prima facie meritorious applications against Russia are now pending before the Court which feature, as their primary or secondary grievance, a complaint of inadequate conditions of transport. Of those, 540 applications were lodged in 2018. The above numbers, taken on their own, are indicative of the existence of a recurrent structural problem (see Varga and Others v.

As the Court observed with concern, the violations found were neither prompted by an isolated incident, nor attributable to a particular turn of events in those cases, but stemmed chiefly from an unwavering application of the domestic normative framework (see paragraph 141 above). Given the vastness of the Russian prison network in which prisoners are frequently transported over long distances (see paragraphs 7 and 82 above), the problem has thus affected, and has remained capable of affecting, a large number of individuals throughout Russia (compare Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 185)."

Thus, the Moscow capital region has six penal facilities for a combined population of 22,000,000, while the Komi Republic has twice as many for a population of 900,000. Article 73 of the Code on the Execution of Sentences establishes a general rule on geographical distribution of prisoners, according to which prisoners should be allocated to penal facilities where they had lived or where they had been convicted, save in “exceptional cases” (see Polyakova and Others, cited above, § 94). The spirit and the objective of Article 73 was to preserve prisoners’ social and family ties (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, § 850, 25 July 2013)."

Unless mandated by compelling security considerations, the use of single-prisoner stakan -type cubicles should be avoided. Elements that impede prisoners from standing up, such as bridge bunks in large compartments of prisoner railway carriages, will need to be uninstalled.

The Court has identified a structural problem in the present case, referring notably to the large number of people affected and the urgent need to grant them speedy and appropriate redress at domestic level. It is therefore convinced that the purpose of the present judgment can only be achieved if the required changes take effect in the Russian legal system without undue delay. The Court reiterates that it called on the Russian authorities to make available domestic remedies in respect of a relevantly similar complaint more than six years ago, in 2012 (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, §§ 232-34). Having regard to the amount of time that has since elapsed and the apparent lack of progress in that matter, the Court considers that the required remedies must be made available not later than eighteen months after this judgment becomes final (see Neshkov and Others, cited above, § 290, and Torreggiani and Others, cited above, § 99).",

The Court considers, without anticipating the examination of whether the reasonable ‑ time requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was complied with, that the applicant ’ s complaint concerning the length of the proceedings in the Regional Court is prima facie “arguable”.

On 1 March 2008 that remedy was superseded by a “request for fixing of time ‑ limit in the event of delay” under Articles 255 ‑ 57 of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraphs 43 ‑ 49 above). However, since that second remedy was introduced after the end of the proceedings at issue in the present case, the Court does not need to examine its effectiveness in the present context. Therefore, for present purposes its analysis will be confined to the effectiveness of the “complaint about delays”."

            [
                "86. In cases concerning chiefly delays occurring prior to July 1999 the Court did not find it necessary to determine whether the “complaint about delays” was an effective remedy on the basis that even if it was, it had been introduced too late to make up for the delay which had already accrued (see Djangozov v. Bulgaria, no. 45950/99, § 52, 8 July 2004; Dimitrov v. Bulgaria, no. 47829/99, § 78, 23 September 2004; Rachevi v. Bulgaria, no. 47877/99, §§ 66, 67 and 100, 23 September 2004; Todorov v.

However, in one of those cases the Court noted that the applicants had successfully used a “complaint about delays” to prompt a court to give its judgment faster, which indicated that the remedy could be effective in certain circumstances (see Jeliazkov and Others, cited above, §§ 17, 19, 27, 28 and 48)."
            ],
            [
                "87. The first case in which the Court addressed the effectiveness of the “complaint about delays” was Stefanova v. Bulgaria. After examining the wording of Article 217a of the 1952 Code, it found that the complaint could in principle be an effective remedy, but that regard had to be had to the particular circumstances (see Stefanova v. Bulgaria, no. 58828/00, §§ 68 and 69, 11 January 2007 ). On the facts of Stefanova it was found ineffective, because the delays there had occurred as a result of the prosecuting authorities ’ failure to provide relevant documents and the courts ’ failure duly to notify a party about the delivery of judgment – issues that could not be resolved through a “complaint about delays” (ibid., §§ 70 and 71). In later judgments the Court identified further situations in which that remedy was unlikely to accelerate proceedings. It could not speed up civil proceedings stayed to await the outcome of criminal ones (see Djangozov, § 53, and Todorov, § 61, both cited above). It could not reduce delays due to problems with the service of summons on the defendant (see Simizov, cited above, § 55), or delays due to unjustified remittals of cases to the lower courts (see Givezov, cited above, § 38; Tzvyatkov v. Bulgaria, no. 2380/03, § 31, 22 October 2009; Kabakchievi, cited above, § 42; Kotseva ‑ Dencheva, cited above, § 28 in fine; and Rosen Petkov, cited above, §§ 34 ‑ 36). It did not seem to apply to proceedings before the Supreme Court of Cassation (see Pavlova v. Bulgaria, no. 39855/03, § 31, 14 January 2010; Maria Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 10905/04, § 35, 18 March 2010; Kabakchievi, cited above, § 41; and Kotseva ‑ Dencheva, cited above, § 28 ). It could not provide effective redress in respect of delays due to the failure of the courts to organise the proper examination of the case, or in situations in which the proceedings had lasted too long without there being identifiable periods of inactivity (see Deyanov v. Bulgaria, no. 2930/04, §§ 69 ‑ 70, 30 September 2010). Lastly, it cannot reduce delays due to factors extraneous to the judicial system, such as the failure of the local authorities to provide to the parties documents needed as evidence in the case."
            ],
            [
                "88. The Court is not persuaded that a “complaint about delays” would have been effective in the present case either, for two reasons. First, the proceedings had already lasted three years at the time when it was introduced (see Holzinger v. Austria (no. 2), no. 28898/95, §§ 21 and 22, 30 January 2001). Secondly, the major source of delay was not so much the courts ’ failure to schedule hearings at reasonable intervals, but the fact that they did not organise the examination of the case properly, dealt with it over a considerable number of hearings, and failed to gather evidence in a more efficient manner. It does not seem that that state of affairs could have been remedied through a “complaint about delays”."

The Judicial Service Commission has the power to impose disciplinary penalties (other than comment and reprimand, which are imposed by the hierarchical superior) on judges, prosecutors and investigating judges. The public bodies responsible for enforcing judicial decisions and the bodies responsible for entries in the land registry may be sanctioned by the Ministry of Justice ( [section] 311).",

By way of example, in 2009 seven judges and one head of administration were sanctioned, mainly for systematic failure to comply with the time-limits laid down by law. Among them, three judges were dismissed and three others had their salaries reduced by 10 to 25% for periods of up to a year.",

For example, a criminal policy strategy for the period 2010 ‑ 2014 has been adopted, the principal objective being to further reduce the excessive formalism of criminal procedure. It should be noted that the amendments to the 2010 CCrP were decided on the basis of this strategy (see above).",

Among the tangible results obtained on the basis of this plan, should be mentioned the working party set up to introduce an application for compensation in cases of excessive length of judicial proceedings (see below).

                "A remedy allowing to question the length of civil proceedings was introduced into Bulgarian law as long ago as 1999 (Article 217a of the former CCvP ). The provisions governing this remedy were maintained to a great extent in the new CCvP of 2007. Articles 255 to 257 thereof stipulate that, if a court fails to take a procedural step in time, the parties may at any time request the superior court to set a deadline for taking the procedural step in question. The request is lodged through the court seized of the case, which must send it to the superior court together with its own opinion. If the court seized of the case takes the requested steps immediately, the request is deemed to be withdrawn unless the party concerned states that it wishes to maintain the request. In cases where the request is transmitted to the superior court, it must be examined within one week by a judge of that court. If he finds that there has been unjustified delay, the superior court sets a deadline by which the procedural step must be taken. The order of the superior court is final.",
                "According to the data supplied by the authorities, the regional courts examined 242 applications for speeding up of civil proceedings in 2007. 110 applications were examined in 2008 and 142 in 2009. Also in 2009, the appeal courts examined 78 applications for the speeding up of proceedings.",
                "The European Court has accepted that the remedy provided for in Article 217a of the former CCvP is effective in principle (see Simizov against Bulgaria, No. 59523/00, § 56, 18 October 2007, Jeliazkov and others against Bulgaria, No. 9143/02, § 48, 3 April 2008, and Stefanova against Bulgaria, No. 58828/00, § 69, 11 January 2007). It has however stated that account must be taken of the circumstances of each case ( Stefanova, cited above, § 69) and of the effect which such application might have on the overall length of the proceedings in question ( Simizov, cited above, §§ 54-56). In several cases the Court has found that the application in question has not or could not have prevented certain delays by reason of their specific causes, such as for example inactivity on the part of the prosecution, inability of the domestic authorities to ensure that one party to the proceedings is properly summonsed, or errors in the application of the law ( Stefanova, cited above, §§ 70 and 71, Mincheva against Bulgaria, No. 21558/03, § 105, 2 September 2010, Maria Ivanova against Bulgaria, No. 10905/04, § 35, 18 March 2010).",

                "The authorities have indicated that these shortcomings will be taken into account when defining a new application for compensation in cases of excessive length of judicial proceedings (see below).",
                "The European Court has consistently pointed to the absence in Bulgarian law of a remedy enabling compensation to be obtained for excessive length of judicial proceedings (see, for example, the Mincheva against Bulgaria judgment cited above, § 107).",
                "In this connection the Government has indicated that, in the context of implementing a plan to eradicate the causes of the violations found by the European Court in judgments concerning Bulgaria, it has set up a working party to prepare a bill amending the law on the responsibility of the state and municipalities for prejudice caused to individuals. This bill envisages, in particular, the introduction of an application for compensation in cases of unjustified delay in the proceedings. This working party has drafted a bill providing that the state may be held responsible, in addition to the cases already settled, where unjustified delay in civil, criminal and administrative proceedings are attributable to the judicial authorities.",
                "As regards criminal proceedings, it should also be noted that certain forms of non ‑ pecuniary redress exist in cases of excessive length of proceedings, such as the possibility of reducing the penalties. This form of redress has been recognised by the European Court as an effective remedy in certain circumstances ( Bochev against Bulgaria judgment of 13 November 2008, § 83).”"

The remedy ’ s shortcomings had been exposed in a number of judgments of the Court. Its successor, the “request for fixing of time ‑ limit in the event of delay” under Articles 255 ‑ 57 of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure, was irrelevant because it had been introduced after the end of the proceedings at issue in the present case and because it reproduced the shortcomings of the “complaint about delays”. As evident from examples provided by the Government, the national courts routinely failed to deal with such complaints or requests within the statutory time ‑ limits. The failure of a lower court to comply with a time ‑ limit fixed by the higher court pursuant to such a request could not have any consequences. Moreover, in contrast to previous cases against Portugal and Austria, the statistics supplied by the Government did not show in how many cases the complaints or requests had been allowed, whether any instructions given as a result of them had been complied with, and whether that had in fact led to the acceleration of the proceedings in connection with which they had been made."

Applicants must have provided the domestic courts or authorities with the opportunity, in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States, of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them. That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available in the domestic system in respect of the alleged breach. The only remedies which Article 35 § 1 requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breach alleged and are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these conditions are satisfied (see McFarlane, cited above, § 107, with further references)."

                "83. The application of Article 13 of the Convention in this context began with the Court ’ s judgment in Kudła v. Poland ([GC], no. 30210/96, §§ 146 ‑ 60, ECHR 20 00 ‑ XI). A comprehensive restatement of the relevant principles, as established in Kudła and its progeny, may be found in the Court ’ s judgment in the case of Sürmeli v. Germany ( [GC], no. 75529/01, §§ 97 ‑ 101, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII, with further references) :",
                "(a) Under Article 1 of the Convention, which provides that “[t]he High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention”, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention is laid on the national authorities. The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. This subsidiary character is articulated in Article 13 and Article 35 § 1 of the Convention;",
                "(b) Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so. It is therefore necessary to determine in each case whether the means available to litigants in domestic law are “effective” in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred;",
                "(c) Remedies available to a litigant at domestic level for raising a complaint about the length of proceedings are “effective” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention if they prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred. A remedy is therefore effective if it can be used either to expedite a decision by the courts dealing with the case, or to provide the litigant with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (on that point, see also Mifsud v. France ( dec .) [GC], no. 57220/00, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII );",
                "(d) The best solution in absolute terms is indisputably, as in many spheres, prevention. Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable ‑ time requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Some States have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation (on that point, see also Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 186, ECHR 2006 ‑ V );",
                "(e) Where a domestic legal system has made provision for bringing a claim against the State, such a claim must remain an effective, sufficient and accessible remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings, and its sufficiency may be affected by excessive delays and depend on the level of compensation.",

In cases concerning chiefly delays occurring prior to July 1999 the Court did not find it necessary to determine whether the “complaint about delays” was an effective remedy on the basis that even if it was, it had been introduced too late to make up for the delay which had already accrued (see Djangozov v. Bulgaria, no. 45950/99, § 52, 8 July 2004; Dimitrov v. Bulgaria, no. 47829/99, § 78, 23 September 2004; Rachevi v. Bulgaria, no. 47877/99, §§ 66, 67 and 100, 23 September 2004; Todorov v.

However, in one of those cases the Court noted that the applicants had successfully used a “complaint about delays” to prompt a court to give its judgment faster, which indicated that the remedy could be effective in certain circumstances (see Jeliazkov and Others, cited above, §§ 17, 19, 27, 28 and 48)."

            [
                "87. The first case in which the Court addressed the effectiveness of the “complaint about delays” was Stefanova v. Bulgaria. After examining the wording of Article 217a of the 1952 Code, it found that the complaint could in principle be an effective remedy, but that regard had to be had to the particular circumstances (see Stefanova v. Bulgaria, no. 58828/00, §§ 68 and 69, 11 January 2007 ). On the facts of Stefanova it was found ineffective, because the delays there had occurred as a result of the prosecuting authorities ’ failure to provide relevant documents and the courts ’ failure duly to notify a party about the delivery of judgment – issues that could not be resolved through a “complaint about delays” (ibid., §§ 70 and 71). In later judgments the Court identified further situations in which that remedy was unlikely to accelerate proceedings. It could not speed up civil proceedings stayed to await the outcome of criminal ones (see Djangozov, § 53, and Todorov, § 61, both cited above). It could not reduce delays due to problems with the service of summons on the defendant (see Simizov, cited above, § 55), or delays due to unjustified remittals of cases to the lower courts (see Givezov, cited above, § 38; Tzvyatkov v. Bulgaria, no. 2380/03, § 31, 22 October 2009; Kabakchievi, cited above, § 42; Kotseva ‑ Dencheva, cited above, § 28 in fine; and Rosen Petkov, cited above, §§ 34 ‑ 36). It did not seem to apply to proceedings before the Supreme Court of Cassation (see Pavlova v. Bulgaria, no. 39855/03, § 31, 14 January 2010; Maria Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 10905/04, § 35, 18 March 2010; Kabakchievi, cited above, § 41; and Kotseva ‑ Dencheva, cited above, § 28 ). It could not provide effective redress in respect of delays due to the failure of the courts to organise the proper examination of the case, or in situations in which the proceedings had lasted too long without there being identifiable periods of inactivity (see Deyanov v. Bulgaria, no. 2930/04, §§ 69 ‑ 70, 30 September 2010). Lastly, it cannot reduce delays due to factors extraneous to the judicial system, such as the failure of the local authorities to provide to the parties documents needed as evidence in the case."

                "88. The Court is not persuaded that a “complaint about delays” would have been effective in the present case either, for two reasons. First, the proceedings had already lasted three years at the time when it was introduced (see Holzinger v. Austria (no. 2), no. 28898/95, §§ 21 and 22, 30 January 2001). Secondly, the major source of delay was not so much the courts ’ failure to schedule hearings at reasonable intervals, but the fact that they did not organise the examination of the case properly, dealt with it over a considerable number of hearings, and failed to gather evidence in a more efficient manner. It does not seem that that state of affairs could have been remedied through a “complaint about delays”."

During the first phase of the proceedings, which did not involve any complex issues, the Sofia District Court held no fewer than nine hearings. Four of those were adjourned for reasons attributable to the authorities : a failure of the local authorities to provide the parties with plans of the properties, delay in the drawing up of the report of a court ‑ appointed expert, and a failure duly to summon the applicant. As a result, the proceedings before that court lasted more than two and a half years (see paragraphs 9 ‑ 13 above). During the second phase the Sofia City Court held ten hearings. Three of those were adjourned for reasons attributable to the authorities – delays in the drawing up of the reports of court ‑ appointed experts. As a result, the proceedings before that court lasted about four years (see paragraphs 20 ‑ 28 above). It is true that at that stage the issues to be resolved were more complex. However, it does not seem that the delay could be explained by that factor alone. It was due chiefly to the courts ’ manner of proceeding. Much of it could have been avoided if the courts had, from the outset, tried to identify the controversial points and gather evidence in relation to them in a more efficient manner (see, mutatis mutandis, Kiurkchian v. Bulgaria, no. 44626/98, § 69, 24 March 2005, and Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 59913/00, § 94, 2 February 2006 ). Instead, they spread out the examination of the case over a large number of hearings and gathered evidence in a somewhat haphazard manner, acceding indiscriminately to all evidentiary requests of the parties and ordering additional expert reports without a reasonable need to do so. Moreover, some of the intervals between hearings were indeed excessive: more than seven months between those on 20 March and 6 November 2002, more than six months between those on 6 November 2002 and 29 May 2003, and more than eight months between those on 29 May 2003 and 12 February 2004 (see paragraphs 24 ‑ 27 above).

The bulk of the breaches found by the Court related to the period preceding the adoption of that Code, and were due to a number of legal, organisational and logistic problems causing delay in the examination of civil cases. Some of those had been addressed in the new Code. The principal novelties in the Code were improvements in the rules governing service of process; increased focus on first ‑ instance proceedings and written submissions; limitations on the ability of parties to adduce evidence at later stages of the proceedings; the introduction of judgments by default; the scrapping of the possibility of full rehearing of cases on appeal; the introduction of limitations on the possibilities of appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court of Cassation; the introduction of simplified procedures for dealing with some categories of straightforward cases; and improvements to the acceleratory remedy existing in the old Code.

Other factors were the comprehensive monitoring carried out by a special working party tasked with assessing the impact of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure, the monitoring carried out by the inspectorate of the Ministry of Justice and by the newly created inspectorate of the Supreme Judicial Council, the increased use of disciplinary sanctions against judges, and the improved continuing legal training provided to judges."

She pointed out that the Court had found breaches of the reasonable ‑ time requirement of Article 6 § 1 in a number of cases relating to proceedings which had taken place between 199 2 and 2009. Despite that, the Bulgarian State had not done enough to tackle the problem. Legislative reforms had been somewhat chaotic, as evidenced by the changes in policy in that domain from one government to the next. The statistics provided by the Government were incomplete, did not show whether undue delays had occurred, and could not serve as a basis to conclude that the problem had been resolved. The reform of the rules of civil procedure was not sufficient because it could not remedy past delays. Moreover, it was too early to say whether that reform would indeed have a positive effect on the length of civil proceedings. Nor could it be accepted that the inspectorates of the Ministry of Justice and of the Supreme Judicial Council would provide a solution to the problem. The Government had not pointed to specific examples of cases in which interventions by those bodies had led to an acceleration of the proceedings.

There was no possibility to claim compensation in respect of such matters under the 1988 Act. As for the existing acceleratory remedy, the “request for fixing of time ‑ limit in the event of delay ”, it was too similar to its predecessor to be considered effective. That was fully confirmed by the analysis of the eight examples provided by the Government. In addition, it was unclear what the consequences of the lower court ’ s failure to heed instructions given by the higher court in such a procedure would be. The higher court did not have the power to order the completion of the entire proceedings within a certain time. The statistics provided by the Government showed neither how many of the requests had been granted by the national courts nor whether the requests had actually led to an acceleration of the proceedings. In those circumstances, the remedy under Articles 255-57 of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure could not be regarded as effective, and there was a clear need for the Court to address the issue in a pilot judgment."

Forty ‑ three cases concerning such complaints have resulted in friendly settlements or have been struck out of the Court ’ s list on the basis of unilateral declarations by the Government (see Annex 2). According to the information in the Court ’ s case management database, there are at present approximately five hundred cases against Bulgaria awaiting first examination which contain a complaint concerning the length of civil proceedings. The above numbers show the existence of a systemic problem (see, among other authorities, Bottazzi v. Italy [GC], no. 34884/97, § 22, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; Lukenda v. Slovenia, no. 23032/02, §§ 90 ‑ 93, ECHR 2005 ‑ X; and Rumpf, cited above, §§ 64 ‑ 70 ). Indeed, as recently as 26 January 2011 the issue was noted “with grave concern” by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which urged Bulgaria to “pursue its efforts to solve the problem of excessive length of court proceedings” (see paragraph 59 above)."

First, in its recent Interim Resolution of 2 December 2010 the Committee of Ministers, having examined the information – including statistics – supplied by the Bulgarian authorities, noted that the legislative reforms introduced between 2006 and 2010 had not yet produced their full impact on the length of proceedings and that a longer period was needed before the effectiveness of the measures taken could be fully assessed (see paragraph 56 above). Since the statistics on which the Government relied before the Court to prove that the problem of the excessive length of proceedings in Bulgaria has been resolved are largely identical to those that they provided to the Committee of Ministers, the Court sees no reason to come to a conclusion that differs from that of the Committee. It also considers that it is too early to find that the measures taken by the Bulgarian State to prevent unreasonably lengthy proceedings, while certainly to be encouraged, have produced tangible results. Indeed, the statistics supplied by the Government contain no data about the average duration of civil proceedings in Bulgaria (see paragraphs 58 and 107 above)."

For those reasons, the Court, while welcoming the Bulgarian State ’ s continued efforts to improve the speed with which civil cases are dealt with and the Government ’ s willingness to conclude friendly settlements in respect of such complaints, finds that the problem of the excessive length of civil proceedings in Bulgaria cannot at this stage be regarded as having been fully resolved."
            ],
            [
                "120. It is not the Court ’ s function to express an opinion on the Bulgarian system of procedure before the civil or the administrative courts. The Contracting States enjoy considerable freedom in the choice of the means calculated to ensure that their judicial systems are in compliance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see König v. Germany, 28 June 1978, § 100, Series A no. 27, and, more recently, Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, §§ 83 and 84, 16 November 2010 ). Moreover, the unreasonable length of proceedings is a multifaceted problem which may be due to a large number of factors, of both legal and logistical character. Some of those – such as an insufficient number of judges or administrative staff, inadequate court premises, overly complex procedures, procedural loopholes allowing unjustified adjournments, or poor case management – may be internal to the judicial system, whereas others – such as the belated submission of expert reports and failures by the authorities to provide in a timely manner documents needed as evidence – may be extrinsic to that system. The Court will therefore abstain from indicating any specific measures to be taken by the respondent State to tackle the problem. The Committee of Ministers is better placed and equipped to monitor the measures that need to be adopted by Bulgaria in that respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov (no. 2), §§ 136 and 137, and Olaru and Others, § 57, both cited above, as well as Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov v. Ukraine, no. 40450/04, §§ 90 ‑ 92, ECHR 2009 ‑ ... (extracts) ). Indeed, as evident from its Interim Resolution of 2 December 2010 and the first Appendix to it, the Committee is already doing so and will continue, in cooperation with the national authorities (see paragraphs 56 and 57 above). By way of example, the Court would point to the recent adoption of statutory provisions proclaiming the right to a “ hearing within a reasonable time ” (see paragraph 37 above) and the obligation for the courts to “ examine and decide cases within a reasonable time ” (see paragraph 45 above)."

In its Interim Resolution the Committee of Ministers gave consideration to the point and found that there existed “certain structural problems in this field” (see paragraph 56 above). Indeed, less than full application of the guarantees of Article 13 in this context would undermine the operation of the subsidiary character of the Court in the Convention system and weaken the effective functioning, on the national and international level, of the scheme of human rights protection set up by the Convention (see McFarlane, cited above, § 112, with further references)."

However, according to the Court ’ s established case ‑ law, such mechanisms cannot be regarded as an effective remedy because they do not give the individuals concerned a personal right to compel the State to exercise its supervisory powers (see Gibas v.

On 1 March 2008 that remedy was superseded by a “request for fixing of time ‑ limit in the event of delay” under Articles 255 ‑ 57 of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraphs 43 ‑ 49 above)."

Austria (no. 1), no. 23459/94, §§ 16 and 20 ‑ 25, ECHR 2001 ‑ I ). However, in subsequent Austrian cases the Court found that the “ Holzinger ” remedy was not effective in respect of delays caused by the Supreme Court (see Meischberger v. Austria ( dec .), no. 51941/99, 15 September 2003, and Potzmader v. Austria ( dec .), no. 8416/05, 27 November 2008). It also found that its effectiveness was unclear where the overall duration of proceedings was unreasonable without there being specific delays attributable to a particular authority or officer (see Maier v. Austria ( dec .), no. 70579/01, 15 September 2003). The new Bulgarian remedy seems to suffer from the same shortcomings. According to the prevailing legal opinion, it is – like its predecessor – not applicable to delays in proceedings before the two supreme courts (see paragraph 55 above), and there are no reported examples of its being used in relation to such proceedings. It is moreover sufficiently similar to its predecessor to raise issues as to its capability of leading to the acceleration of proceedings in a number of other situations (see paragraph 87 above)."

Moreover, none of the examples contained information as to whether the use of the remedy had in fact sped up the proceedings. The same goes for the statistics provided by the Government (see paragraphs 52 and 106 above). While those statistics show that more and more people have resorted to that remedy ( in 2009 it was used on more than two hundred and twenty occasions ), there is no information showing in how many of those cases the higher courts have actually fixed time ‑ limits for the lower courts to take certain procedural steps, and in how many cases the remedy has led to the actual acceleration of the proceedings ( contrast Tomé Mota v. Portugal ( dec .), no. 32082/96, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX, and Bašić v. Austria, no. 29800/96, §§ 28, 29, 37, ECHR 2001 ‑ I )."

More importantly, even if it is accepted that the remedy operates effectively, it cannot, by itself and in the absence of a concurrent remedy providing compensation for undue delays in proceedings that have already been completed, solve the problem of unreasonably lengthy proceedings. Indeed, in Scordino (no. 1) ( cited above, § 186) the Court observed that “some States, such as Austria, Croatia, Spain, Poland and Slovakia, have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation”. It also stated that it is clear that for countries where length ‑ of ‑ proceedings problems already exist, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings – although desirable for the future – may not be adequate to redress a situation in which proceedings have clearly already been excessively long (ibid., § 185). It confirmed this position in three subsequent cases against Slovenia (see Žunič v. Slovenia ( dec .), no. 24342/04, 18 October 2007; Tomažič v. Slovenia, no. 38350/02, § 37 in fine, 13 December 2007; and Robert Lesjak v. Slovenia, no. 33946/03, § 36, 21 July 2009). In view of what has been said above, Bulgaria can be considered as a country in which length ‑ of ‑ proceedings problems already exist. The present case – where the proceedings had lasted three years by the time the “complaint for delays” became available and came to a close before the introduction of the “request for fixing of time ‑ limit in the event of delay” (see paragraphs 8, 34, 43 and 49 above) – is a good illustration of that. There is thus a clear need for the introduction of a remedy allowing redress to be made available for past delays. Indeed, the Committee of Ministers very recently invited the Bulgarian authorities “ to complete as soon as possible the reform undertaken in order to introduce a remedy whereby compensation may be granted for prejudice caused by excessive length of judicial proceedings ” (see paragraph 56 above), and the Bulgarian authorities are now working on a draft bill in that domain (see paragraphs 57 and 109 above). The Court would add that the introduction of effective domestic remedies in this domain would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that could otherwise, and in the Court ’ s opinion more appropriately, have been addressed in the first place within the national legal system (see Kudła, § 155, and Scordino (no. 1), § 188, both cited above )."

                "– the procedural rules governing the examination of such a claim must conform to the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention;",
                "– the rules governing costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their claim is justified;",
                "– a claim for compensation must be heard within a reasonable time. In that connection, consideration may be given to subjecting the examination of such claims to special rules that differ from those governing ordinary claims for damages, to avert the risk that, if examined under the general rules of civil procedure, the remedy may not be sufficiently swift (see Scordino (no. 1), cited above, § 200; Vidas v. Croatia, no. 40383/04, §§ 36 ‑ 37, 3 July 2008; and McFarlane, cited above, § 123);",

In relation to this criterion, it should be noted that the domestic authorities or courts are clearly in a better position than the Court to determine the existence and quantum of pecuniary damage. In relation to non ‑ pecuniary damage, there exists a strong but rebuttable presumption that excessively lengthy proceedings will cause such damage. Although in some cases the length of proceedings may result in only minimal non-pecuniary damage or no non ‑ pecuniary damage at all, the domestic authority or court dealing with the matter will have to justify its decision to award lower or no compensation by giving sufficient reasons, in line with the criteria set out in this Court ’ s case ‑ law.

In view of that and bearing in mind that the case, due to its pilot character, raised a range of issues which surpass the complexity of those usually raised by a normal length ‑ of ‑ proceedings case, the Court considers it reasonable to award the full amount claimed by the applicant in respect of lawyers ’ fees (EUR 3,205.32).

Law enforcement agencies and officials should take all reasonable steps to communicate with assembly organizers and/or participants regarding the policing operation and any safety or security measures.

As noted above in the context of assemblies, or other activities that take place on the border of public and private, either physically or conceptually, it is important to bear in mind that private security providers have a very different mandate and set of priorities to the police. As such, the police should be called in whenever uncertainties exist with regard to private and public interests, especially concerning the use of force in such contexts.",

The use of means of physical coercion was neither envisaged nor implied in the loggers ’ duties, so any fight or altercation with third parties could not entail their employer ’ s liability. Domestic law provided for criminal liability for abuse of authority or office or for exceeding official powers. To be held liable for those offences, a person ’ s actions needed to relate to his or her official position or result from action taken in connection with his or her official powers but in excess of their scope or result from an intention to abuse an official power. Where this was not the case, different provisions of the law penalising offences committed by private individuals were applicable.

This is further illustrated by the fact that the company and its staff had been engaged to guard the construction site by a private entity, the Main Contractor, under a private-law contract (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above).

The Court is mindful, however, of the well-established principle of the Convention system that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Radomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/12, § 149, ECHR 2018 ). There is no evidence that the applicants raised this argument before the domestic courts or that those courts examined this matter.

Nevertheless, the Court has to address the applicants ’ argument, as it is central to their case, and notes that the constitutional provision on which it is based appears to provide for a regulatory scheme under which the procedure of judicial restrictions of assemblies is linked with a procedure for their advance notification (see paragraph 93 above), which allows the authorities to apply to a court with a request to impose certain restrictions on the planned assembly. This follows from a decision of the Constitutional Court, which provides the authoritative interpretation of the relevant constitutional provision (see paragraph 94 above). It is well illustrated by the provision in the Code of Administrative Justice, which requires the court to reject an action for a judicial order restricting an assembly if it has been lodged belatedly, that is on the planned date of the event or thereafter (see paragraph 100 above). This latter provision was subject to the Court ’ s examination in Chumak, where the Court, for precisely that reason, expressed a doubt as to whether the judicial procedure in question could properly be used to disband an ongoing assembly (cited above, § 42)."

In any event, that repetition came only when the protesters were already restricted in their movement.

After all, the situation on 28 May 2010 has to be seen not in isolation but in the broader context of the events: by that date, it was public knowledge that a construction project was unfolding in the area where the applicants were present and the applicants, who by their own admission, participated in the protests from 20 May 2010, could not but have been aware that the police were likely to be deployed to stop them from interfering in the tree-felling and construction work (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above regarding the evidence concerning the events of 20 and 25 May, for example, and compare Pentikäinen v.

The authorities ’ failure to investigate the alleged presence on the scene of the protests of unidentified persons bearing security guard insignia without proper authorisation is one of the factors which has led the Court to find a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the present case (see paragraph 168 above). The Court considers that, in the particular circumstances of the present case those failings also have consequences for the respondent State ’ s compliance with its Article 11 obligations. The authorities ’ failure to take any demonstrable steps to investigate that alleged infiltration of the scene of protests by such unidentified and unauthorised persons form part of the respondent State ’ s failure to take reasonable steps to ensure the peaceful nature of the protests (see, mutatis mutandis, Identoba and Others v. Georgia, no. 73235/12, § 98, 12 May 2015, and § 76 the UN Special Rapporteur ’ s report at paragraph 115 above)."

It must accordingly determine whether the remedies available to the applicant under Polish law for raising a breach of his right to marry satisfied the requirements of that provision, in particular whether they were “effective” in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that had already occurred (see Kudła, cited above, § 158)."

It is also true that the applicant could, as he did, challenge the initial refusal before the penitentiary court ( see paragraph 23 above ). However, the procedure lasted for nearly five months and no ruling on his appeal had yet been given until the prison authorities eventually changed their original decision and the appeal had become purposeless (see paragraphs 13, 18 and 19 above). In consequence, it cannot be said that in the instant cases it offered the applicant the requisite relief, that is to say, a prompt decision on the substance of his Convention claim under Article 12.",

However, subsequently, in the case of Hamer v. the United Kingdom, (no. 7114/75, Commission ’ s report of 13 December 1979) where the Article 12 complaint was based on similar facts, the Commission altered its previous position and expressed an opinion that there was a breach of this provision, holding that “[t]he essence of the right to marry ... is the formation of a legally binding association between a man and a woman.

It was natural that, as the Court had held in many cases concerning the rights of prisoners, any measure depriving a person of liberty inevitably entailed limitations on the exercise of Convention rights, including a measure of control on prisoners ’ contacts with the outside world. In the context of the right to marry it could mean that the authorities, in exercising their power in this area, could monitor the wedding ceremony and limit, for instance, the number of participants. However, they should maintain a fair balance between the demands of security in prison and the prisoner ’ s right to marry. Their discretion should be limited to, and their decisions based on, concrete facts, not on prejudice. A refusal should be restricted to situations where the marriage ceremony would jeopardise the prison security – and not be merely difficult to organise. Moreover, rules regulating the authorities ’ discretion should be laid down in the national law. In particular, the law ought to list specific circumstances in which the authorities should not give leave to marry – for example, if it would affect the process of rehabilitation. In this context, it must be stressed that the issues involved were of a sensitive nature; thus, an unjustified refusal to grant leave to marry could be regarded as additional or disciplinary punishment."

Polish law did not require the civil status authorities to check whether an intended marriage was fictitious or “genuine” before its solemnisation. Since there was no difference in legal status between unmarried persons at liberty and unmarried persons in prison, imposing such a requirement on prisoners was tantamount to discrimination."

Switzerland, judgment of 18 December 1987, Series A no. 1 28, § 32; and Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 29, ECHR 2002-VI).",

The Convention institutions have accepted that limitations on the right to marry laid down in the national laws may comprise formal rules concerning such matters as publicity and the solemnisation of marriage. They may also include substantive provisions based on generally recognised considerations of public interest, in particular concerning capacity, consent, prohibited degrees of affinity or the prevention of bigamy. In the context of immigration laws and for justified reasons, the States may be entitled to prevent marriages of convenience, entered solely for the purpose of securing an immigration advantage. However, the relevant laws – which must also meet the standards of accessibility and clarity required by the Convention – may not otherwise deprive a person or a category of persons of full legal capacity of the right to marry with the partners of their choice (see Hamer v. the United Kingdom, no. 7114/75, Comm. Rep. 13 December 1979, D.R. 24, pp. 12 et seq., §§ 55 et seq.; Draper v. the United Kingdom, no. 8186/78, Comm. Rep., 10 July 1980, D.R. 24, § 49; Sanders v. France, no. 31401/96, Com.

In contrast to Article 8 of the Convention, which sets forth the right to respect for private and family life, and with which the right “to marry and to found a family” has a close affinity, Article 12 does not include any permissible grounds for an interference by the State that can be imposed under paragraph 2 of Article 8 “in accordance with the law” and as being “necessary in a democratic society”, for such purposes as, for instance, “the protection of health or morals” or “the protection of the rights and freedoms of others”. Accordingly, in examining a case under Article 12 the Court would not apply the tests of “necessity” or “pressing social need” which are used in the context of Article 8 but would have to determine whether, regard being had to the State ’ s margin of appreciation, the impugned interference has been arbitrary or disproportionate (see paragraph 4 8 above, with references to the Court ’ s case-law )."

Also, in deciding whether or not such permission is to be granted, the authorities have a margin of discretion and must have regard not only to the personal interest pursued by the prisoner – however important it may be – but equally to such factors as the maintenance of good order, safety and security in prison. Furthermore, the aims of imprisonment, which are not limited to punitive and deterrent aspects of the penalty but necessarily encompass the rehabilitative elements, are considerations that are relevant in this context (see paragraph 53 above and Dickson cited above, § 75)."

First of all, they considered that since the applicant and M.H. could not “substantiate” their acquaintance as being prior to their stay in the same prison, such a relationship had, in their words, been “illegal” or “developed illegally”. This conclusion was based on the fact that the applicant and M.H. had apparently become acquainted with each other when she had been temporarily detained in the same establishment and that they had maintained contact through sending kites – a form of correspondence forbidden in prison ( see paragraphs 12, 15 and 16 above). Second, the authorities held that the circumstances in which the couple ’ s bond had originated – “ in prison ” and “certainly illegally” – meant that it was “very superficial” and “ unworthy ” from the point of view of the applicant ’ s social rehabilitation (see paragraphs 15-16 above)."

Under Polish law this is for the civil status, not for any other, authorities to determine whether there are any legal obstacles to the parties ’ marriage, failing which they cannot be refused to marry each other at any given chosen time following the statutory waiting period of 1 month (see paragraphs 24-25)."

In the present case the only reason why the applicant was unable to exercise his right to marry was not his ineligibility caused by the existence of any statutory obstacle listed in the Polish Family and Custody Code but the fact that the authorities disputed his decision to marry M.H. and refused him permission to have the necessary civil status celebration held in prison.

This, having regard to the scope of the State ’ s discretion accorded under this provision ( see paragraphs 48-50 above ), cannot be justified by any conceivable legitimate aim pursued by the authorities."

In their submission, these circumstances were relevant for the applicant ’ s status as a victim and for the assessment of the merits of his complaint under Article 12 ( see paragraphs 30 and 41-42 above ).",
                "The Court does not accept this argument. The Government seem to suggest that the fact that the applicant obtained the leave he sought some 5 months after he had made his request to the authorities (see paragraphs 11 and 19 above) or that he retained the possibility of marrying M.H. at some unspecified future stage could alleviate the consequences of the initial ban placed on the exercise of his right to marry. However, a delay imposed before entering into a marriage in respect of persons of full age and otherwise fulfilling the conditions for marriage under the national law, be it a civil sanction or the practical consequence of such a refusal as in the instant case, cannot be considered justified under Article 12 of the Convention (see F. v. Switzerland cited above, § 33-37). Consequently, the Court rejects the Government ’ s plea of inadmissibility on the ground of incompatibility ratione personae ( see paragraphs 32-33 above )."

It submitted that, as shown by the facts supplied by the applicant, the authorities ’ discretion in granting or refusing a detained person the right to marry is unlimited. There are no rules stating in which circumstances a request for leave to marry in a detention facility can be refused and no time-limits are set for handling such requests (see paragraphs 45-47 above)."

It is also true that no specific provision of the national law deals with marriage in detention but, in the Court ’ s view, Article 12 does not require the State to introduce separate laws or specific rules on marriage of prisoners; thus, as stated above, detention is not a legal obstacle to marry (see paragraphs 51-53 above ).

The discretion available in theory may be very wide, but the decisive element is how it is applied in practice. In the applicant ’ s case the Convention breach was caused by the authorities ’ failure to strike a fair balance of proportionality among various public and individual interests at stake in a manner compatible with the Convention, rather than by the absence of detailed rules on marriage in prison. As a result, the measure applied impaired the very essence of the applicant ’ s right to marry.",

However, the procedure lasted for nearly five months and no ruling on his appeal had yet been given until the prison authorities eventually changed their original decision and the appeal had become purposeless (see paragraphs 13, 18 and 19 above).

The applicant, therefore, assuming that the overall amount of the pecuniary gain for which the seizure order had been made corresponded to the sum of the two amounts noted (approximately EUR 1,060,000), submitted a detailed estimate value of each item of the restrained property based on the information from a publicly available Internet portal on the market values of real properties in Croatia.

Specifically, the investigation case file had only contained information concerning the difference between the purchase and accounting value of the property with regard to the purchase contracts of 1997, namely fifteen years before the request for seizure of the property had been made. It had therefore not been possible to assess the value of the real property on the basis of such estimates. In any case, however, any such possible estimate concerned only a limited number of items of the real property, whereas the remainder of the property in respect of which the seizure order had been made had remained without any relevant estimate of its value."

On the other hand, the applicant argued that his assessment of the value of the seized real property, which he had provided during the criminal proceedings, had been based on publicly available information from a specialised Internet site and as such corresponded to its present market value. The applicant therefore considered that, without any such assessment being made by the competent authorities, their decision on the seizure of his property had been disproportionate and contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. This had therefore endangered his business activities as the restrained real property had been the only valuable property which he owned that allowed him to pursue his business activities. In particular, the applicant explained that his business activities were associated with agriculture and that it was therefore of paramount importance for him to be able to dispose freely of the real property (in particular the plots of land) so as to be able, for instance, to take loans by providing mortgages on that property."

Moreover, his possibility of using the legal remedies had been limited as there was no possibility of lodging an appeal on points of law against a seizure order, and the Constitutional Court was declaring constitutional complaints to that effect inadmissible. There was also a presumption of the existence of a fear that the possible confiscation would not be possible or would be difficult, which effectively he could not have rebutted. Furthermore, the applicant pointed out that the parties ’ requests related to the seizure of property had not been examined at a public hearing and he considered that the existence of an appeal against the decisions on seizure of property had not been a sufficient procedural guarantee. Lastly, the applicant stressed that although the possibility of obtaining damages related to the improper seizure of property existed in law, it followed from the case-law of the domestic courts that it had not been effective in practice."

In the Government ’ s view, the only possibility for securing the enforcement of a confiscation order against the applicant had been to order seizure of his real property.

In particular, it had been for the first time assessed by the Vukovar County State Attorney ’ s Office based on its findings related to the applicant ’ s property. Thereafter, it had been assessed several times by the Vukovar County Court and the Supreme Court, which had found, on the basis of the relevant material available in the case file, that the impugned measure had been necessary and proportionate in the circumstances. Accordingly, given that only the relevant part of the seized property would be later confiscated if such an order became final and that the only restriction on the applicant ’ s use of that property had been his inability to use it for obtaining a loan or to sell it, the Government considered that the applicant had not been required to bear an excessive disproportionate burden."

Any legislative exercise would benefit from the Constitutional Court ’ s case-law ( see paragraphs 97 and 101 ), the Supreme Court ’ s experience that resulted in its draft law of 2008 ( Burdov (no. 2), cited above, §§ 34-37 ), the Committee of Ministers ’ texts adopted under Article 46 of the Convention (see paragraph 113 above) and its more general Recommendations CM/ Rec (2004) 6 and CM/ Rec (2010) 3 on effective domestic remedies. It would be, for instance, quite appropriate for the authorities to seek, by any means, to combine a compensatory remedy with an acceleratory one (see Nagovitsyn and Nalgiev, cited above, § 35), at least for certain cases involving persistent enforcement delays or requiring special diligence in the enforcement process (see, in particular, paragraphs 152 and 170 above)."

In the Court ’ s view, that time-limit is also consistent with the experience of the first pilot judgment, the nature of the measures to be adopted by the respondent State and the domestic legislative initiatives already taken to that effect ( see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 141 and point 6 of the operative part; compare Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 233 ).",

The second was brought by an individual, Mr Golovin, whose complaint on account of the delayed enforcement of a judgment against a private person had earlier been dismissed by the Saratov Regional Court and the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Court found both applications inadmissible by decisions delivered on 18 January ( no. 45 ‑ O-O) and 8 February 2011 ( no. 115-O-O), respectively. In the Constitutional Court ’ s view, it was not acceptable that the public authorities could abuse their special position resulting from the impossibility of seizure of their budgetary funds through enforcement proceedings; the proper enforcement of such judgments should therefore be ensured through other means, such as the establishment of appropriate procedures for liability and effective remedies in accordance with Article 13 of the Convention. That the Compensation Act only addressed the delayed enforcement of judgments of a particular type did not mean that the legislator excluded the right to claim damages for other instances of delayed enforcement resulting from the fault of another. Referring to the above - mentioned Ruling by the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court found that the general provisions of the Civil Code allowed compensation for delayed enforcement of judgments in cases falling outside the Compensation Act. As a result, the Constitutional Court did not find that section 1 ( 1 ) of the Compensation Act violated the constitutional rights of the persons concerned.

Such questions of a general character would arise, for example, where there is a need to clarify the States ’ obligations under the Convention or to induce the respondent State to resolve a structural deficiency affecting other persons in the same position as the applicant. The Court has thus been frequently led, under Articles 37 and 39, to verify that the general problem raised by the case had been or was being remedied and that similar legal issues had been resolved by the Court in other cases (see Korolev v. Russia (dec.), no. 25551/05, ECHR 2010, with further references )."

This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, thus fundamentally undermining respect for human rights as defined in the Convention. The Court accordingly communicated the present applications with an emphasis on Article 13 (see paragraphs 6 above and 141 below ), which gives direct expression to the States ’ obligation, enshrined in Article 1 of the Convention, to protect human rights first and foremost within their own legal systems (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI, and Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 96 ).

The Court further notes the Government ’ s failure to address this crucial point in their latest “action plan” submitted on 13 May 2014 to the Committee of Ministers under Article 46 of the Convention (see paragraph 114 above). The acceptance of the Government ’ s request to strike the present “pilot” applications out of the Court ’ s list would leave the current situation unchanged without any guarantee that a genuine solution would be found in the near future.

Thus, the applicant Ms Kostyleva obtained two judgments by the domestic court acknowledging unlawful inaction on the part of the respondent administration and awarding substantial compensation in that regard (see paragraphs 82 and 84. above). The Government also provided three similar decisions by the courts of general jurisdiction awarding compensation for non-enforcement of judgments against the State authorities concerning the provision of housing: the judgment of 6 June 2008 by the Nevskiy District Court of Saint-Petersburg awarding RUB 30,000 to each applicant for an enforcement delay of eight years, the judgment of 19 April 2012 by the Syktyvkar Town Court awarding RUB 35,000 for an enforcement delay of four years, and the judgment of 1 September 2010 by the Iglinskiy District Court of the Republic of Bashkortostan awarding RUB 50,000 to each applicant for an enforcement delay of five years.

However, the respondent local authorities had continued to ignore their obligation arising from the courts ’ judgments. As regards the domestic remedies referred to by the Government, the applicant argued that they were ineffective for two reasons. First, the domestic judicial awards referred to by the Government, including that made in the applicant ’ s case, were far too low in comparison with those made by the Court in similar situations.

Nor did any such difference appear in the Supreme Court ’ s draft constitutional law of 26 September 2008, which sought to establish a compensation mechanism in the event of non-enforcement of any judgment by respondent State authorities. Against that background, the Government opted at a later stage for radically restricting the scope of the draft Compensation Act to judgments awarding monetary payments against the State (see paragraph 94 above).

As the Court has repeatedly held in its judgments, while the possibility of such compensation was not totally excluded – and was indeed granted in certain rare cases – this remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, being notably conditional on the establishment of the authorities ’ fault (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 110). The Court reiterates its view that such fault is particularly difficult to establish as the respondent authority may delay execution of a domestic judgment due to various obstacles which do not, as a rule, entail the authorities ’ civil responsibility under the Russian law (ibid., § 111). The establishment of fault as a precondition for the State ’ s responsibility for delayed enforcement of judgments by respondent State authorities is still difficult to reconcile with the very strong presumption that such delays will occasion non-pecuniary damage (ibid., §§ 100 and 111, and compare Section 1(3) of the Compensation Act )."

The application of the above -mentioned criteria of reasonableness to the enforcement of judgments ordering that specific action be taken by the State may trigger a different presumption. The enforcement of certain judgments of that type must, in the Court ’ s view, be completed within a stricter time-limit. For example, the judgment in Ms Troshina ’ s favour required a straightforward act to be taken by the administration, that is, to respond to the applicant ’ s request for certain data from the land register. As regards the applications of Mr Gerasimov, Ms Baranova and Mr Starostenkov, the domestic judgments in their favour were more burdensome for the respondent authorities but nonetheless required special diligence given what was at stake for the applicants ( respectively, the obligation to ensure basic utility services and renovation, the provision of heating supply in time for the cold season and a car for rehabilitation of a person affected by a lifelong disability ). The Court considers that a delay in the enforcement of any of these four judgments exceeding six months should in principle be considered as unreasonably long and, therefore, inconsistent with the Convention requirements."

The Court has already acknowledged that enforcing a judgment requiring allocation of housing may take longer than the payment of a monetary sum (see Kravchenko and Others, no. 11609/05, § 35, 21 February 2011). In the great majority of such housing cases decided in the past, violations of the Convention were found on account of enforcement delays exceeding two years (see more than one hundred applications decided by groups in Kravchenko and Others; Zolotareva and Others; Ilyushkin and Others; and Kalinkin and Others, all cited above). The Court will thus presume, with due regard to the complexity of housing allocation procedures, that a delay of below two years in the enforcement of such a judgment would not be incompatible with the “ reasonable time ” requirement unless it disclosed an exceptional situation requiring special diligence. For example, enforcement delays of one year or longer were considered by the Court to violate the Convention when a judgment ordered the applicants ’ rehousing from derelict buildings (see Bulycheva v. Russia, no. 24086/04, § 33, 8 April 2010, and Nevolin v. Russia, no. 38103/05, §§ 15-19, 12 July 2007) or to provide housing to homeless victims of terrorism ( Sitnitskiye v.

Domestic courts are better placed to ascertain the proper method of enforcement and to decide the issue of whether and when full and appropriate compliance with a judgment has been secured.

Another important aim is to induce the respondent State to resolve large numbers of individual cases arising from the same structural problem, thus implementing the principle of subsidiarity which underpins the Convention system. The Court may thus decide to adjourn adjudication of such cases, awaiting their resolution at the domestic level in accordance with the pilot judgment.

                "216. The above -mentioned problems are largely aggravated by the continuous lack of effective domestic remedies in respect of such obvious and recurrent violations of the Convention (see paragraphs 157 - 166 above). The Court has at times highlighted the incompatibility of this situation with the Convention requirements (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, §§ 101 ‑ 17 and 133 ) and regretted that the Government had missed the opportunity to resolve that problem in the wake of the first pilot judgment or even later (see Kalinkin and Others, cited above, § 30, and Ilyushkin and Others, § 36, both cited above). As a result, people affected by the most basic and undisputable violations of the Convention, like those acknowledged by the Government in the present case, still continue to seek redress before the Court in the first instance. As the Court has repeatedly noted, this situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which commands that the High Contracting Parties bear primary responsibility for securing the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention. It observes, moreover, that a number of applicants further complain that the domestic judgments in their favour remain unenforced at the domestic level notwithstanding the Court ’ s judgments obligating the State to secure their enforcement by appropriate means (see paragraph 114 above). Such complaints raise serious doubts about the authorities ’ compliance with their obligations even in cases subject to the Committee of Ministers ’ supervision."

While noting a perceptible trend towards an improvement in this sensitive area and the increasing attention paid to the problems by the respondent State at the highest level ( see paragraphs 106 - 108 above ), the Court is bound to conclude that the recurrent violations of the Convention, such as those found in the present case, reveal persistent structural dysfunctions which amount, by their nature and scale, to a practice incompatible with the Convention (see Bottazzi v. Italy [GC], no. 34884/97, § 22, ECHR 1999 V, and Burdov ( no. 2 ), cited above, § 135)."

The Court also finds that the nature of the underlying problems, a large number of people affected by them in Russia and the urgent need to grant them speedy and appropriate redress at the domestic level justify the application of the pilot-judgment procedure in the present case (see Burdov no. 2, § 130, and Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 190 ). The mere repetition of the Court ’ s findings in similar individual cases would not be the best way to achieve the Convention ’ s purpose. The pilot judgment procedure now appears to be the most timely and effective way to assist the respondent State in finding the appropriate solutions and the Committee of Ministers in supervising the execution of the judgments (see Resolution Res(2004)3 of the Committee of Ministers on judgments revealing an underlying systemic problem, and the Declarations adopted by the High Contracting Parties at the Interlaken, Izmir and Brighton conferences)."

                "219. As it was already noted by the Court and acknowledged by the Russian authorities themselves (see paragraphs 105 - 112 above), the problems at the root of the violations of Article 6 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 found in this case are large-scale and complex in nature. Systematic delays in the enforcement of judgments by the State do not stem from a specific legal or regulatory provision or a particular lacuna in Russian law (see paragraphs 213 - 215 above). The resolution of those problems is contingent on the implementation of complex strategies by various authorities at both federal and local level."

The Committee of Ministers has already given consideration to this matter and continues to examine it in the cases concerned (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2009)43, paragraphs 113 - 114 above). While the effects of the most recent encouraging developments reported by the authorities with regard to the housing allocated to servicemen still remain to be assessed (see paragraph 106 above ), the ultimate solution to the structural problems identified by the Court in paragraphs 213 - 215 above will no doubt require further general measures. Particular attention would have to be paid to the bailiffs ’ and other authorities ’ present incapacity to secure enforcement in such cases and the need to find appropriate mechanisms to that effect. However, given the complex legal, practical and policy considerations involved, the assessment of the specific measures required goes beyond the Court ’ s judicial function. It is not the Court ’ s task to advise the respondent Government in such a complex legal, political and budgetary process, let alone recommend a particular way of organising the domestic enforcement procedure in respect of judgments against the State. The Court will thus abstain in these circumstances from indicating any specific measure to be taken. The Committee of Ministers is better placed and equipped to monitor the general measures to ensure that all domestic judgments against the State authorities and entities be enforced within a reasonable time (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § § 136-37, and Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 194)."

Against this background, the Court ’ s findings in respect of domestic remedies (see paragraph 216 above) reveal essentially a legal problem that lends itself to be resolved through an amendment of domestic legislation, as demonstrated by the positive experience of the Burdov pilot judgment. Indeed, the Compensation Act was successfully introduced in 2010 within a limited time to provide an effective remedy against delayed enforcement of domestic judgments ordering monetary payments from the State budgets."

The Court further notes that the draft constitutional law tabled by the Supreme Court on 26 September 2008 attempted to make a new effective remedy applicable to cases involving the State ’ s obligations in kind ( see paragraphs 159 - 161 above ). The Court has no official information about the reasons that eventually led the Russian legislator to restrict the scope of the Compensation Act ( see paragraph 94 above ). Be that as it may, the Court does not find it appropriate to examine any such reason at the present stage, its task being solely to ascertain the prospective legal implications of the present pilot judgment so as to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Russian Federation under the Convention."

There are several avenues by which this goal can be achieved in Russian law and the Court would not impose any specific option, having regard to the respondent State ’ s discretion to choose the means it will use to comply with the judgment ( see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII ). The Russian authorities may obviously choose the most straightforward solution, extending the scope of the Compensation Act to all cases concerning non ‑ enforcement of judgments delivered against the State and the Court welcomes the recent legislative initiatives to that end (see paragraphs 107 ‑ 108 above). The authorities may nonetheless choose to introduce changes to other legal texts that would produce the same effect. Any legislative exercise would benefit from the Constitutional Court ’ s case-law ( see paragraphs 97 and 101 ), the Supreme Court ’ s experience that resulted in its draft law of 2008 ( Burdov (no. 2), cited above, §§ 34-37 ), the Committee of Ministers ’ texts adopted under Article 46 of the Convention (see paragraph 113 above) and its more general Recommendations CM/ Rec (2004) 6 and CM/ Rec (2010) 3 on effective domestic remedies. It would be, for instance, quite appropriate for the authorities to seek, by any means, to combine a compensatory remedy with an acceleratory one (see Nagovitsyn and Nalgiev, cited above, § 35), at least for certain cases involving persistent enforcement delays or requiring special diligence in the enforcement process (see, in particular, paragraphs 152 and 170 above)."

In the Court ’ s view, that time-limit is also consistent with the experience of the first pilot judgment, the nature of the measures to be adopted by the respondent State and the domestic legislative initiatives already taken to that effect ( see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 141 and point 6 of the operative part; compare Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 233 ).",

It may thus decide in the pilot judgment that its proceedings in all cases stemming from such a problem be adjourned pending the implementation of the relevant measures by the respondent State. If, however, the respondent State fails to adopt such measures following the pilot judgment and continues to violate the Convention, the Court will have no choice but to resume examination of all similar applications pending before it and to take them to judgment so as to ensure effective observance of the Convention ( ibid., § 128 )."
