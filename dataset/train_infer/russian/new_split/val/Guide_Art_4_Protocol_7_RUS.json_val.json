In the case under consideration two measures were imposed on the applicant in two separate and consecutive sets of proceedings.

                "42. The Court reiterates that the legal characterisation of the procedure under national law cannot be the sole criterion of relevance for the applicability of the principle of non bis in idem under Article 4 § 1 of Protocol No. 7. Otherwise, the application of this provision would be left to the discretion of the Contracting States to a degree that might lead to results incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention (see, most recently, Storbråten v. Norway (dec.), no. 12277/04, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... (extracts), with further references). The notion of “penal procedure” in the text of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 must be interpreted in the light of the general principles concerning the corresponding words “criminal charge” and “penalty” in Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention respectively (see Haarvig v. Norway (dec.), no. 11187/05, 11 December 2007; Rosenquist v. Sweden (dec.), no. 60619/00, 14 September 2004; Manasson v. Sweden (dec.), no. 41265/98, 8 April 2003; Göktan v.

                "43. The Court’s established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the “ Engel criteria” (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22), to be considered in determining whether or not there was a “criminal charge”. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. It is enough that the offence in question is by its nature to be regarded as criminal or that the offence renders the person liable to a penalty which by its nature and degree of severity belongs in the general criminal sphere (see Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § 86, ECHR 2003 ‑ X). The relative lack of seriousness of the penalty cannot divest an offence of its inherently criminal character (see Öztürk v. Germany, judgment of 21 February 1984, Series A no. 73, § 54, and Lutz v. Germany, judgment of 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123, § 55). This does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, as recent authorities, Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, §§ 30-31, ECHR 2006 ‑ ..., and Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 82-86)."

                "44. As noted above, first, the applicant was fined in summary penal order proceedings because he had used more leniently taxed fuel than diesel oil in the tank of his vehicle, which constituted petty tax fraud. The proceedings were “criminal” according to the Finnish legal classification. Those proceedings were “criminal” also for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 and consequently the applicant was “finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of [the] State”. The guarantee of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 comes into play where a new set of proceedings is instituted after the previous acquittal or conviction has acquired the force of res judicata. In this case, the applicant did not appeal against the summary penal order, which therefore became res judicata."

            [
                "45. Subsequently, the applicant was issued with a fuel fee debit in administrative proceedings. Turning to the first of the Engel criteria, it is apparent that the fuel fee debit was not classified as criminal but as part of the fiscal regime (see paragraph 12 above). This is however not decisive. In this connection, the Court has previously found that the sphere defined in the Finnish legal system as “administrative” embraces certain offences that have a criminal connotation but are too trivial to be governed by criminal law and procedure (see Jussila v. Finland [GC], cited above, § 38)."
            ],
            [
                "46. The second criterion, the nature of the offence, is the more important. The Court observes that the relevant provision of the Fuel Fee Act was directed towards all citizens rather than towards a group possessing a special status. The applicant was liable in his capacity as owner or user of a diesel engine vehicle. As to the Government’s argument that the fuel fee debit was intended as pecuniary compensation for damage, the Court is however not so convinced in the circumstances of the present case. It may well be that the fuel fee imposed corresponded to the damage caused, namely loss of revenue. It is however to be noted that the fuel fee collected was trebled. This must in the Court’s view be seen as a punishment to deter re-offending, recognised as a characteristic feature of criminal penalties (see Ezeh, §§ 102 and 105). It may therefore be concluded that the fuel fee debit was imposed by a rule whose purpose was not only compensatory but also deterrent and punitive. The Court considers that this establishes the criminal nature of the offence."

Formally, the use of more leniently taxed fuel was not forbidden, but it was subject to fairly severe financial sanctions. The basic structure of the Fuel Fee Act and the Motor Vehicle Tax Act was identical to, for example, the Penal Code, which does not specifically forbid certain unwanted acts but only provides for the consequences of such acts. The only difference was that the sanction applicable to the use of fuels was an administrative sanction collected as a tax. The basic aim of the provisions on additional tax and fuel fee is well established in Finland. The provisions are well-known among motorists and the consequence is that, compared with other countries, more leniently taxed fuel is hardly ever used in road traffic in Finland.

The principal purpose of the fuel fee was to ensure that more leniently taxed fuel than diesel oil was not used in diesel vehicles. The fuel fee alone had no fiscal purpose. He could have used a more leniently taxed fuel by notifying the authorities of such use and by paying a daily fee amounting to some EUR 252. However, it had not been possible to drive the pickup van during a single day such a distance as to make the use of such fuel financially viable. The result of the failure to give prior notice had been that the applicant had been considered to have used more leniently taxed fuel for a period of twenty days although his statement that the use involved one fill-up of the fuel tank had not been proved wrong. The consequences were out of all proportion and unreasonable taking into consideration even the absolute benefit sought through the offence, that is, the difference in price between fuel taxed as diesel oil and more leniently taxed fuel, the reprehensibility and unique nature of the act, the financial position and actions of the offender and other circumstances. The applicant’s application for exemption from payment of the fuel fee or a decrease thereof had been unsuccessful. Although the increased fuel fee was characterised as an administrative sanction, it should be equated with a criminal sanction."

                "28. The applicant considered that the prohibition on the use of more leniently taxed fuel had technically been in existence even prior to the entry into force in 2004 of the new Fuel Fee Act. The legislation provided for a high fuel fee so as to render the actual use of such fuel impossible. In practice, few notifications were made of the use of more leniently taxed fuel oil in cars and vans. A prohibition on the use of light fuel oil had not even been proposed in the Government Bill for the enactment of the new Fuel Fee Act. It was only added to the Bill during consideration in the Finance Committee (report no. 37/2003 vp). This demonstrated that the State had long held that the notification procedure including sanctions was sufficient to prevent the use of more leniently taxed fuel in diesel vehicles. The applicant took the view that the essential elements of the punishable offence were identical in the provision on petty tax fraud and in the Fuel Fee Act. Likewise, the administrative fuel fee and the penal sanction resulting from petty tax fraud were imposed for one and the same act. Under the wording of sections 3-4 and 6 of the Fuel Fee Act, the fuel fee was imposed for failure to observe the notification obligation. According to the essential elements of tax evasion in the Penal Code, a person who for the purpose of avoiding tax fails to observe a duty pertaining to taxation or influencing the assessment of tax shall be sentenced for tax fraud. The use of the more leniently taxed fuel would have been permissible subject to payment of a daily fee. The increased fuel fee was imposed for failure to submit a prior notification. It was for precisely the same reason, that is failure to observe the notification obligation, that the fine had been imposed. The fuel fee had thus not been imposed because the use of more leniently taxed fuel was prohibited as such. The fact of the fuel fee being imposed irrespective of intent or negligence only served to underscore the citizens’ need for judicial relief and it did not change the essentially criminal nature of the fuel fee. The Fuel Fee Act and the Penal Code had the same structure, a stand which was also taken in the Government Bill for the enactment of the new Fuel Fee Act."

In practice, the owner or holder of a vehicle cannot be unaware of the type of fuel used in that vehicle. In theory, the fuel tank of a vehicle could be filled with more leniently taxed fuel during unauthorised use. Any occurrence of such a scenario would again only underscore the need of citizens for judicial relief. In the case of Västberga Taxi Aktiebolag and Vulic v. Sweden, no. 36985/97, 23 July 2002) the Court held that the question of whether a tax or tax surcharge could be converted into a prison sentence was not decisive for the classification of an offence as “criminal”. The characterisation in Finland of the current fuel fee as an administrative sanction and the fact that appeals against it were examined by an administrative court had no relevance to the case."

(nos. 36855/97 and 41731/98, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI), which involved failure to file tax returns, whereas the present case involved failure to file prior notification. In the former case the tax consequence was based on accounts, that is, the amount of tax actually evaded. In the present case, the amount of tax actually evaded had not been established but it seemed indisputable that the fuel fee significantly exceeded the amount of tax actually evaded. In the case of Ponsetti and Chesnel, interest on arrears and tax surcharge amounted to 40-80%. In the present case, the tax was increased by 300%. The former case involved chronic and repeated failure whereas the present case involved a single instance of failure of short duration. In the former case, the essential elements of tax fraud differed from those of failure to file tax returns in a timely fashion, whereas in the present case the essential elements of tax fraud and failure to notify were the same. Moreover, the acts in the present case were congruous."

                "31. The Government submitted that the aim of the Fuel Fee Act in force at the relevant time was to ensure that the State would in all circumstances, in respect of diesel vehicles, obtain at least the same amount of tax that accrued from the use of diesel oil instead of the generally available and more leniently taxed light fuel oil. The primary purpose of the legislation was to ensure the use of diesel oil in diesel vehicles. At that time, the legislation did not contain any formal prohibition on the use of more leniently taxed fuel and therefore it was necessary to make the use of such fuel financially less advantageous than the use of diesel oil. This was ensured by providing for a high flat-rate tax (the fuel fee). Although the use of a more leniently taxed fuel was not prohibited, anyone who used such fuel was obliged to give prior notification. The fee was imposed irrespective of whether the person in question defaulted on the notification obligation intentionally or through carelessness since this guaranteed the State’s tax income irrespective of how the conduct of the tax payer was assessed. The amount of the fuel fee depended solely on the vehicle type. Failure to comply with the notification obligation resulted in the fuel fee being collected threefold. Furthermore, a fuel fee could only be reduced in individual cases for particular reasons. Although the increased fuel fee had the nature of an administrative sanction, its main objective was to collect tax revenue and to safeguard the operation of the fuel taxation system. According to the new Fuel Fee Act, the fuel fee was, unlike before, a sanction for a violation of a prohibition laid down in the Act. However, the purpose of the fee remained unchanged, that is, to ensure the proper accrual of tax revenue."

                "32. The Government submitted that petty tax fraud was an offence under the Penal Code punishable in criminal proceedings by a fine (the amount of the day-fine being dependent on the income and assets of the person concerned). Failure to pay a fine resulted in its being converted to a prison sentence. The increased fuel fee was not a penal sanction but an administrative one, imposed in an administrative procedure and could not, therefore, be equated to a determination of a criminal charge against the applicant. This was also reflected in the new Fuel Fee Act, which contained an express prohibition on the of use light fuel oil. This change to the legislation resulted from the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 27 November 2003 concerning Finland (Case C-185/00: Commission of the European Communities v. Republic of Finland ) in which the European Court of Justice deemed that Community legislation obliged Finland to amend its legislation so as to ensure, more efficiently than before, that fuels were used in compliance with fuel directives (see Council Directive 92/81/EEC on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on mineral oils and Council Directive 92/82/EEC on the approximation of the rates of excise duties on mineral oils, both replaced by Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity ). As to the applicant’s view that the prohibition on the use of more leniently taxed fuel had technically been in existence also before the amendment, the Government submitted that it was indeed true that the rate of the fuel fee was so high that its payment was disadvantageous even if the person concerned only had to pay the basic amount. However, in the above-mentioned judgment it had been found that Finland had failed to fulfil its obligations under Community law. Thus, the prohibition on the use of more leniently taxed fuel and the fact that the sanction for using the wrong fuel was severe, have been found to constitute different legal issues. As to the applicant’s submission that the State had long held that the notification procedure inclusive of sanctions was sufficient to prevent the use of more leniently taxed fuel in diesel vehicles, the Government submitted that this was true, and that this fact had also been relied on before the European Court of Justice. However, it did not render the fuel fee a criminal law sanction nor a sanction of a comparable nature, as its aim was specifically to ensure the accrual of tax revenue, primarily by ensuring the use of taxable diesel oil in vehicles and secondarily by corresponding at least to the tax difference between the different fuels."

            [
                "33. The Government argued that although the increased fuel fee could be considered quite substantial, the essential elements of the acts leading to its imposition on the one hand and to punishment for petty tax fraud on the other differed significantly from each other and did not constitute one and the same act on the following grounds. Firstly, the administrative fuel fee was imposed for using a fuel that was taxed more leniently than diesel oil whereas the criminal sanction for petty tax fraud was imposed for illegal evasion of the fuel fee, the punishable act being failure to comply with the notification obligation laid down in the Fuel Fee Act. Thus, the administrative fuel fee and the criminal sanction for petty tax fraud were imposed for different acts. Secondly, the sanction provided for in the Penal Code always necessitated intent or at least negligence, and petty tax fraud was always intentional and thus essentially involved a subjective element. By contrast, the fuel fee was imposed, irrespective of the degree of intent, on the basis of the mere objective fact that the fuel system of a vehicle contained the wrong fuel. Thirdly, the purpose of the criminal sanction for tax fraud was to constitute a punishment and to express moral reproach for a certain act. The fuel fee did not have a similar purpose of punishment or reproach. It was only intended to ensure the accrual of tax revenue, primarily by ensuring the use of taxable diesel oil in vehicles and secondarily by corresponding at least to the tax difference between the different fuels. Moreover, the higher fuel fee was not intended to be a punishment, but only to ensure that vehicle users gave prior notification if they wanted to use a more leniently taxed fuel. Fourthly, the fuel fee system in force at the relevant time also differed from a punishment in that it made it legally possible for vehicle owners to choose to use a tax-free fuel, to notify the authorities of this and to pay the fuel fee, an option which was not open in respect of acts regulated by criminal law. Fifthly, only a perpetrator or an accomplice comparable with the perpetrator could be sentenced to a sanction under criminal law. Emphasis should be put on the fact that owners or holders of a vehicle had to pay the fuel fee irrespective of whether they used the fuel concerned. Sixthly, an unpaid fine could be converted to imprisonment whereas an unpaid fuel fee could not. Seventhly, criminal cases were examined by general courts whereas cases concerning fuel fees were examined in an administrative procedure, like tax cases, and finally through an appeal to an administrative court."

The Government argued that the present case was similar to the case of Ponsetti and Chesnel (cited above) in that the constitutive elements of tax fraud and those of failure to file tax returns within the prescribed period (“the fiscal offence”) were different. The cases were also similar in that tax fraud included the element of “wilfulness” whereas the “fiscal offence” was possible on solely objective grounds. On the other hand, when compared to the aforementioned case, it could be noted that in respect of the fuel fee in the present case, the acts underlying the sanctions were even more clearly composed of different elements than the acts giving rise to a tax penalty, as the fuel fee could, on the conditions mentioned in the foregoing, be imposed even if there had been no intention of tax evasion."

This common feature was also referred to in the Government Bill (112/2003) for the enactment of the new Fuel Fee Act. However, the purpose of the reference was only to indicate that the fuel fee must be considered an effective means of ensuring the collection of fuel tax or of a corresponding amount of taxes, irrespective of whether the fuel fee was based on a prohibition of use. A further reason for the inclusion of the aforementioned comparison of the Fuel Fee Act with the Penal Code was the case pending before the European Court of Justice. The purpose was only to indicate that the objectives of legislation may be achieved even if not based on a prohibition.

The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. It is enough that the offence in question is by its nature to be regarded as criminal or that the offence renders the person liable to a penalty which by its nature and degree of severity belongs in the general criminal sphere (see Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § 86, ECHR 2003 ‑ X). The relative lack of seriousness of the penalty cannot divest an offence of its inherently criminal character (see Öztürk v. Germany, judgment of 21 February 1984, Series A no. 73, § 54, and Lutz v. Germany, judgment of 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123, § 55). This does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, as recent authorities, Jussila v.

This is however not decisive. In this connection, the Court has previously found that the sphere defined in the Finnish legal system as “administrative” embraces certain offences that have a criminal connotation but are too trivial to be governed by criminal law and procedure (see Jussila v.

The applicant was liable in his capacity as owner or user of a diesel engine vehicle. As to the Government’s argument that the fuel fee debit was intended as pecuniary compensation for damage, the Court is however not so convinced in the circumstances of the present case. It may well be that the fuel fee imposed corresponded to the damage caused, namely loss of revenue. It is however to be noted that the fuel fee collected was trebled. This must in the Court’s view be seen as a punishment to deter re-offending, recognised as a characteristic feature of criminal penalties (see Ezeh, §§ 102 and 105).

The Court reiterates that in the light of the Preamble to the Convention, the rule of law is part of the common heritage of the Contracting States, one of the fundamental aspects of which is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, among other things, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see Brumărescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, § 61, ECHR 1999 ‑ VII)."

Russia, no. 52854/99, § 52, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX) or if serious legitimate considerations outweigh the principle of legal certainty (see Bratyakin v. Russia (dec.), no. 72776/01, 9 March 2006)."

It must be assessed in the light of, for example, Article 4 § 2 of Protocol No. 7, which expressly permits a State to reopen a case due to the emergence of new facts, or where a fundamental defect is detected in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case ( see Nikitin v. Russia, no. 50178/99, § 54-57, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII, and Savinskiy v. Ukraine, no. 6965/02, § 23, 28 February 2006). Certain special circumstances of the case may reveal that the actual manner in which such a review was used impaired the very essence of a fair trial. In particular, the Court has to assess whether, in a given case, the power to launch and conduct a [ ... ] review was exercised by the authorities so as to strike, to the maximum extent possible, a fair balance between the interests of the individual and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the system of criminal justice (see Bujniţa v.

The Court observes, and it seems undisputed between the parties, that in the present case a final judgment acquitting the applicant on all charges was re-examined and quashed by granting the prosecutor ’ s request for leave to appeal out of time against the acquittal decision (see, by contrast, Fadin v. Russia, no. 58079/00, § 34, 27 July 2006). The issue arises as to whether on the basis of the facts of the case, and regard being had to the review proceedings, the authorities struck, to the maximum extent possible, a fair balance between the interests of the applicant and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the system of criminal justice and thus complied with Article 6."

The bulk of the prosecutor ’ s request for leave to appeal out of time of 8 October 1999 concerned the breach of procedural safeguards in that the injured party, i.e. the victim ’ s family, had not been notified of the acquittal decision. The Court notes that under Article 58 § 1 of the CCP the injured party may request the prosecution of the offender and compensation for damage. Under Article 409 of the CCP, the injured party may file an appeal, himself or through his legal representative, in respect of criminal and civil aspects."

Even assuming that the victim ’ s family had been granted “injured party” status and had had vested interests with regard to any alleged criminal and civil aspects, they did not lodge any appeal with the District Court themselves or through their legal representative. Nor did they make a request for leave to appeal out of time or directly take any necessary action through the assistance of the prosecutor ’ s office. The victim ’ s family chose another course. They filed a request with other domestic authorities, i.e. the office of the President of the Republic, which were not empowered to take any action whatsoever, other than to pass on their complaints to the prosecutor ’ s office."

The Court does not accept the Government ’ s argument that the prosecutor who attended the acquittal procedures, even though he had previously participated in the proceedings that had led to the applicant ’ s conviction, had failed to notify his supervisors, so that an appeal could not be lodged within the time prescribed by law. It considers that the mistakes or errors of the State authorities should serve to the benefit of the defendant. In other words, the risk of any mistake made by the prosecuting authority, or indeed a court, must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see above Radchikov v. Russia, § 50).

In the instant case the prosecutor ’ s office failed to exercise its right to lodge an ordinary appeal and permitted the statutory ten -day time-limit to expire without challenging the acquittal decision. Instead, they requested leave to appeal out of time more than nine months later, after the judgment in the applicant ’ s favour had become binding and enforceable and after his acquittal. The prosecutor ’ s request did not contain any information as to the date when the ten-day time-limit provided for under Article 147 § 3 of the CCP had begun to run, and nor did the Government point to any exceptional circumstances that would have prevented the prosecutor ’ s office from making use of an ordinary appeal in good time."
