As a result, section 41 bis could not be construed as empowering the Minister of Justice to take measures relating to prisoners ’ correspondence. Accordingly, from the end of 1993 the sole basis for monitoring of correspondence was section 18 of Law no. 354 of 1975, as amended by section 1 of Law no. 1 of 1977.",

Hence, a lack of appropriate medical care and, more generally, the detention in inappropriate conditions of a person who is ill may in principle amount to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see, for example, İlhan v.

Although Article 3 of the Convention cannot be construed as laying down a general obligation to release detainees or place them in a civil hospital, even if they are suffering from an illness which is particularly difficult to treat ( see Mouisel, cited above, § 40 ), it nonetheless imposes an obligation on the State to protect the physical well ‑ being of persons deprived of their liberty. The Court cannot rule out the possibility that in particularly serious cases situations may arise where the proper administration of criminal justice requires remedies to be taken in the form of humanitarian measures (see Matencio v. France, no. 58749/00, § 76, 15 January 2004, and Sakkopoulos v. Greece, no. 61828/00, § 38, 15 January 2004 )."

Furthermore, the Court has held that detaining a person suffering from tetraplegia in conditions inappropriate to her state of health amounted to degrading treatment (see Price, cited above, § 30). In these circumstances, the Court must take account of three factors in particular in assessing whether the continued detention of an applicant is compatible with his or her state of health where the latter is giving cause for concern. These are: (a) the prisoner ’ s condition; (b) the quality of care provided; and (c) whether or not the applicant should continue to be detained in view of his or her state of health (see Farbtuhs v.

On three occasions, in January 2001 and in March and July 2002, the Naples court responsible for the execution of sentences, on the basis of the medical reports drawn up by the prison doctors, refused the applicant ’ s requests for a stay of execution of his sentence, taking the view that the care provided by the prison ’ s in-house medical service was appropriate to his state of health (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above).",

On the contrary, the length of time must be examined in the light of the circumstances of each case; this entails, inter alia, ascertaining whether the renewal or extension of the restrictions in question was justified or not (see Argenti v.

The Court arrived at this conclusion by taking account of two factors in particular, namely the limited period of validity of each decree imposing the special regime and the fact that the Minister of Justice could issue a new decree without being bound by any decision the court responsible for the execution of sentences might have taken to rescind all or part of the restrictions imposed by the previous decree.

In that context the Court considers that, given the specific nature of the phenomenon of organised crime, particularly of the mafia type, and the fact that family visits have frequently served as a means of conveying orders and instructions to the outside, the – admittedly substantial – restrictions on visits, and the accompanying controls, could not be said to be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued (see Salvatore v.

Before the Court of Cassation they had instructed a lawyer (Mr Monod) to represent them and they had not left the address given as their place of residence in the case file. There was accordingly no proportionality between their failure to comply with the arrest warrants and the sanction that had been imposed for that reason. The Code of Criminal Procedure did not lay down any positive obligation to surrender to custody and it had not been asserted that they had resisted any attempts to enforce the warrants."

The Government submitted that the Court of Cassation’s ruling that the applicants’ appeal was inadmissible satisfied the criteria laid down by the Court’s case-law, in so far as the limitation concerned did not “restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right [was] impaired”. Access to the Court of Cassation was not denied to an absconding defendant but only made subject to certain conditions intended to ensure a fair balance between the protection of public interests and respect for the rights of the defence. In the present case the applicants had deliberately failed to comply with the warrants for their arrest, since they had not attended the hearing for the delivery of the Court of Appeal’s judgment, the date of which had been duly notified to them. They had lodged their appeal on points of law three days later, and could therefore not maintain that, not having been served in person with a copy of the arrest warrant, they were not obliged to comply with it. The ruling that the appeal was inadmissible had thus been proportionate to the aim pursued, which was to make it possible to enforce the court’s order against the applicants, regard being had in addition to the level of the court which had ruled it inadmissible. Moreover, unlike Mr Poitrimol, the applicants had had the benefit of adversarial procedure at first instance and on appeal, so that the Court’s conclusion in the Poitrimol v. France judgment (23 November 1993, Series A no. 277-A) could not be transposed to the present case. Lastly, scrutiny of the criminal proceedings against the applicants as a whole showed that their right to a fair trial had been respected."

It also expressed the opinion that the Court’s decision in the Poitrimol case was valid not only in respect of cases where a defendant had unsuccessfully sought on appeal to justify his refusal to appear before the court and to be represented by counsel; it had to do with the disproportionate nature of the sanction as such. In the present case the sanction was all the more disproportionate because, unlike Mr Poitrimol, who had left French territory, the applicants had not absconded and had never at any time attempted to evade justice."

It could not be otherwise unless he supplied evidence of circumstances making it absolutely impossible for him to surrender to custody at the appropriate time. As no such evidence has been supplied by the three appellants, against whom arrest warrants were issued after they had appeared in court for the hearing, their appeal, which has been lodged by an attorney practising in the Court of Appeal, must be declared inadmissible” (see paragraph 16 above)."

Nevertheless, a State which does institute such courts is required to ensure that persons amenable to the law shall enjoy before these courts the fundamental guarantees contained in Article 6” (see the Delcourt v.

He also challenged the Indictment Division's decision to commit him for trial for aiding and abetting crimes against humanity on the ground that, in his opinion, individual complicity in the case of such a crime, which was mainly attributable to an institution or an organisation, presupposed that the individual concerned subscribed to the hegemonic and racial ideology of the criminal institution. The applicant maintained that he had never belonged to the Nazi organisations condemned by the Nuremberg Tribunal and that the acts of which he stood accused had been committed in the performance of his duties as secretary-general of the Gironde Prefecture, an organ of the Vichy State, which in his view did not have a hegemonic ideology with the goal of racial extermination. He submitted that for the purposes of the Nuremberg law, which formed the basis of his prosecution, the German State and the Nazi organisations should be regarded as separate entities from the Vichy State, to which crimes against humanity could not therefore be attributed retrospectively. Consequently, he considered that neither could such crimes be attributed to persons who had performed purely administrative duties in the departments for which he was responsible.

It therefore cannot take into account Mr Vuillemin's fee note, which contains no items relating to steps taken in the present proceedings. While the initial application, lodged by Mr Argand on 14 January 2000, was co-signed by Mr Varaut, the observations in reply to the Government's observations and the applications for just satisfaction were drawn up by Mr Argand. Mr Varaut's fee note of 18 June 2001, which indicates only a total sum, contains no other details and the note of 6 March 2001 appears to refer to proceedings against the civil parties in the Melun tribunal de grande instance. That being so, the Court is not in a position to satisfy itself that the fees paid to Mr Varaut were actually and necessarily incurred for the present proceedings and it considers that there is no ground for awarding reimbursement of them. As to Mr Argand's fees, contained in a note setting out a detailed list of work done, and having regard to the fact that only two of the complaints initially made were declared admissible, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant EUR 20,000 under this head."

In domestic proceedings the Minister of the Interior, who kept the central records on deductible-point driving licences, systematically referred to the deduction of points as a secondary penalty. Moreover, the sanction in question was a punitive measure which was capable of affecting freedom of movement in so far as it could, eventually, lead to disqualification. It could not be described as an administrative sanction because it was not ordered by an administrative authority but was mandatory according to the relevant statute."

Similarly, the Law of 10 July 1989 provided that, where a person had committed an offence which entailed, in due course, a deduction of points, the ordinary courts were not empowered to exempt him, under Article 55-1 of the Criminal Code, or rehabilitate him, under Article 799 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. There was therefore no doubt that for the purposes of domestic law the deduction of points was not a criminal measure.

In its analysis it is not bound by the classifications in domestic law, which have only relative value (see the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 34, § 81; the Öztürk v.

France judgment of 21 October 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2224, § 53).",

Other factors that may be taken into account as relevant in this connection are the nature and purpose of the measure in question; its characterisation under national law; the procedures involved in the making and implementation of the measure; and its severity” (judgment cited above, p. 13, § 28)."

With regard to the classification in French law of the deduction of points, the Court notes, like the Commission, that an examination of the relevant legislation and the case-law of the Court of Cassation and the Conseil d’Etat (see paragraph 20 above) clearly shows that the measure in question, considered in isolation, is regarded as an administrative sanction not connected with the criminal law. The mere fact that, according to the applicant, the Minister of the Interior, who keeps the central records on deductible-point driving licences, systematically refers to the deduction of points as a secondary penalty cannot negate that finding."

The criminal court first assesses and classifies the facts constituting the offence which may give rise to the docking of points, before imposing whatever principal or secondary criminal penalty it deems appropriate. Then, on the basis of the conviction pronounced by the criminal court, the Minister of the Interior deducts the number of points corresponding to the type of offence concerned, in accordance with the scale laid down by Parliament, in Article R. 256 of the Road Traffic Code (see paragraph 21 above).",

It is indisputable that the right to drive a motor vehicle is very useful in everyday life and for carrying on an occupation. The Court, like the Commission, accordingly infers that, although the deduction of points has a preventive character, it also has a punitive and deterrent character and is accordingly similar to a secondary penalty. The fact that Parliament intended to dissociate the sanction of deducting points from the other penalties imposed by the criminal courts cannot change the nature of the measure."

Moreover, even in domestic law, everyone on whom a secondary penalty had been imposed could ask the ordinary courts to rescind the disqualification or disability concerned. But Article L. 11-4 of the Road Traffic Code excluded precisely that possibility and laid down special rules. Furthermore, applying to the administrative courts was not effective because their jurisdiction was restricted in such a way that they had no discretion. The supervision they carried out was purely formal, being limited to recording the deduction of points resulting automatically from a court finding that the offence had been committed. But the ordinary courts were the guardians of individual freedoms and it was their task to determine whether the law on driving licences was compatible with the Convention."

They could thus elect to stand trial in the criminal courts in order to answer charges which might be used as the basis for a deduction of points. Similarly, when notice of a deduction was served on offenders after the criminal courts had given their verdict, they were informed that they could take their cases to the administrative courts and had two months in which to do so. In the present case, that is what Mr Malige could have done, because an administrative court dealing with an application challenging a decision as ultra vires must satisfy itself that the administrative authority has not made any error about the existence of the facts which prompted its intervention, that is the criminal conviction entailing the docking of points, or any error in law."

Since this ground of disqualification was mandatory, no discretion being conferred on the accused, no \"waiver\" could lawfully be made. At all events, in the instant case, notwithstanding the contents of the record of the trial (see paragraph 10 above), the defence lawyer did not waive the right to raise the issue of Judge Schaumburger's participation in the trial as a ground of nullity. On the contrary, he expressly stated that such a waiver would be legally impossible.

In the present case, the presiding judge had informed the defence before the trial that one of the members of the court had taken part in the investigation proceedings. He had then invited the applicant's lawyer to say whether he wished to challenge that judge on that account. The applicant's lawyer had not replied (see paragraph 9 above). At the hearing, before the court began to take evidence, the presiding judge had again enquired whether the parties had any objection to Judge Schaumburger's participation. The record of the trial showed that the parties had waived their right to raise this point as a ground of nullity (see paragraph 10 above). No request was filed for an amendment or rectification of the record of the trial. Contrary to what occurred in the case of Pfeifer and Plankl v. Austria (judgment of 25 February 1992, Series A no. 227, pp. 16-17, paras. 35-39), in which the Court took the view that the waiver was invalid, the offer of waiver in the present case, as the record of the trial shows, was accepted by experienced legal counsel in an unequivocal manner."

Otherwise, the Commission agreed with the main thrust of the Government's arguments and found that the applicant was entitled to, and validly did, waive his right to challenge Judge Schaumburger."

However, it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see, mutatis mutandis, the Casado Coca v. Spain judgment of 24 February 1994, Series A no. 285-A, p. 18, para. 43).

However, whether these misgivings should be treated as objectively justified depends on the circumstances of each particular case; the mere fact that a trial judge has also dealt with the case at the pre-trial stage cannot be held as in itself justifying fears as to his impartiality (see, mutatis mutandis, the Hauschildt v.

It did not entail any assessment of the evidence by him nor did it require him to reach any kind of conclusion as to the applicant's involvement. In this limited context, the applicant's fear that the Innsbruck Regional Court lacked impartiality cannot be regarded as objectively justified (see, mutatis mutandis, the Nortier judgment cited above, p. 16, para. 37).

In the present criminal appeal, the submission of the observations allowed the Attorney-General to take up a clear position as to the applicant's appeal, a position which was not communicated to the defence and to which the defence could not reply. In any event, as the Commission rightly pointed out, the principle of the equality of arms does not depend on further, quantifiable unfairness flowing from a procedural inequality.

A court should be reluctant to interfere with such courts-martial sentencing decisions, particularly where the Judge Advocate General has reviewed the matter and has dismissed the petition in the terms in which he did here. The considerations particular to this sort of military offence relate to the significance of the offence for the maintenance of military discipline and efficiency, the need for deterrence, the significance of rank and the availability of other measures from dismissal to loss of rank and pay, which are in many ways not available or not paralleled in the civilian sphere. Indeed some of those factors would also be of particular weight when the Courts-Martial Appeal Court is dealing with offences which do have parallels in the civilian sphere, and would justify caution in interfering with courts-martial sentences; even more so do they justify caution when dealing with offences which have no parallel in the civilian sphere.”",

The only factual matters on which [the appellants] could rely were the reports written on Wing Commander Chambers who presided [ at one of the RAF courts-martial] (there being no report on any army [permanent president] ). It would in my opinion be preferable if no annual report were written on officers serving as [permanent presidents ], but those on Wing Commander Chambers gave no support in substance to [the appellants'] argument.

                "“It goes without saying that any judgment of the European Court commands great respect, and section 2(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires the House to take any such judgment into account, as it routinely does. There were, however, a large number of points in issue in Morris v. the United Kingdom, and it seems clear that on this particular aspect the European Court did not receive all the help which was needed to form a conclusion. It is true that the junior officers who sit on courts-martial have very little legal training, but that is also true of the [permanent president] whose presence was accepted [in Morris ] as a guarantee of the rights of the accused. It is also true that junior officers sitting on courts-martial remain subject to army discipline and reports. But there is nothing to suggest that any report ever is or ever has been made on any junior officer's decision-making as a member of a court-martial, and it is hard to see how any such report could be made given the prohibition on disclosure of the deliberations of the tribunal in the oath taken by the members. There is nothing to suggest that they remain subject to service discipline in relation to their judicial decision-making, and again it is hard to see how they could. It is true that there is no statutory bar on an officer being made subject to external army influence when sitting on the case. Any person seeking to influence the decision of a sitting member of a court-martial otherwise than at the hearing would, however, be at risk of prosecution either for perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice or under section 69 of the 1955 Act. The officer members are drawn from a different command from the accused. Briefing notes sent to officer members of courts-martial before they sit enjoin them not to'speak to any unit personnel and certainly not to any unit officer who may be attending the trial in an official capacity or as a spectator'. They are instructed in writing not to talk to anyone about the case (other than the other members of the court-martial, when all are together) for as long as the trial continues, and this instruction is routinely emphasised by the judge advocate. The officers do not occupy accommodation at the unit of the accused and are told to be seen to avoid'local unit influences'. They are instructed'not to associate with Formation or Unit personnel either professionally or socially until the trial is over'. At the outset of the hearing the officers take an oath in terms quoted by the European Court in [ paragraph 27 of its judgment in Morris ], swearing to try the accused'according to the evidence'and to'administer justice according to the Army Act 1955 without partiality, favour or affection'. In considering the independence and impartiality of the [permanent president] both the [ Courts-Martial Appeal Court in the appellants'cases] and the European Court in Morris ... attached weight to established convention and practice. In my opinion the rules governing the role of junior officers as members of courts-martial are in practice such as effectively to protect the accused against the risk that they might be subject to'external army influence', as I feel sure the European Court would have appreciated had the position been more fully explained.”"

                "68. Turning to the criticism of the reviewing authority in Morris, Lord Bingham noted:",
                "“Its role can certainly be seen as anomalous, since ordinarily a binding decision of any court cannot be disturbed otherwise than (exceptionally) by itself or by a superior appellate court. It is however to be noted that the review of conviction and sentence carried out by the reviewing authority, whether the accused seeks such review or not ... cannot work otherwise than to the advantage of the accused. The reviewing authority cannot substitute conviction of a more serious offence, nor can it substitute a sentence which is in its opinion more severe (section 113AA(4)). This subsection does not confer a discretion, but calls for an exercise of judgment. It is essentially the same exercise of judgment as is required of the Court of Appeal ... which has not given rise to difficulty in practice. If the reviewing authority were to substitute a sentence which the accused considered to be more severe than that imposed by the court-martial, it would be open to the accused to challenge the substituted sentence on appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, and it is important to note that the intervention of the reviewing authority in no way diminishes the rights of the accused on appeal. It is difficult to see any analogy with the situation which the European Court considered in Brumarescu v. Romania ... where the applicant, with a final and irreversible judgment of a court in his favour, was deprived of the benefit of that judgment by a later decision in proceedings initiated by a party not involved in the earlier case. If a court-martial is not an independent and impartial tribunal for the trial of civil offences committed by service personnel in England and Wales, the reviewing authority could not be relied on to save it. But if it is, I find it difficult to understand how the role of the reviewing authority can undermine or reduce its independence and impartiality. [The appellants] recognised the difficulty of this argument and did not seek to sustain the judgment of the European Court on the point.”"

The appellants had also generally argued that the whole culture of the services was such as to incline those who took part in courts-martial to attach excessive weight to the values of discipline and morale, to the point of rendering a trial unfair. It was argued that the ritual accompanying courts-martial was oppressive and unfair. Lord Bingham observed:",
                "“I would for my part have no hesitation in agreeing that a court-martial is a court of law, not a parade, and its procedures (while properly involving some formality) should be those appropriate to a court of law and not the parade ground. I would also accept that officers serving on courts-martial will disapprove of those found to have acted in breach of the law governing their respective service. But judges and jurors in the Crown Court will similarly disapprove of those found to have infringed the ordinary criminal law. There is no reason to think that in the former case any more than in the latter such disapproval will infect the tribunal's approach to deciding whether the particular accused has broken the law in the manner charged. Officers will appreciate, better than anyone, that to convict and punish those not shown to be guilty is not to promote the interests of good discipline and high morale but to sow the seeds of disaffection and perhaps even mutiny. In the absence of any evidence at all to support it, I could not accept the suggestion that any modern officer would, despite the oath he has taken, exercise his judgment otherwise than independently and impartially or be thought by any reasonable and informed observer to be at risk of doing so.”",

Lord Rodger rejected the suggestion that, by its very nature, a trial of a civilian offence by court-martial was incompatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and he referred, in this respect, to this Court's judgment in Engel and Others v. the Netherlands ( judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22) and to Morris ( cited above, § 59). Since the trial by court-martial did not in itself violate Article 6 § 1, the decision as to whether the court-martial was to be regarded as an independent and impartial tribunal depended on the safeguards which were in place. He noted generally in this respect:",
                "“A submission of this kind requires one, as a starting-point, to consider what is meant by the requirement that a tribunal should be independent and impartial. As the European Court noted in Morris ... the concepts of independence and objective impartiality are closely linked. In the present cases, in substance, the court-martial must be guarded from the risk of influence by the prosecution and guarded from the risk of influence by the relevant service authorities, especially superior officers who might wish to secure some particular result, supposedly in the interests of the morale or discipline of the service or of some particular unit. As a result of the abolition of the role of the convening officer by the 1996 Act, no issue was raised in these cases as to the independence of the members of the tribunal from the prosecution. On the other hand, Article 6 does not require that the members of the tribunal should not share the values of the military community to which they belong any more than it requires that the judge or members of the jury in a civil court should be divorced from the values of the wider community of which they form part. What matters is that, while sharing the values of the service community, the members of the court-martial should put aside any prejudices which they may have and act – and be seen to act – independently and impartially in deciding the issues in the case before them.”"

As to permanent presidents, Lord Rodger observed that, while there had been no appraisal reports on permanent presidents in the army since 1997, the RAF had continued the practice of preparing reports on permanent presidents. He was of the view that “that practice [ was ] undesirable and, as the army experience show [ ed ], unnecessary. It would be better if it were discontinued”. However, he went on to observe that such reports generally, and the ones completed in the case before him, commented on the manner in which the permanent president had tackled his role as a permanent president (referring to the administrative aspects of the job) and did not bear on his actual decisions when sitting in a court-martial. Indeed, Lord Rodger noted that the reports in question had recognised that the permanent president's role was one in which the president was “isolated and unsupervised and which require [d] independence” which the Air Secretary “honour[ed] and respect[ed]”. The reports did not therefore give the slightest reason to doubt the permanent president's independence. On the contrary, he considered that",

He drew parallels between the members of the court-martial and jurors, noting that, while jurors brought certain prejudices and experiences with them to a trial, the safeguards of an oath and the trial judge's directions were considered by the domestic courts and by the European Court to be sufficient to ensure that jurors put aside their prejudices and reached a just verdict on the evidence. The members of courts-martial took a similar oath and the judge advocate gave them the same kind of directions which a trial judge would have given jurors: there was no reason to suppose that members of a court-martial would be less faithful to their oath or less diligent in applying the directions given by the judge advocate than would jurors, particularly when “trust and obedience to commands” were important to the officers sitting on a court-martial."

In order to be seen to avoid local unit influences, the members are not to stay in public accommodation at the accused's unit. They are not to speak to unit personnel and especially not to any officer who may be attending the trial – at the risk of being debarred from the trial or indeed of the trial being prejudiced. They are not to associate either professionally or socially with such personnel until the trial is over. There is a veto on the president briefing the other members of the court in the absence of the judge advocate. The members are to tell the court administration officer if they know something about the accused which could prejudice their impartiality or if they know someone who might be a witness in the case. The members are warned not to talk to anyone else about the case as long as it continues. They are not to look at any papers which are before the judge advocate, prosecutor or defence counsel, for fear of seeing something which they ought not to. When they deliberate on conviction or sentence, the most junior member is to give his opinion orally first – again, obviously, with the aim of ensuring that the junior members express their own personal view, uninfluenced by the more senior members. In terms of the members'oath their deliberations are to be kept secret and this secrecy is further ensured by the instruction to the court orderly at the end of the proceedings to burn or shred all scrap paper. Again, the object is to prevent the members feeling, or coming under, any outside pressure during or after the trial by reason of their participation in the decision in the case.",
                "[The appellants] did not suggest that these were other than genuine instructions to the members which they were intended to observe. Nor was it suggested that the instructions were in practice ignored or that they had been ignored in these particular cases. But if they are indeed observed, I find it hard, if not impossible, to see how anyone either in the court or, more particularly, outside the court could improperly influence the members'decision either on conviction or on sentence. Certainly, it is hard to see what more could be done to ensure that, while sitting in the court-martial, the officers act not as officers subject to command but as independent and impartial members of the court, reaching the verdict and determining the sentence according to law but according also to their own individual conscience.”"

                "74. Lord Rodger noted that there were, however, two differences between members of a court-martial and an ordinary jury, differences which he concluded did not undermine the independence of the former:",
                "“First, the routines, the periods of boredom and the pleasures, pains and pressures of service life would be unknown to most jurors today, although they would have been familiar to many of their fathers and grandfathers. By contrast, members of a court-martial know all about them and about the society in which the accused lives and works. [The appellants'counsel ] suggested that officers on a court-martial, imbued by their training with notions of rank and discipline, would always tend to believe the evidence of a fellow officer or a non-commissioned officer rather than the evidence of a private. By contrast, he said, members of a jury, who carried no such burden of preconceptions, would be able to see more clearly and judge purely on the evidence before them. Of course, this submission was really just a matter of assertion. There was, and could be, no evidence to back it up. Indeed, it was somewhat undermined by the conviction of [ two of] the appellants ... [Those appellants'] conviction was based on the evidence of [two Guardsmen] ... In accepting the guardsmen's evidence, the court-martial must have disbelieved the evidence of their superiors in rank ... In any event, it is possible to fashion an argument – equally a matter of assertion – that officers who are familiar with service life and who are in close contact with service personnel of all ranks may well be less impressed by mere rank and better able to gauge the underlying realities than jurors confronted for the first time with officers or non-commissioned officers telling an apparently plausible tale. Viewed in this light, the specialised knowledge and experience of the members of a court-martial could be seen as a positive advantage rather than as a disadvantage. However that may be, I see no reason to think that, when duly directed by the judge advocate, officers on a court-martial cannot properly assess the evidence and return a true verdict based on it. I therefore reject the appellants'argument on this point.",
                "The members of a court-martial perform a role in deciding sentence which is no part of a jury's function in the United Kingdom. I accept that, in determining sentence, the members will indeed have regard to such issues as the impact of the offence on service morale and discipline. They will, inevitably, be more aware of these effects than a civil judge would be. Therefore, while the safeguards of the independence and impartiality of the members should mean that they approach their verdict in much the same way as jurors in a civil trial, it cannot be assumed that, when passing sentence, the court-martial will necessarily give exactly the same weight to these service factors as would a Crown Court judge. The sentences which a court-martial passes may therefore not coincide exactly with the sentences which a civil judge would pass on the same facts. In my view that does not call the decisions of the courts-martial into question, either generally or in terms of Article 6. Any difference in sentencing does not mean that the members are not independent or impartial, but merely that, though both independent and impartial, they may assess the various factors differently ... There are ... two additional points to bear in mind. The first is that the judge advocate advises the other members on sentence and also has a vote on sentence. He will be able to bring to bear his informed view as a lawyer on what sentence would be suitable. The second safeguard is that any sentence imposed by the court-martial is subject not only to review by the reviewing authority but also to appeal, on the ground that it is not appropriate, with the leave of the [ Courts-Martial Appeal Court ]. The members of the [ Courts-Martial Appeal Court ] are civil judges and are in a position to correct any inappropriate punishment that the court-martial may impose by reason of the members'military background.”"

                "75. Lord Rodger considered that all of these matters had to be borne in mind when considering the particular characteristics of the members of the court-martial to which the Chamber attached importance in Morris. He went on to identify and disagree with the specific concerns expressed by the Chamber in that case as regards the independence of the ordinary members:",
                "“The first was that the officer members had no legal training. That applies also in the present cases and indeed must apply in virtually all cases. As the briefing notes show, officers who may be called upon to sit on courts-martial are given some training by being allowed to sit and observe proceedings, including the members'deliberations. This should mean that, when they are eventually asked to sit, they should not find the procedures wholly unknown or strange, but it goes no further than that. While in Morris v. the United Kingdom the Third Chamber seems to have regarded the lack of formal legal training as a significant defect, as I have already noted, in Engel v. the Netherlands ... the European Court held that the Dutch Supreme Military Court was an independent and impartial tribunal, even though four of the six members were military officers with no legal training. Given the other safeguards which were in place in the present cases, I see no reason to conclude that the absence of legal training undermined the members'independence and impartiality.",
                "The European Court attached importance to the fact that the officers, other than the permanent president, remained subject to army discipline and reports. In so far as the members of the courts-martial in the present cases also remained subject to service discipline, they simply shared the characteristic of all serving members of the armed forces. It must have been equally true of the military members of the Dutch Supreme Military Court in Engel v. the Netherlands. Moreover, the fuller information available to the House about the safeguards in place to protect the independence of the members of courts-martial shows clearly, in my view, that, just like the Dutch officers in Engel v. the Netherlands, the officers in these cases would not have been under the command of any higher authority in their function as members of the courts-martial. Indeed, as [the Ministry of Defence] pointed out, contrary to the assumption of the European Court, there was even a formal legal bar to any superior officer trying to influence their decision, since this would have constituted the criminal offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice.",
                "It is true, of course, that, as in Morris v. United Kingdom, so also in these cases, leaving aside the permanent presidents, the officers sitting on the courts-martial would have remained subject to reports. [The appellants] indeed drew attention to a number of such reports where mention is made of the fact that, during the year in question, the officer concerned had sat as a member of a court-martial. In itself that must be unobjectionable since the information that the particular officer has had this experience may be relevant at some future date if, for instance, consideration is being given to appointing a permanent president. What would be objectionable would be any report which made reference, whether favourable or unfavourable, to an officer's decisions when sitting on a court-martial. But [the appellants] could point to no report where this had been done. The only report which referred to an officer's performance in relation to a court-martial was one relating to [one officer]:'Her foray into the court-martial arena has brought particular accolades for her thoughtful and incisive contribution to the legal process'. The report showed that [that officer] had acted not only as junior member on several courts-martial but also as assistant defending officer to an airman tried by a general court-martial. It appears that the comment may well have related to this second role. In any event the report makes no comment on any decision reached by [that officer] when sitting as a member of a court-martial. Indeed counsel for the [Ministry of Defence] showed the House a number of statements from officers concerned with personnel matters who had read thousands of annual reports and had never seen mention of such a thing. That being so, again with the benefit of this more detailed information, I would not share the view of the European Court in Morris v. the United Kingdom that the independence and impartiality of officers sitting on courts-martial are compromised by the fact that they remain subject to the system of annual reports.",
                "For all these reasons I consider that those charged with administering the system of courts-martial have been at pains to put in place a series of practical safeguards which are designed to secure the independence and impartiality of those sitting on these courts. Nor is this surprising. There is not a little force in the point made by the [ Courts-Martial Appeal Court ] that, if service factors are to be seen as an aspect or function of the public interest, they will themselves require that the court-martial process should be, and should be seen to be, fair and impartial and, so far as possible, to achieve accurate results. Otherwise both servicemen and the public would lose confidence in it, with consequential effects on good order and discipline.",
                "Having regard in particular to the additional information which was not before the European Court, I would therefore hold that the safeguards built into the system are indeed such that no fair-minded and informed observer who had considered them would conclude that there was a real possibility that the courts-martial in these cases lacked independence or impartiality in this respect. In other words they were, objectively, independent and impartial. I would accordingly reject the Article 6 challenge based on the role of the officer members.”"

Finally, Lord Rodger turned to the reviewing authority and to the finding in Morris that the role played by that authority constituted in itself a reason for finding that a court-martial had not been independent or impartial. Lord Rodger did not agree. Indeed, he noted that even the appellants before him had difficulty in supporting the Chamber's reasoning in Morris on this point. He continued:",
                "“The reviewing authority is, admittedly, an unusual institution. It does not operate like an ordinary court and, at a certain level of abstract theory, its existence could seem to be inconsistent with the charge against an accused being determined by only a system of'tribunals'. That appears to be the way in which the European Court has treated it. But if, as the court indicates, the issue can also be characterised as relating to the independence of the court-martial, I find it difficult to see how the existence of this body affects that independence. It might, of course, be different if there were any suggestion that the decisions of the courts-martial were influenced by the existence of the reviewing authority, for example, because they tended to convict more readily or to impose heavier sentences in the knowledge that the reviewing authority could always quash them. But [the appellants] made no such submission and there is nothing whatever in the information before the House that would support it. On the contrary, [the appellants] accepted that the provision for review could only be to the benefit, and not to the detriment, of someone who had been convicted. In particular, it could provide a quick and simple means of correcting a mistaken decision by a court-martial.",
                "In reaching its conclusion on this point the European Court was particularly concerned by the fact that the decision as to whether any substituted sentence was more or less severe than that imposed by the court-martial would have been left to the discretion of the reviewing authority. When making this observation the Court does not appear to have been referred to, or to have had in mind, the coda to section 71(1) of the [1955 Act] which establishes, as a matter of law, the relative positions of particular punishments in the hierarchy of punishments set out in the subsection and which deals specifically with how detention and imprisonment are to relate to one another. Particularly when these provisions are taken into account, it is hard to see how, in reality, there is likely to be any scope for the reviewing authority to exercise the kind of discretion that appears to have troubled the European Court. In truth, counsel could refer to no case where any problem as to the relative severity of two punishments had arisen. If, by chance, however, the reviewing authority were to go wrong on the point, the person affected could ask the appeal court for leave to appeal.",
                "In all the cases under appeal except [one], the reviewing authority did not intervene, but the appellants were granted leave to appeal to the [ Courts-Martial Appeal Court ]. Where they had other arguable grounds of appeal relating to conviction or sentence, the [ Courts-Martial Appeal Court ] dealt with them, as well as with the Article 6 grounds, in their reasoned judgments. In these circumstances I am, with due respect to the decision of the European Court in Morris v .the United Kingdom, unable to see why the mere existence of the reviewing authority, or the reduction of [a] period of detention [in one case], should lead to the conclusion that the determination of the charges against the appellants was not reached by a'tribunal'that was'independent and impartial'for the purposes of Article 6. I would therefore reject the appellants'Article 6 argument based on the role of the reviewing authority.”"

However, members of courts-martial did not remain subject to service discipline in relation to their judicial decision-making, so that any reporting by the service authorities on them had to, and did in the applicant's case, exclude any comment on the carrying out by them of their duties as members of a court-martial. This was the position in Morris, and the Government regretted that this information had not been before the Court when it examined that case. Accordingly, the fact that ordinary members remained subject to air-force discipline did not undermine their independence ( the Government referred to Engel and Others, cited above, pp. 12-13, § 30).",
                "Thirdly, in the Government's opinion, there were clearly sufficient safeguards of the independence of the decision-making of the ordinary members of courts-martial. Perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice was a common - law criminal offence and an offence under section 69 of the 1955 Act. The deliberations during which the members of the court-martial voted were confidential. Each member took an oath. As with civilian jurors, there was a reasonable expectation that the ordinary members would comply with the binding directions given by the judge advocate to try the case and give a true verdict according to the evidence and without prejudice ( see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ III, and Gregory v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports 1997 - I). The Government emphasised the content, and distribution to each court-martial member, of the Courts-Martial Administration Unit (RAF) briefing notes. The Government could not locate the actual briefing notes applicable at the time of the applicant's court-martial but submitted those in force in July 1999, which they stated made only minor changes to those notes in force in February 1998. According to the Government, the notes reinforced the message, proclaimed in the oath, that members were at all times to act independently and impartially and they had the effect of preventing members feeling, or coming under, any outside pressure during or after the trial. These notes had been sufficient to convince the House of Lords that ordinary members were sufficiently protected against outside influence and the Government regretted that this material had not been put before the Court when it examined the Morris case."

They regretted that they had not brought this coda to the Court's attention during its examination of the Morris case. If the accused considered that the reviewing authority had, nevertheless, substituted a sentence more severe than that of the court-martial, he could bring this before the Courts-Martial Appeal Court.

It was also found that the 1996 Act had gone a long way towards meeting the concerns expressed in Findlay, abolishing as it did the posts of “convening officer” and “confirming officer” and separating the prosecution, convening and adjudication elements of the court-martial process ( ibid., § § 61 and 62).

Further, the Court found that the principle that a tribunal's binding decision should be unalterable by a non-judicial authority had been breached by the role of the reviewing authority, a principle which had been considered in Findlay (cited above) to be a component of the “independence” guarantee of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.",

While the higher authority decides on the basis of service considerations whether a charge should be brought before the prosecuting authority, it is the prosecuting authority which decides whether a prosecution by court-martial should be pursued or not. The 1996 Act has not conferred on the higher authority, and there is no evidence that the higher authority fulfils, any other role in the pursuit of charges by court-martial. Since the decision to prosecute by court-martial is one exclusively for the prosecuting authority, it is not relevant to the independence of the court-martial process whether the higher authority is legally qualified or not or whether there is a chain - of - command connection between that authority and the CO.

The decision to prosecute is made on the basis of legal criteria similar to those applied by the Crown Prosecution Service and in accordance with the codes of conduct of the respective branches of the legal profession. While the prosecuting authority is also the RAF Director of Legal Services, he is answerable to the Attorney General only, and is not reported on within the service on his prosecution duties. There being no chain of command or service connection between the higher and prosecuting authorities either claimed or apparent, any seniority in rank of the higher authority over the prosecuting authority would not be sufficient to conclude, as the applicant suggests, that the latter is “likely to” be influenced by the former."

Moreover, the CAO's duties are largely administrative in nature, requiring the CAO to take steps which have been regulated in some detail in the 1955 Act, the 1997 Rules and the Queen's Regulations to ensure that a court-martial hearing takes place with the necessary persons in attendance and with the required facilities in place. As to the more significant and sensitive task of selecting members of a court-martial, the detailed criteria and procedures to be followed by a CAO (see paragraphs 34-35 above) allow that officer little discretion in that selection and rebut the applicant's claim that the selection process lacks transparency. In addition, these criteria expressly exclude from a court-martial any officer from the accused's RAF station and any of his COs, as well as any officer who has been involved in the investigation and prosecution of the charges or in the convening of a court-martial. Furthermore, all officers selected to sit are reminded in the Courts-Martial Administration Unit (RAF) briefing notes received by them (see paragraphs 45 -6 2 above) of these and any other factors that could render them ineligible, and members are encouraged to inform the CAO prior to the trial (or the judge advocate once the trial has started ) if they are worried that they may be ineligible."

Boyd and Others, the Grand Chamber would compare to that of a Crown Court trial judge. The judge advocate is responsible for the fair and lawful conduct of the court-martial and his rulings on the course of the evidence and on all questions of law are binding and must be given in open court. The judge advocate has no vote on verdict and does not therefore retire with the other court-martial members to deliberate on verdict. However, he sums up the evidence and delivers further directions to the other members of the court-martial beforehand, and he can refuse to accept a verdict if he considers it “contrary to law”, in which case he gives the president and ordinary members further directions in open court, following which those members retire again to consider verdict. The judge advocate retires with the other members in order to provide advice, deliberate and vote on sentence. Moreover, and as Lord Rodger also noted (see paragraph 72 above), there is no evidence to suggest that members (the permanent president and the ordinary members) of a court-martial would be less diligent than civilian jurors in complying with binding rulings and directions on points of law given to them.",

Since the permanent president was bound by the legal rulings and directions of the judge advocate, the permanent president's lack of legal qualifications did not undermine his independence or the guarantee of independence provided by that post. While he may have been more senior in rank to the ordinary members, he could not brief them in the absence of the judge advocate and, although he deliberated on verdict alone with the ordinary members, the judge advocate exercised firm control over those deliberations both before and after they took place (see paragraphs 29 and 11 7 above).",

However, the essential point for present purposes is that no appraisal report had been drawn up on the present permanent president since August 1997 and, crucially, such reports could not have referred to that officer's judicial decision-making. As Lord Bingham pointed out (see paragraph 66 above), permanent presidents were answerable to no one in the discharge of their court-martial functions.",

He also had the power “albeit in prescribed circumstances” to dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial. It was further considered “significant” that he acted as “confirming officer” after the trial: a court-martial's verdict and sentence were not effective until “confirmed” by that officer and he could vary the sentence imposed by court-martial as he saw fit. The Court considered this contrary to the “well-established principle” that the power to give a binding decision not alterable by a non-judicial authority was inherent in the notion of “tribunal” and could also be seen as a component of the “independence” required by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.",

The Court concluded that “for all these reasons, and in particular the central role played by the convening officer in the organisation of the court martial”, Mr Findlay's misgivings about the independence and impartiality of his court-martial were objectively justified."

The convening officer retained a key prosecuting role while appointing members of the applicants'courts-martial who remained subordinate in rank to him. He could still “albeit in prescribed circumstances” have dissolved the applicants'courts-martial.

It referred to the latter's aim and activities, namely that it sought the foundation of a Kurdish State on a territory that Turkey should be made to cede after an armed struggle and to that end carried out armed attacks and sabotage against the armed forces, industrial premises and tourist facilities in the hope of weakening the authority of the State. The PKK also had a political front (the ERNK ) and a military wing (the ARNK ), which operated under its control. Its income was derived mainly from “taxes”, “fines”, donations, subscriptions, and the proceeds of armed robberies, gun-running and drug trafficking. According to the Court of Cassation, the applicant led all three of these groups. In his speeches at party conferences, in his radio and television appearances and in the orders he had given to his activists, the applicant had instructed his supporters to resort to violence, indicated combat tactics, imposed penalties on those who did not obey his instructions and incited the civilian population to put words into action. As a result of the acts of violence carried out by the PKK from 1978 until the applicant's arrest (in all, 6,036 armed attacks, 3,071 bomb attacks, 388 armed robberies and 1,046 kidnappings), 4,472 civilians, 3,874 soldiers, 247 police officers and 1,225 village guards had died."

Turkey, no. 57250/00, 29 July 2004 )."

In order to comply with the requirements of Article 6 regarding independence, the court concerned must be seen to be independent of the executive and the legislature at each of the three stages of the proceedings, namely the investigation, the trial and the verdict (those being the three stages in Turkish criminal proceedings according to the Government)."

In that connection, he explained that his lawyers had not been allowed to visit him until ten days after his arrest, by which time he had already made statements to the judicial authorities.

His first meeting with his lawyers had taken place in the presence of members of the security forces. The other visits by his lawyers had been overseen and listened in to by the authorities and filmed with a video camera. Ultimately, the applicant considered that he had not been able to confer in private with his lawyers, in breach of the mandatory provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After two short initial visits, contact with his lawyers had been limited to two weekly visits of an hour each. In proceedings that had been conducted extremely quickly and had produced an enormous case file, the total duration of the visits had been manifestly insufficient for him to prepare his defence.

The National Security Court had nonetheless dismissed an application by the applicant's lawyers for additional evidence to be taken. The applicant added that, while before the National Security Court he had accepted political responsibility for the PKK's general policy, he had denied criminal liability for acts of violence that went beyond the PKK's stated policy.

In that connection, they observed firstly that the applicant had been convicted under Article 125 of the Criminal Code, the aim of which was to protect the democratic values of the Republic. The Criminal Divisions of the Turkish Court of Cassation, sitting in plenary session, had held that the PKK was an organisation that resorted to force and acts of violence with a view to bringing about the secession of part of Turkish territory to form a Kurdish State with a political regime based on Marxist-Leninist ideology. The acts of violence perpetrated by the PKK and acknowledged by the applicant at his trial had involved some 6,036 armed attacks on civilians, 8,257 armed confrontations with the security forces, 3,071 bomb attacks, 388 armed robberies and 1,046 kidnappings. Those acts came within the list of terrorist acts set out in Articles 1 and 2 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. The Government noted that the applicant had admitted before the courts that he had played a role in the creation and organisation of the PKK and in the planning and perpetration of acts of violence committed by members of that organisation."

The 17,000 -page case file had, in fact, been compiled from the case files in seven sets of criminal proceedings that had already been instituted in various national security courts several years before the applicant's arrest, and the applicant was already familiar with the papers. In any event, very few new documents had been added to the case file. The Government asserted that the National Security Court had communicated all the relevant documents to the applicant and allowed him to study the case file and any annexes he wished to see under the supervision of two officials. It had also informed the applicant that it would provide him with a copy of any document he thought might assist him with his defence.

Switzerland, judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, p. 13, § 36).

Article 6 will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer from the initial stages of police interrogation. However, this right, which is not explicitly set out in the Convention, may be subject to restrictions for good cause. The question, in each case, is whether the restriction, in the light of the entirety of the proceedings, has deprived the accused of a fair hearing ( see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports 1996-I, pp. 54-55, § 63).",

If a lawyer were unable to confer with his client and receive confidential instructions from him without such surveillance, his assistance would lose much of its usefulness, whereas the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective ( see S. v. Switzerland, judgment of 28 November 1991, Series A no. 220, pp. 15- 16, § 48). The importance to the rights of the defence of ensuring confidentiality in meetings between the accused and his lawyers has been affirmed in various international instruments, including European instruments (see Brennan v. the United Kingdom, no. 39846/98, §§ 38-40, ECHR 2001-X). However, as stated above ... restrictions may be imposed on an accused's access to his lawyer if good cause exists.

It considers that the inevitable consequence of that restriction, which was imposed during both the preliminary investigation and the trial, was to prevent the applicant from conversing openly with his lawyers and asking them questions that might prove important to the preparation of his defence. The rights of the defence were thus significantly affected.",
                "... The Court observes in that connection that the applicant had already made statements by the time he conferred with his lawyers and made further statements at hearings before the National Security Court after consulting them. If his defence to the serious charges he was required to answer was to be effective, it was essential that those statements be consistent. Accordingly, the Court considers that it was necessary for the applicant to be able to speak with his lawyers out of the hearing of third parties.",

As to the Government's contention that the supervision of the meetings between the applicant and his lawyers was necessary to ensure the applicant's security, the Court observes that the lawyers had been retained by the applicant himself and that there was no reason to suspect that they threatened their client's life. They were not permitted to see the applicant until they had undergone a series of searches. Mere visual surveillance by the prison officials, accompanied by other measures, would have sufficed to ensure the applicant's security.”",

It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court's task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial ( see Quaranta v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 May 1991, Series A no. 205, p. 16, § 30). In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to'guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective'and that assigning a counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused ( see Artico v. Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 15- 16, § 33). The Court also points out that the manner in which Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) are to be applied during the preliminary investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings involved and on the circumstances of the case; in order to determine whether the aim of Article 6 – a fair trial – has been achieved, regard must be had to the entirety of the domestic proceedings conducted in the case ( see Imbrioscia, cited above, pp. 13- 14, § 38).",

The Court further notes that the presentation of those highly complex charges generated an exceptionally voluminous case file ... It considers that in order to prepare his defence to those charges the applicant required skilled legal assistance equal to the complex nature of the case.

It notes that the Government have not explained why the authorities did not permit the lawyers to visit their client more often or why they failed to provide more adequate means of transport, thereby increasing the length of each individual visit, when such measures were called for as part of the'diligence'the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner ( see Colozza [ v.

Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2231, § 43). It must, however, confine its primary attention to the issues of interpretation and application of the provisions of the Convention that arise in the present case.",
                "... It is recalled that the Court accepted in Soering that an established practice within the member States could give rise to an amendment of the Convention. In that case the Court accepted that subsequent practice in national penal policy, in the form of a generalised abolition of capital punishment, could be taken as establishing the agreement of the Contracting States to abrogate the exception provided for under Article 2 § 1 and hence remove a textual limit on the scope for evolutive interpretation of Article 3 ( ibid., pp. 40-41, § 103). It was found, however, that Protocol No. 6 showed that the intention of the States was to adopt the normal method of amendment of the text in order to introduce a new obligation to abolish capital punishment in time of peace and to do so by an optional instrument allowing each State to choose the moment when to undertake such an engagement. The Court accordingly concluded that Article 3 could not be interpreted as generally prohibiting the death penalty (ibid., pp. 40-41, §§ 103-04).",
                "... The applicant takes issue with the Court's approach in Soering. His principal submission was that the reasoning is flawed since Protocol No. 6 represents merely one yardstick by which the practice of the States may be measured and that the evidence shows that all member States of the Council of Europe have, either de facto or de jure, effected total abolition of the death penalty for all crimes and in all circumstances. He contended that as a matter of legal theory there was no reason why the States should not be capable of abolishing the death penalty both by abrogating the right to rely on the second sentence of Article 2 § 1 through their practice and by formal recognition of that process in the ratification of Protocol No. 6.",

The Court reiterates that the Convention is a living instrument which must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions and that the increasingly high standard being required in the area of the protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspondingly and inevitably requires greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fundamental values of democratic societies (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 101, ECHR 1999-V).",

It reiterates that in assessing whether a given treatment or punishment is to be regarded as inhuman or degrading for the purposes of Article 3 it cannot but be influenced by the developments and commonly accepted standards in the penal policy of the member States of the Council of Europe in this field (see Soering, cited above, p. 40, § 102). Moreover, the concepts of inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment have evolved considerably since the Convention came into force in 195 3 and indeed since the Court's judgment in Soering in 1989.",
                "... Equally the Court observes that the legal position as regards the death penalty has undergone a considerable evolution since Soering was decided. The de facto abolition noted in that case in respect of twenty-two Contracting States in 1989 has developed into a de jure abolition in forty-three of the forty-four Contracting States and a moratorium in the remaining State that has not yet abolished the penalty, namely Russia. This almost complete abandonment of the death penalty in times of peace in Europe is reflected in the fact that all the Contracting States have signed Protocol No. 6 and forty-one States have ratified it, that is to say, all except Turkey, Armenia and Russia [ [1] ]. It is further reflected in the policy of the Council of Europe, which requires that new member States undertake to abolish capital punishment as a condition of their admission into the organisation. As a result of these developments the territories encompassed by the member States of the Council of Europe have become a zone free of capital punishment.",
                "... Such a marked development could now be taken as signalling the agreement of the Contracting States to abrogate, or at the very least to modify, the second sentence of Article 2 § 1, particularly when regard is had to the fact that all Contracting States have now signed Protocol No. 6 and that it has been ratified by forty-one States. It may be questioned whether it is necessary to await ratification of Protocol No. 6 by the three remaining States before concluding that the death penalty exception in Article 2 § 1 has been significantly modified. Against such a consistent background, it can be said that capital punishment in peacetime has come to be regarded as an unacceptable ... form of punishment that is no longer permissible under Article 2.”"

Since the right to life in Article 2 of the Convention ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions of the Convention – one from which there can be no derogation in peacetime under Article 15 – and enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe, its provisions must be strictly construed (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, § 147), a fortiori the second sentence of Article 2 § 1.",

This flows from the requirement that'[e] veryone's right to life shall be protected by law'. An arbitrary act cannot be lawful under the Convention ( see Bozano, cited above, p. 23, § 54, and pp. 25-26, § 59).",
                "... It also follows from the requirement in Article 2 § 1 that the deprivation of life be pursuant to the'execution of a sentence of a court', that the'court'which imposes the penalty be an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of the Court's case-law ( see Incal, cited above; Çıraklar, cited above; Findlay v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports 1997-I; and Hauschildt v. Denmark, judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154), and that the most rigorous standards of fairness be observed in the criminal proceedings both at first instance and on appeal. Since the execution of the death penalty is irreversible, it can only be through the application of such standards that an arbitrary and unlawful taking of life can be avoided (see, in this connection, Article 5 of ECOSOC Resolution 1984/50 and the decisions of the United Nations Human Rights Committee ...; also Advisory Opinion OC-16/99 of 1 October 1999 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on'The right to information on consular assistance in the framework of the guarantee of due process of law', §§ 135 ‑ 36, and Hilaire, Constantine and Benjamin et al. v. Trinidad and Tobago, § 148 ...). Lastly, the requirement in Article 2 § 1 that the penalty be'provided by law'means not only that there must exist a basis for the penalty in domestic law but that the requirement of the quality of the law be fully respected, namely that the legal basis be'accessible'and'foreseeable'as those terms are understood in the case-law of the Court (see Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 56, ECHR 2000-II, and Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 52, ECHR 2000-V).",

However, even in these circumstances, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the victim's conduct.

In assessing the evidence on which to base the decision whether there has been a violation of Article 3, the Court adopts the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.

In this regard, it is of importance for instance whether there is reason to believe that the person concerned would resist arrest or try to abscond or cause injury or damage.

                "We note that, although the defence in this case were notified that an ex parte application was to be made by the prosecution for material to be withheld on grounds of public interest immunity, they were not informed of the category of material which the prosecution sought to withhold, they were not - by definition - involved in the ex parte proceedings, and they were not informed of the reasons for the judge's subsequent decision that the material should not be disclosed. This procedure cannot, in our view, be said to respect the principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms, given that the prosecuting authorities were provided with access to the judge and were able to participate in the decision-making process in the absence of any representative of the defence. We do not accept that the opportunity given to the defence to outline their case before the trial judge took his decision on disclosure can affect the position, as the defence were unaware of the nature of the matters they needed to address. It was purely a matter of chance whether they made any relevant points.",
                "The fact that the judge monitored the need for disclosure throughout the trial (see paragraph 56 of the judgment ) cannot remedy the unfairness created by the defence's absence from the ex parte proceedings. In our view, the requirements - set out in the Doorson and Van Mechelen judgments - that any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on defence rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities, are not met by the mere fact that it was a judge who decided that the evidence be withheld. In stating this, we do not suggest in any way that the judge in the present case was not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, or that he was not fully versed in the evidence and issues in the case as mentioned in paragraph 56 of the judgment. Our concern is that, in order to be able to fulfil his functions as the judge in a fair trial, the judge should be informed by the opinions of both parties, not solely the prosecution.",
                "The proceedings before the Court of Appeal were, in our view, inadequate to remedy these defects, since, as at first instance, there was no possibility of making informed submissions to the court on behalf of the accused. The facts of this case can therefore be distinguished from those of the Edwards judgment, where by the time of the appeal proceedings the defence had received most of the missing information and the Court of Appeal was able to consider the impact of the new material on the safety of the conviction in the light of detailed and pertinent argument from the defence (Edwards judgment, §§ 36-37).",
                "We accept that there may be circumstances in which material need not be disclosed to the defence, but we find that the way in which the United kingdom courts dealt with the sensitive material in the present case was not satisfactory. It is not for the Court to prescribe specific procedures for domestic courts to follow, but we note that, in the light of two Convention cases, a “special counsel” system has been introduced in the United Kingdom where it is necessary to withhold evidence from one of the parties to litigation, and that other examples are likely to be introduced (paragraphs 35-38 of the judgment ). These examples do not exactly match the circumstances of the present case, but we have no doubt that the practical problems raised by the Government (see paragraph 47 of the judgment ) can be resolved.",
                "For example, we understand that in Northern Ireland, ex parte applications on public immunity grounds are made to a judge other than the trial judge. In such a system, no problems of participation of the “special counsel” at the trial would arise and the trial judge is not put in the uncomfortable position of having to see material and then having to discount it at a later stage of the proceedings.",
                "Again without purporting to lay down specific procedures to be applied by domestic courts, we would refer to the system in the immigration context (see Rule 7 (7) of the Special Immigration Appeals Act Commission (Procedure) Rules 1998, set out at paragraph 36 of the judgment ). Under these arrangements, a “special counsel” is permitted to have sight of the sensitive material, after which he or she is permitted further communication with the defence only with the leave of the court.",
                "These examples show that legitimate concerns about confidentiality can be accommodated at the same time as according the individual a substantial measure of procedural justice.",
                "We conclude, therefore, that the decision-making procedure in the present case did not sufficiently comply with the principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms, nor did it incorporate adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the accused.

Non-disclosure, that is, secrecy concerning some aspects of prosecution's case, is of course a problem in itself. However, compared to the preponderantly inquisitorial Continental systems of criminal procedure in which the ex officio investigation used to be entirely secret, the partial non-disclosure in an adversarial system cannot be seen as a breach of a fundamental procedural standard. Still, for me this is not a minor technical consideration because it affects the whole philosophy of criminal procedure. I have written about that in an article entitled The Crown and the Criminal: The Privilege against Self-Incrimination -- Towards the General Principles of Criminal Procedure, Nottingham Law Journal, Vol. 5, pp. 32-119 (1996).",
                "Here I should like to raise a preliminary issue which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been considered by the national courts. For the State to acquire the right to intrude on someone' s privacy there must be probable cause, that is, a suspicion sufficiently fortified by specific, articulable and antecedent evidence to be called reasonable. Clearly, if the citizen is to have the right to be left alone by the Government any exception to this must be justified in advance of the intrusion itself. The ex post facto discovery of tons of cannabis cannot justify the previous breach of the fundamental human right to be left alone. Further, such antecedent evidence must not be tainted by violations of someone's constitutional and human rights. If it is, it (and all evidence which would not be obtained were it not for the breach) should be subject to exclusionary rule.",
                "It is permissible to speculate in this case that there was telephone interception leading to arrest. The legitimacy of this intrusion into privacy has never been subject to adversarial scrutiny as regards the issue of privacy nor regarding the question whether it in fact crossed the threshold of probable cause. Unless it did, the question remains open as to the legitimacy of subsequent arrest and search leading to ultimate conviction.",
                "The non-disclosure of these preliminary procedures of course precludes the proper examination of the basic probable cause safeguard.",
                "Dissenting Opinion of Judge Hedigan",
                "I regret that I cannot agree with the majority in this case. I agree with the dissenting opinion of Judges Palm, Fischbach, Vajić, Thomassen, Tsatsa ‑ Nikolovska and Traja save only that I do not consider that as a general rule applications to withhold evidence need to be made to a Judge other than the trial Judge. In so far as their dissenting opinion might suggest this, I would disagree.",
                "My point of departure is to be found in the judgment of the Court in Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands 23/04/97 Reports 1997-III § 58 where it held; “having regard to the place that the right to a fair administration of justice holds in a democratic society, any measures restricting the rights of the defence should be strictly necessary. If a less restrictive measure can suffice then that measure should be applied.”",
                "It follows that, if it can be shown that there is a viable alternative way of proceeding which is less restrictive of an applicant's right to a fair trial and to proceedings adversarial in character, it should be taken. In my opinion, where the applicant can establish on a prima facie basis that such an alternative way exists, the onus shifts to the respondent to show why it cannot use or adapt such a way.",
                "In this case, the prosecution withheld relevant information from the defence. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that any failure to disclose relevant evidence undermined the right to a fair trial. It was, however, conceded that the right to full disclosure was not absolute, and could, in pursuit of a legitimate aim such as protection of national security or of vulnerable witnesses or sources of information, be subject to limitations.",
                "It was agreed by the applicants and the Government that any such restrictions must be counter balanced by sufficient safeguards to protect the rights of the accused. Under present U.K. law this is provided for by the requirement that it is the trial judge should decide whether the evidence in question be disclosed.",
                "There are three ways in which this may occur:",
                "a) An application by the prosecution on notice to the accused indicating at least the category of the material which they hold. The defence then have the opportunity to make representations to the Court.",
                "b) Where disclosure of the category itself would 'let the cat out of the bag' the prosecution should notify the defence that an application to the Court is to be made but the category would not be disclosed and the application would be ex parte.",
                "c) The third procedure is where, to reveal even the fact that an ex parte application would be made, would be to reveal the nature of the evidence; in such cases the application should be made ex parte without notice to the defence."

There had been two previous importations of meat from the same consignor in May and early June 1993, both of which had been collected by a firm of hauliers called Davidsons. On this occasion, the meat was delivered to West Kent Cold Storage at Dunton Green, near Sevenoaks in Kent."

At approximately 6 a.m. he was followed from his home in Walthamstow, East London, to a lorry park at Beckton, where he collected an articulated lorry and refrigerated trailor which he had bought the previous month. He drove the lorry to West Kent Cold Storage, where he loaded the consignment of meat onto the lorry, and then drove on to a lock-up garage in Leytonstone, East London. He backed the trailor into the garage and drove away in his car. He made two brief visits to the garage during the morning, and then returned at approximately 1 p.m."

Six of the ten pallets of meat were still on the lorry in a frozen state, although the refrigerator motor was not operative. Four of the pallets, containing a large quantity of cannabis resin, had been opened and left to defrost in the unrefrigerated garage.

Any information therefore that might have led to his being able to confirm either the source or content of those instructions, as well as to trace those who had involved him in a smuggling enterprise was of obvious importance. The Crown had declined to answer the question whether any potentially relevant material, apart from the subject-matter of the ex parte application, had not been disclosed, on the grounds that to do so would reveal whether or not there had been a telephone intercept. It was plain from the course of the argument that the ex parte application had not dealt with any telephone intercept, since the Crown argued that this was the province solely of the prosecutor, and not that of the judge, a proposition based on R. v. Preston [see paragraph 34 below]. In these circumstances the defence were entitled to know at least the category of material with which that application did not deal. ... Furthermore, the Crown should have been called upon to justify, ex parte if necessary, the stance taken in relation to the other unused material. ... Since there must have been a reason for watching the defendant, which was explained neither by the evidence adduced, nor by that served but excluded by agreement, and since it was said that there was no informant involved in the case, there is a strong likelihood that disclosable information, bearing directly upon the defendant's case, was in the possession of the prosecution.”"

It referred to the important role performed by the trial judge in monitoring the views of the prosecution as to the proper balance to be struck and remarked that even in cases in which the sensitivity of the information required an ex parte hearing, the defence had “as much protection as can be given without pre-empting the issue”. Finally, it emphasised that it was for the trial judge to continue to monitor the position as the trial progressed.

It would be an abdication of the prosecution's duty if, out of an abundance of caution, it were simply “to dump all its unused material in the court's lap and leave it to the judge to sort through it regardless of its materiality to the issues present or potential”. Thus, the prosecution should put before the court only those documents which it regarded as material but wished towithhold. “Material” evidence was that which could, on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution, be seen to ( i ) be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case; (ii) raise or possibly raise a new issue the existence of which was not apparent from the evidence the prosecution proposed to use; or to (iii) hold out a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect of providing a lead of evidence going to ( i ) or (ii). Exceptionally, in case of doubt about the materiality of the documents or evidence, the court might be asked to rule on the issue.

Judged simply as a set of instructions to prosecutors, the Guidelines would be unobjectionable if they exactly matched the contours of the common law duty of non-disclosure .... But if the Guidelines, judged by the standards of today, reduce the commons law duties of the Crown and thus abridge the common law rights of a defendant, they must be pro tanto unlawful .... [T] oday, the Guidelines do not conform to the requirements of the law of disclosure in a number of critically important respects. First, the judgment in Ward established that it is for the court, not prosecuting counsel, to decide on disputed questions as to discloseable materials, and on any asserted legal ground to withhold production of relevant material .... For present purposes the point of supreme importance is that there is no hint in the Guidelines of the primacy of the court in deciding on issues of disclosure .... Secondly, the guidelines are not an exhaustive statement of the Crown's common law duty of disclosure: R. v. Ward at 25 and 681D. To that extent too the Guidelines are out of date. Thirdly, the Guidelines were drafted before major developments in the field of public interest immunity. [I]n paragraph 6 the Guidelines are cast in the form of a prosecutor's discretion ....

                "“Since R. v. Ward ... there has been an increasing tendency for defendants to seek disclosure of informants' names and roles, alleging that those details are essential to the defence. Defences that the accused has been set up, and allegations of duress, which used at one time to be rare, have multiplied. We wish to alert judges to the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about informants with very great care. They will need to be astute to see that assertions of a need to know such details, because they are essential to the running of the defence, are justified. If they are not so justified, then the judge will need to adopt a robust approach in declining to order disclosure. Clearly, there is a distinction between cases in which the circumstances raise no reasonable possibility that information about the informant will bear upon the issues and cases where it will. Again, there will be cases where the informant is an informant and no more; other cases where he may have participated in the events constituting, surrounding, or following the crime. Even when the informant has participated, the judge will need to consider whether his role so impinges on an issue of interest to the defence, present or potential, as to make disclosure necessary ... It is sufficient for us to say that in this case we are satisfied that the information concerning the informant showed a participation in the events concerning this crime which, coupled with the way in which the defence was raised from the very first moment by the defendant when he said that he was being set up, gave rise to the need for the defence to be aware of the identity of the informant and his role in this matter. We, therefore, conclude that if one applies the principle which has been quoted from R. v. Keane ... to the facts of the present case, there could only be one answer to the question as to whether the details concerning this informer were so important to the issues of interest to the defence, present and potential, that the balance which the judge had to strike came down firmly in favour of disclosure.”",

Under the 1996 Act, the prosecution must make “primary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed evidence which, in the prosecutor's view, might undermine the case for the prosecution. The defendant must then give a defence statement to the prosecution and the court, setting out in general terms the nature of the defence and the matters on which the defence takes issue with the prosecution. The prosecution must then make a “secondary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed material “which might reasonably be expected to assist the accused's defence as disclosed by the defence statement”.

The Interception of Communications Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) came into force on 10 April 1986 following the Court's judgment in Malone v. the United Kingdom (2 August 1984, Series A no. 82). Its objective, as outlined in the Home Office White Paper which preceded it, was to provide a clear statutory framework within which the interception of communications on public systems would be authorised and controlled in a manner commanding public confidence (Interception of Communications in the United Kingdom (February 1985) Her Majesty's Stationary Office, Cmnd. 9438)."

By section 1 (1) of the 1985 Act, anyone who intentionally intercepts a communication in the course of its transmission by means of a public communications system is guilty of a criminal offence. Section 1 (2) and (3) provide four circumstances in which a person who intercepts communications in this way will not be guilty of the offence, for example, interception of a communication pursuant to a warrant lawfully issued by the Secretary of State under section 2 of the Act, where the Minister considers the interception necessary in the interests of national security, for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime, or in order to safeguard the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. The operation of the Act is overseen by a Tribunal and a Commissioner: see further the Halford v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 June 1997 ( Reports 1997 ‑ III, §§ 21-35)."

Section 9 provides that no evidence shall be adduced by any party, in any proceedings before a court or tribunal, which tends to suggest either that an offence under section 1 of the 1985 Act has been committed by a public servant or that a warrant has been issued to such a person under section 2 of the 1985 Act."

Preston ([1994] vol. 2 Appeal Cases p. 130), the House of Lords decided that the fact that material intercepted pursuant to section 2 of the 1985 Act had been destroyed did not amount to a material irregularity in criminal proceedings. The basis for the House of Lords' decision was that the purpose for which such an interception might be permitted was narrowly defined in section 2 of the 1985 Act; in particular, the purpose of “preventing and detecting serious crime” did not extend to amassing evidence with a view to prosecuting offenders. One of the consequences of this construction was that, in a case of interception authorised for “preventing and detecting serious crime”, section 6 of the Act would normally require the destruction of intercepted material at a stage well before the prosecution's duty to disclose relevant material could arise in criminal proceedings. Accordingly, if the Act were to operate, as Parliament had intended, to restrict retention and dissemination of intercepted material to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of “preventing and detecting serious crime”, there was likely to be no intercepted material to disclose to the defence and its destruction could not be said to amount to a material irregularity."

Any such restriction on the rights of the defence should, however, be strictly proportionate and counterbalanced by procedural safeguards adequate to compensate for the handicap imposed on the defence.

He pointed to four examples of cases where a special counsel procedure had been introduced in the United Kingdom (see paragraphs 35-38 above). These examples, he submitted, demonstrated that an alternative mechanism was available which would ensure that the rights of the defence were respected as far as possible in the course of a hearing to determine whether evidence should be withheld on public interest grounds, whilst safeguarding legitimate concerns about, for example, national security or the protection of witnesses and sources of information, and he reasoned that the onus was on the Government to show why it would not be possible to introduce such a procedure."

Moreover, the proposed scheme would give rise to significant difficulties in practice, for example, with regard to the duties which would be owed by the special counsel to the accused, the amount of information he or she would be at liberty to pass on to the accused and the defence lawyers and the quality of instructions he or she could expect to receive from the defence.

In this way, the Act sought both to achieve a proper balance between the individual's right to privacy under Article 8 of the Convention and the need to use secret surveillance, and to ensure that measures and methods of surveillance were kept secret.

It did not consider that the non-disclosure of intercepted material rendered the proceedings unfair, since it was not established that there was any such material, since the principle of equality of arms was respected because neither side could adduce interception evidence (see paragraph 33 above), and since the applicant could have given evidence as to the fact and content of the telephone calls which he alleged took place, but chose not to."

In the circumstances of the case it finds it unnecessary to examine the applicant's allegations separately from the standpoint of paragraph 3(b) and (d), since they amount to a complaint that the applicant did not receive a fair trial.

Austria judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 211, §§ 66, 67).

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 § 1 (see the Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, § 58). Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see the above-mentioned Doorson judgment, § 72 and the above-mentioned Van Mechelen and Others judgment, § 54)."

In any event, in many cases, such as the present, where the evidence in question has never been revealed, it would not be possible for the Court to attempt to weigh the public interest in non-disclosure against that of the accused in having sight of the material.

The fact that the need for disclosure was at all times under assessment by the trial judge provided a further, important, safeguard in that it was his duty to monitor throughout the trial the fairness or otherwise of the evidence being withheld. It has not been suggested that the judge was not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 § 1. He was fully versed in all the evidence and issues in the case and in a position to monitor the relevance to the defence of the withheld information both before and during the trial. Moreover it can be assumed – not least because the Court of Appeal confirmed that the transcript of the ex parte hearing showed that he had been “very careful to ensure and to explore whether the material was relevant, or likely to be relevant to the defence which had been indicated to him” - that the judge applied the principles which had recently been clarified by the Court of Appeal, for example that in weighing the public interest in concealment against the interest of the accused in disclosure, great weight should be attached to the interests of justice, and that the judge should continue to assess the need for disclosure throughout the progress of the trial (see the Ward and Davis, Johnson and Rowe judgments in paragraphs 22 and 24-25 above). The jurisprudence of the English Court of Appeal shows that the assessment which the trial judge must make fulfils the conditions which, according to the Court's case-law, are essential for ensuring a fair trial in instances of non-disclosure of prosecution material (see paragraphs 51 and 52 above). The domestic trial court in the present case thus applied standards which were in conformity with the relevant principles of a fair trial embodied in Article 6 § 1. Furthermore, during the appeal proceedings the Court of Appeal also considered whether or not the evidence should have been disclosed (see paragraphs 17-18 above), providing an additional level of protection for the applicant's rights."

                "We note that, although the defence in this case were notified that an ex parte application was to be made by the prosecution for material to be withheld on grounds of public interest immunity, they were not informed of the category of material which the prosecution sought to withhold, they were not - by definition - involved in the ex parte proceedings, and they were not informed of the reasons for the judge's subsequent decision that the material should not be disclosed. This procedure cannot, in our view, be said to respect the principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms, given that the prosecuting authorities were provided with access to the judge and were able to participate in the decision-making process in the absence of any representative of the defence. We do not accept that the opportunity given to the defence to outline their case before the trial judge took his decision on disclosure can affect the position, as the defence were unaware of the nature of the matters they needed to address. It was purely a matter of chance whether they made any relevant points.",
                "The fact that the judge monitored the need for disclosure throughout the trial (see paragraph 56 of the judgment ) cannot remedy the unfairness created by the defence's absence from the ex parte proceedings. In our view, the requirements - set out in the Doorson and Van Mechelen judgments - that any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on defence rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities, are not met by the mere fact that it was a judge who decided that the evidence be withheld. In stating this, we do not suggest in any way that the judge in the present case was not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, or that he was not fully versed in the evidence and issues in the case as mentioned in paragraph 56 of the judgment. Our concern is that, in order to be able to fulfil his functions as the judge in a fair trial, the judge should be informed by the opinions of both parties, not solely the prosecution.",
                "The proceedings before the Court of Appeal were, in our view, inadequate to remedy these defects, since, as at first instance, there was no possibility of making informed submissions to the court on behalf of the accused. The facts of this case can therefore be distinguished from those of the Edwards judgment, where by the time of the appeal proceedings the defence had received most of the missing information and the Court of Appeal was able to consider the impact of the new material on the safety of the conviction in the light of detailed and pertinent argument from the defence (Edwards judgment, §§ 36-37).",
                "We accept that there may be circumstances in which material need not be disclosed to the defence, but we find that the way in which the United kingdom courts dealt with the sensitive material in the present case was not satisfactory. It is not for the Court to prescribe specific procedures for domestic courts to follow, but we note that, in the light of two Convention cases, a “special counsel” system has been introduced in the United Kingdom where it is necessary to withhold evidence from one of the parties to litigation, and that other examples are likely to be introduced (paragraphs 35-38 of the judgment ). These examples do not exactly match the circumstances of the present case, but we have no doubt that the practical problems raised by the Government (see paragraph 47 of the judgment ) can be resolved.",
                "For example, we understand that in Northern Ireland, ex parte applications on public immunity grounds are made to a judge other than the trial judge. In such a system, no problems of participation of the “special counsel” at the trial would arise and the trial judge is not put in the uncomfortable position of having to see material and then having to discount it at a later stage of the proceedings.",
                "Again without purporting to lay down specific procedures to be applied by domestic courts, we would refer to the system in the immigration context (see Rule 7 (7) of the Special Immigration Appeals Act Commission (Procedure) Rules 1998, set out at paragraph 36 of the judgment ). Under these arrangements, a “special counsel” is permitted to have sight of the sensitive material, after which he or she is permitted further communication with the defence only with the leave of the court.",
                "These examples show that legitimate concerns about confidentiality can be accommodated at the same time as according the individual a substantial measure of procedural justice.",
                "We conclude, therefore, that the decision-making procedure in the present case did not sufficiently comply with the principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms, nor did it incorporate adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the accused. It follows that in our opinion there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 in the present case.",
                "Dissenting opinion of Judge Zupančič",
                "In my opinion this case is the tip of a much larger iceberg than imagined either by majority or by other dissenters. Non-disclosure, that is, secrecy concerning some aspects of prosecution's case, is of course a problem in itself. However, compared to the preponderantly inquisitorial Continental systems of criminal procedure in which the ex officio investigation used to be entirely secret, the partial non-disclosure in an adversarial system cannot be seen as a breach of a fundamental procedural standard. Still, for me this is not a minor technical consideration because it affects the whole philosophy of criminal procedure. I have written about that in an article entitled The Crown and the Criminal: The Privilege against Self-Incrimination -- Towards the General Principles of Criminal Procedure, Nottingham Law Journal, Vol. 5, pp. 32-119 (1996).",
                "Here I should like to raise a preliminary issue which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been considered by the national courts. For the State to acquire the right to intrude on someone' s privacy there must be probable cause, that is, a suspicion sufficiently fortified by specific, articulable and antecedent evidence to be called reasonable. Clearly, if the citizen is to have the right to be left alone by the Government any exception to this must be justified in advance of the intrusion itself. The ex post facto discovery of tons of cannabis cannot justify the previous breach of the fundamental human right to be left alone. Further, such antecedent evidence must not be tainted by violations of someone's constitutional and human rights. If it is, it (and all evidence which would not be obtained were it not for the breach) should be subject to exclusionary rule.",
                "It is permissible to speculate in this case that there was telephone interception leading to arrest. The legitimacy of this intrusion into privacy has never been subject to adversarial scrutiny as regards the issue of privacy nor regarding the question whether it in fact crossed the threshold of probable cause. Unless it did, the question remains open as to the legitimacy of subsequent arrest and search leading to ultimate conviction.",
                "The non-disclosure of these preliminary procedures of course precludes the proper examination of the basic probable cause safeguard.",
                "Dissenting Opinion of Judge Hedigan",
                "I regret that I cannot agree with the majority in this case. I agree with the dissenting opinion of Judges Palm, Fischbach, Vajić, Thomassen, Tsatsa ‑ Nikolovska and Traja save only that I do not consider that as a general rule applications to withhold evidence need to be made to a Judge other than the trial Judge. In so far as their dissenting opinion might suggest this, I would disagree.",
                "My point of departure is to be found in the judgment of the Court in Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands 23/04/97 Reports 1997-III § 58 where it held; “having regard to the place that the right to a fair administration of justice holds in a democratic society, any measures restricting the rights of the defence should be strictly necessary. If a less restrictive measure can suffice then that measure should be applied.”",
                "It follows that, if it can be shown that there is a viable alternative way of proceeding which is less restrictive of an applicant's right to a fair trial and to proceedings adversarial in character, it should be taken. In my opinion, where the applicant can establish on a prima facie basis that such an alternative way exists, the onus shifts to the respondent to show why it cannot use or adapt such a way.",
                "In this case, the prosecution withheld relevant information from the defence. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that any failure to disclose relevant evidence undermined the right to a fair trial. It was, however, conceded that the right to full disclosure was not absolute, and could, in pursuit of a legitimate aim such as protection of national security or of vulnerable witnesses or sources of information, be subject to limitations.",
                "It was agreed by the applicants and the Government that any such restrictions must be counter balanced by sufficient safeguards to protect the rights of the accused. Under present U.K. law this is provided for by the requirement that it is the trial judge should decide whether the evidence in question be disclosed.",
                "There are three ways in which this may occur:",
                "a) An application by the prosecution on notice to the accused indicating at least the category of the material which they hold. The defence then have the opportunity to make representations to the Court.",
                "b) Where disclosure of the category itself would 'let the cat out of the bag' the prosecution should notify the defence that an application to the Court is to be made but the category would not be disclosed and the application would be ex parte.",
                "c) The third procedure is where, to reveal even the fact that an ex parte application would be made, would be to reveal the nature of the evidence; in such cases the application should be made ex parte without notice to the defence."

While the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination are primarily designed to protect against improper compulsion by the authorities and the obtaining of evidence through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused, the scope of the right is not confined to cases where duress has been brought to bear on the accused or where the will of the accused has been directly overborne in some way. The right, which the Court has previously observed is at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure, serves in principle to protect the freedom of a suspected person to choose whether to speak or to remain silent when questioned by the police. Such freedom of choice is effectively undermined in a case in which, the suspect having elected to remain silent during questioning, the authorities use subterfuge to elicit, from the suspect, confessions or other statements of an incriminatory nature, which they were unable to obtain during such questioning and where the confessions or statements thereby obtained are adduced in evidence at trial."

The judge concluded that there was evidence on the tapes from which the jury could infer that the applicant was involved in the events of 3 February 1995, and it was not so unreliable that it could not be left to the jury to assess for themselves. The judge also rejected the applicant's counsel's arguments under sections 76 and 78 of PACE that the evidence from H. was obtained by oppression or by such impropriety as to render it inadmissible. He considered that the use of an informant to talk and listen to the accused over a substantial period of time did not result in any unfairness to the accused. The fact that H. might be considered as having much to gain in giving evidence was also a matter to be left to the jury in their assessment of the reliability of his evidence. The evidence was accordingly admitted before the jury. The judge's ruling on the admissibility of the evidence was given on 26 January 1998, after a voir dire (submissions on a point of law in the absence of a jury) and consisted of a judgment of eighteen pages."

You have the tape recordings of the conversations on 28 June when H. had been wired up, between [the applicant] and H., and you have the transcripts of the conversations between H. and the police. I suggest ... that you approach the evidence of H. with the very greatest caution and care. He is a professional criminal. He behaved, and has behaved as he acknowledged, dishonestly and criminally for years. He saw the likelihood of advantage to himself, both in terms of bail and in the sentence that he was likely to receive. You have heard that he has not yet been sentenced on matters for which he was in custody in early 1995. The defence say if you consider the whole picture you simply cannot rely upon H.; quite unsafe to do so. The prosecution say the contents of the tapes of 28 June can be relied on and are consistent with what H. says [the applicant] had said to him previously, before he, H., was wired up. Of course tapes of ... conversations cannot possibly constitute any independent confirmation of what H. says about what [the applicant] had said to him previously, because, and you will understand the logic of that, the information is all coming from one source, namely H. and the witness cannot strengthen his own evidence essentially by repetition.",

There was no basis for holding that the exercise of his discretion had been so flawed that the Court of Appeal should intervene. In so far as the applicant complained that the judge should have warned the jury not to take into account the applicant's failure to answer police questioning in the light of the police strategy to “spook” him, Lord Justice Rose found that the judge had given an entirely appropriate direction to the jury in the circumstances of the case."

The Supreme Court held that the statements of the undercover officer should have been excluded at trial. McLachlin J said, inter alia :",

However, in the absence of eliciting behaviour on the part of the police, there is no violation of the accused's right to choose whether or not to speak to the police. If the suspect speaks, it is by his or her own choice, and he or she must be taken to have accepted the risk that the recipient may inform the police.”"

He had spoken to a lawyer who had advised him to remain silent. The police arranged for a friend to visit B. in custody while carrying a body-pack recording device. The friend questioned B. about his involvement in the murder and in the words of the Supreme Court “sought to exploit the [accused's] trust in him as a friend to undermine the [accused's] confidence in his lawyer's advice to remain silent and to create a mental state in which the [accused] was more likely to talk”. The Supreme Court held that it was wrong to admit the evidence obtained by the friend that the accused knew the time of the deceased's death. According to the headnote of the reported case:",

The right protects against the use of State power to subvert the right of an accused to choose whether or not to speak to the authorities. Where the informer who allegedly acted to subvert the right to silence of the accused is not obviously a State agent, the analysis must focus on both the relationship between the informer and the State and the relationship between the informer and the accused. The right to silence will only be infringed where the informer was acting as an agent of the State at the time the accused made the statement and where it was the informer who caused the accused to make the statement. Accordingly two distinct inquiries are required. First ... was the evidence obtained by an agent of the State? Second, was the evidence elicited? The right to silence ... will be violated only if both questions are answered in the affirmative.",

The conversation here would not have occurred or would have been materially different but for the authorities' intervention. Furthermore, the impugned statement was elicited. Parts of the conversation were functionally the equivalent of an interrogation and the appellant's trust in the informer as a friend was used to undermine the appellant's confidence in his lawyer's advice to remain silent and to create a mental state in which the appellant was more likely to talk.”"

They got my fingerprints on the dope.” The accused replied: “Lee and me too.” The Supreme Court found nothing to suggest that the exchange was the functional equivalent of an interrogation. It was of no consequence that the police officer was engaged in a subterfuge, permitted himself to be misidentified or lied, so long as the responses were not actively elicited or the result of interrogation. In this case the conversation had been initiated by the accused and the police officer picked up the flow and content of the conversation without directing or redirecting it in a sensitive area.

An undercover officer held a conversation with the accused pretending that his own brother-in-law was suspected of arson and the accused made admissions of his own involvement in a fire. The High Court of Australia found that the admissions should not have been admitted at trial as they had been elicited by a police officer in clear breach of the accused's right to choose whether or not to speak. The accused Pavic had been questioned by the police about a disappeared person and remained silent. After his release from custody, Pavic made incriminatory statements to a friend called C., who had been fitted with a listening device by the police. The High Court found that there was no impropriety involved and the admissions were reliable and should be admitted. C. had not been a police officer or a person in authority over Pavic. The fact that C. was regarded as trustworthy by Pavic was an indicator of the reliability of the admissions; a serious crime had been committed and there was no public interest to be served by rejecting the admissions.

The critical question is not whether the accused has been tricked and secretly recorded. It is not even whether the trick has resulted in self-incrimination, electronically preserved to do great damage to the accused at trial. It is whether the trick may be thought to involve such unfairness to the accused or otherwise to be so contrary to public policy that a court should exercise its discretion to exclude the evidence notwithstanding its high probative value. In the case of covertly obtained confessions, the line of forbidden conduct will be crossed if the confession may be said to have been elicited by police (or by a person acting as an agent of the police) in unfair derogation of the suspect's right to exercise a free choice to speak or to be silent.”",

In particular, on 28 June 1995 the applicant was removed from prison to a police station and interrogated for a day as a “softening-up” process prior to his being questioned by H.

Furthermore, the tapes were not the only evidence against the applicant and the jury were made fully aware of any possible deficiencies in this evidence. There was no basis on which to distinguish this case from Khan, as in that case no violation was found despite the fact that the recording involved trespass and the evidence obtained was the only evidence against the applicant, whereas in this case the surveillance was lawful under domestic law and the recordings were not the only evidence against the applicant, as there was also the evidence put forward by H.

Finally, the Government disputed the relevance of the Canadian cases cited by the applicant, noting that the Hebert case concerned the use of evidence actively elicited by an undercover agent (not covert audio- or video-recordings) and which was the only evidence against the accused, while in Broyles the information given by the accused to his visitor was obtained in the functional equivalent of an interrogation and the accused's special trust in his friend exploited."

The Court reiterates that its duty, according to Article 19 of the Convention, is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting States to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is therefore primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see Schenk v. Switzerland, judgment of 12 July 1988, Series A no. 140, p. 29, §§ 45-46, and, for a more recent example in a different context, Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decision 1998-IV, p. 1462, § 34). It is not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence – for example, unlawfully obtained evidence – may be admissible or, indeed, whether the applicant was guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair.

                "44. As regards the privilege against self-incrimination or the right to silence, the Court has reiterated that these are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of a fair procedure. Their aim is to provide an accused person with protection against improper compulsion by the authorities and thus to avoid miscarriages of justice and secure the aims of Article 6 (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports 1996-I, p. 49, § 45). The right not to incriminate oneself is primarily concerned with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent and presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seeks to prove the case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Saunders v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2064, §§ 68-69). In examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court will examine the nature and degree of the compulsion, the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures and the use to which any material so obtained is put (see, for example, Heaney and McGuinness v. Ireland, no. 34720/97, §§ 54-55, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and J.B. v. Switzerland, no. 31827/96, ECHR 2001-III).",

As the applicant alleged that he knew of the possible recording and as the tapes indicated that a certain amount of whispering or gesturing was being carried out at times, the Court considers that an assessment of the strength or the reliability of the evidence concerned is not a straightforward matter. The applicant's conduct as a whole must have played a role in the assessment of the evidence and this Court is not well-placed to express a view.

This decision was reviewed on appeal by the Court of Appeal which found that the judge had taken into account all the relevant factors and that his ruling could not be faulted. At each step of the procedure, the applicant had therefore been given an opportunity to challenge the reliability and significance of the recording evidence.

The right, which the Court has previously observed is at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure, serves in principle to protect the freedom of a suspected person to choose whether to speak or to remain silent when questioned by the police. Such freedom of choice is effectively undermined in a case in which, the suspect having elected to remain silent during questioning, the authorities use subterfuge to elicit, from the suspect, confessions or other statements of an incriminatory nature, which they were unable to obtain during such questioning and where the confessions or statements thereby obtained are adduced in evidence at trial."

There, the Canadian Supreme Court expressed the view that, where the informer who allegedly acted to subvert the right to silence of the accused was not obviously a State agent, the analysis should focus on both the relationship between the informer and the State and the relationship between the informer and the accused: the right to silence would only be infringed where the informer was acting as an agent of the State at the time the accused made the statement and where it was the informer who caused the accused to make the statement. Whether an informer was to be regarded as a State agent depended on whether the exchange between the accused and the informer would have taken place, and in the form and manner in which it did, but for the intervention of the authorities. Whether the evidence in question was to be regarded as having been elicited by the informer depended on whether the conversation between him and the accused was the functional equivalent of an interrogation, as well as on the nature of the relationship between the informer and the accused."

In the present case, the Court notes that in his interviews with the police following his arrest the applicant had, on the advice of his solicitor, consistently availed himself of his right to silence. H., who was a long-standing police informer, was placed in the applicant's cell in Stretford police station and later at the same prison for the specific purpose of eliciting from the applicant information implicating him in the offences of which he was suspected. The evidence adduced at the applicant's trial showed that the police had coached H. and instructed him to “push him for what you can”. In contrast to the position in Khan, the admissions allegedly made by the applicant to H., and which formed the main or decisive evidence against him at trial, were not spontaneous and unprompted statements volunteered by the applicant, but were induced by the persistent questioning of H., who, at the instance of the police, channelled their conversations into discussions of the murder in circumstances which can be regarded as the functional equivalent of interrogation, without any of the safeguards which would attach to a formal police interview, including the attendance of a solicitor and the issuing of the usual caution. While it is true that there was no special relationship between the applicant and H. and that no factors of direct coercion have been identified, the Court considers that the applicant would have been subjected to psychological pressures which impinged on the “ voluntariness ” of the disclosures allegedly made by the applicant to H.: he was a suspect in a murder case, in detention and under direct pressure from the police in interrogations about the murder, and would have been susceptible to persuasion to take H., with whom he shared a cell for some weeks, into his confidence. In those circumstances, the information gained by the use of H. in this way may be regarded as having been obtained in defiance of the will of the applicant and its use at trial impinged on the applicant's right to silence and privilege against self-incrimination."

The relevant finding in the Milinienė case reads as follows :",

To the extent that SŠ had police backing to offer the applicant considerable financial inducements and was given technical equipment to record their conversations, it is clear that the police influenced the course of events. However, the Court does not find that police role to have been abusive, given their obligation to verify criminal complaints and the importance of thwarting the corrosive effect of judicial corruption on the rule of law in a democratic society. Nor does it find that the police role was the determinative factor. The determinative factor was the conduct of SŠ and the applicant. To this extent, the Court accepts that, on balance, the police may be said to have ‘ joined ’ the criminal activity rather than to have initiated it. Their actions thus remained within the bounds of undercover work rather than that of agents provocateurs in possible breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention .. .”"

The applicant then offered to supply them himself. As the transaction progressed, the applicant was offered a significant sum of money – USD 3,000 – to supply a large amount of narcotics. This obviously represented an inducement to produce the goods. The first instance court recognised the determinative part played by the police ... These elements in the present case, in the Court ’ s view, extended the police ’ s role beyond that of undercover agents to that of ‘ agents provocateurs ’. They did not merely ‘ join ’ an on-going offence; they instigated it. The necessary inference from these circumstances is that the police did not confine themselves to investigating the applicant ’ s criminal activity in an essentially passive manner, but exercised an influence such as to incite the commission of the offence ... ”"

When drawing the line between legitimate infiltration by an undercover agent and instigation of a crime the Court will examine the question whether the applicant was subjected to pressure to commit the offence. It has found the abandonment of a passive attitude by the investigating authorities to be associated with such conduct as taking the initiative in contacting the applicant, renewing the offer despite his initial refusal, insistent prompting, raising the price beyond average ( see, among other cases, Malininas, cited above, § 37) or appealing to the applicant ’ s compassion by mentioning withdrawal symptoms ( see Vanyan, cited above, § § 11 and 49 ).

In practice, the authorities may be prevented from discharging this burden by the absence of formal authorisation and supervision of the undercover operation. In this context, in the case of Teixeira de Castro (cited above, § 38) the Court found that the undercover agent ’ s activity was not part of an operation ordered and supervised by a judge, distinguishing it on this ground from the case of Lüdi ( cited above ), where the police officer concerned had been sworn in, the investigating judge had been aware of his task and a preliminary investigation had been opened."

The procedure in the cases in question consisted of the following. The public - interest immunity material was made available to the trial judge in the ex parte procedure, and the judge would decide whether any of the confidential material would assist the defence, in particular to argue the point of entrapment, in which case it would be obliged to order its disclosure. The Court found, in particular, that the issue of entrapment, if determined by the trial judge who also decided upon the guilt or innocence of the accused, was too closely related to the essence of criminal charges to exclude the defence from full knowledge of all material to which the prosecution had access (ibid.). Subsequently, the Court examined (in the context primarily of Article 5 § 4, but also of Article 6) the possibility of using special advocates to counterbalance the procedural unfairness caused by lack of full disclosure in national - security cases but also found such an approach to be capable of upsetting equality of arms, depending on the importance of the undisclosed material to the outcome of the trial ( see A. and Others, cited above, § § 205 et seq.)."

As follows from the general principles set out above, the first question to be examined by the Court when confronted with a plea of entrapment is whether the State agents carrying out the undercover activity remained within the limits of “essentially passive” behaviour or went beyond them, acting as agents provocateurs. In addressing this question, the Court will apply the substantive test of incitement set out in paragraphs 37 - 50 above; its ability to make a substantive finding on this point will depend, however, on whether or not the case file contains sufficient information on the undercover activities preceding the offence, in particular the details of encounters between the State agents and the applicant before the test purchase. If the substantive test is inconclusive owing to the lack of information in the file, the Court will proceed to the second step of its examination, whereby it will assess the procedure by which the plea of incitement was determined by the domestic courts in the light of the criteria set out in paragraphs 51 - 65 above."

Turning to arguments adduced in the present case as regards the substantive test, the Court observes that the parties disagreed as to whether the FSB had carried out the investigation in the applicant ’ s case in an essentially passive manner. In particular, they differed as to the role of the undercover agent in the applicant ’ s sale of cannabis in connection with the test purchase and the applicant ’ s previous involvement in trading drugs before that agent ’ s intervention."

                "69. The Court observes that the applicant began to arrange the sale in question in September 2004, allegedly through a certain Vladimir, who requested her to sell him large quantities of cannabis and harassed her into that deal. Until 28 January 2005 the applicant was preparing the sale, acting as an intermediary between S., the supplier, and Vladimir. According to the applicant ’ s own testimonies in court, her first encounter with the FSB undercover agent B. took place on 29 January 2005, immediately before the test purchase. By that stage the FSB already possessed recordings of her conversations with S., which had taken place between 23 and 27 January 2005, concerning the ongoing drug sale. It follows from that account that the FSB agent B. stepped into the transaction when it was already under way. Therefore, as far as B. ’ s role is concerned, it is beyond doubt that he merely “joined in ” the criminal acts rather than instigated them."

In so far as the applicant could be understood as claiming that Vladimir had also acted on the instructions of the FSB, the Court is unable to see any indication of such a link on the basis of the case file. It observes that the materials in its possession contain no account of the initial phase of the transaction other than that given by the applicant at the trial. It cannot therefore determine with certainty whether Vladimir ’ s alleged involvement was part of the undercover operation, and if so, whether he exerted pressure on the applicant to commit the offence at issue."

However, even assuming that the Moscow City Court endorsed the prosecutor ’ s argument pertaining to the presence of classified information in the case file as raised during the hearing on 25 December 2001 (see paragraph 22 above), the Court does not concur with the Government ’ s submission that the mere presence of such information in a case file automatically implies a need to close a trial to the public, without balancing openness with national security concerns. The Court observes that it may be important for a State to preserve its secrets, but it is of infinitely greater importance to surround justice with all the requisite safeguards, of which one of the most indispensable is publicity. Before excluding the public from criminal proceedings, courts must make specific findings that closure is necessary to protect a compelling governmental interest and limit secrecy to the extent necessary to preserve such an interest (see, mutatis mutandis, Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, § 149, 29 November 2007, and Moser v. Austria, no. 1 2643/02, §§ 96-97, 21 September 2006 )."

The section of its Report to the Russian Government (CPT/Inf (2003) 30) dealing with the conditions of detention in temporary holding facilities and remand establishments and the complaints procedure read as follows:",

According to the 1996 Regulations establishing the internal rules of Internal Affairs temporary holding facilities for suspects and accused persons, the living space per person should be 4 m². It is also provided in these regulations that detained persons should be supplied with mattresses and bedding, soap, toilet paper, newspapers, games, food, etc. Further, the regulations make provision for outdoor exercise of at least one hour per day.",

                "45. It should be stressed at the outset that the CPT was pleased to note the progress being made on an issue of great concern for the Russian penitentiary system: overcrowding.",
                "When the CPT first visited the Russian Federation in November 1998, overcrowding was identified as the most important and urgent challenge facing the prison system. At the beginning of the 2001 visit, the delegation was informed that the remand prison population had decreased by 30,000 since 1 January 2000. An example of that trend was SIZO No 1 in Vladivostok, which had registered a 30% decrease in the remand prison population over a period of three years.",
                "The CPT welcomes the measures taken in recent years by the Russian authorities to address the problem of overcrowding, including instructions issued by the Prosecutor General ’ s Office, aimed at a more selective use of the preventive measure of remand in custody. Nevertheless, the information gathered by the Committee ’ s delegation shows that much remains to be done. In particular, overcrowding is still rampant and regime activities are underdeveloped. In this respect, the CPT reiterates the recommendations made in its previous reports (cf. paragraphs 25 and 30 of the report on the 1998 visit, CPT (99) 26; paragraphs 48 and 50 of the report on the 1999 visit, CPT (2000) 7; paragraph 52 of the report on the 2000 visit, CPT (2001) 2).",
                "125. As during previous visits, many prisoners expressed scepticism about the operation of the complaints procedure. In particular, the view was expressed that it was not possible to complain in a confidential manner to an outside authority. In fact, all complaints, regardless of the addressee, were registered by staff in a special book which also contained references to the nature of the complaint. At Colony No 8, the supervising prosecutor indicated that, during his inspections, he was usually accompanied by senior staff members and prisoners would normally not request to meet him in private “because they know that all complaints usually pass through the colony ’ s administration”.",
                "In the light of the above, the CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Russian authorities review the application of complaints procedures, with a view to ensuring that they are operating effectively. If necessary, the existing arrangements should be modified in order to guarantee that prisoners can make complaints to outside bodies on a truly confidential basis. ”",

The Government did not argue that they were not in possession of any documents showing the names and exact number of inmates in the cells in which the applicant had been detained.

The Court observes at the outset that the applicant complained about the conditions of his detention in two different detention facilities during two separate periods of his detention. The Court notes that a part of the applicant ’ s complaint refers to a period of detention which ended more than six months before he lodged the application with the Court on 17 August 2003. The most recent period of detention that the Court may examine commenced on 19 April 2002 when the applicant was re-detained and placed in facility no. IZ-77/3 in Moscow. That period of detention represented a continuous situation which ended on 11 April 2003 when the applicant was transferred to a correctional colony, that is within the six months preceding the lodging of the application. The Court therefore considers that the part of the applicant ’ s complaints concerning the conditions of his detention before 19 April 2002 has been introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention (see Testa v. Croatia, no. 20877/04, § 37, 12 July 2007, and Bragadireanu v. Romania, no. 22088/04, § 80, 6 December 2007 )."

The main characteristic which the parties did agree upon was the size of the cells. However, the applicant claimed that the cell population severely exceeded their design capacity. The Government argued that the applicant had been detained with two other inmates in the smaller cell and with fifteen to twenty inmates in the bigger cells."

The Court notes that the Government, in their plea concerning the number of detainees, cited statements by the facility ’ s director indicating the number of the applicant ’ s fellow inmates (see paragraph 31 above) and, without giving any explanation, furnished documents certifying the destruction of certain registration logs in the detention facility (see paragraph 48 above). In this respect, assuming that the facility ’ s registration logs had been destroyed, the Court considers it extraordinary that in June 2006, that is more than three years after the applicant ’ s detention in that facility had come to an end, the director was able to recollect the exact number of inmates who had been detained together with the applicant. The director ’ s certificates are therefore of little evidential value for the Court. However, if the registration logs still exist, the Court finds it peculiar that the Government preferred to rely on the director ’ s certificates to support their allegations concerning the conditions of the applicant ’ s detention when it was open to them to submit copies of registration logs showing the names of inmates detained with the applicant."

In this connection, the Court reiterates that Convention proceedings, such as those arising from the present application, do not in all cases lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation), as in certain instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting allegations. A failure on a Government ’ s part to submit such information without a satisfactory explanation may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant ’ s allegations (see Ahmet Özkan and Others v.

Irrespective of the reasons for the overcrowding, the Court reiterates that it is incumbent on the respondent Government to organise its penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of financial or logistical difficulties (see Mamedova v.

More specifically, the Court reiterates that it has recently found a violation of Article 3 on account of an applicant ’ s detention in overcrowded conditions in the same detention facility and at the same time (see Igor Ivanov v. Russia, no. 34000/02, §§ 16-18 and §§ 30-41, 7 June 2007, and Sudarkov v. Russia, no. 3130/03, §§ 20-22 and §§ 40-51, 10 July 2008 )."

Having regard to its case-law on the subject and the material submitted by the parties, the Court notes that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Although in the present case there is no indication that there was a positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant, the Court finds that the fact that the applicant was obliged to live, sleep and use the toilet in the same cell as so many other inmates for almost a year was itself sufficient to cause distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention, and to arouse in him feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him."

Furthermore, while in the present case it cannot be established “beyond reasonable doubt” that the ventilation, heating, lighting or sanitary conditions in the facilities were unacceptable from the standpoint of Article 3, the Court nonetheless notes that the cell windows had been covered with metal shutters blocking access to fresh air and natural light. They were removed some time towards the end of 2002, that is more than seven months after the applicant ’ s detention in that facility had begun. In addition, the Court observes that the applicant was diagnosed with a serious skin disease in the facility and that it appears most likely that he was infected while in detention. Although this fact in itself does not imply a violation of Article 3 given, in particular, the fact that the applicant received treatment (see Alver v. Estonia, no. 64812/01, § 54, 8 November 2005, and Igor Ivanov, cited above, § 40) and that he fully recovered, the Court considers that these aspects, while not in themselves capable of justifying the notion of “ degrading ” treatment, are relevant in addition to the focal factor of the severe overcrowding, to show that the applicant ’ s detention conditions went beyond the threshold tolerated by Article 3 of the Convention (see Novoselov v. Russia, no. 66460/01, § 44, 2 June 2005)."

Thus, it may on occasion be necessary under Article 6 to limit the open and public nature of proceedings in order, for example, to protect the safety or privacy of witnesses, or to promote the free exchange of information and opinion in the pursuit of justice (see B. and P. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 36337/97 and 35974/97, § 37, ECHR 2001-III, with further references)."

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the Government suggested that two of the exceptions referred to in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention applied in the present case. In particular, they argued that national security concerns and the interests of victims and witnesses had justified dispensing with public hearings."

                "82. As regards the first ground, the Court reiterates that on 17 September and 25 December 2001 the City Court gave decisions ordering trial in camera. The first decision did not contain any reasoning (see paragraph 19 above) and the second only cited the need to protect the safety of the victims and witnesses (see paragraph 22 above). Furthermore, in its appeal decision of 26 February 2003 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, while dealing with the applicant ’ s complaint about trial in camera, did not mention the national security considerations as a justification for not allowing the public to attend. The Court is, therefore, not convinced that the national security concerns served as a basis for the decision to exclude the public from the trial."

However, even assuming that the Moscow City Court endorsed the prosecutor ’ s argument pertaining to the presence of classified information in the case file as raised during the hearing on 25 December 2001 (see paragraph 22 above), the Court does not concur with the Government ’ s submission that the mere presence of such information in a case file automatically implies a need to close a trial to the public, without balancing openness with national security concerns. The Court observes that it may be important for a State to preserve its secrets, but it is of infinitely greater importance to surround justice with all the requisite safeguards, of which one of the most indispensable is publicity. Before excluding the public from criminal proceedings, courts must make specific findings that closure is necessary to protect a compelling governmental interest and limit secrecy to the extent necessary to preserve such an interest (see, mutatis mutandis, Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, § 149, 29 November 2007, and Moser v. Austria, no. 1 2643/02, §§ 96-97, 21 September 2006 )."

                "84. There is no evidence to suggest that either of the two conditions was satisfied in the present case. The Court has already found that the Moscow City Court did not elaborate on the reasons for holding the trial in camera. It did not even indicate what documents in the case file, if any, were considered to contain State secrets or how they were related to the nature and character of the charges against the applicant. The Court further observes that the City Court did not take any measures to counterbalance the detrimental effect that the decision to hold the applicant ’ s trial in camera must have had on public confidence in the proper administration of justice for the sake of protecting the State ’ s interest in keeping its secrets. The Government did not argue – and there is no indication to the contrary in the documents submitted by the parties – that it was not open to the City Court to hold the trial publicly subject to clearing the courtroom for a single or, if need be, a number of secret sessions to read out classified documents. The Court therefore finds it striking that in such a situation the Moscow City Court preferred to close the entire trial to the public."

                "85. The Court further looks at the Government ’ s second argument to the effect that the exclusion of the public was necessary in the interests of justice, in particular, for the safety of the victims and witnesses. The Court observes that the need to protect the safety of victims and witnesses through the exclusion of the public from the trial was first mentioned by the Moscow City Court in its decision of 25 December 2001. The reasons given by the Moscow City Court for holding the hearing in camera were “ to guarantee security to the victims, witnesses and other parties to the proceedings, taking into account the character of the charges ”. The Court considers these reasons to be regrettably laconic. It would have been preferable to have expanded this element to explain in more detail why the City Court was worried about the vulnerability of certain victims and witnesses or whether and why it was concerned that witnesses and victims could have been deterred. It was also important to explain why the concern for the safety of victims and witnesses outweighed the importance of ensuring the publicity of the trial. Moreover, if the trial court had indeed taken into account certain information, this should have been presented to the parties, in particular the applicant, so that an open discussion of the matter could have occurred (see Volkov v. Russia, no. 64056/00, § 31, 4 December 2007)."

                "86. At the same time the Court is not convinced that the Moscow City Court had in its possession specific information showing that the applicant or his co-defendants posed a serious risk of real and substantial danger to other parties to the proceedings or that their conduct could have prejudiced a fair trial. The Court notes that the Government submitted no documents to show what information had served as a basis for the City Court ’ s decision. Furthermore, as can be seen from the court hearing record, the need to guarantee the victims ’ and witnesses ’ safety was not even mentioned by the prosecutor in his objection to the applicant ’ s request to open the trial to the public (see paragraph 22 above). It appears that the Moscow City Court concluded that there was a risk to the victims ’ and witnesses ’ safety merely on the ground of the gravity of the charges against the defendants. In this respect, the Court notes that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify the restriction of such a fundamental tenet of judicial proceedings as their openness to the public. This is particularly true in cases such as the present one where the legal characterisation of the facts was determined by the prosecution without judicial examination of the issue whether the evidence that had been obtained supported a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the alleged offence. The Court observes that a danger which defendants may present to other parties to the proceedings cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the gravity of the charges and severity of the sentence faced. It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may confirm the existence of a danger justifying the denial of public access to a trial. In the present case the decisions of the domestic courts gave no reasons why they considered the risk to the victims ’ and witnesses ’ safety to be decisive. Consequently, the Court finds that dispensing with a public hearing was not justified in the circumstances of the present case."

The Court lastly observes – and the Government did not argue to the contrary – that the appeal hearing before the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation was also not open to the public.

                "All democratic countries have granted the members of their legislative assemblies certain privileges and immunities in order to allow them to perform their legislative tasks properly. Quite evidently, the aim of granting the members of legislative assemblies a different status from that enjoyed by other citizens is not to make them a privileged group who are above the law.",

                "Even though Article 83 of the Constitution is entitled ‘ Parliamentary Immunity ’, it actually establishes two institutions: parliamentary non-liability and parliamentary immunity. The first paragraph of the Article explains that the members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey are not liable for their votes and statements in the course of the Assembly ’ s work, for the views they express before the Assembly or, unless the Assembly decides otherwise on the proposal of the Speaker, for repeating or revealing these outside the Assembly.",
                "The second paragraph of the Article stipulates that a member who is alleged to have committed an offence before or after election may not be arrested, questioned, detained or tried unless the Assembly decides otherwise. The only cases where this provision does not apply are those where a member is caught in the act of committing a crime punishable by a heavy penalty, provided that proceedings were initiated before the election, and cases subject to Article 14 of the Constitution.",
                "Article 83 of the Constitution does not specify on what grounds immunity may be lifted, and the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly do not cover the subject. That does not mean that the legislature has a free hand in the matter. The rationale for immunity and the way in which it has developed over the years show that Parliament ’ s powers concerning the lifting of immunity are not absolute but limited. Furthermore, the fact that immunity has a place in the Constitution means that the rules and aims of immunity must be defined in the light of the rules and aims of the Constitution. There is no doubt that the intention, when immunity was provided for in Article 83, was to allow those responsible for legislative duties to carry them out in the knowledge that they were safely sheltered, and rightly so, from all worry and pressure. In other words, the aim of parliamentary immunity is to ensure that MPs are not prevented, even temporarily, from fulfilling their functions by arbitrary criminal proceedings. So the powers of the legislature in the matter are limited by the purpose for which immunity was institutionalised in the Constitution.",

Most European states recognise two categories of immunity for parliamentarians: firstly, the “ non-liability ” of parliamentarians in respect of judicial proceedings for opinions expressed and votes cast in the discharge of their parliamentary duties; secondly, their “ inviolability ” or “ immunity in the strict sense ”, shielding them from all arrest, detention or prosecution for offences unrelated to their parliamentary duties without the consent of the Chamber to which they belong. This comparative law study focuses on the latter aspect of parliamentary immunity ( see the Venice Commission ’ s Report on the regime of parliamentary immunity, 1996)."

The very nature of this aspect of immunity results in a wide array of legal approaches to its implementation. In some States there is no such institution (the Netherlands, San Marino). In others its scope is very limited. For example, in the United Kingdom inviolability covers civil matters only and MPs enjoy no particular protection in criminal matters and are treated like any other individual. In Ireland and Norway parliamentary inviolability serves to prevent MPs from being arrested during sessions or on their way to or from Parliament. It therefore affords them limited protection."

In certain cases MPs are protected from body searches, house searches and interception of their communications ( Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Switzerland ).

In France, for example, since the constitutional reform of 1995, the Chamber ’ s authorisation is no longer necessary for criminal proceedings to be brought, but only for detention, arrest and other judicial supervision measures. A similar change came about in Italy when Constitutional Law no. 3 of 29 October 1993 did away with the need for the prior authorisation of Parliament in order for criminal proceedings to be brought against an MP. In Romania, since the constitutional reform of 2003, senators may be placed under judicial investigation or criminal proceedings brought against them for acts not connected with votes cast or political opinions expressed in the course of their duties as senators."

In such cases the prior authorisation of the Chamber concerned is not required, but even this does not necessarily prevent Parliament from examining the matter and subsequently requesting the suspension of the proceedings or the custodial measures ( Georgia and Romania, for example ). In some countries the law excludes certain types of act from inviolability, or the criterion may be the severity of the penalty incurred ( the Portuguese Constitution excludes, in certain circumstances, deliberate offences punishable with imprisonment for over three years )."

The request is transmitted to the Speaker of the Parliament, either directly or in certain cases through another authority ( the Minister of Justice, the Prime Minister), then examined by a special or ad hoc parliamentary committee, which gives an opinion after hearing the MP concerned. It is then for the full Chamber to decide, with or without a debate, in private or in public, whether or not to lift immunity.

Thus, if immunity was to be lifted the accusation had to be genuine, serious and not politically motivated; public opinion had to have been affected by the criminal proceedings and it must have become necessary to lift the immunity in order to protect the honour and dignity of the MP concerned; and lastly, the accusation must not fall within the scope of the freedom of expression and opinion guaranteed by the first paragraph of Article 83 of the Constitution."

The procedure in question also appears to be subject to certain formalities which secure respect for the rights of the defence at every stage of the decision-making process and a right of appeal against the decisions taken by the relevant parliamentary bodies ( see paragraphs 31 and 32 above ). Indeed, in the present case the applicant had the possibility of exercising the rights thus guaranteed by filing an objection to the decisions to suspend the criminal proceedings against him ( see paragraphs 15, 22 and 27 above )."

                "101. As to the applicant ’ s arguments that the decision-making procedure lacked clarity, the Court points out that the machinery for implementing parliamentary liability by a decision to lift or not to lift immunity is one of the ways in which Parliament exercises its autonomy. The decisions taken in the matter by parliamentary bodies, which are political bodies by definition, are therefore political decisions by nature and not court decisions, so they cannot be expected to satisfy the same criteria as court decisions when it comes to giving reasons."

Furthermore, the lists submitted by the parties concerning the requests for the lifting of immunity pending before the 22nd Parliament and at the start of the 23rd Parliament ( see paragraphs 2 6 and 3 7 above ) show the existence of a constant trend in the practice of the parliamentary bodies concerned since the election of the 22 nd Parliament not to grant any request to lift an MP ’ s immunity. As this practice is applied without distinction both to members of the majority and to those of the opposition, Parliament ’ s decisions not to allow requests for the lifting of immunity are free of any personal considerations ( intuitus personae ), be it with regard to the personality of the interested party or to his political convictions. The procedure followed in the present case thus seems to have been devoid of any discriminatory or arbitrary character."

The Court notes, nevertheless, that the applicant also complains about the time taken to examine his requests to have his immunity lifted, which amounted in his opinion to an abuse of process and led to a denial of justice. It is worth noting here, in the light of both the provisions of domestic law and parliamentary practice in the matter, that while the examination of the requests by the relevant parliamentary committees is limited in time by predefined deadlines ( see paragraph 32 above), that is not the case once they have been transferred to the plenary Assembly."

                "104. In the instant case the Court cannot ignore the fact that the applicant has had criminal accusations hanging over him for over six years, and the situation could remain the same until he ceases to be an MP. There is therefore no denying that the uncertainty inherent in any criminal proceedings has been accentuated in this case by the impugned parliamentary procedure, as the delays it has caused have resulted in equivalent delays in the criminal proceedings."

However, while the Chamber found that such a delay was prejudicial to the applicant ( Chamber judgment, § 91), the Grand Chamber is unable to ignore the special nature of the applicant ’ s status and the specificity of the impugned procedure. The Grand Chamber considers that the connection between the MP ’ s parliamentary immunity and his status is a fundamental aspect of the matter at issue."
            ],
            [
                "106. It should be noted here that the criminal proceedings at the origin of the applicant ’ s complaint were brought against him before he stood for election to Parliament. As a lawyer he could not have been unaware of the consequences his election would have on the proceedings in question. In standing for election, then standing for a second term, he was aware that his special status would delay the outcome of the criminal proceedings against him. He also knew that because of his status he would not be able to waive his inviolability or have it lifted merely at his request ( see paragraph 32 above )."
            ],
            [
                "107. Having regard to the unusual complaint before it, in which immunity is perceived not as an advantage for the beneficiary but as a disadvantage linked to parliamentary office, the Court finds that the degree of prejudice suffered is also a factor to be taken into account in determining the impact of the delay, inherent in MP status, on the applicant ’ s right to have his case heard by a court. Examining that factor requires analysis of the context."
            ],
            [
                "108. In the present case the Court considers it important when assessing any prejudice suffered by the applicant to bear in mind that the impugned delay is the time taken by the parliamentary procedure for examining requests for the lifting of immunity and not the time taken to complete criminal proceedings as such. In the instant case there is no reason to consider that the applicant will not be able to have a fair trial when he ceases to be an MP. The parliamentary procedure does not appear to adversely affect that possibility in any way, particularly as it has no effect on the presumption of innocence to which all accused persons are entitled. Sight should not be lost here of the fact that the decisions taken by parliamentary bodies in this connection serve no penal or repressive purpose but are aimed in principle – as the lifting of immunity is generally refused – at protecting MPs rather than harming them."

                "109. In the present case, not only is the obstruction to criminal proceedings as a result of parliamentary inviolability only temporary, but in principle Parliament does not intervene at all in the course of justice as such. In this case, when examining the applicant ’ s request to lift his immunity Parliament seems only to have considered whether inviolability, as a temporary obstacle to judicial action, should be lifted immediately or whether it was preferable to wait until the end of the applicant ’ s term in Parliament. The effect was thus merely to suspend the course of justice, without influencing it or taking part in it."

As to the applicant ’ s allegations that the proceedings against him had tarnished his reputation, the Court points out that it is in the very nature of this form of prejudice to manifest itself as soon as an official accusation is lodged. In this case, however, there is no doubt in the Court ’ s mind that the applicant ’ s honour and reputation were protected by respect for the principle of the presumption of innocence."
            ],

                "111. In the light of the above, the Court considers that while the delay inherent in the parliamentary procedure did affect the applicant ’ s right to have his case heard by a court, in delaying the proceedings it did not, in the instant case, impair the very essence of that right. As it is limited in time and covered by special rules concerning, inter alia, the suspension of the running of time for the purposes of limitation, the impugned immunity merely constitutes a temporary procedural obstacle to the criminal proceedings, by no means depriving the applicant of the possibility of having his case tried on the merits."

                "112. With regard to the requirements of the rule of law, however, the type of immunity associated with the applicant ’ s status as an MP is valid only because of the legitimacy of the aims pursued, namely, to preserve the integrity of Parliament and protect the opposition. The Court acknowledges that the applicant ’ s inability in this case to waive his inviolability falls within the scope of the legitimate aims thus defined ( see paragraphs 90 and 91 above ). In that sense it accepts that individual renunciation by the applicant is no substitute for a decision of the National Assembly."

Lastly, as the right to obtain a judgment in respect of criminal accusations is not absolute, in particular when there is no fundamental irreversible detrimental effect on the parties, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the instant case the failure to lift the applicant ’ s parliamentary immunity did not impair his right to a court to a degree disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."

The 1945/1971 Act listed five such payments or services from which the procureur du Roi made his choice. The first consisted of paying over a certain sum of money which might, if appropriate, be greater than the maximum fine fixed by the Act. The procureur du Roi called on the person concerned to advise him within a given period whether he accepted the settlement proposed; full and punctual performance of the settlement barred criminal proceedings.",

It was nevertheless notified to the municipal authorities of the person ’ s place of residence; until a period of five years had expired, mention of it was included in the information extracts the municipalities supplied to the judicial authorities but not in the lists of convictions intended for other authorities.

It is true that the Government had not pleaded non-exhaustion on this point but it would have been difficult for them to do so in the circumstances; annulment was hypothetical at the time and did not occur until 31 May 1978, by which date the case had already been at the stage of deliberations for more than six months and reopening the hearings could scarcely have been envisaged (see paragraph 20 above and Appendix I to the Commission ’ s report).

However, there being no agreement - whether formal or otherwise - between the Government and the applicant or his heirs, it is not possible in the circumstances to talk of either a \"friendly settlement\" or an \"arrangement\" (see the Luedicke, Belkacem and Koç judgment of 28 November 1978, Series A no. 29, p. 15, par. 36). What remains to be determined is whether there exists any \"other fact of a kind to provide a solution of the matter\".",

On 14 February 1978, Mrs. Deweer and her three daughters advised the Commission \"of their material and moral interest in seeing completed the proceedings instituted by their husband and father\" (see paragraph 6 of the Commission ’ s report). The Government did not challenge this interest. The Court, for its part, wishes to mark its full approval of the practice which the Commission has been following in cases of this nature and which it has implicitly confirmed in the present instance: when an applicant dies during the course of proceedings, his heirs may in principle claim in their turn to be \"victims\" (Article 25 par. 1 of the Convention) (art. 25-1) of the alleged violation, as rightful successors and, in certain circumstances, on their own behalf (see application no. 4427/70, 24. 5. 1971, X v.

Like Mr. Deweer ’ s death ( 14 January 1978 ), it predated the adoption of the Commission ’ s report ( 5 October 1978 ) and is mentioned therein at paragraph 20 in fine. The Court has therefore had cognisance of the \"fact\" as from the moment when the case was referred to it ( 14 December 1978 ). However, Rule 47 par. 2, as is made clear by its text, is concerned with the Court being \"informed\" of something having a bearing on a case already pending before it. Furthermore and above all, the judgment by the Conseil d ’ État could at the very best have led to restitution of the 10,000 BF paid over by Mr. Deweer; it did not restore the right being claimed by him in the circumstances, namely the right to defend himself in criminal proceedings in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention.

In his letter of 30 September 1974, the procureur du Roi - while advising the applicant of the closure of his establishment - offered him a means of \"avoiding prosecution\", namely payment of the sum of 10,000 BF.

                "45. When seen in this light, the relevant provisions of the Belgian legislation (see paragraphs 12-15 above) prove to be enlightening. The source of the 1945/1971 Act is a Legislative Decree published during the Second World War, in the middle of a time of shortages, rationing and the \"black market\". Through a series of drastic measures, this Legislative Decree set on foot \"the repression of offences against rules relating to the country ’ s supplies\". The return to conditions of plenty has enabled its severity to be relaxed and its title to be changed, but even the existing text still carries the imprint of its origin. The wording employed bears witness to this. Thus, paragraphs 1 and 2 of section 11, the basis of the contested decisions by the Louvain procureur du Roi, utilise terms such as \"offender\" and \"offence\". In addition, anyone who contravenes a Decree passed in pursuance of Part I of the Act, as for instance the Decree of 9 August 1974, is liable to the penalties listed in section 9, that is to say imprisonment, fine, forfeitures, court ordered closure of premises and publicising of the judgment. The offer of settlement made on 30 September 1974 was in effect a substitute for at least certain of those penalties. Had the applicant rejected the offer, the accompanying decision of provisional closure would have come into operation, if need be until \"the date on which judgment [was] passed on the offence\" (section 11 par. 2); he would have risked imprisonment and a fine if he had disregarded the closure decision (sections 9 par. 5 (b) and 11 par. 2 read in conjunction).",
                "Similarly, the \"pro-justitia\" of 18 September 1974 described Mr. Deweer as being \"in breach\" (\"in overtreding\") of Articles 2 par. 4 and 3 par. 1 of the Decree of 9 August 1974 (see paragraph 8 above). In his decision of 30 September, the Louvain procureur du Roi also mentioned an \"offence\" (\"een inbreuk\"); although he judged it unnecessary to request imprisonment as punishment for the offence (\"dat geen hoofdgevangenisstraf dient gevorderd te worden ter beteugeling van gezegd misdrijf\"), the procureur du Roi stressed its \"gravity\" (\"de ernst\"). By letter of the same date, he drew the applicant ’ s especial attention to the \"heavy penalties\" (\"strenge straffen\") under the Act for failure to comply with the closure order (see paragraph 9 above).",
                "The closure order, as the Government have well shown, was made \"in the normal course of the criminal proceedings that had to be taken following the offence reported against Mr. Deweer\". The order was a prelude to \"criminal proceedings\" which the procureur du Roi contemplated instituting if the \"offender\" were to refuse a friendly settlement.",
                "In addition, the Government stressed the applicant ’ s alleged \"confession\" to the inspector, Mr. Vanderleyden, and the \"flagrant offence\" whose commission they claimed Mr. Deweer \"acknowledged on the spot\". In their view, in agreeing to \"pay the fine by way of settlement\" - \"a kind of compensation to the community for his reprehensible conduct\" - the applicant had admitted his \"guilt\", \"perhaps not explicitly but in substance\" (see page 34 of the verbatim record of the hearings of 9 December 1977 before the Commission).",
                "Although such a fine is not assimilated to a penalty, its payment had, in any event, to be mentioned in the information extracts supplied by municipalities for inclusion in criminal files (see paragraph 15 above)."

The \"charge\" could, for the purposes of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1), be defined as the official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence. In several decisions and opinions the Commission has adopted a test that appears to be fairly closely related, namely whether \"the situation of the [suspect] has been substantially affected\" ( Neumeister case, Series B no. 6, p. 81; case of Huber v. Austria, Yearbook of the Convention, vol. 18, p. 356, 67; case of Hätti v. Federal Republic of Germany, ibid., vol. 19, p. 1064, 50, etc.).

Before the trial court, the applicant would therefore have been entitled not only to rely, as he did before Mr. Vanderleyden, on his good faith or the additional costs incurred by a butcher buying on the hoof (see paragraph 8 above) but also to plead that the Decree of 9 August 1974 was contrary to the Constitution or incompatible with Community law (see paragraphs 19-20 above).

It is subject to implied limitations, two examples of which are given at paragraph 58 of the Commission ’ s report (decision not to prosecute and order for discontinuance of the proceedings); it is not the Court ’ s function, though, to elaborate a general theory of such limitations (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Golder judgment, pp. 18-19, par. 36 and 38-39).",
                "The current proceedings do not, however, concern a limitation of that nature. By paying the 10,000 BF which the Louvain procureur du Roi \"required\" by way of settlement (see paragraph 9 above), Mr. Deweer waived his right to have his case dealt with by a tribunal.",
                "In the Contracting States ’ domestic legal systems a waiver of this kind is frequently encountered both in civil matters, notably in the shape of arbitration clauses in contracts, and in criminal matters in the shape, inter alia, of fines paid by way of composition. The waiver, which has undeniable advantages for the individual concerned as well as for the administration of justice, does not in principle offend against the Convention; on this point the Court shares the view of the Commission (see paragraphs 55-56 of the report; decision of 5. 3. 1962, application no. 1197/61, X v. Republic of Germany, Yearbook of the Convention, vol. 5, pp. 94-96).",
                "Nevertheless, in a democratic society too great an importance attaches to the \"right to a court\" (see paragraph 44 above) for its benefit to be forfeited solely by reason of the fact that an individual is a party to a settlement reached in the course of a procedure ancillary to court proceedings. In an area concerning the public order ( ordre public) of the member States of the Council of Europe, any measure or decision alleged to be in breach of Article 6 (art. 6) calls for particularly careful review (see, for Article 5 (art. 5), the above-mentioned De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment, p. 36, par. 65). The Court is not unaware of the firmness with which the Belgian courts have condemned, on the basis of Article 8 of the Constitution and Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, failure to respect the \"right to a court\" in private legal relationships (see, for example, the Brussels Civil Court, 23. 11. 1967, Journal des Tribunaux 1967, p. 741; compare the Court of Cassation, 1. 6. 1966, with the final submissions of Advocate General Mahaux, Pasicrisie 1966, pp. 1249-1250 and 1251-1252). At least the same degree of vigilance would appear indispensable when someone formerly \"charged with a criminal offence\" challenges a settlement that has barred criminal proceedings. Absence of constraint is at all events one of the conditions to be satisfied; this much is dictated by an international instrument founded on freedom and the rule of law (see the above-mentioned Golder judgment, pp. 16-17, par. 34). Here again, the Court concurs with the Commission."

                "50. In paragraph 57 of its report, the Commission expressed the opinion that there was constraint in the present case : it considered that the applicant waived the guarantees of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1) only \"under the threat of [the] serious prejudice\" that the closure of his shop would have caused him."

                "51. (a) The Government ’ s first submission was as follows: the offer of settlement made to Mr. Deweer on 30 September 1974 amounted in law to no more than a \"proposal for a friendly settlement\" which he could quite well have rejected; \"in accepting the offer and acting upon it on 2 October\", the applicant, \"by paying a relatively modest sum, succeeded in avoiding the risk of receiving a sentence which might have been more severe than this fine paid by way of settlement\" and \"which might, if appropriate, have been accompanied by a court order for the closure of the establishment\" (section 9 par. 5 of the 1945/1971 Act; see paragraph 13 above).",
                "Furthermore, the Government maintained, the Commission ’ s reasoning is inconsistent. Whereas the procedure followed in the circumstances is stated at paragraph 57 of the report to be in breach of the Convention for the reason that it was tainted with constraint, paragraphs 55 and 59 contain the recognition that settlement of criminal cases is legitimate. In a sense, so the argument continued, that kind of settlement \"always takes place under some form of ‘ constraint ’ and under the ‘ threat ’ of more or less ‘ serious ’ prejudice\"; thus, criminal proceedings represent, \"for the majority of those\" against whom they are taken \"or likely to be taken, something to be feared\" and, in very many instances, \"a sufficiently serious ‘ threat ’ to encourage [them] ... to forgo\" the trial of their case by a court of law.",
                "(b) The Court points out that while the prospect of having to appear in court is certainly liable to prompt a willingness to compromise on the part of many persons \"charged with a criminal offence\", the pressure thereby brought to bear is in no way incompatible with the Convention: provided that the requirements of Articles 6 and 7 (art. 6, art. 7) are observed, the Convention in principle leaves the Contracting States free to designate and prosecute as a criminal offence conduct not constituting the normal exercise of one of the rights it protects (see the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, p. 34, par. 81).",
                "Moreover, the applicant was probably scarcely apprehensive about criminal prosecution since it was not unlikely that prosecution would result in an acquittal, perhaps proceeded by a request to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for a preliminary ruling (see paragraphs 19-20 above). The \"constraint\" complained of by the applicant was to be found in another quarter, namely in the closure order of 30 September 1974.",
                "This order was due to come into effect forty-eight hours after notification of the decision of the procureur du Roi and it could have remained in force until the date on which the competent court passed judgment on the offence (sections II par. 2 and 9 par. 5 (b) of the 1945/1971 Act; see paragraph 13 above). In the meantime, that is possibly during a period of months, the applicant would have been deprived of the income accruing from his trade; he would nonetheless have incurred the risk of having to continue to pay his staff and of not being able to resume business with all his former customers once his shop reopened (see pages 2, 7, 46, 47 and 49 of the verbatim record of the hearings of 9 December 1977 before the Commission; and the note of the hearings of 27 September 1979 - the reply given by the applicants ’ counsel to the Court ’ s third question). Mr. Deweer would have suffered considerable loss as a consequence.",
                "The Louvain procureur du Roi did admittedly offer Mr. Deweer a means of avoiding the danger, namely by paying 10,000 BF in \"friendly settlement\" (see paragraph 9 above). This solution certainly represented by far a lesser evil. As the Government rightly pointed out, the sum in question was only slightly above the minimum amount - 3,000 BF - of \"the fine laid down by law\", whereas under section 11 par. 1 of the 1945/1971 Act it could have been more than the maximum, namely 30,000,000 BF (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above). Accordingly, as the Delegates observed, there was a \"flagrant disproportion\" between the two alternatives facing the applicant. The \"relative moderation\" of the sum demanded in fact tells against the Government ’ s argument since it added to the pressure brought to bear by the closure order. The moderation rendered the pressure so compelling that it is not surprising that Mr. Deweer yielded."

            [
                "52. Pleading as to the merits and not as to admissibility (see paragraph 26 above), the Government put forward a second objection. They maintained that nothing prevented Mr. Deweer from refusing a \"friendly settlement\" and challenging the decision of the procureur du Roi by bringing \"an action tot recover damages for the loss suffered as a result of the closure of his establishment\", or \"the excessive length of such closure\", and by making an \"application for interim measures\" \"to have the closure suspended\" (see paragraph 44 of the Commission ’ s report).",
                "(a) On the latter point, the Government invoked Article 584 of the Belgian Judicial Code, a provision that could be applied in \"a wide variety of circumstances\" although up till now, they said, it would not appear to have been relied on in any comparable case : \"The President of the Court of First Instance shall, in respect of all matters except those which the law excludes from the jurisdiction of the courts of justice, give a provisional ruling in cases which he recognises as being urgent.\"",
                "The Delegates, for their part, did not believe that a \"provisional measure ordered by the prosecuting authorities\" could, in its turn, be the subject of another \"provisional measure\" decreed by a civil court with the object of countermanding the former measure, especially since in Belgium civil proceedings must await the outcome of criminal proceedings (\"le pénal tient le civil en état \").",
                "The Court shares the Delegates ’ scepticism and would add the following considerations to those which they advanced. As the Government themselves pointed out, \"an application for interim measures is normally accessory to a principal claim\" and, as is laid down by Article 1039 of the Judicial Code, \"orders for interim measures are made without prejudice to the merits\". However, the Court does not perceive which court having to deal with the \"merits\" of the case could have ordered discontinuance of the impugned closure by relying, for example, on the Constitution or the Convention. Whilst section 2 par. 5 of the 1945/1971 Act allows an appeal, having suspensive effect, against closure decisions issued by the Minister of Economic Affairs to be made to the judge in chambers at the Court of First Instance with jurisdiction in criminal matters, no right of appeal against closure decisions emanating from the procureur du Roi is granted by the Act (see paragraph 13 above).",
                "(b) As for suing for damages in respect of the loss caused by the closure, the Government did not specify in what form they conceived such an action. In Belgium, there are strict rules on the personal liability of officers serving in the public prosecutor ’ s department (parquet). Thus, they \"can be called to account\" (\"la prise à partie \") only \"if they have been guilty of deceit or fraud\", \"if the law declares them to be liable in damages\" or if the law \"expressly\" stipulates that they are to be called to account (Articles 1140 and 1141 of the Judicial Code, taken together). The Government did not allege that any of these conditions was satisfied in the present case. Neither did they indicate in what way the decision of the Louvain procureur du Roi could entail liability on the part of the authorities.",
                "It is not for the Court to deal with issues of Belgian domestic law which are apparently unsettled and on which the Government have not supplied sufficient information. The Court confines itself to noting that the applicant, who was faced with a serious and immediate peril, quite naturally attended to the most pressing matter first without embarking on hazardous legal speculations; the Court cannot reproach him for doing so."

The Government finally stressed that \"the Commission admitted\" that \"the outright closure\" of the shop would have been reconcilable with the Convention, even though \"so radical a solution would certainly have cost the applicant more than 10,000 [Belgian] francs\". From this premise, they described the logic of the reasoning followed in the report as \"curious\", submitting that, \"still according to the Commission\", the breach of Article 6 (art. 6) stemmed in substance from a \"favour\" granted to Mr. Deweer, namely the offer of a settlement whereby the procureur du Roi was to adopt a solution milder, more flexible and less burdensome than closure. In this way, claimed the Government, an \"absurd conclusion\" was reached.",

Since 1946, procureurs du Roi have utilised paragraph 2 of section 11 of the 1945/1971 Act solely in conjunction with paragraph 1; on the other hand, they have frequently applied paragraph 1 without paragraph 2 (see paragraph 15 above, last sub-paragraph).",

The fact that it is possible to inflict on a person one of the first-mentioned forms of treatment cannot authorise his being subjected to one of the second-mentioned, even if he agrees or acquiesces (see, mutatis mutandis, the Commission ’ s report in the De Becker case, Series B no. 2, pp. 90-91, 101-102 and 124-125)."

The time-limit of thirty days was introduced \"with a view to expediting the transmission of the file\".",

The reasons given therefor were firstly that, according to the case-law of the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 13 and 14 below), non-compliance with Article 433 para. 3 did not entail nullity and the rights of the accused in case of unreasonable delay in the proceedings before the Supreme Court were in any case protected by Articles 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention and 14 para. 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Secondly, it was pointed out that in practice this time-limit was only rarely met and that it appeared inappropriate to maintain a provision which \"in relation to the - speedy - pursuit of the proceedings before the Supreme Court creates expectations which in practice can hardly if at all be fulfilled\".",

However, due to the fact that the Code of Criminal Procedure contains no provisions at all relating to proceedings after referral, a provision comparable to Articles 409 and 433 and applicable in these cases does not exist."

Non-compliance with Article 409 para. 1 or Article 433 para. 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not, according to the case-law of the Supreme Court, entail nullity: that sanction is not expressly provided for; neither are these provisions so essential that non-compliance should ipso facto lead to nullity. However, non-compliance is relevant in connection with the question whether the requirement of trial \"within a reasonable time\" within the meaning of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention has been complied with (see, for instance, the judgments of the Supreme Court of 23 September 1980, NJ ( Nederlandse Jurisprudentie ) 1981, 116, and 29 March 1988, NJ 1988, 813)."

                "14. The case-law of the Supreme Court relating to the requirement of \"trial within a reasonable time\" within the meaning of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention in general, and more especially in relation to the question of the consequences of non-compliance with Articles 409 para. 1 and 433 para. 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, may be summarised as follows.",
                "(a) Exceeding what may, depending on the particular circumstances of the case, be considered a \"reasonable time\" may, but does not necessarily, lead to inadmissibility of the prosecution; the court may also deem it appropriate to impose a more lenient sentence than it would have done had the violation of the relevant rights of the accused not taken place. If the court decides to impose a more lenient sentence, it must take into account the extent of the violation and also indicate the reduction which it has thought fit to apply (see, for instance, the Supreme Court ’ s judgments of 29 January 1985, NJ 1985, 690; 7 April 1987, NJ 1987, 587; 29 March 1988, NJ 1988, 813; 25 April 1989, NJ 1989, 705).",
                "(b) In order to determine whether or not a \"reasonable time\" has been exceeded, the court must consider both the various phases of criminal proceedings and their overall time-span and take into account all appropriate circumstances in reaching its decision, such as the complexity of the case, the conduct of the accused and the way in which the case has been handled by the competent authorities (see, for instance, the judgment of the Supreme Court of 19 February 1985, NJ 1985, 581).",
                "(c) As the decision as to whether or not a reasonable time has been exceeded is thus partly dependent on the assessment of factual circumstances, the Supreme Court, which essentially has competence only as regards points of law, can examine the validity of the decision of the judge of fact only to a limited degree; thus a judgment can only be quashed if it reveals an incorrect view of the concept of trial within a reasonable time or of the standards set out in the preceding paragraph, or if the grounds given for its decision are insufficient (see, for instance, the judgments of the Supreme Court of 5 January 1982, NJ 1982, 339; 9 March 1982, NJ 1982, 409; 11 May 1982, NJ 1983, 280; 12 October 1982, NJ 1983, 371; 3 January 1984, NJ 1984, 403; 29 January 1985, NJ 1985, 690; 10 December 1985, NJ 1986, 480; 1 November 1988, NJ 1989, 680; 31 October 1989, NJ 1990, 257).",
                "Although the Supreme Court has held that delaying criminal proceedings for more than two years does not in itself warrant the conclusion that a \"reasonable time\" has been exceeded (see its judgment of 16 December 1986, NJ 1987, 637), it is commonly assumed that in its above-mentioned limited assessment it applies, as a general guideline, a rule presumed to have been derived from the report of the Commission of 12 March 1984 in application no. 9193/80 ( Marijnissen ) (Decisions and Reports 40, pp. 83-99) endorsed by the Committee of Ministers in its resolution of 25 January 1985 (DH (85)4). This rule may be summarised as follows: in principle, a \"reasonable time\" has been exceeded if the proceedings in one of their phases have not been pursued for more than two years due to circumstances for which the accused is not responsible; if such an eventuality occurs and is pleaded by the defence, then a rejection of that plea must be particularly well reasoned. The character of this rule as a general guideline implies, on the one hand, that under certain circumstances stagnation for a shorter period may be a reason for applying such strict requirements to the grounds given for rejecting the defence ’ s plea that a reasonable time has been exceeded and, on the other hand, apparently, that exceeding the time-limit of two years may sometimes, perhaps also depending on the further circumstances of the particular case, be allowed to pass.",
                "(d) The courts must also address ex officio the question whether a reasonable time has been exceeded. However, it must only appear from the judgment that this has been done if there are special circumstances.",
                "In considering whether or not such special circumstances are present, the Supreme Court uses the general guideline, mutatis mutandis, indicated in sub-paragraph (c). This means that, as a rule, it only holds the lower courts bound to address ex officio the question whether or not a reasonable time has been exceeded if it appears from the documents that the proceedings have been held up for more than two years due to reasons for which the defence cannot be held accountable. However, if there are special circumstances, the courts are obliged to address the question ex officio even if the period of inactivity is shorter (see, for instance, the Supreme Court ’ s judgments of 1 July 1981, NJ 1981, 625; 1 May 1990, NJ 1990, 641).",
                "(e) The Supreme Court applies these rules itself in the procedure of appeal on points of law and thus addresses, ex officio if need be, the question whether it must be assumed that the duration of proceedings in this phase has led to excessive length of the proceedings. In this connection, it appears from its abundant case-law that the time elapsed between the filing of the appeal on points of law and the sending in of the documents to the registry of the Supreme Court has some significance: if this causes such a delay that the case comes up before the Supreme Court for the first time more than two years after the appeal on points of law was filed, then as a rule the judgment will be quashed and the case will be referred for retrial, at which point the judge of fact will have the options indicated in sub-paragraph (a) above of declaring the prosecution inadmissible or of reducing the sentence. However, the Supreme Court may itself reach the opinion that no other decision is possible than to declare the prosecution inadmissible, which it may then do of its own motion (see, for instance, its judgments of 12 January 1988, NJ 1988, 814; 29 March 1988, NJ 1988, 813; 12 April 1988, NJ 1988, 970; 25 April 1989, NJ 1989, 705; 6 June 1989, NJ 1990, 92; 13 February 1990, NJ 1990, 633). On the other hand, if the period of inactivity is shorter, the Supreme Court will merely state that the delay is longer than is desirable but that judgment of the case cannot be held not to have taken place within a reasonable time; it will then determine, applying the rule set forth in the preceding sub-paragraph, whether or not special circumstances warrant any different decision (see, for instance, its judgments of 13 January 1981, NJ 1981, 240; 3 March 1981, NJ 1981, 367; 16 February 1982, NJ 1982, 410; 4 June 1985, NJ 1986, 182; 16 September 1985, NJ 1986, 495; 11 February 1986, NJ 1986, 553; 11 February 1986, NJ 1986, 644; 16 February 1988, NJ 1988, 823).",

                "The result of section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act and section 29 of the 1881 Act is that in the field of audiovisual communication a publishing director is criminally responsible – as principal – for any defamatory statement made on air, where the content of that statement has been “fixed prior to being communicated to the public”. In such a case, as soon as the statement's defamatory character has been established, the offence is made out as regards the publishing director – the maker of the statement being prosecuted as an accessory – without it being necessary to prove mens rea on his part. As pointed out above, section 93 - 3 is intended to punish a publishing director who has failed to perform his duty of overseeing the content of remarks made on air in those cases where he would have been able to exercise such oversight before they were broadcast.",
                "A number of elements have to be proved before the publishing director can be convicted: he must have the status of publishing director; the offending statement must have been broadcast and must be defamatory; and the content of the statement must have been fixed before it was broadcast. The Government have stated that where there has been no “prior fixing” responsibility is no longer presumed and the rules of ordinary law apply instead, so that the prosecution has to prove that the publishing director had a personal hand in the broadcasting of the offending statement.",
                "The Court takes the view that the difficulty in the present case stems from the fact that this presumption is combined with another, namely that defamatory remarks are presumed to have been made in bad faith. However, this second presumption is not irrebuttable; although defendants cannot seek to establish the truth of defamatory statements where, as in the present case, the events concerned have taken place more than ten years before (section 35 of the 1881 Act), they may overturn that presumption by establishing their good faith. Thus, as the Paris Court of Appeal observed in its judgment of 17 June 1998, the applicants could have established the third applicant's good faith by proving that the allegations complained of had been made in pursuit of a legitimate aim, without any personal animosity, after a serious investigation and in temperate language.",
                "Therefore, as the Government submitted, a publishing director has a valid defence if he can establish the good faith of the person who made the offending remarks or prove that their content was not fixed before being broadcast; moreover, the applicants raised such arguments in the domestic courts.",
                "That being the case, and having regard to the importance of what was at stake – effectively preventing defamatory or insulting allegations and imputations being disseminated through the media by requiring publishing directors to exercise prior supervision – the Court considers that the presumption of responsibility established by section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act remains within the requisite “reasonable limits”. Noting in addition that the domestic courts examined with the greatest attention the applicants'arguments relating to the third applicant's good faith and their defence that the content of the offending statement had not been fixed in advance, the Court concludes that in the present case they did not apply section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act in a way which infringed the presumption of innocence.",

                "7. In its issue no. 1272, dated 1 February 1997, the weekly magazine Le Point published an “investigation” headlined “ Vichy : Around the Papon Case”. Several pages focused on Mr Michel Junot, under the headline “1942-1943 Revelations: Michel Junot, deputy to mayor Jacques Chirac on the Paris City Council from 1977 to 1995, was Deputy Prefect at Pithiviers in 1942 and 1943. In that capacity, he was responsible for maintaining order in the two internment camps in his district, Pithiviers and Beaune-la-Rolande”. The article included the following passages:",
                "“'It has to be said that, all political consideration set aside, Vichy's civil servants gave a remarkable example of efficient, skilful and honest administration .'That good-conduct citation, awarded in 1981, does not come from Maurice Papon, who has now been committed to stand trial in the Bordeaux Assize Court for'complicity in crimes against humanity'. Those are the exact words used in L'illusion du bonheur, a book published ... by Michel Junot, a deputy mayor when Jacques Chirac ran Paris City Council between 1977 and 1995, who knows his subject, since he was Deputy Prefect in Pithiviers, in the département of Loiret, in 1942 and 1943. In that capacity he supervised the maintenance of order in the camp of that town, where thousands of Jews were interned before being deported to Auschwitz. Unlike Maurice Papon – and this is a significant difference between the two cases – he did not order anyone to be arrested, interned or transferred to Drancy.",
                "After the war Michel Junot enjoyed a brilliant career in France's highest administrative spheres before turning to politics. He was to become a member of parliament for Paris from 1958 to 1962, giving his allegiance to the CNI, which he never left. But it was on Paris City Council, where he served as mediator from 1977 to 1989 that he spent the longest part of his career. He is a former MEP and since 1978 has been the president of the Maison de l'Europe in Paris.",
                "Until now, he has always maintained that the internment camps in his district, Pithiviers, and Beaune-la-Rolande some twenty kilometres away, were not under his control. His main duties were to inspect the local districts and to compile'general and confidential information'files on local dignitaries. The Pithiviers camp?'it was not under my jurisdiction. I never set foot in it'he told L'Express magazine in 1990.",
                "An outright denial which is, however, inconsistent with several documents not previously published which Le Point has managed to obtain. Documents which clarify his field of activity.",
                "... when he was appointed Deputy Prefect at Pithiviers on 9 June 1942 ... the camps at Pithiviers and Beaune-la-Rolande, originally intended for German prisoners of war, were already being used as internment camps prior to their inmates being deported, the first having left on 8 May 1942.",
                "Michel Junot, who was to remain in office for exactly a year to the day, took up his post in Pithiviers on 24 August 1942, that is, less than a month before the departure, on 20 September 1942, of a fresh transport of Jewish deportees.",
                "On that day a thousand detainees arrested during house-to-house searches in the Paris region, including 163 children under 18, were put on transport no. 35 and shipped off to Auschwitz via Drancy, the camp to the north of Paris.",
                "On the eve of their departure, Michel Junot informed the Prefect of his concerns about maintaining order.'I hereby inform you that I have just been notified of the entrainment of a thousand Jews from the Pithiviers camp tomorrow from 5 p.m. onwards at Pithiviers railway station, and that all the gendarmes in my district apart from one officer per squad are therefore required to assist with the entrainment ... .'...",
                "Two days later, on 2 2 September, Junot did not hide his satisfaction when sending the Prefect the following report:'The day of 20 September 1942 went very smoothly throughout my district. The limited police presence planned for the afternoon of 20 September could not be deployed ... because all the gendarmes in the area, except for one officer per squad, were required for the entrainment of the Jewish detainees of the Pithiviers camp, whose departure I was suddenly notified of on 19 September at 3 p.m. The entrainment was to take place between 4 and 7 p.m. at Pithiviers station at the far end of the avenue de la République where the communists had called on ... the inhabitants of Pithiviers to demonstrate at 6.30 p.m., and I was concerned that some incidents might occur which could disrupt an orderly departure. But nothing of the sort happened and the town remained perfectly calm.'...",
                "Then, in a'monthly report'drafted eight days later for his superiors, he scrupulously went over the events again.",
                "On 30 September 1942 he reported in detail on the situation in the two'internment camps', as he headed the third paragraph of his report.'The Beaune-la-Rolande camp, which has been empty since the end of August, has been cleaned', Junot stated.'The conditions there are now excellent. Two transports of Jews passed through and spent twenty-four hours there before leaving for Drancy. There are only about twenty detainees left at the camp, doing maintenance work.'",
                "Michel Junot went on:'The Pithiviers camp had been occupied since the end of August by 1,800 Jewish internees of all categories, French and foreign, men, women and children, some arrested during the August and December 1941 round-ups, others for having infringed the regulations of the occupying forces (demarcation line, wearing the star of David, etc.). All of them, except those married to Aryans and a few mothers of young children, were placed on trains bound for Germany on 20 September. Finally the last internees left Pithiviers in the evening of the 24th for Beaune-la-Rolande so as to clear the camp, which was due to receive communist internees. In fact this last Jewish transport spent only twenty-four hours in Beaune before being sent on to Drancy on the orders of the occupying forces.'",
                "Drancy was the last stop in France before they were deported to Germany and the final solution: their physical destruction. ...",
                "On reading this dry civil servant's prose, the Acting Prefect of Loiret, Jacques Marti-Sane, expressed his satisfaction in writing. He was pleased with the orderliness which had prevailed during the entrainment of the deportees, who until then had been crammed into huts surrounded by barbed wire and picked out by searchlight beams from the watchtowers.",
                "In an internal memorandum dated 1 October 1942 – another document not previously published – the Acting Prefect informed the head of the first division of the prefecture, who was responsible for organisation and surveillance:'The Pithiviers Deputy Prefect may be called upon to intervene in the matter of the camps in an emergency and on my express instructions. In any event, in his capacity as the government representative in Pithiviers, he has the right to monitor the proper functioning of the camps. Accordingly, it seems to me essential that all instructions sent to the camp commandant should be copied to the Pithiviers Deputy Prefect, so that he is not bypassed.'...",
                "No fewer than seven transports left from camps in Loiret between June and September 1942, the last one under Junot's responsibility.",
                "In his October report, the Deputy Prefect expressed his concerns over the difficulty in maintaining order in Beaune-la-Rolande, which was full of'French and foreign Jews who have contravened the regulations of the occupying forces (in particular, attempts to cross the demarcation line) and whom the German police have sent to the Beaune camp'. As a conscientious official, Michel Junot went so far as to suggest:'If there is a further rise in the number of internees, we should make plans to strengthen the security arrangements.'",
                "In the same report, he pointed out that communists were gradually replacing the Jews in Pithiviers, though there were still 1,574 of the latter on 30 October 1942 compared with 1,798 on 26 September.",
                "' The presence of this camp inside my district means that the sub-prefecture is receiving a number of letters asking for leave to visit and even for people to be released. I have had some standard-form replies drafted explaining that I have no power to take such measures and that only the Prefect who took the internment decision has any authority in that respect. There is nothing to report from the camp, which is guarded most efficiently by a detachment of gendarmes', he wrote.",
                "On the day of the liberation of Orléans, 16 August 1944, Michel Junot was present. He waved the tricolour from the balcony of Loiret's prefecture. And he stood at the head of the prefecture steps to welcome André Mars, the commissaire de la République sent by General de Gaulle. But that did not stop him being swept away in the subsequent purge. On 14 December 1945, ten months after awarding Junot a'certificate of participation in the Resistance', de Gaulle signed a decree removing him from office. The hero of Free France was acting in response to a decision of the National Purification Commission based on a report from the Loiret departmental liberation committee stating that Junot was'a typical careerist, devoid of all moral scruples, not to be allowed to hold any kind of public office'.",
                "However, like many servants of the French State, Junot claimed to have been playing a double game. He explained that he had worked for a'network'of the Central Intelligence and Action Bureau ... citing his activity on behalf of General de Gaulle's intelligence service in London under the Occupation and the medals he had received as a result. He must have been persuasive, because when peace returned he was to be found once more as permanent secretary to various Ministers, before becoming a deputy prefect again in 1956 and then prefect in 1957. ... ”"

                "8. An interview with Mr Junot was also published as part of the investigation. It included the following statement by him:",
                "“ ... It was only when I reported to the Prefect of Loiret that I discovered the existence of the camps. At that time I did not know who was interned there. There had been communists, at the time of the breaking of the Germano-Soviet pact. And there were foreign Jews. We did not know their ultimate destination. We only knew that they were going to Drancy. Rumour had it that they were being sent to work in salt mines in Poland. We obviously knew that they were not going off on a pleasant holiday. But I did not learn of the existence of the extermination camps until April 1945 when the first deportees returned.",
                "When I took up office, on 24 August 1942, all the transports except one had already left.”",
                "When the interviewer asked Mr Junot if he thought this “ renewed interest in those dark years” was “necessary for the young generations” he replied: “If Frenchmen in those days made mistakes, or sometimes committed war crimes, I think there is the discreet veil of history ... ”"

                "“According to the weekly magazine Le Point, a former deputy mayor of Paris supervised the deportation of a thousand French and foreign Jews in 1942. Michel Junot, now aged 80, was Deputy Prefect of Pithiviers at the time. He admits that he organised the departure of a transport of deportees to Drancy. Michel Junot, whom General de Gaulle removed from office at the end of the war, claims to have been in the Resistance and subsequently rose through the ranks of the civil service. In his defence, the former deputy mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995 maintains, like Maurice Papon, that he knew nothing of the fate of the deported Jews and says that the discreet veil of history should be drawn over the crimes of those days.”",
                "The way in which France Info operates is for the presenter to broadcast live, with two news bulletins and two news flashes per half-hour. He then breaks for an hour to update his information before going on air again. The above-mentioned broadcast was accordingly repeated by the third applicant and by other journalists sixty-two times between 6 p.m. on 31 January and 11.04 a.m. on 1 February, in either the same or a slightly different form. However, the broadcasts systematically specified that the report was based on an article published in Le Point. After 11 p.m., a number of news bulletins and flashes mentioned the fact that, “unlike Maurice Papon”, Michel Junot had never issued any orders for anyone to be arrested, interned or transferred to Drancy, sometimes adding that he was “responsible only for keeping order”.",

Mr Junot brought proceedings in the Paris Criminal Court against the second applicant, who is publishing director of the applicant company (the publisher), the third applicant and the applicant company as principal, accessory and civilly liable respectively for the offence of public defamation of a civil servant, contrary to sections 29, first paragraph, and 31, first paragraph, of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881 (“the 1881 Act”).",
                "In their defence, the applicants argued that the case under section 31 of the 1881 Act was inadmissible, because Mr Junot had been retrospectively stripped of his status as a civil servant at the time of the Liberation. They also contended that the prosecution's case against the second applicant was inadmissible: the disputed statement had been broadcast live and its content could not therefore be construed as having been “fixed prior to being communicated to the public” within the meaning of section 93 - 3 of the Audiovisual Communication Act of 29 July 1982 (“the 1982 Act”). Moreover, they submitted that the third applicant had acted in good faith. In that connection, they argued that public interest in the period of the Occupation had been revived by the news of the Papon trial; that the third applicant had been in possession of the article published in Le Point on the previous day along with three agency dispatches; that it had been reasonable to link the cases of Mr Junot and Mr Papon because both men had held high public office during the Occupation and had subsequently enjoyed brilliant political careers; that the use of the conditional tense and the absence of any personal comment about Mr Junot demonstrated the journalist's caution; and that France Info had reported Mr Junot's denials from 6 a.m. on 1 February onwards."

By a judgment of 25 November 1997, the Paris Criminal Court (Seventeenth Division) found the second and third applicants guilty as principal and accessory respectively of the offence of public defamation of a civil servant. It fined them 20,000 French francs (FRF) each and ordered them jointly to pay FRF 50,000 in damages. It also found the applicant company civilly liable and ordered by way of civil remedy that an announcement informing the public of the content of its judgment be broadcast on France Info every thirty minutes during a twenty-four hour period in the month following the date on which the judgment became final.",
                "With regard to the defamatory nature of the disputed allegations, the judgment reads as follows:",
                "“Mr Junot is alleged ... to have personally played an active role in the deportation of Jews in his capacity as Deputy Prefect of Pithiviers. This allegation, which undoubtedly damages the honour of the civil party, is moreover aggravated by the connection made between the case of Mr Papon – who has been committed for trial before the Gironde Assize Court to answer charges that he participated in crimes against humanity – and that of Mr Junot, with the suggestion that the latter was seeking to evade responsibility for the crimes committed during that period, over which he believes that'the discreet veil of history should be drawn'.",
                "The fact that it was specified that,'unlike Maurice Papon', Michel Junot'did not issue any orders for anyone to be arrested, interned or transferred to Drancy'in no way detracts from the seriousness of the charge levelled at the civil party; the same can be said of the use of the conditional tense throughout the broadcasts.",
                "The allegations in question also cast doubt on Mr Junot's membership of the Resistance, which was reported as a mere'claim'on his part, and suggested that he had been stripped of his status by General de Gaulle at the end of the war. These words also damage the civil party's honour and reputation.”",
                "The court found that Mr Junot had never lost the rank of Deputy Prefect, and that he should be considered as having been acting in that capacity in Pithiviers at the time of the facts alleged against him and accordingly to have been exercising public authority. It found that section 31 of the 1881 Act was therefore applicable.",
                "With regard to the good faith of the third applicant, the court found as follows:",
                "“There being a presumption that defamatory statements are made in bad faith, it is for the defendants to prove their good faith.",
                "It should first be noted that the repetition of defamatory statements already published in another medium does not in any way provide the person who repeats them with a defence; such journalistic practice is particularly to be deprecated, because it means that a statement that has not been verified by anyone subsequently reporting it acquires the appearance of an absolute certainty.",
                "This is what happened with Mr Junot: having assumed that the enquiries made by his fellow journalists at Le Point were reliable, Bertrand Gallicher simply repeated the magazine's allegations against the civil party without checking them.",
                "As evidence that he had carried out a serious investigation, Bertrand Gallicher told the Court that he had been in possession of the article published in Le Point on the previous day, and of three agency dispatches; however these dispatches, which simply quoted large sections of the magazine article, could not, without more, provide the journalist with a legal defence.",
                "The journalist also produced the documents mentioned in Le Point : the Prefect's memorandum of 1 October 1942, Michel Junot's notes of 19 and 22 September 1942 and the monthly reports for September and October 1942; however, these documents did not give him grounds for asserting that Michel Junot, Pithiviers Deputy Prefect, had supervised the deportation of a thousand Jews or that he had admitted having organised the departure of a transport of Jewish deportees.",
                "Neither the memorandum from the Prefect of Loiret dated 1 October 1942 specifying that the Pithiviers Deputy Prefect must be copied in on all the instructions given to the camp commandant, nor the memorandum of 19 September 1942 to the Prefect signed by Michel Junot and expressing his concerns about keeping order on 20 September 1942 in the event of communist demonstrations because all the gendarmes in the district had been drafted in to help with the'entrainment of a thousand Jews', nor the report drawn up by Michel Junot on 22 September 1942 on the events of the day, which had been'perfectly calm', prove that Michel Junot, Deputy Prefect, had played a personal part in the organisation and departure of that transport for Drancy. In fact, what these documents show is that he complained of having been notified only belatedly of the'entrainment of a thousand Jews', that he did not receive copies of all the instructions sent to the camp commandant, a memorandum from the Prefect having been required to ensure that he was not'bypassed'and that his concern was to maintain order outside the camps.",
                "Michel Junot's monthly reports for September and October 1942 do not carry any more evidential weight in this respect; while the first mentions that most of the Jews in the Pithiviers camp had been'entrained'on transports bound for Germany on 20 September 1942; while both report on the occupancy rate of the two internment camps situated in his district and thus establish his'responsibility in principle'for the camps (using Mr Serge Klarsfeld's formula); while they keep the Prefect informed of relations with the German forces and the circumstances in which the anti-Jewish laws were being applied and certainly show that Mr Junot was performing his functions of Deputy Prefect under the Occupation with zeal and determination, and without being troubled by too many scruples, they nonetheless do not prove that he played a personal part in the deportation of Jews or that he organised the departure of a transport of Jewish deportees.",
                "Turning to the other documents cited by the defence, namely a letter dated 19 September 1942 from the secretary-general for the police on the Conseil d'Etat to the Orléans Regional Prefect and the latter's reply dated 21 September 1942, and a memorandum dated 19 September 1942 from the Pithiviers Deputy Prefect to the captain of the gendarmerie and police superintendent, they cannot be regarded by the Court as having any evidential weight, since they are merely summarised on a plain sheet of paper.",
                "In short, the documents in Bertrand Gallicher's possession did not give him grounds for alleging that Mr Junot was guilty of having participated in crimes against humanity.",
                "Nor did these documents entitle the presenters who came on air after 0.33 a.m. on 1 February to repeat the allegation that the plaintiff had supervised the Jewish internment camps of Pithiviers and Beaune-la-Rolande and the maintenance of order in both camps.",
                "Lastly, the testimony of Mrs Mouchard-Zay recounting the dramatic circumstances of the various round-ups of Jewish men, women and children, the conditions in which they were transferred to and arrived in the two camps of Pithiviers and Beaune-la-Rolande, and the dramatic change in public opinion which coincided with these events, does not prove that Mr Junot played any part in the organisation of these deportations.",
                "While being aware of the professional constraints imposed by the need to break news rapidly, which is inherent in the very nature of radio, the Court notes that the journalists, far from merely reporting raw news objectively, endorsed the interpretation adopted by some of their fellow journalists, while going further by making a connection with the'Papon case', no doubt with the intention of making the story more sensational.",
                "The disputed broadcasts were therefore particularly careless and contributed to the spread of rumour by repeating defamatory allegations.",
                "In relation to the allegation that Mr Junot was not a genuine member of the Resistance, the Court finds that the evidence produced by the defence is insufficient to cast doubt on his Resistance activities, which in any event have been vouched for by Jean-Claude Aaron, the leader of the Masséna network, by Colonel Rémy and by several people of Jewish descent who described the help he had given them during the Occupation.",
                "For all of the above reasons, the Court is unable to accept that [the third applicant] acted in good faith.”",
                "The court found the second applicant, in his capacity as publishing director, not liable for the first broadcast, which had been made live by the third applicant on 31 January at 6 p.m. It found, however, that the same statement had been repeated either in full or in condensed form by the various presenters who subsequently went on air, and considered that such “systematic repetition of the disputed statements” should be construed as “rolling broadcasting” within the meaning of section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act. The court concluded as follows:",
                "“[The second applicant], as publishing director, whose duty it is to control what is broadcast on the channel for which he is responsible, is therefore liable in law as principal for the offence of defamation.”"

The defence arguments ... tending towards proving the truth of the facts is not relevant here, quite apart from the fact that no evidence to that effect has been adduced. Moreover, comparing Mr Junot's position to that of Mr Papon, who had indeed just been committed for trial in the Bordeaux Assize Court, also necessarily had a defamatory resonance.",
                "The same defamatory classification must also be given to the passage'[Mr Junot] ... claims to have been in the Resistance'. Coming as it does between the reference to his being sacked by General de Gaulle and the comparison to Mr Papon, this can only insinuate that Mr Junot's assertion was false.”",

                "In seeking to establish their good faith the defence cite three dispatches (AFP, AP and Reuters) which mentioned the article in Le Point and the content of a television programme in which Mr Junot had taken part. But the use of agency dispatches as one's main source, especially when they are purely repetitive and reproduce an article that has already been published does not constitute evidence that an attempt has been made, if not to conduct an investigation, then at least to check the information. In addition, the wholly gratuitous assertion that Mr Junot admitted his culpability is particularly reprehensible from both the criminal and the ethical points of view.",
                "As regards the debate about whether Mr Junot had been a member of the Resistance, the Criminal Court rightly noted that the documents produced by the defence were not sufficient evidence to the contrary, whereas his participation has been attested to by the leader of the Masséna network, Jean-Claude Aaron, by Colonel Rémy and by a number of persons of Jewish origin who have drawn attention to Mr Junot's courageous attitude.",
                "Moreover, the imputations contained in the message sent out were disproportionate in relation to the objective material that the accused maintained they had at their disposal, and here it should be noted, as clarification of this point may be helpful, that neither the use of the conditional tense pleaded in defence, nor the mention – very late in the day – of Mr Junot's denials, affect the gravity of the allegations made in dispatches broadcast several dozen times.",
                "The content of the documents which the defendants learned of in Le Point is not convincing in terms of the construction that has been placed upon them if they are to be considered to reflect Deputy Prefect Junot's attitude at the time of the departure of the last transport of Jewish deportees on 20 September 1942.",
                "The memo of 19 September from the deputy prefect to his prefect ... said:'I have just been notified of the entrainment of a thousand Jews ... tomorrow', and he complained that he would therefore not have sufficient manpower to control a communist demonstration.",
                "The same deputy prefect sent a memo, dated 22 September, informing the prefect that there had been no incidents on account of the demonstration and that the departure of the transport had been orderly.",
                "The memo of 1 October 1942 from the Prefect of Loiret seems to echo his subordinate's concerns about being informed in stipulating that the deputy prefect'in his capacity as the government representative ..., has the right to monitor the proper functioning of the camps'.",
                "The reports sent by Michel Junot to his prefect in September and October 1942 describe the situation in the camps but do not reveal that he had any power over them or initiative regarding them.",
                "The witness evidence heard in court did not provide any additional information about Mr Junot's duties.",
                "As to the other documents produced in court, the Criminal Court rightly found, for reasons which the Court of Appeal endorses, that they did not appear to have been in the defendants'possession at the time when the statement was broadcast. Moreover, they do not necessarily weaken Mr Junot's argument, since they include one memo he wrote on 15 April 1943 to the Prefect of Orléans about improving the food and bedding in the camps.

It is significant in this respect that such steps were taken from the morning of 1 February onwards, when the content of the offending statement was amended. Moreover, it would be stretching the concept of prior fixing to contend that it must involve mechanical recording. Content may also be fixed by a communication method based on repetition which effectively requires it to be fixed but not necessarily by mechanical means. Therein lies the difference from'live'broadcasting involving no repetition.”",

In the case of a live broadcast that presumption did not in principle apply. In accordance with the rules of ordinary law, the prosecution had to prove that the publishing director had personally participated in broadcasting the statement.",
                "By ruling that there was “prior fixing” where a statement was broadcast repeatedly, the courts had merely interpreted that concept. They had by no means adopted reasoning to the accused's detriment by analogy. In the Government's submission, the applicants'argument amounted to equating the concept of “prior fixing” with that of “recording”, only a prior “recording” being capable of enabling the publishing director to exercise his power of supervision. Yet in the present case the criminal courts had exonerated the second applicant, the publishing director of Radio France, of all responsibility for the first bulletin, broadcast live on France Info; the applicants'convictions had been based on the later bulletins only. In doing so the courts had made a reasonable interpretation of the concept of “prior fixing”, adapting the case-law to the changing situation, through reasoning which was purely teleological and devoid of any analogy. The Government further submitted that the text of section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act made no distinction between live broadcasts and pre - recorded programmes. It followed that the domestic courts had not extended the normal scope of that provision to cover a situation not provided for in the legislation. Parliament had deliberately used the concept of “prior fixing” rather than that of “prior recording”, the former being broader than the latter. The word “ fixation ” in the French language referred to “what is determined in advance”, which could therefore be checked. In short, the courts had not created a new charge or autonomous offence by analogy.",
                "In addition, the Government submitted that the interpretation of the term “prior fixing” in the present case had been “consistent with the essence of the offence”. Firstly, the intention had been to adapt the text to “new circumstances”, as France Info, the first European radio station to broadcast news programmes round-the-clock, had not been set up until 1987, quite some time after the enactment of the 1982 Act. Secondly, it was a reasonable reflection of the way the offence had originally been framed, since it was based on the possibility of supervision by the publishing director whenever a statement was repeated, whether live-to-air or not.",
                "Lastly, the Government said that the interpretation complained of had been foreseeable. They pointed out in that connection that, as a lawyer and media professional, the second applicant could not have been unaware of the provisions of section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act; by taking appropriate advice if necessary, he could reasonably have been expected to foresee how they would be interpreted."

The applicants replied that legal theorists writing in that specialist field had all equated the concept of a statement's “prior fixing”, within the meaning of section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act, with its “prior recording”, and excluded live broadcasts from the scope of that provision. They referred in that connection to the following two publications: Communication audiovisuelle, J. Francillon and B. Delcros, Juris -Classeur pénal, Annexe Vo communication audiovisuelle, vol. 2, 1990, §§ 47 - 48, and Droit des médias, C. Debbasch (ed.), 1999, no. 2509. By applying section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act in the context of the repetition of a statement in a live broadcast, even though in such circumstances the presenter remained the sole judge of its content and the advisability of repeating or adapting it, the domestic courts had departed from the legislature's intentions, as confirmed by the prevailing legal theory, and created “by analogy” a new category of offence."

That condition is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts'interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him liable (see, for example, Kokkinakis v. Greece, judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260 - A, p. 22, § 52).",
                "It is true that, in the context of audiovisual communication, the words “fixed prior to being communicated to the public” may seem to indicate that a publishing director cannot be convicted of an offence under section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act unless the offending statement has been recorded before being broadcast. Thus construed, section 93 - 3 cannot form the basis for the successful prosecution of a publishing director where the “statement” has been broadcast live. The Court notes moreover that the Government have not supplied any evidence that before the applicants'trial the domestic courts had applied section 93 - 3 in circumstances similar to those of the present case.",
                "Nevertheless, Article 7 of the Convention does not outlaw the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, “provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen” (see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 50, ECHR 2001 ‑ II).",
                "The Court notes that the presumption of the publishing director's responsibility established by section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act is the corollary of the latter's duty to check the content of the “statements” put out through the medium for which he works. The reason, therefore, why the publishing director's responsibility is engaged only where the content of the offending “statement” has been “fixed” prior to being broadcast is that he is deemed on account of that “prior fixing” to have been placed in a position to apprise himself of its content and check it before it is broadcast.",
                "Moreover, it is clear – and the parties did not disagree on this point – that there has been “prior fixing” where the offending “statement” has been recorded with a view to its being broadcast, and that, conversely, there has been no prior fixing where such a statement has been broadcast live. In the Court's opinion, the facts of the present case fall halfway between recording and live broadcasting. On the one hand, the offending statement was not recorded; on the other, in view of the way France Info operated, it was intended to be repeated live-to-air at regular intervals. As there had been no “prior fixing”, the criminal courts absolved the publishing director of all responsibility in respect of the first of the bulletins broadcast on France Info; on the other hand, they held that that first broadcast had constituted a “prior fixing” of the statement's content as regards subsequent broadcasts. They therefore ruled that from the second broadcast onwards the publishing director could be considered to have been placed in a position to check its content beforehand. The Court considers that, in the particular context of the way France Info operated, that interpretation of the concept “prior fixing” was consistent with the essence of the offence concerned and “reasonably foreseeable”.",

                "22. The Government submitted that section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act did not establish an irrebuttable presumption of the publishing director's responsibility. Firstly, the prosecution was still obliged to prove the objective element of the offence, namely the broadcasting of a defamatory statement; it was merely absolved from the obligation to prove the mental element. Secondly, defendants could still deny the facts or challenge their classification. Thirdly, once the facts had been established, the presumption did not prevent defendants, whether principals or accessories, from presenting a defence. On this last point, the Government admitted that by section 35 of the 1881 Act defendants could not seek to establish proof of the truth of the defamatory statement where, as in the present case, the events concerned had taken place more than ten years before. However, they could plead good faith, which was a valid defence. The second and third applicants had indeed put forward that defence in the criminal courts, and the fact that their arguments were not accepted did not mean that proof of good faith was impossible. It was also open to defendants to plead compliance with a statutory requirement ( l'ordre de la loi ) or necessity ( force majeure ), both defences under ordinary law. The Government argued on that basis that the second applicant could have put forward legal arguments other than a claim not to be the publishing director as an effective defence.",
                "The Government further submitted that the Convention did not prohibit presumptions of fact or of law provided that they were kept within reasonable limits which took into account the gravity of what was at stake and maintained the rights of the defence. The presumption in section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act respected such limits. Firstly, it came into play only with regard to the offences defined in Chapter IV of the 1881 Act, concerning the offences of defamation and insult. Secondly, the legal responsibility of each defendant was determined in strict proportion to the part he or she had actually played, with a legal distinction being drawn according to whether or not the content of the information had been fixed prior to its communication to the public. Where that was not the case, the publishing director, not having been in a position to intervene to prevent the broadcast, could not be prosecuted as a principal. Lastly, the Government submitted that the way in which section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act had been applied in the present case had been compatible with the presumption of innocence. Firstly, the domestic courts had fully established the defamatory nature of the statements broadcast. Secondly, they had clearly proved the existence of intent on the part of the third applicant, after meticulously examining the documents and witness evidence he had adduced to prove his good faith. Thirdly, the second applicant's conviction as principal did not infringe the “principle of individual responsibility”, since the criminal responsibility contemplated in section 93 - 3 arose not from producing the statement but from publishing or broadcasting it, which formed part of the responsibilities of the publishing director; above all, in the present case, by emphasising that “a rolling news bulletin may be monitored and controlled ... by making the necessary arrangements to that effect ”, the Paris Court of Appeal had in a sense established intent on the part of the second applicant even though in law it did not actually need to do so in order to find him guilty."

                "23. The applicants contested the Government's argument that a publishing director could escape liability by proving his good faith; the established case-law – which moreover drew the consequences of the strict liability provided for in section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act – proved the opposite (they referred in that connection to the following judgments of the Court of Cassation, Criminal Division : Cass. crim., 22 December 1976, Bulletin no. 379, p. 961, and Cass. crim., 8 July 1986, Bulletin no. 233, p. 596). The presumption of responsibility established by that section was indeed therefore irrebuttable. According to the Court's case-law, Article 6 § 2 of the Convention required States to keep presumptions of fact and of law within reasonable limits which took into account the gravity of what was at stake and maintained the rights of the defence; but there was no criminal policy consideration of any particular gravity which militated in favour of the presumption in issue in the present case. Moreover, although the applicants did not deny that necessity was a defence under ordinary law capable of qualifying the irrebuttable character of a presumption of responsibility, they could not see what might constitute a case of force majeure excluding the publishing director's responsibility under section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act."

France, judgment of 7 October 1988, Series A no. 141 ‑ A, p. 18, § 31).",
                "The Court next observes that the Convention does not prohibit presumptions of fact or of law in criminal cases. Nevertheless, it requires States “to remain within certain limits in this respect”: they must “confine them within reasonable limits which take into account the importance of what is at stake and maintain the rights of the defence” (see Salabiaku, cited above, pp. 15-16, § 28).",
                "The result of section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act and section 29 of the 1881 Act is that in the field of audiovisual communication a publishing director is criminally responsible – as principal – for any defamatory statement made on air, where the content of that statement has been “fixed prior to being communicated to the public”. In such a case, as soon as the statement's defamatory character has been established, the offence is made out as regards the publishing director – the maker of the statement being prosecuted as an accessory – without it being necessary to prove mens rea on his part. As pointed out above, section 93 - 3 is intended to punish a publishing director who has failed to perform his duty of overseeing the content of remarks made on air in those cases where he would have been able to exercise such oversight before they were broadcast.",
                "A number of elements have to be proved before the publishing director can be convicted: he must have the status of publishing director; the offending statement must have been broadcast and must be defamatory; and the content of the statement must have been fixed before it was broadcast. The Government have stated that where there has been no “prior fixing” responsibility is no longer presumed and the rules of ordinary law apply instead, so that the prosecution has to prove that the publishing director had a personal hand in the broadcasting of the offending statement.",
                "The Court takes the view that the difficulty in the present case stems from the fact that this presumption is combined with another, namely that defamatory remarks are presumed to have been made in bad faith. However, this second presumption is not irrebuttable; although defendants cannot seek to establish the truth of defamatory statements where, as in the present case, the events concerned have taken place more than ten years before (section 35 of the 1881 Act), they may overturn that presumption by establishing their good faith. Thus, as the Paris Court of Appeal observed in its judgment of 17 June 1998, the applicants could have established the third applicant's good faith by proving that the allegations complained of had been made in pursuit of a legitimate aim, without any personal animosity, after a serious investigation and in temperate language.",
                "Therefore, as the Government submitted, a publishing director has a valid defence if he can establish the good faith of the person who made the offending remarks or prove that their content was not fixed before being broadcast; moreover, the applicants raised such arguments in the domestic courts.",
                "That being the case, and having regard to the importance of what was at stake – effectively preventing defamatory or insulting allegations and imputations being disseminated through the media by requiring publishing directors to exercise prior supervision – the Court considers that the presumption of responsibility established by section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act remains within the requisite “reasonable limits”. Noting in addition that the domestic courts examined with the greatest attention the applicants'arguments relating to the third applicant's good faith and their defence that the content of the offending statement had not been fixed in advance, the Court concludes that in the present case they did not apply section 93 - 3 of the 1982 Act in a way which infringed the presumption of innocence.",

The Government submitted that this type of measure had already been used by the courts as a means of reparation in the context of audiovisual communication, citing – though without providing either a copy or a reference – a judgment given by the Paris tribunal de grande instance on 10 June 1983 requiring a television channel to broadcast an announcement.",

On the first point, the Government said that the domestic courts had conducted a detailed examination of the case and the parties'arguments before finding that the information broadcast on France Info had damaged Mr Junot's honour and good name. In particular, the order requiring Radio France to broadcast an announcement by way of civil reparation had appropriately reflected the circumstances of the case. On the second point, the Government argued that the conviction of the second and third applicants had been proportionate on account of the particular gravity of the damage to Mr Junot's honour and good name – the bulletin complained of had been broadcast a large number of times on a station with a very large audience, it had incautiously referred without comment to unverified facts and it had suggested a parallel with the Papon case (which betrayed a lack of impartiality) – and of the moderate nature of the fines and the awards of damages. Nor was the order against Radio France disproportionate: the domestic courts had limited its obligation to the requirement that it broadcast the announcement every two hours for twenty-four hours (a total of twelve times, as compared with around sixty repetitions of the offending statement), and the content of the announcement had responded point by point to the defamatory imputations broadcast on France Info. The applicants'argument that this measure had unduly reduced the editorial space of France Info was invalid, since news was broadcast round the clock on that channel. Moreover, since the operation of France Info depended on public funds, it could not be affected by the broadcasting of a dozen announcements over a period of twenty-four hours."

The question of the role of the French State in the deportation operations during the Occupation was a question of general interest to society which lay “at the heart of contemporary debate”. The bulletins complained of had not been intended to damage Mr Junot's reputation but to shed further light on a period of history of interest to the public. The applicants also emphasised the fact that the article published in Le Point to which the bulletins referred had been based on serious documentary material made up of official correspondence written by Mr Junot “which revealed his participation in operations to maintain order around the camps at the time when the deportation transports were being put together”.

The applicant company was ordered, by way of civil reparation, to broadcast a number of times on France Info an announcement about the judgment.

It considers that, as its case-law requires (see, for example, Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316 - B, pp. 71 et seq., § § 37 et seq.), that measure had a basis in domestic law and was foreseeable. Firstly, the applicant company's civil liability for defamatory remarks broadcast on the radio channels it runs is founded on Article 1382 of the Civil Code, which provides: “Any act committed by a person that causes damage to another shall render the person through whose fault the damage was caused liable to make reparation for it”. Secondly, it is established French case-law that the trial courts alone have power to determine the manner in which damage is to be made good and that they may order reparation in kind. On this last point, although the Government have not established that the courts regularly order measures of this type in cases involving audiovisual communication – they merely mentioned a first-instance judgment but did not provide a copy or a reference – the publication of announcements about judicial decisions is nevertheless, in France, one of the usual forms of reparation for damage caused through the medium of the press ( see, mutatis mutandis, Prisma Presse v. France (dec.), no. 71612/01, 1 July 2003).",
                "In addition, the Court has previously held that “national laws concerning the calculation of damages for injury to reputation must make allowance for an open-ended variety of factual situations” and that accordingly the words “prescribed by law” do not require that a party to judicial proceedings should be able to “anticipate with any degree of certainty the quantum of damages that could be awarded in his particular case” (see Tolstoy Miloslavsky, cited above, p. 73, § 41). It considers that a similar approach may be followed, mutatis mutandis, where reparation in kind is concerned.",

As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly.",

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "The Court's task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts."

                "There is no doubt that the attitude of senior French administrative officers during the Occupation is a question commanding the highest public interest and that the broadcasting of information about it forms an integral part of the task allotted to the media in a democratic society. Moreover, the information published in Le Point and the news bulletins complained of was a contribution to a public debate which was already going on at the material time and was focused on the trial of Maurice Papon, the chief executive officer at the prefecture of Gironde from May 1942 to August 1944, for aiding and abetting arbitrary arrests, false imprisonment, murders and attempted murders all constituting crimes against humanity.",

Michel Junot, now aged 80, was Deputy Prefect of Pithiviers at the time. He admits that he organised the departure of a transport of deportees to Drancy. Michel Junot, whom General de Gaulle removed from office at the end of the war, claims to have been in the Resistance and subsequently rose through the ranks of the civil service. In his defence, the former deputy mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995 maintains, like Maurice Papon, that he knew nothing of the fate of the deported Jews and says that the discreet veil of history should be drawn over the crimes of those days.”",
                "This item was broadcast for the first time at 5 p.m. on 31 January 1997 and repeated by the third applicant and other journalists sixty-two times between 6 p.m. on 31 January and 11.04 a.m. on 1 February, either in the same form or with slightly different wording, but in each case it was pointed out that the information concerned had been published in Le Point. From 11 p.m. onwards a number of bulletins and newsflashes included the information that, “unlike Maurice Papon”, Mr Junot had not ordered anyone to be arrested, interned or transferred to Drancy, sometimes adding that he had only been responsible for “maintaining order”. Beginning at 5.45 a.m. on 1 February, a number of newsflashes and bulletins (broadcast at 6.45, 7, 7.15, 8, 8.15, 8.23, 8.30, 8.45 and 9.33 a.m.) mentioned that Mr Junot denied the accusations in Le Point.

            [
                "36. In its judgment of 17 June 1998, the Paris Court of Appeal held that in imputing to Mr Junot supervision of the deportation of a thousand Jews and the organisation of their dispatching to Drancy, in comparing his situation to that of Maurice Papon – who had just been committed for trial in the Assize Court – and in insinuating that he had not been a member of the Resistance, the above bulletin had damaged his honour and dignity and was consequently defamatory. The Court of Appeal went on to say: “Calumnious imputations are deemed to be in bad faith unless it can be established that they were made in pursuit of a legitimate aim, without any personal animosity, after a serious investigation and in temperate language ”, and found that, although the first two of those conditions had been satisfied, the same was not true of the other two. As regards the third condition, the Court of Appeal found that the third applicant had broadcast the bulletin complained of when Le Point had only just come out, had used as his only sources three press agency dispatches reporting the article in that publication – a fact which did not show that he had checked the information – and a television programme in which Mr Junot had taken part, and had gratuitously asserted that Mr Junot admitted that his conduct had been blameworthy. As regards the fourth condition, the Court of Appeal held that the imputations contained in the information broadcast had been disproportionate in relation to the objective material which the applicants claimed to have had at their disposal. It considered that the use of the conditional tense and “the mention – very late in the day – of Mr Junot's denials ” did not attenuate “ the gravity of the allegations made in dispatches broadcast several dozen times ”, and that the content of the documents quoted in Le Point did not justify the construction that had been placed upon them in the news bulletins. On that point, it said: “All these texts portray an official dedicated to fulfilling his functions of maintaining public order and defending the political interests of the government. They do not support, without overstating the case, an assertion that Mr Junot supervised the camps or played a role in the deportation of the Jews. ”"

Nevertheless, journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see, in particular, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § 59). Moreover, a general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press's role of providing information on current events, opinions and ideas (see Thoma, cited above, § 64).",

It cannot therefore be validly maintained that merely by broadcasting those bulletins the third applicant failed to discharge his obligation to act in good faith.

While it is true that the article stated that a transport of a thousand interned Jews had left Pithiviers on 20 September 1942 “under Junot's responsibility”, there was nothing in it – any more than there was in the interview with Mr Junot – to indicate that he had admitted organising the departure of that transport.",

His writings did not touch upon political issues, but rather on general moral themes. A circle of sympathisers had formed around him, who tried to follow his view of Islam in their own lives. Akram Yuldashev's supporters argued that there was no such thing as an organised group known as Akramia. The name “Akramia” was derived by an Uzbek court in 1999 from Akram Yuldashev's first name. Furthermore, Akram Yuldashev and his supporters denied having any links with Hizb-ut-Tahrir."

The charges included “terrorism” and premeditated, aggravated murder – capital offences – as well as attempting to overthrow the constitutional order and organising mass disturbances. At least 230 people were convicted and sentenced to between twelve and twenty-two years'imprisonment for their alleged participation in the unrest. All trials except one were closed to the public. The defendants'relatives and international observers were denied access to the courtroom. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and Human Rights Watch observers who were present at the only public trial from September to November 2005 were unanimous in their conclusion that the trial fell far short of international standards. They noted that all the defendants pleaded guilty to charges of “terrorism” and asked for forgiveness, while several even requested that they be given the death penalty. Their confessions, which were obtained from them during incommunicado pre-trial detention, closely followed the wording of the indictment. The observers expressed concerns that the defendants could have been subjected to torture and that their confessions could have been extracted under duress. Retained lawyers were not allowed to the detention centres or in the courtroom and were barred from representing their clients. The defendants were represented by State-appointed counsel who did not mount an active defence of the accused. There was no cross-examination of defendants or witnesses, and contradictions in the testimonies were not addressed. No witnesses for the defence were called to testify. The prosecution did not introduce any forensic, ballistic, or medical reports, nor did it present any exhibits or call expert witnesses. All the defendants were found guilty, predominantly on the basis of their confessions, and sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from fourteen to twenty years (see Human Rights Watch report of 11 May 2006 “The Andijan Massacre: one year later, still no justice”; and the report of 21 April 2006 from the OSCE/ODIHR “Trial monitoring in Uzbekistan – September/October 2005”).",

Amnesty International considers that these individuals are at great risk of suffering a violation of their right to life as a result of the likely imposition of the death penalty following what would likely be an unfair trial.

The Special Rapporteur is therefore of the opinion that States cannot resort to diplomatic assurances as a safeguard against torture and ill-treatment where there are substantial grounds for believing that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture or ill-treatment upon return.",

Moreover, with respect to the events in May 2005 in Andijan, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that there is strong, consistent and credible testimony to the effect that Uzbek military and security forces committed grave human rights violations there. The fact that the Government has rejected an international inquiry into the Andijan events, independent scrutiny of the related proceedings, and that there is no internationally accepted account of the events, is deeply worrying. Against such significant, serious and credible evidence of systematic torture by law enforcement officials in Uzbekistan, I continue to find myself appealing to Governments to refrain from transferring persons to Uzbekistan. The prohibition of torture is absolute, and States risk violating this prohibition - their obligations under international law - by transferring persons to countries where they may be at risk of torture.

In general, assessing the suitability of diplomatic assurances is relatively straightforward where they are intended to ensure that the individual concerned will not be subjected to capital punishment or certain violations of fair trial rights as a consequence of extradition. In such cases, the wanted person is transferred to a formal process, and the requesting State's compliance with the assurances can be monitored. While there is no effective remedy for the requested State or the surrendered person if the assurances are not observed, non-compliance can be readily identified and would need to be taken into account when evaluating the reliability of such assurances in any future cases.",

Reference was made in the Preface to the potential tension between a State's obligation to protect its citizens against terrorist acts and the need to uphold fundamental values. This is well illustrated by the current controversy over the use of'diplomatic assurances'in the context of deportation procedures. The prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment encompasses the obligation not to send a person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would run a real risk of being subjected to such methods. In order to avoid such a risk in given cases, certain States have chosen the route of seeking assurances from the country of destination that the person concerned will not be ill-treated. This practice is far from new, but has come under the spotlight in recent years as States have increasingly sought to remove from their territory persons deemed to endanger national security. Fears are growing that the use of diplomatic assurances is in fact circumventing the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment.",
                "39. The seeking of diplomatic assurances from countries with a poor overall record in relation to torture and ill-treatment is giving rise to particular concern. It does not necessarily follow from such a record that someone whose deportation is envisaged personally runs a real risk of being ill-treated in the country concerned; the specific circumstances of each case have to be taken into account when making that assessment. However, if in fact there would appear to be a risk of ill-treatment, can diplomatic assurances received from the authorities of a country where torture and ill-treatment is widely practised ever offer sufficient protection against that risk? It has been advanced with some cogency that even assuming those authorities do exercise effective control over the agencies that might take the person concerned into their custody (which may not always be the case), there can be no guarantee that assurances given will be respected in practice. If these countries fail to respect their obligations under international human rights treaties ratified by them, so the argument runs, why should one be confident that they will respect assurances given on a bilateral basis in a particular case?",
                "40. In response, it has been argued that mechanisms can be devised for the post-return monitoring of the treatment of a person deported, in the event of his/her being detained. While the CPT retains an open mind on this subject, it has yet to see convincing proposals for an effective and workable mechanism. To have any chance of being effective, such a mechanism would certainly need to incorporate some key guarantees, including the right of independent and suitably qualified persons to visit the individual concerned at any time, without prior notice, and to interview him/her in private in a place of their choosing. The mechanism would also have to offer means of ensuring that immediate remedial action is taken, in the event of it coming to light that assurances given were not being respected. ”",

All the governments offering diplomatic assurances had long histories and continuing records of employing torture. Governments with poor records on torture routinely denied that torture was used and failed to initiate investigations when allegations of torture were made. It was highly unlikely that those governments, which persistently breached the international ban on torture, would keep their promises not to torture a single individual. Given that the receiving states were already under a duty not to torture or ill-treat detainees, and most had ratified legally binding treaties promising to refrain from such abuse, the diplomatic assurances, which were not legally binding, did not provide any additional protection to the deportees. Moreover, there was no mechanism inherent in the assurances themselves that would enable the person subject to the assurances to enforce them or to hold the sending or receiving government accountable.

In particular, a Russian man transferred from the US to Russia had been unlawfully detained, severely beaten and denied necessary medical care, despite assurances from the Russian authorities that he would be treated humanely in accordance with Russia's domestic law and international obligations. The European Court of Human Rights, in the case of Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, ( no. 36378/02, ECHR 2005 ‑ III ), had experienced directly that diplomatic assurances were ineffective. In that case Georgia had extradited five applicants to Russia, despite an indication by the Court of interim measures requiring that none of them be extradited. The Russian Government had offered diplomatic assurances, including guarantees of humane treatment and unhindered access of the applicants to appropriate medical treatment, to legal advice and to the European Court of Human Rights. However, when the Court subsequently declared the application admissible and decided to send a fact-finding mission to visit the applicants, the Russian authorities had refused access to them.

In particular, nine Uzbek nationals extradited from Kazakhstan in November 2005 had been ill-treated by the Uzbek authorities. In June and August 2005 nine Uzbek nationals had been extradited from Kyrgyzstan to Uzbekistan, ten more Uzbek nationals had been extradited from Ukraine in February 2006. The men had been held in incommunicado detention ever since and their whereabouts had remained unknown. No independent actor or organisation had been granted access to them. In recognition of the numerous credible sources on the routine use of torture in Uzbekistan, governments in North America, Europe, and Central Asia had acknowledged that extradition to Uzbekistan of persons who were wanted by the Uzbek authorities – either because of their alleged association with the May 2005 events in Andijan or because they were perceived to be independent Muslims – would violate their international obligations. Several European governments, including the Czech Republic, Germany, Norway, Romania and Sweden, had granted full refugee status or UNHCR-mandated resettlement to Uzbek nationals fleeing persecution by the Uzbek authorities pursuant to the Andijan events or as a result of their religious or political affiliations."

                "“66. The Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations, including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens. The right to political asylum is not contained in either the Convention or its Protocols (see Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215, p. 34, § 102).",
                "67. It is the settled case-law of the Court that extradition by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question would, if extradited, face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. The establishment of such responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of conditions in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention. Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the receiving country, whether under general international law, under the Convention or otherwise. In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may be incurred, it is liability incurred by the extraditing Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, pp. 35-36, §§ 89-91).",
                "68. It would hardly be compatible with the'common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law'to which the Preamble refers, were a Contracting State knowingly to surrender a person to another State where there were substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (see Soering, cited above, pp. 34-35, § 88).",
                "69. In determining whether substantial grounds have been shown for believing that a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 exists, the Court will assess the issue in the light of all the material placed before it or, if necessary, material obtained proprio motu. Since the nature of the Contracting States'responsibility under Article 3 in cases of this kind lies in the act of exposing an individual to the risk of ill-treatment, the existence of the risk must be assessed primarily with reference to those facts which were known or ought to have been known to the Contracting State at the time of the extradition; the Court is not precluded, however, from having regard to information which comes to light subsequent to the extradition. This may be of value in confirming or refuting the appreciation that has been made by the Contracting Party of the well-foundedness or otherwise of an applicant's fears (see Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden, judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, pp. 29-30, §§ 75-76, and Vilvarajah and Others, cited above, p. 36, § 107).",

                "This situation typically arises when deportation or extradition is delayed as a result of an indication by the Court of an interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. Such an indication means more often than not that the Court does not yet have before it all the relevant evidence it requires to determine whether there is a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3 in the country of destination.",

The assessment of this minimum is, in the nature of things, relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the treatment or punishment, the manner and method of its execution, its duration and its physical or mental effects (see Vilvarajah and Others, cited above, p. 36, § 107).",

The applicants claimed that their extradition to Uzbekistan would expose them to a danger of ill-treatment and capital punishment. They also lodged applications for asylum, reiterating their fears of torture and persecution for political motives. They supported their submissions with reports prepared by UN institutions and international NGOs describing the ill-treatment of detainees in Uzbekistan.

Since they have not yet been extradited owing to an indication by the Court of an interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the material date for the assessment of that risk is that of the Court's consideration of the case. It follows that, although the historical position is of interest in so far as it may shed light on the current situation and its likely evolution, it is the present conditions which are decisive (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V, § 86)."

At the time when the extradition decisions were issued against the applicants those offences were classified as capital under the Uzbek Criminal Code. The applicants therefore ran the risk of a death sentence. However, capital punishment was abolished in Uzbekistan as from 1 January 2008 (see paragraph 26 above). The Court considers that the risk of the imposition of the death penalty on the applicants was thereby eliminated so that no issue arises under Article 3 in this respect."

It reiterates, however, that in cases where the applicant – or a third party within the meaning of Article 36 of the Convention – provides reasoned grounds which cast doubt on the accuracy of the information relied on by the respondent Government, the Court must be satisfied that the assessment made by the authorities of the Contracting State is adequate and sufficiently supported by domestic materials as well as by materials originating from other reliable and objective sources such as, for instance, other Contracting or non-Contracting States, agencies of the United Nations and reputable non-governmental organisations. In its supervisory task under Article 19 of the Convention, it would be too narrow an approach under Article 3 in cases concerning aliens facing expulsion or extradition if the Court, as an international human rights court, were only to take into account materials made available by the domestic authorities of the Contracting State concerned, without comparing these with materials from other reliable and objective sources (see Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. 1948/04, § 136, ECHR 2007 ‑ ...

In particular, in 2002 the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture described the practice of torture upon those in police custody as “systematic” and “indiscriminate”. His successor in this post announced in 2006 that his mandate continued to receive serious allegations of torture by Uzbek law enforcement officials (see paragraphs 74 and 98 above). At the end of 2006 the UN Secretary General also drew attention to the continuing problems of the widespread mistreatment of prisoners and complained that inadequate measures were taken to bring those responsible to justice ( see paragraph 78 above). Moreover, no concrete evidence has been produced of any fundamental improvement in the protection against torture in Uzbekistan in recent years. Although the Uzbek government adopted certain measures designed to combat the practice of torture (see the Government's submissions in paragraph 109 above), there is no evidence that those measures returned any positive results.

It is not necessary for the Court to enter into a consideration of the Government's untested allegations about the applicants'terrorist activities because they are not relevant for its analysis under Article 3. The Court is well aware of the immense difficulties faced by States in modern times in protecting their communities from terrorist violence. However, even in these circumstances, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the victim's conduct. The prohibition provided by Article 3 against ill-treatment is equally absolute in expulsion and extradition cases. Thus, whenever substantial grounds have been shown for believing that an individual would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 if removed to another State, the responsibility of the Contracting State to safeguard him or her against such treatment is engaged in the event of expulsion or extradition. In these circumstances, the activities of the individual in question, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be a material consideration (see, mutatis mutandis, Chahal, cited above, §§ 79 to 81; and Saadi, cited above, §§ 138 to 141 )."

In its judgment in the Chahal case the Court cautioned against reliance on diplomatic assurances against torture from a State where torture is endemic or persistent (see Chahal, cited above, § 105 ). In the recent case of Saadi v. Italy the Court also found that diplomatic assurances were not in themselves sufficient to ensure adequate protection against the risk of ill-treatment where reliable sources had reported practices resorted to or tolerated by the authorities which were manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention (see Saadi, cited above, §§ 147 and 148 ).

In this connection, Article 5 § 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 § 1 (c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that “action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition”.

It also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, § 41, where remarks were made by a minister and police superintendent to the press naming without qualification the applicant, arrested that day, as an accomplice to murder; see also Daktaras v.

In the present case, the Court must also ascertain whether there was any close link, in legislation, practice or fact, between the impugned statements made in the context of the extradition proceedings and the criminal proceedings pending against the applicants in Uzbekistan which might be regarded as sufficient to render the applicants “charged with a criminal offence” within the meaning of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention (compare Zollmann, cited above)."

The extradition proceedings were therefore a direct consequence, and the concomitant, of the criminal investigation pending against the applicants in Uzbekistan. The Court therefore considers that there was a close link between the criminal proceedings in Uzbekistan and the extradition proceedings justifying the extension of the scope of the application of Article 6 § 2 to the latter. Moreover, the wording of the extradition decisions clearly shows that the prosecutor regarded the applicants as “charged with criminal offences” which is in itself sufficient to bring into play the applicability of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention. The Court also notes that in the case of P. and R.H. and L.L. v. Austria ( no. 15776/89, Commission decision of 5 December 1989, Decisions and Reports (DR) 64, p. 269) the Commission considered the applicants awaiting extradition from Austria to the United States as “charged with a criminal offence” within the meaning of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention.

The Court reiterates that the presumption of innocence will be violated if a judicial decision or a statement by a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved guilty according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court emphasises the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Böhmer v. Germany, no. 37568/97, § § 54 and 56, 3 October 2002; and Nešťák v. Slovakia, no. 65559/01, § § 88 and 89, 27 February 2007 )."

However, the applicants'complaint is not directed against the extradition as such, but rather against the reasoning contained in the extradition decisions. The Court considers that an extradition decision may raise an issue under Article 6 § 2 if supporting reasoning which cannot be dissociated from the operative provisions amounts in substance to the determination of the person's guilt (see, mutadis mutandis, Lutz v.

The Ivanovo Regional Court found that the extradition decisions only described the charges against the applicants, and did not contain any findings as to their guilt ( see paragraph 72 above). However, that interpretation was at odds with the unambiguous wording of the extradition decisions, namely that the applicants had “committed” the imputed offences.

Nor did the fact that the members of the appeal Chamber had been appointed by the President make any difference. In this regard the Government presented copies of eleven decisions by the Supreme Court where various petitions by the President of the Supreme Court or the President of the Criminal Division had been wholly or partially rejected, regardless of the fact that in some of those cases the same senior judicial officer had both appointed and petitioned the appeal judges."

It was only after this decision that the prosecutor could proceed with the bill of indictment and the conclusion of the pre-trial investigation. Otherwise, any doubt in favour of the applicant would have led to the withdrawal of the charges against him. In this context the prosecutor was required either to adopt a reasoned decision confirming the validity of the suspicion or to discontinue the case.

While the use of the term “proved” is unfortunate, the Court considers that, having regard to the context in which the word was used, both the applicant and the prosecutor were referring not to the question whether the applicant's guilt had been established by the evidence – which was clearly not one for the determination of the prosecutor – but to the question whether the case file disclosed sufficient evidence of the applicant's guilt to justify proceeding to trial."

Relying also on Article 6 of the Convention, the applicant submitted another plea regarding the Assize Court ’s refusal to order a second opinion.

If they have been communicated to all the parties so that there has been an opportunity for adversarial argument about them, the production of such documents cannot legitimately be said to have any adverse effect on the rights of the defence.",

Lastly, the applicant submitted that the rejection of his application for a second opinion had constituted a breach of the rights of the defence because a second opinion had been essential in view both of the expert’s volte-face and of the influence that the latter’s abrupt change of mind might have had in establishing the defendant’s criminal responsibility and deciding on the sentence most suited to him personally. On the latter point, the applicant noted that the sentence imposed on him (eighteen years’ imprisonment) had been heavier than that imposed on the three other co-defendants (ten years’ imprisonment, a five-year fully suspended prison sentence with probation and a five-year prison sentence one year of which was suspended with probation)."

The latter did not decide the case on the written evidence but on the evidence adduced in court. While the defendant was free to choose his defence, the prosecution had the right to produce new evidence in support of its argument. The documents in issue in the instant case had been intended to provide information about the applicant’s personality. The Government pointed out that the Assize Court had confirmed that possibility in its interlocutory judgment of 13 March 1997 and stated that the documents in issue had been communicated to the parties and there had been an opportunity to examine them adversarially."

In that connection, the Government observed that although, in his initial application, the applicant had criticised the filing of evidence taken from proceedings long before, he had narrowed the scope of that complaint in his further observations, merely alleging a lack of time to prepare his defence. The Government pointed out that the complaint in question had never been raised before the Assize Court. It was only after the expert had made his submissions, and having regard to the possible impact of his statements, that the applicant’s lawyer applied for the investigation to be reopened and the hearing to be adjourned to a subsequent session."

They noted in that connection that copies of the documents in issue had been distributed to each of the lawyers of the civil parties and the defence lawyers. Moreover, the examination of the applicant as to his background had been adjourned until the afternoon to give the applicant and his counsel the time they needed to study the new evidence. The applicant’s lawyer had also been granted an adjournment to prepare his application to reject the documents in issue and had thus been able to criticise them. The defence had also been able to present its version of the facts on the second and third days of the trial and had been given the last word, in accordance with the provisions of Article 346 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. At all events, the Government pointed out that the applicant had not been unaware of the existence of those documents and that his sexual problems in adolescence had already been mentioned in the report on his personality drawn up by the investigating judge. No evidence had therefore been concealed."

Furthermore, with regard to the psychiatrist’s evidence at the trial, the Government pointed out that psychiatric experts played no part in establishing whether defendants had committed the offences of which they were accused since their sole function was to help the court to arrive at a more informed opinion about the personality of the accused, so that it could determine, inter alia, his degree of responsibility at the material time. The expert’s comments on the documents in issue came within the scope of his freedom of expression. The Government also pointed out that, as a skilled professional, the expert was entirely at liberty to assess the time he required to familiarise himself with the documents on the file that would provide him with useful information and form an opinion on their potential impact on his previous diagnosis. If the expert had thought the adjournment was not long enough, he would have asked for an extension or even for an adjournment until the following morning in view of the late hour at which he was examined. Moreover, it was impossible to know exactly what the expert had said in evidence because all proceedings before the Assize Court were oral. At all events and contrary to what the applicant asserted, the Government considered that the expert’s oral evidence had not conflicted with his report, which had already pointed to the accused’s psychopathic traits and signs of sexual perversion."

The Government also pointed out that the applicant had had an opportunity to contradict the psychiatric expert’s comments freely because he had been able to exercise his right to examine him in accordance with Article 168 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Assize Court had not considered it necessary to allow the applicant’s application for a second opinion to be ordered because nine other witnesses had been heard after the psychiatric expert. The Government argued that the right to a second opinion was not an absolute right under the requirements of the Convention, the national courts being free to judge for themselves whether it was appropriate to order a second opinion."

The complaint can be divided into three parts: firstly, the applicant alleged an infringement of the principle of equality of arms and the rights of the defence on account of the circumstances in which the prosecution had filed new documents at the beginning of the trial in the Assize Court and the lack of time that his lawyer had had to prepare his defence thereafter; secondly, he complained that the expert had had only a quarter of an hour to study the new evidence, which nonetheless had caused him to effect a complete volte-face in his submissions; finally, the applicant considered it unfair of the Assize Court to reject his application for a second opinion when the expert’s change of mind had strongly influenced the jury’s opinion in a direction that was unfavourable to him."

On 13, 14 and 15 March there followed the examination of the defendants, the hearing of the witnesses and the expert, the civil parties’ pleadings, the deputy public prosecutor’s submissions, the pleadings of the co-defendants’ lawyers and finally the pleadings by the lawyer of the main defendant, namely the applicant, which were submitted from 7.05 to 8.45 p.m. on 15 March 1997 and brought the hearing to a close (the court and the jury then retired to discuss the verdict, which they delivered some three hours later at 11.45 p.m.)."

The Court notes that the hearing of Dr Gautier, one of the experts appointed during the investigation, began in the late afternoon of 13 March when he read out his written report. In that connection, the Court would point out that the psychiatric opinion ordered during the investigation was intended to determine whether the applicant suffered from any kind of mental or psychological anomaly and, if so, whether there was a link between that disorder and the offences of which he stood accused. It was also supposed to assess how dangerous the defendant was. The two experts appointed by the investigating judge concluded that the offences with which the applicant had been charged, and of which his nephews and niece, the alleged victims, had accused him, were linked with a state of sexual perversion. They stated, however, that it was difficult to assess the extent and nature of that perversion – in so far as the applicant presented the facts as isolated incidents – or to gauge the applicant’s potential for rehabilitation since a cure would be possible only if his underlying sexual problems were more clearly identified. The experts also asserted that the applicant was not dangerous in the psychiatric sense of that term. Consequently, their written report was, though not favourable towards the applicant, at least mitigated."

The expert was thus able to study a statement dating from 1979 in which the applicant spontaneously admitted to having sexually interfered with young children of both sexes on a dozen or so occasions."

Similarly, the right to a fair trial does not require that a national court should appoint, at the request of the defence, a further expert even when the opinion of the expert appointed by the defence supports the prosecution case (see Brandstetter v. Austria, judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 211, p. 22, § 46). Accordingly, the refusal to order a second opinion cannot in itself be regarded as unfair."

By the time of the Revolution in 1789 there were seventy-three attorneys at the King's Bench. The Revolution brought their activities to an end. They became counsel at the Tribunal of Cassation that was created in 1790, and subsequently, in 1804, members of the Court of Cassation Bar. Another group of lawyers practised at the Conseil d'Etat. The two groups were merged by an ordinance of 10 September 1817. That ordinance, which for many years served as the Bar Council Charter, was amended by a decree of 28 October 1991 (which codified the conditions of access to the profession and has since undergone a number of subsequent amendments; see also the law of 20 March 1948, which made women eligible to enter the profession, and the decree of 15 March 1978, allowing lawyers to practise in professional partnerships).

The Government could not therefore contend that Article 6 § 3 only concerned “persons charged, but not yet convicted”. In addition, the right to conduct one's own defence was a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 6 (see Foucher v. France, judgment of 18 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II) that was also applicable in proceedings before the Court of Cassation. He said that in Voisine v. France (no. 27362/95, 8 February 2000) the Court had noted that the applicant in that case, who had not been represented by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, had not benefited from the practice whereby advocates-general at the Court of Cassation informed counsel to the parties of the tenor of their submissions before the hearing. The applicant's rights had therefore been infringed, as he had been unable to establish the tenor of the advocate-general's submissions or to reply to them and had not been summoned to the hearing. The fact that he had not applied for legal aid could not constitute a waiver of his right to adversarial process. Litigants could not therefore, without a breach of the provisions of the Convention, be treated differently depending on whether or not they were assisted by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar."

However, under French law, the place where the debate was organised was the public hearing held by the Criminal Division and the debate began on the day of the hearing. They contended that they had been deprived of unity of time and place, as their pleadings had been lodged at the beginning of the proceedings before the Court of Cassation, whereas the advocate-general had made his submissions on the day of the hearing. Furthermore, appellants in the Court of Cassation had to make their representations in writing whereas the advocate-general made his submissions orally. The solution would therefore be to permit appellants in the Court of Cassation to take part in all the stages of the proceedings before the Criminal Division, including the hearing, with the assistance of a lawyer of their choosing, that is to say without being required to instruct a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. On that point, they challenged the monopoly of the members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, pointing out, inter alia, firstly, that lawyers practising at a European bar had sufficient technical expertise to take part in proceedings before the Court of Cassation, as attested by the fact that they were entitled to appear before all other national and European courts and, secondly, that the monopoly on the rights to address the Court of Cassation was not based on any provision of domestic law.",
                "The applicants also indicated that by virtue of Article 569 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, appeals to the Court of Cassation operated as a stay of execution of sentence. An appeal to the Court of Cassation was an essential stage in criminal proceedings, as the supervision by the judges of that court enabled any error of law by the lower courts to be corrected, both as regards the definition of the charge and the trial procedure. Consequently, convicted persons who appealed to the Court of Cassation retained their status as a person charged, both under domestic law and under the Convention, until such time as their appeal to the Court of Cassation had been dismissed. They accordingly continued to be presumed innocent and necessarily retained all the rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention."

The Government submitted that the right to defend oneself in person, guaranteed by Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention on behalf of “everyone charged with a criminal offence” (see Foucher, cited above), could not concern proceedings in the Court of Cassation, as before that court it was no longer the defendants but the decisions themselves that were subjected to legal scrutiny, without any review of the facts or decision on guilt or sentence. Accordingly, convicted persons who appealed to the Court of Cassation were no longer “[persons] charged with a criminal offence” within the meaning of Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention because, as a matter of principle, their guilt had already been established by the courts below. The guarantees under Article 6 § 3 (c) should not therefore extend to stages of the proceedings, such as an appeal to the Court of Cassation, that did not concern the determination of the charge. In any event, the right to conduct one's own defence could be regulated by domestic law (see, among other authorities, Croissant v. Germany, judgment of 25 September 1992, Series A no. 237-B; Correia de Matos v. Portugal (dec.), no. 48188/99, ECHR 2001-XII). The Government accordingly concluded that the Convention did not prohibit States from making an accused's representation by a lawyer compulsory for certain aspects of criminal proceedings before trial and appeal courts and that, a fortiori, there was nothing to guarantee appellants in the Court of Cassation a right to conduct their own defence at all stages of the proceedings before the Criminal Division of that court."
            ],
            [
                "37. The Government submitted that, although in exceptional circumstances domestic law afforded convicted persons appealing to the Court of Cassation a partial right to conduct their own defence, that right did not entail any possibility of their taking part in the oral stage of the proceedings unrepresented. The very specific nature of appeals to the Court of Cassation served to explain the special features of the procedure followed by that court, the desirability of using specialist lawyers and, conversely, the limited importance given to oral hearings. The ordinary procedure in both civil and criminal appeals to the Court of Cassation entailed in principle compulsory representation by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, a rule that did not in any respect contravene the provisions of the Convention. However, as an exception to that rule, French law did not make representation compulsory for the written stage of appeals to the Court of Cassation by persons appealing against conviction. Such persons were entitled to sign the notice of appeal and to lodge a signed pleading in person in accordance with the statutory rules. Regard being had to the essentially written nature of the procedure, all appellants therefore had the same rights to put forward their arguments, whether they were acting in person, or were assisted, either by a member of the ordinary bar or by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. In addition, whether drafted by an appellant in person or signed by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, the written submissions crystallised once and for all the arguments that could be made against the impugned decision, such that no further points could be added orally. It was neither necessary nor usual for members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar to make oral submissions: since oral submissions were optional under Article 602 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar did not even attend hearings, save in the very rare instances when they wished to address the court at hearings in which the argument was always highly technical and largely incomprehensible to the layperson. Although appellants to the Court of Cassation could nevertheless make an application under an ordinance of 15 January 1826 for permission to appear in person, without being represented by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, such applications were very rarely granted, as they were of no real benefit to an appellant lacking the requisite knowledge of the law governing appeals to the Court of Cassation or of the techniques used in such appeals. Offering appellants the right to make oral representations at the hearing would therefore only create an appearance that the adversarial principle was being observed, whereas that principle constituted a right that was intended to be concrete and effective, not purely formal. Moreover, in Voisine, cited above, the Court had acknowledged that the special nature of the procedure before the Court of Cassation could justify the monopoly of the right to make oral representations being reserved to specialist lawyers, notwithstanding its finding of a violation of Article 6 for the failure to communicate the advocate-general's submissions. Indeed, in Reinhardt and Slimane-Kaïd (judgment of 31 March 1998, Reports 1998-II, p. 666, § 106) the Court had said that the practice currently used, whereby advocates-general informed the parties' lawyers prior to the hearing of the tenor of their submissions and the parties' lawyers were entitled in cases where there was an oral hearing to reply to them, afforded the parties an opportunity of apprising themselves of the advocate-general's submissions and of commenting on them in a satisfactory manner. In the Government's submission, only a practice of that type could guarantee an effective debate. Incidentally, statistical data for the year 2000 clearly showed that unassisted appellants were four times less likely to be successful in an appeal to the Court of Cassation than parties assisted by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. That was a reflection of the difficulty experienced by unrepresented appellants in formulating valid points of law."

The Government added that it was always open to a convicted appellant to obtain assistance from a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar in order to take part in the oral stage of the proceedings before the Criminal Division, as the latter operated a particularly liberal legal-aid scheme. At the material time, it was the practice systematically to grant provisional legal aid in criminal cases to convicted persons who had lodged an appeal to the Court of Cassation. That practice had now been abandoned save in exceptional cases, but legal-aid applications were dealt with very rapidly. Accordingly, appellants who, like the applicants, decided not to be represented by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, either chosen by them or assigned by the legal-aid office, deliberately chose the written procedure rather than a different procedure offering the advantages of assistance by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. In the instant case, the applicants had had at their disposal all the information they needed to take their decision: Mr Meftah had been advised by a citizens advice bureau, and Mr Adoud and Mr Bosoni by their lawyer, who had also acted for Mr Voisine."

Spain, judgment of 19 December 1997, Reports 1997-VIII). In the instant case, the three applicants had had a fair hearing before the trial and appeal courts and their grounds of appeal had been duly examined by the Court of Cassation.

                "The Court reiterates that the guarantees contained in paragraph 3 of Article 6 are specific aspects of the general concept of a fair trial set forth in paragraph 1. The various rights of which a non-exhaustive list appears in paragraph 3 reflect certain of the aspects of the notion of a fair trial in criminal proceedings (see, among other authorities, Unterpertinger v. Austria, judgment of 24 November 1986, Series A no. 110, p. 14, § 29, and Granger v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 March 1990, Series A no. 174, p. 17, § 43). When compliance with paragraph 3 is being reviewed, its basic purpose must not be forgotten nor must it be severed from its roots (see Artico v. Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, p. 15, § 32). The Court therefore considers complaints under Article 6 § 3 under those two provisions taken together (see, among many other authorities, the following judgments: Delta v. France, 19 December 1990, Series A no. 191-A, p. 15, § 34; Vacher v. France, 17 December 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ VI, p. 2147, § 22; Melin v. France, 22 June 1993, Series A no. 261-A, p. 11, § 21; and Foucher, cited above, p. 464, § 30).",
                "Furthermore, as a “criminal charge” is an autonomous notion, the Court is not bound by the classifications in domestic law, which have only relative value (see, among other authorities, the following judgments: Öztürk v. Germany, 21 February 1984, Series A no. 73, pp. 17-18, §§ 49-50; Bendenoun v. France, 24 February 1994, Series A no. 284, p. 20, § 47; and Malige v. France, 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, p. 2935, § 34). The Court considers that the Court of Cassation procedure is a stage in the French criminal proceedings which may have repercussions upon the conviction or the sentencing of a person by lower courts, enabling any error of law committed by a lower court to be corrected, a matter which may have a serious impact upon the determination of a criminal charge.",
                "Consequently, the applicants cannot be deprived of the right to benefit from the guarantees of paragraph 3 of Article 6 on the ground that, for the purposes of their appeal to the Court of Cassation, they were considered by French law to be “convicted persons” and no longer “persons charged with a criminal offence”."

The manner in which Article 6 § 1 applies to courts of appeal or of cassation depends on the special features of the proceedings concerned and account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings conducted in the domestic legal order and the Court of Cassation's role in them. Given the special nature of the Court of Cassation's role, which is limited to reviewing whether the law has been correctly applied, the Court is able to accept that the procedure followed in the Court of Cassation may be more formal (see the following judgments: Levages Prestations Services v. France, 23 October 1996, Reports 1996-V, pp. 1544-45, §§ 45-48; K.D.B. v. the Netherlands, 27 March 1998, Reports 1998-II, p. 630, § 38; and Brualla Gómez de la Torre, cited above, p. 2956, § 37).",
                "The Court has held on a number of occasions that, provided that there has been a public hearing at first instance, the absence of public hearings at second or third instance may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Thus, proceedings for leave to appeal or proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6 even where the appellant was not given an opportunity of being heard in person by the appeal or cassation court (see the following judgments: Sutter v. Switzerland, 22 February 1984, Series A no. 74, p. 13, § 30; Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, Series A no. 115, p. 22, § 58; Ekbatani v. Sweden, 26 May 1988, Series A no. 134, p. 14, § 31; Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, Series A no. 168, pp. 44-45, § 106; and Bulut v.

The special features of the procedure before the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation must therefore be taken into account in determining whether the applicants' right to a fair trial was infringed (see Kamasinski, cited above, pp. 44-45, § 106). Under French law, the Court of Cassation carries out supervision which is limited to compliance with the law, including jurisdictional and procedural rules, to the exclusion of any examination of the facts in the strict sense, such examination being within the sole province of the courts below. Save for exceptions, the procedure before the Court of Cassation is essentially written, that rule applying also when a party is represented by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. Members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar do not enjoy an absolute right to make oral observations: any member wishing to do so at the hearing must first contact the President of the Criminal Division in order to inform him or her of the points of law which they intend to raise and to determine by agreement the arrangements under which they will be allowed to do so (see paragraph 31 above)."

In the present case, the Court notes that the appeals to the Court of Cassation were lodged after the applicants' arguments had been examined by both the trial courts and the courts of appeal, which had had full jurisdiction and, in compliance with the rules laid down by Article 6, had held hearings at which the applicants or their lawyer had appeared and presented their case."

As regards the right for appellants in the Court of Cassation to make oral representations at the hearing, it should be noted that any legal argument at a hearing before the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation will be particularly technical and concern only points of law (see paragraph 24 above), as no further submissions may be made on the facts beyond the court of appeal stage, unless the case is remitted by the Court of Cassation. Thus, in the Court's view, it would be unduly formalistic to interpret the procedural requirements as meaning that the applicants should have been permitted to make oral representations at the hearing before the Court of Cassation. It is clear that, in addition to entailing a risk of negative repercussions in terms of increased litigation, such an approach would not assist in resolving issues that are essentially in written form and technical, and largely inaccessible to someone without legal training (see Pham Hoang v. France, judgment of 25 September 1992, Series A no 243, p. 23, § 40)."

                "The Court reiterates that the right for everyone charged with a criminal offence to be defended by counsel of his own choosing (see Pakelli v. Germany, judgment of 25 April 1983, Series A no. 64, p. 15, § 31) cannot be considered to be absolute and, consequently the national courts may override that person's choice when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice (see Croissant, cited above, p. 33, § 29).",
                "Furthermore, account must be taken of Directive 98/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 and to the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities on that directive, which provides that in order to ensure the smooth operation of the justice system, member States may lay down specific rules for access to supreme courts, such as the use of specialist lawyers (see paragraph 32 above).",
                "In any event, like lawyers from the ordinary bar, members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar are members of a regulated legal profession who are independent of the courts.

But even in the former case the written submissions crystallise all the arguments against the impugned decision. Oral submissions are optional, under Article 602 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and, in practice, members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar do not attend hearings, save in very rare cases (see paragraph 37 above). It has to be acknowledged that some High Contracting Parties to the Convention operate a similar system, whereas others require appellants to be represented by a lawyer. In the Court's view, such an option is undoubtedly sufficient to justify a difference in procedure, since whether or not the appellant is represented depends not on a rule of automatic application but on the appellant's own choice. Self-evidently, the fact that the appellant has made that choice and, consequently, waived the advantages to be gained from having the assistance of a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar, must be established in an unequivocal manner (see Colozza v. Italy, judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, pp. 14-15, § 28). The Court considers that French law affords sufficient guarantees in that connection. In any event, Mr Adoud and Mr Bosoni were assisted by a member of the ordinary bar who was fully competent to inform them of the consequences of their choice which, in the circumstances of the instant case, was therefore freely made and conscious. The same applies to Mr Meftah, who was advised by a citizens advice bureau during the proceedings before the domestic courts."

In the light of the fact that only questions of pure law are argued before the Court of Cassation and that the parties are represented in that court by highly specialised lawyers, that practice affords parties an opportunity of apprising themselves of the advocate-general's submissions and commenting on them in a satisfactory manner. It has not, however, been shown that such a practice existed at the material time.",

It is noteworthy that the applicant, of foreign origin and unfamiliar with the Greek language and legal system, was unable to indicate any grounds of appeal in his written notice of appeal and that this failure resulted in his appeal being declared inadmissible (see paragraphs 16 and 18 above)."

However, according to the case-law of the Court of Cassation as confirmed by the letter of 23 February 1995 of the deputy public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation addressed to the Agent of the Government, the Code of Criminal Procedure does not provide for legal aid in connection with such appeals (see paragraphs 21 and 26 above). Although the Government have submitted that free legal assistance can be granted by the Bar Council to appellants in cassation proceedings under Article 201 § 6 of the Code of Lawyers (see paragraph 48 above), they have not provided any concrete examples of how this scheme operates in practice.

They did so extensively. The hearings took up a great deal of time. The shortest hearing of an unidentified witness lasted nearly two hours (46203); the longest about five hours (BRZ08). The hearings of witnesses Jansen and Koene each lasted a good five hours. This information may perhaps be of use in assessing the suggestion that was made on 3 October 1990 to the Court of Appeal, that all the witnesses should be heard by the Court in a single day.",

Once the text existed in draft form, those present were invariably given the opportunity to make comments, request clarification and put further questions. Where necessary the statement was then amended, clarified and expanded - always, of course, within the limits of what the witness really wanted to say. And even if ... there are drawbacks to the manner in which the hearings of the unidentified witnesses were carried out, it is my belief that the advocate-general and the defence had sufficient opportunity to question the witnesses thoroughly at the hearings. Those present really did have the opportunity for hours on each occasion. If they so desired, those present had several chances to put questions to a witness. Unlike what normally happens at court hearings, everyone was able to follow the entire transcription of the statements and then still obtain clarifications and additions. Questions were barred only on substantive grounds (see the records for details), not by reason of the time taken for the interrogations.",

I have no reason to doubt their reliability. Nor at any time did I have the impression that I was being lied to. On the contrary, each and every one of them was very much to the point. The persons facing me wore serious expressions. The unidentified witnesses were clearly quite aware of the serious nature of the oath or pledge they had given and of the very great interests at stake, especially for the accused persons involved. The calm, quiet manner in which, for example, BRZ0 3 and BRZ08 related their experiences in Leende (in which connection I expressly leave it to the Court of Appeal to decide whether these accused persons were the perpetrators) was impressive and certainly gave no indication of malice towards the accused. All the witnesses manifested a certain degree of wariness, which, in view of their desire to remain anonymous and the sometimes rather forceful manner of questioning on the part of [two of the defence lawyers] in particular, did not bother me.",
                "If all the statements are laid side by side, some differences of detail can be observed. I do not think that these differences are such as to warrant the conclusion that the witnesses may be unreliable. Rather, in so far as I have observed any differences, I would describe them rather as the ‘ extraneous noise ’ which in my experience practically always affects statements by witnesses. Of course it is ultimately for the Court of Appeal to decide on the value of the statements.",
                "The reasons for the witnesses wishing to remain anonymous in the instant case are given in the records of the hearings. It seems to me that I am now affording the Court an opportunity to reflect on the value of those arguments. I think that the text of the recent judgments of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands also compels me, as the judge conducting the questioning, to state my opinion on the reasons given by the witnesses for remaining anonymous. I am also concerned to inform the Court of Appeal that I am aware that the Court is called to take the final decision in these matters. I consider the reasons behind the desire to remain anonymous to be such as fully to justify anonymity. I have had regard in this connection to the nature of these cases and to the nature of the activities of the anonymous witnesses concerned.",
                "I take the liberty of observing - while expressly leaving aside the question whether these accused persons are the perpetrators - that the instant case tellingly illustrates the fact that there are evidently people for whom human lives do not count when it comes to evading responsibility for exceptionally serious crimes which they may have committed.",
                "I can understand that there are major objections to revealing the names and appearance of members of arresting teams, observation teams and arresting units to the public at large. By that I mean that the obvious interest of society in having very serious crimes solved should weigh in the balance. At the same time, I am of the opinion that the conduct of the unidentified witnesses (who are no longer anonymous to myself) who have appeared in this case is the subject of proper judicial supervision. It is not apparent to me as investigating judge that the ‘ numbered witnesses ’ acted carelessly. Rather, in my opinion, the opposite was true.",
                "During the last hearing of the witness Koene, [two of the defence lawyers] asked me to record that, in their view, the witness answered not only the questions of the defence but also questions by the investigating judge in a ponderous, deliberate manner that was hard to follow. I have been asked to endorse that opinion. I decline to do so. The witness Koene was wary in his answers, which I find understandable in view of the barrage of questions - which were not always formulated equally clearly. It must not be forgotten that a witness who is being questioned on oath about a multitude of events that occurred some years previously should not be reproached for failing, in his answers to those questions, to keep up with the tempo of the rather forceful questioning to which [the two lawyers] in particular subjected him on 8 November 1990, together and in tandem. Furthermore, I can imagine that a witness may be somewhat annoyed if he is repeatedly asked the same question, especially if he has already replied under oath on the day before. The witness Koene kept a cool head, and in so doing demonstrated a certain quality. As far as I can judge at the present time, I regard him as a reliable witness. Nor do I think that he can be regarded as a reluctant witness, if only by reason of his extensive statements in the records of 7 November and 8 November 1990.",
                "The witness Koene informed me on 15 November 1990 that on 26 January 1989 the persons numbered BRZ05 and BRZ14 were in the car with BRZ10. He gave me this information following a request by the defence.",
                "I think I ought not to omit to mention, with regard to the witness Engelen, that throughout the hours of insistent questioning he certainly did not strike me as untruthful. In my judgment, Mr Engelen is a simple, friendly and very obliging man. Perhaps I can illustrate the impression I had of him by recording that, after the interrogation had gone on for a considerable time, I thought it opportune to ask the unusual question whether the witness could read. I do not exclude the possibility that he is not entirely aware of the great importance of an exact and consistent account of what he saw.",

As already noted in the Court of Appeal ’ s interlocutory decision of 3 October 1990, the present case concerns extremely serious crimes, the [attempted murder] having been committed so as to evade recognition and arrest by the police, the perpetrators having been prepared to sacrifice a number of human lives. In these circumstances, the risk run by the witnesses identified only by a number and their families if their anonymity is lifted or insufficiently guaranteed is decisive.

In the Court ’ s opinion, the balancing of the interests of the defence against arguments in favour of maintaining the anonymity of witnesses raises special problems if the witnesses in question are members of the police force of the State. Although their interests - and indeed those of their families - also deserve protection under the Convention, it must be recognised that their position is to some extent different from that of a disinterested witness or a victim. They owe a general duty of obedience to the State ’ s executive authorities and usually have links with the prosecution; for these reasons alone their use as anonymous witnesses should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances. In addition, it is in the nature of things that their duties, particularly in the case of arresting officers, may involve giving evidence in open court."

Austria, 28 August 1992, § 21 in fine, Series A no. 242 ‑ A; Delta v. France, 19 December 1990, § 37, Series A no. 191 ‑ A; and Rachdad v. France, no. 718 46/01, § 25, 13 November 2003).",

The Court observes that the Revdinsk Town Court read out statements by ten prosecution witnesses, including Mr Sh., Mr B., Mr O. and Mr R., the applicant ’ s alleged accomplices in the robberies. None of them attended the trial or gave statements in open court. In the light of the applicant ’ s complaints, the Court must establish whether the use of the statements made by the four accomplice witnesses to the investigating authorities, coupled with the fact that the applicant was not able to confront them in court, amounted to a violation of his right to a fair trial."

Another witness for the prosecution, Ms L. , testified before the trial court that the warehouse had been robbed on 17 September 1996. The two witnesses for the defence, Mr V. and Mr Ma. , denied any knowledge of the applicant ’ s involvement in the robberies and implicated Mr R. The applicant pleaded innocent."

As to the statements by the prosecution witnesses, excluding the four accomplice witnesses, the Court observes that those witnesses did not provide any information which could have, even remotely, implicated the applicant in the robberies and only made observations on the fact of the commission of the crimes. None of them identified the applicant as the alleged perpetrator. The material evidence presented by the prosecution had the same evidentiary weight. The records, materials and inventories were species of proof that the robberies had, in fact, taken place. They did not have any probative value which would allow the conclusion that the applicant had committed the criminal offences in question."
            ],
            [
                "66. The conclusion is, however, different when the Court comes to examine the statements made by the four remaining witnesses for the prosecution. At the same time, the Court considers it necessary to distinguish the depositions made by Mr O. and Mr R. from those made by Mr B. and Mr Sh.. It reiterates that, unlike Mr B. and Mr Sh., who testified both as defendants during the criminal proceedings against them and as witnesses in the course of the pre-trial investigation against the applicant, Mr O. and Mr R. were only questioned as co-accused in the criminal case against them (see paragraphs 6 and 19 above). Mr O. ’ s death and Mr R. ’ s escape made their questioning or confrontation with the applicant at a later stage impossible. In this respect, the Court reiterates that a higher degree of scrutiny should be applied to the assessment of statements by co- accused, because the position in which accomplices find themselves while testifying is different from that of ordinary witnesses. They do not testify under oath, that is, without any affirmation of the truth of their statements which could render them punishable for perjury for wilfully making untrue statements. The Court has already held on a number of occasions that for the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention to be respected on account of the admissibility of a guilty plea by a co-accused, such a plea should only be admitted to establish the fact of the commission of a crime by the person making the plea, and not the other defendant, and a judge should make it clear that the guilty plea by itself does not prove that the defendant was involved in that crime (see, for instance, Vladimir Romanov v. Russia, no. 41461/02, § 102, 24 July 2008, with further references). The Court, therefore, considers that neither Mr O. nor Mr R. was a material witness whose evidence was crucial for the applicant ’ s conviction. Given this finding, it does not consider it necessary to look any further into the reasons for their absence from the trial and the applicant ’ s inability to confront them. Having regard to the evidential value of the witnesses ’ statements and material evidence, the Court considers that the depositions made by Mr B. and Mr Sh. during the pre-trial investigation and read out by the Town Court constituted virtually the sole direct and objective evidence on which the courts ’ findings of the applicant ’ s guilt were based."
            ],
            [
                "67. The Court observes that the main thrust of the applicant ’ s complaint was the alleged lack of an adequate opportunity to examine Mr B. and Mr Sh., or have them examined, in court, in particular on account of the alleged lack of any reasonable effort on the part of the national authorities to ensure their presence at the trial. In this respect, the Court reiterates that the applicant took part in confrontation interviews with Mr B. and Mr Sh. during the pre-trial investigation which, according to the Government, dispensed the Town Court from the obligation to obtain their attendance (see paragraph 19 above)."
            ],
            [
                "68. The Court, however, considers that a close look at its case - law does not allow it to conclude that the very fact of an accused ’ s participation in confrontation interviews with witnesses at the pre-trial stage can, in itself, strip him or her of the right to have those witnesses examined in court. The Court has consistently held that the evidence must be produced “live” before the body called upon to assess the case and determine the facts. This relates in the first place to the trial, which is the central aspect of criminal proceedings and applies to witness evidence, which the defence must be able to question in open court (see Lüdi, cited above, § 27; Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 51, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ III; Solakov v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, no. 47023/99, § 57, ECHR 2001 ‑ X; and S.N. v. Sweden, no. 34209/96, § 44, ECHR 2002 ‑ V )."

            [
                "69. On the issue of the confrontation interviews between the applicant and his two alleged accomplices, Mr Sh. and Mr B., the Court reiterates its finding in a similar case against Russia. In particular, in the case of Melnikov v. Russia ( no. 23610/03, § § 79 -81, 14 January 2010 ) the Court held that a confrontation interview conducted, in the absence of defence counsel, by an investigator who did not meet the requirements of independence and impartiality, and had a large discretionary power to block questions during the confrontation could not in the circumstances be considered an appropriate substitute for the examination of the witness in open court. The Court has also held that the appearance of a key witness before the trial court was of crucial importance to enable it to make an effective assessment of his demeanour and of the reliability of his deposition (ibid, § § 79- 81, with further references). The Court abides by this finding in the present case. It observes that the Government did not allege that the applicant benefited from legal assistance during the confrontation interviews. The Court does not doubt that the domestic courts undertook a careful examination of Mr B. ’ s and Mr Sh. ’ s written statements and gave the applicant an opportunity to contest them at the trial, but this can scarcely be regarded as a proper substitute for a personal observation of the leading witnesses giving oral evidence (see Bocos-Cuesta v. the Netherlands, no. 54789/00, § 71, 10 November 2005 ). The present conclusion is even more salient in a situation when one of the leading witnesses had already been held liable for lying under oath (see paragraph 29 above) and there was a possibility that the witnesses had been intimidated into maintaining the statements they made on earlier occasions (see paragraph 26 above). The Court, therefore, is unconvinced that the applicant ’ s participation in the pre-trial confrontation interview with Mr Sh. and Mr B. could have been, on its own, taken by the Town Court as a circumstance relieving it of the responsibility to hear those two witnesses in person."

                "70. Having said that, the Court reiterates that it occasionally accepted that the reading out of witness statements obtained at the pre-trial stage was not inconsistent with Article 6 § § 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention. At the same time, it has seen that situation as an exception which required convincing justification, such as an impossibility to examine an absent or otherwise missing witness when the authorities ’ reasonable efforts to secure his or her presence were futile (see, for instance, Artner, cited above, §§ 20 ‑ 24 ); an interest in keeping the identity of the witness secret – such as, for example, where undercover agents were involved (see, for example, Lüdi, cited above, §§ 45-50); the need to protect the life, liberty or security of the witness intimidated by the accused or his associates (see Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ II ); and the necessity to protect victims - witnesses of sexual offences who risk being further traumatised by confrontations with the alleged perpetrator (see P.S. v. Germany, no. 33900/96, 20 December 2001 )."

                "71. However, the Court has never limited its analysis to the mere finding that a case falls under one of those exceptions. If the respondent Government relied in its arguments on one of these exceptional situations and the Court established that the conviction was based solely or to a decisive extent upon the untested witness statement, it proceeded in three steps. It commenced the review with an examination of the reasons invoked as an exception and determined whether they had actually existed and whether they had been subject to thorough examination by the national authorities. The Court then considered whether the restrictions on the defence rights had been kept to a very minimum, and whether they had been strictly necessary in order to satisfy a legitimate aim. The final step in the Court ’ s review was an examination of whether the shortcomings in safeguarding the rights of the defence were adequately compensated for (see Al- Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 152)."

            [
                "73. The Court takes note of the Government ’ s argument that the absence from the trial of the two witnesses was due to the Town Court ’ s inability to establish their whereabouts despite every possible effort. In particular, they stated that Mr Sh. had moved to another town without informing his relatives of his new address and Mr B. had been on a business trip outside the Sverdlovsk Region. The Court, however, observes that at least on two occasions in January and February 2003 Mr Sh. informed the Town Court of his whereabouts, noting that a difficult financial situation and business matters precluded his attending the trial (see paragraph 20 above). There is no indication that the Town Court responded to the information from Mr Sh. in any other way than by sending new summonses to him. As to Mr B. ’ s attendance, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the Town Court issued orders urging the bailiff ’ s office to ensure his presence at the trial, including by escorting him to the hearings. The Court, however, is unable to find any evidence confirming the Government ’ s argument that Mr B. had left the Sverdlovsk Region on matters of business. The case - file materials presented by the Government do not provide any information as to the reasons for Mr B. ’ s failure to attend, or to what actions, if any, the bailiffs ’ office took to obtain his attendance. At the same time, the Court is particularly mindful of the Town Court ’ s reliance, in its orders of 11 April and 19 May 2003, on the assumption that the summonses had reached Mr B. (see paragraph 25 above)."

                "74. Regard being had to the circumstances of the case, the Court has serious doubts as to whether the Town Court ’ s conclusion that it was impossible to secure the witnesses ’ attendance can indeed be accepted as warranted. The Town Court ’ s review of the reasons for the witnesses ’ absence was superficial and uncritical. Given the Government ’ s explanations and the materials in the file, the Court is not satisfied that the Town Court was, in fact, unaware of the witnesses ’ whereabouts. The Court notes that the Town Court decided to proceed with the reading out of the written depositions by the defaulting witnesses, given that the attempts to obtain their presence had already caused a lengthy stay in the proceedings. While keeping in mind the domestic courts ’ obligation to secure the proper conduct of the trial and avoid undue delays in the criminal proceedings, the Court does not consider that a stay in the proceedings for the purpose of obtaining the witnesses ’ testimony, or at least clarifying the issue of their appearance at the trial, in which the applicant stood accused of a very serious offence and risked a long term of imprisonment, would have constituted an insuperable hindrance to the expediency of the proceedings at hand ( see Vladimir Romanov, cited above, § 104, with further references, and, most recently, Krivoshapkin v. Russia, no. 42224/02, § 60, 27 January 2011 ). The authorities chose to eschew that stay. As a result, the witnesses never appeared to testify in court in the presence of the applicant."

                "75. In this respect, the Court reiterates that paragraph 1 of Article 6, taken together with paragraph 3, requires the State to take positive steps, in particular, to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him. Such measures form part of the diligence which the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see Sadak and Others v. Turkey, nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, § 67, ECHR 2001-VIII). Having regard to the above considerations, the Court finds that the decision to excuse the absence of the witnesses was not sufficiently convincing and that the authorities failed to take reasonable measures to secure their attendance at the trial."

Having found that the Town Court ’ s decision to dispense with the witnesses ’ appearance had no justification and bearing in mind the earlier mentioned test (see paragraph 71 above), the Court, in principle, does not need to consider further what effect that decision had on the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings against the applicant and whether the handicap arising from the witnesses ’ absence from the trial was counterbalanced by the confrontation interviews between the applicant and the witnesses at the pre-trial stage, as the very concept of fairness enshrined in Article 6 requires that judges form their own impression of the witness ’ s reliability and credibility by observing his or her demeanour under questioning in open court, unless the restriction on the right to cross-examine the witness is exceptionally imposed for good cause and with weighty reasoning (see Vladimir Romanov, cited above, § 71 )."

It also found a violation of Article 6 in a number of cases where Russian courts refused leave to appear in court to imprisoned applicants who had wished to make oral submissions on their civil claims. For instance, in the case of Kovalev v. Russia ( no. 78145/01, § 37, 10 May 2007), despite the fact that the applicant was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim of ill-treatment by the police had been largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been “an important part of the plaintiff ’ s presentation of the case and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings”. In the case of Khuzhin and Others v. Russia (no. 13470/02, §§ 53 et seq., 23 October 2008) the Court found that, by refusing to ensure that the imprisoned applicants could attend hearings, and by failing to consider other legal means of ensuring their effective participation in defamation proceedings, the Russian courts had violated the principle of equality of arms. A similar conclusion was reached by the Court in other cases against Russia where the authorities had failed to secure imprisoned applicants ’ appearance before the civil courts examining their complaints about the conditions of their detention (see, for instance, Shilbergs v. Russia, no. 20075/03, § § 107-113, 17 December 2009; Artyomov v. Russia, no. 14146/02, § § 204-208, 27 May 2010; and Roman Karasev v. Russia, no. 30251/03, § § 65-70, 25 November 2010 ). In the cases cited above, the Court consistently held that given the nature of the applicants ’ claims, which were, to a significant extent, based on their personal experience, the effective, proper and satisfactory presentation of the case could have only been secured by the applicants ’ personal participation in the hearings.

However, as in the previous cases concerning the attendance of civil hearings by imprisoned applicants, the Court attributes particular importance to the nature of the dispute to which the applicant was a party. The Court reiterates that the proceedings at hand concerned the termination of parental rights and required assessment by the domestic courts of the very special legal and factual relationship which exists between a parent and a child. The Court considers that before taking a decision to permanently sever that special relationship, the courts should have heard evidence from the applicant in person.

In the present case, the need to grant anonymity to the witnesses had arisen as early as 24 April 1997 when a person, addicted to heroin at that time and later examined under the name “Jana Charvátová ”, had clearly declared that she had been ready to testify provided she was granted anonymity. Both witnesses “Jana Charvátová ” and “Jan Novotný ” had insisted on maintaining their anonymity during their interviews on 11 July 1997, when they had expressed their fears of suffering reprisals at the hands of drug dealers and the risk of personal injury. Since drug dealing had been involved and dealers frequently use threats or actual violence against persons who testify against them, the witnesses ’ fears could not be considered groundless, even if the applicant had maintained that he had not threatened them. The Government pointed out that the need to obtain testimony from a specific person as evidence in criminal proceedings had been recognised by the Court as a relevant ground for allowing the witness ’ s anonymity ( Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, § 71), while at the same time protecting the witness against the possibility of reprisal by the applicant. In the Government ’ s view, the situation of witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 in the Doorson case was similar to the situation of the present anonymous witnesses. The fact that the drug dealer had not assaulted “Jana Charvátová ” because she had testified against him, but because she had owed money for the drugs, was not a reason for assessing the potential threat as being any less serious."

Once the examination had been completed, he had had an opportunity to comment on the witnesses ’ statements and to question them directly, being in the same room as the witnesses who had been separated from him by a moveable partition. Moreover, he had heard the manner in which the witnesses had responded to questions. Accordingly, even if he could not see them, he could assess what the witnesses had been saying and the manner in which they had testified. He could also register the witnesses ’ emotions. Thus, he could draw his own conclusion as to their credibility, basing himself on his direct, although partially limited, perception of their behaviour and replies. Moreover, he could raise objections during the proceedings."

The claims of “Jana Charvátová ” that she should be examined anonymously had led to an agreement with the police, but no such request had been recorded in the “Jan Novotný ” case.

Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, § 89). Furthermore, evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing, in the presence of the accused, with a view to adversarial argument. There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence; as a general rule, paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6 require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statements or at a later stage ( see Lüdi v.

However, if the anonymity of prosecution witnesses is maintained, the defence will be faced with unusual difficulties. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that in such cases Article 6 § 1, taken together with Article 6 § 3 (d), require that the handicaps under which the defence operates should be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities.

Therefore, the Court accepts that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that such measures can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence (see Baegen v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1995, Series A no. 327-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 44, § 77). In securing the rights of the defence, the judicial authorities may be required to take measures which counterbalance the handicaps under which the defence labours (see Doorson, cited above, p. 471, § 72, and P.S. v. Germany, no. 33900/96, § 23, 20 December 2001)."

However, the use in evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him or her either when the statements were made or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Saïdi v. France, judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 56, § 43, and A.M. v. Italy, no. 37019/97, § 25, ECHR 1999-IX). A conviction should not be based either solely or to a decisive extent on statements which the defence has not been able to challenge (see, mutatis mutandis, Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ II, p. 472, § 76). Article 6 does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court. It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a witness (see, among other authorities, Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, § 89)."

These features are even more prominent in a case involving a minor. In the assessment of the question whether or not in such proceedings an accused received a fair trial, account must be taken of the right to respect for the private life of the alleged victim. Therefore, the Court accepts that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that such measures can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence (see Baegen v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1995, Series A no. 327-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 44, § 77). In securing the rights of the defence, the judicial authorities may be required to take measures which counterbalance the handicaps under which the defence labours (see Doorson, cited above, p. 471, § 72, and P.S. v.

Not a single interview between the psychologist and the girl had been recorded on audio or video tape. It is surprising that the prosecution never made arrangements to have a fresh interview recorded so as to allow the court to observe the manner in which D reacted to the questions put to her or interacted generally with the psychologist during the interview. The psychologist repeated before the court what D had said to her under observation (see paragraph 16 above). The psychologist's statement was highly incriminating. As to the fact that the applicant father had admitted the alleged abuse, the Court observes that the admission, which was unspecific in nature, had been made four years before the criminal investigation had been opened into the case and in connection with public care proceedings. It was later retracted and during the pre-trial investigation and the criminal proceedings he had explained the circumstances in which it had been made (see paragraph 9 above). The witnesses heard by the courts had made no observations on the alleged acts (see paragraph 16 above). In contrast to the case of S.N. v. Sweden ( no. 34209/96, ECHR 2002 ‑ V ) in the present case neither the applicant father nor his counsel had at any stage been afforded an opportunity to have questions put to the child.

The Court’s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III, p. 711, § 50). In particular, “as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce ... Article 6 § 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses” (see Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, pp. 32-33, § 33). It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 38-39, § 91; and Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, § 89). That principle also applies where a defendant asks for the complainant in a defamation case to be examined."

During the same period the industrialist Carlo De Benedetti chose an English newspaper in which to say that Italy is his Siberia. Even Bettino Craxi, when he feels like uttering threats or complaints, generally does so via the Spanish papers. This might be a form of gratuitous snobbery. But it might also be a victimisation syndrome of the type ‘We’re foreigners in our own country and are obliged to raise our voices abroad in order to make ourselves heard at home.’",
                "That’s what Andreotti is suggesting when he adds that he feels like an exile and the victim of a plot, but he doesn’t exactly know what kind of plot. Those who have seen him recently say that he’s pale, his pointed ears are drooping and he’s bent forward to the point of being hunchbacked. He’s worried about his wife Lidia, who’s been plunged in a kind of cataleptic trance since that fateful 27 March. That was the day when the official notification that he was under investigation – a document running to some 250 typewritten pages – turned the most well known Italian politician into the number one godfather of the Sicilian Mafia. Now Andreotti is bewildered. He tries to understand but he can’t. He thinks there must have been some sort of spur-of-the-moment conspiracy.",
                "But the antibody that’s eating away at him has been there for some time. It’s been cultured for years in precisely those religious environments that Andreotti likes best. While he was already dominating Rome in the 1950s Giancarlo Caselli, the Principal Public Prosecutor in Palermo, author of the 250 pages which have annihilated him, was learning his lessons at the school of the Salesian brothers in Turin.",
                "Giancarlo was a fine, studious boy. Turin is full of people like that because it’s a rainy city and the houses have no balconies to watch the street from, so there’s nothing else for a boy to do but get his head down over his books. That’s why the place specialises in the mass-production of intellectuals. From Bobbio to Conso, the Minister of Justice. It’s a puritan brotherhood.",
                "The more Giancarlo progressed towards self-knowledge the heavier his complex about his father weighed on him. The father was a very worthy man but only the chauffeur of a captain of industry. While driving he breathed in the air of the bourgeoisie and then he blew it out again over his son. The boy decided that when he grew up he would pass over to the other side of the fence. No longer subservient like dad, but keeping the upper hand.",
                "At university, he drew close to the PCI [the Italian Communist Party], the party which exalts the frustrated. When he was admitted to the State legal service he swore a threefold oath of obedience – to God, to the Law and to via Botteghe Oscure [formerly the headquarters of the PCI, now those of the PDS – the Democratic Party of the Left]. And Giancarlo became the judge he has remained for the last thirty years – pious, stern and partisan.",
                "But he cannot really be understood without a mention here of his alter ego Luciano Violante, Caselli’s twin brother. Both from Turin; the same age – 52; both raised by the Catholic teaching orders; both communist militants; both judicial officers; and a deep understanding between them: when Violante, the head, calls, Caselli, the arm, responds.",
                "Luciano has always been one step ahead of Giancarlo. In the mid-1970s he indicted for an attempted coup d’état Edgardo Sogno, a former member of the Resistance, but also an anti-communist. It was a typical political trial which led nowhere. Instead of facing a judicial inquiry, Violante found that his career began to take off. In 1979 he was elected as a Communist MP. And ever since then he has been the via Botteghe Oscure’s shadow Minister of Justice. Today he’s the chairman of Parliament’s anti-Mafia committee, the great choreographer of the to-ing and fro-ing of the pentiti [criminals-turned-informers] and the PDS’s strongman.",
                "While Violante was climbing the ladder, Caselli had turned into a handsome figure with the shock of prematurely white hair he’s so proud of. If he goes away anywhere, even on a short trip, he always takes his hairdryer with him. During breaks in proceedings he pats his quiff into place on his forehead and pushes his hair over his ears. Afterwards, as you will have noticed on TV, he moves his head the bare minimum, so as not to ruin his handiwork.",
                "Vain – he’s vain. When Giancarlo was a member of the National Council of the Judiciary, from 1986 to 1990, his colleagues used to make fun of him, saying ‘Under his hair there’s nothing there’. That’s true up to a point, as a comment on his narcissism and his ideological blinkers. But it’s not true as regards his intelligence, which cannot be faulted. So far, as can be seen, there’s nothing to suggest that one day Caselli’s and Andreotti’s paths would cross.",
                "Apart from his spell at the National Council of the Judiciary, Giancarlo continued to live in Turin. He was a judge in the public eye and in the first line of the battle against terrorism. It was he who obtained the confession of Patrizio Peci, whose evidence as a witness for the prosecution devastated the Red Brigades.",
                "In the meantime, the PCI set in motion its strategy for gaining control of the public prosecutors’ offices of every city in Italy. That campaign is still going on, as the PDS has picked up the baton. The whole thing was the product of two linked but very very simple ideas Violante had. The first idea was that if the Communists could not manage to gain power through the ballot box, they could do so through the courts. There was no shortage of material. The Christian Democrats and the Socialists were nothing but thieves and it would be easy to catch them out. The second idea was more brilliant than the first: the opening of a judicial investigation was sufficient to shatter people’s careers; there was no need to go to the trouble of a trial, it was enough to put someone in the pillory. And to do that it was necessary to control the entire network of public prosecutors’ offices.",
                "And that was the start of Tangentopoli. The Craxis, De Lorenzos and others were immediately caught with their hands in the till and destroyed. But Andreotti was needed to complete the picture. More cunning than the rest, or not so greedy, the sly old Christian Democrat nearly always avoided getting caught up in corruption cases.",

A campaign of unsubstantiated allegations saw off the incumbent public prosecutor Giammanco, who crept away with his tail between his legs.

Less than two months later the senator-for-life was suddenly accused of belonging to the Mafia. The file was an implausible rag-bag containing statements by pentiti, old and new documents and information given by the same old Buscetta [a pentito ] to Violante and the anti-Mafia committee, now used by Caselli as evidence in a kind of game of ping-pong between the two twins. To cut a long story short, even the most long-lived brontosaurus in the Palazzo [i.e. Palazzo Madama – the Senate-House] was destroyed, thanks to the principle that an accusation is sufficient to destroy anyone.",

Buscetta could still be useful to him during the investigation, even if the outcome was no longer of much importance. The result sought had already been achieved.",

What a stroke of luck. Caselli, on the other hand, will be portrayed as an objective judge whose duty obliged him to prosecute but who realised he had been in the wrong. He will become a hero. And that, if there is a God, cries out for vengeance.”"

Describing himself in addition as an opinion columnist ( opinionista ), he asserted that he had not intended to give a biography of Caselli but rather to express his critical opinions, in a figurative and forceful way. More precisely, he had made critical judgments, which were admittedly more or less well founded and with which readers might or might not agree, but which were explicitly derived from the factual premise, namely Caselli’s political activity. Lastly, he demanded that evidence be taken from the complainant and from certain journalists and figures in Italian politics who, like Mr Caselli, had been Communist Party militants. In particular, he asked for evidence to be taken from Mr S. Vertone and Mr G. Ferrara and for press articles on interviews in which the two men had confirmed the complainant’s active political militancy to be added to the file. In particular, in an interview published in the daily newspaper Corriere della Sera on 11 December 1994, extracts from which were quoted in the applicant’s appeal, Mr Vertone had stated, inter alia, that the complainant was a brave man of great integrity but that he was influenced by the cultural and political model of communism, that his relations with the former Communist Party had been very close and that he had later all but joined the party. In an interview given to another daily newspaper, La Stampa, which published it on 9 December 1994, Mr Ferrara had asserted that he had taken part in dozens of political meetings with Caselli and Violante among others during the 1970s in the Turin federation of the former Communist Party. He had gone on to say that although Caselli, a man of integrity, had done good work against terrorism as an officer of the State legal service, he was heavily politicised and should therefore avoid speaking like a tribune of the people."

The absolutely vague and irrelevant nature of the request is manifest in the light of the tenor of the phrases used by Mr Perna (in whose article the allusion to Mr Caselli’s militancy is by no means limited, as Mr Caiazza argued in the grounds of appeal, to the assertion that Mr Caselli associated himself with the Communist Party while he was at university, an assertion which would, incidentally, not constitute an insult); the article set out to give a detailed account of the forms taken by that militancy by imputing certain acts to Mr Caselli with the aim of proving that his militancy existed.

                "Apart from the procedural aspect of the question, it should be stated at the outset that even the argument that the content of the article was not objectively offensive is absolutely devoid of foundation, as the judgment given by the trial court was justified in every respect as regards the offensive nature, for a man even more than for an officer of the State legal service, of imputations of specific facts implying a lack of personality, dignity, independent thought, coherence and moral honesty, and conduct signifying explicitly that there have been instances of dereliction of professional duty. ...",

And in fact it is precisely by virtue of this comparative parameter and of its accessory powers of cognition that this court must repeat that the reasons given [by the Court of Appeal] are immune to criticism: the article is quite clearly a bare list of acts and conduct imputed to Mr Caselli in which there cannot be seen, even in veiled form, the slightest contribution to thought which might be regarded as a critical judgment, or even the attempt at irony which is said to be hidden in the elusive ‘caustic phrases’ referred to in the grounds of appeal.

The Court’s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III, p. 711, § 50). In particular, “as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce ... Article 6 § 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses” (see Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, pp. 32-33, § 33). It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 38-39, § 91; and Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, § 89). That principle also applies where a defendant asks for the complainant in a defamation case to be examined."

But the Italian courts which tried the merits of the case held that Mr Caselli’s political convictions and any manifestation of them unconnected with the performance of his duties as State Counsel, the existence of ties of friendship between Mr Violante and Mr Caselli and the use of the statements made by Mr Buscetta, a criminal-turned-informer paid by the State, in the proceedings against Mr Andreotti were facts without any defamatory import. On the other hand, it was defamatory to say that the complainant had “managed the Andreotti investigation in furtherance of a grand political design hatched by Violante” in order to take power by non-electoral means, thus committing an abuse of authority for political ends. The offending article manifestly denied that Mr Caselli possessed “the qualities of impartiality, independence, objectivity and probity which characterise the exercise of judicial functions” by attributing to him conduct “signifying that there [had been] instances of dereliction of professional duty” which “constituted disciplinary and criminal offences”. As the Court of Cassation noted in its judgment of 9 October 1998, the applicant’s requests for evidence to be admitted “were interpreted in accordance with their exact significance and probative value and were rightly refused because they were totally devoid of relevance to the decision” (see paragraph 20 above). The vague and irrelevant nature of the request for the proceedings to be reopened was, in the Court of Cassation’s view, quite evident in the light of the tenor of the applicant’s assertions: “the article set out to give a detailed account of the forms taken by [Mr Caselli’s] militancy by imputing certain acts to Mr Caselli with the aim of proving that his militancy existed. Consequently, either this point remains vague or the problem is resolved by trying to make the complainant admit the facts noted in the charges, with the result that the burden of proof is shifted away from [Mr Perna and Mr Montanelli]. ...”",

On that crucial aspect, at no time did the applicant try to prove the reality of the conduct alleged to be contrary to those principles.

From that point of view, it cannot therefore be considered that the defamation proceedings brought by Mr Caselli against the applicant were unfair on account of the way the evidence was taken. The Court observes in passing, and although this is not decisive in the present case, that on 10 January 1996 the Monza District Court also ruled to be irrelevant the report on the evidence given by Mr Buscetta and the account of it given in a press article, documents which Mr Caselli’s counsel had asked to be admitted in evidence in order to make clear what course the interview had taken (see paragraph 15 above).",

The applicant’s assertions, far from concerning a matter of public debate, had been a personal affront to Mr Caselli.

                "39. The Court reiterates the following fundamental principles in this area:",
                "(a) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, among other authorities, Jersild v. Denmark, judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 23, § 31; Janowski v. Poland [GC], no. 25716/94, § 30, ECHR 1999-I; Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, § 43, ECHR 1999-VIII; and Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, § 43, 29 February 2000).",
                "The press plays an essential role in a democratic society. Although it must not overstep certain bounds, regarding in particular protection of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest, including those relating to justice (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, pp. 233-34, § 37). Not only does it have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of “public watchdog” (see Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 27, § 63, and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 62, ECHR 1999-III). Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed (see Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 25, § 57). Journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 313, p. 19, § 38, and Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, §§ 45 and 46, ECHR 2001-III).",
                "(b) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Janowski, cited above, § 30).",
                "(c) In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the remarks held against the applicant and the context in which he made them. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient” (see Barfod v. Denmark, judgment of 22 February 1989, Series A no. 149, p. 12, § 28, and Janowski, cited above, § 30). In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Jersild, cited above, p. 24, § 31; Fuentes Bobo, cited above, § 44; and De Diego Nafría v. Spain, no. 46833/99, § 34, 14 March 2002).",
                "(d) The nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference (see, for example, Ceylan v. Turkey [GC], no. 23556/94, § 37, ECHR 1999-IV, and Tammer v. Estonia, no. 41205/98, § 69, ECHR 2001-I).",

The fact that the journalist had acted deliberately was fully confirmed by the content of the whole article, in which Mr Caselli had been “constantly and subtly denigrated”. Its author had therefore indeed intended to damage another’s reputation (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above)."

It held that the factual statements made about Mr Caselli played no informative role and had not been proved to be true. The offensive nature of the article, for a man, even more than for an officer of the State legal service, was not in doubt, as the applicant had made imputations of specific facts implying a lack of personality, dignity, independent thought, coherence and moral honesty, and conduct signifying explicitly that there had been instances of dereliction of professional duty (see paragraph 20 above)."

The Court observes that a finding of a violation of Article 10 cannot be excluded a priori where a defendant has been convicted by the domestic courts on the basis of a separate examination of the various assertions made in an article like the one in issue. In the present case, however, merely to scrutinise each of the statements taken into consideration by the national authorities in reaching their decision that the offence of defamation had been committed would be to lose sight of the article’s overall content and its very essence. Mr Perna did not confine his remarks to the assertion that Mr Caselli harboured or had manifested political beliefs and that this justified doubts about his impartiality in the performance of his duties. It is quite apparent from the whole article – as the national authorities rightly noted – that the applicant sought to convey to the public the following clear and wholly unambiguous message: that Mr Caselli had knowingly committed an abuse of authority, notably in precise circumstances connected with the indictment of Mr Andreotti, in furtherance of the alleged PCI strategy of gaining control of public prosecutors’ offices in Italy. In that context, even phrases like the one relating to the “oath of obedience” take on a meaning which is anything but symbolic. The Court further observes that it has just found, in paragraph 31 of this judgment, that at no time did the applicant try to prove that the specific conduct imputed to Mr Caselli had actually occurred and that in his defence he argued, on the contrary, that he had expressed critical judgments which there was no need to prove."

Having thus reaffirmed the \"autonomy\" of the notion of \"criminal\" as conceived of under Article 6 (art. 6), what the Court must determine is whether or not the \"regulatory offence\" committed by the applicant was a \"criminal\" one within the meaning of that Article (art. 6). For this purpose, the Court will rely on the criteria adopted in the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment (ibid., pp. 34-35, § 82). The first matter to be ascertained is whether or not the text defining the offence in issue belongs, according to the legal system of the respondent State, to criminal law; next, the nature of the offence and, finally, the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risked incurring must be examined, having regard to the object and purpose of Article 6 (art. 6), to the ordinary meaning of the terms of that Article (art. 6) and to the laws of the Contracting States."

                "51. Under German law, the facts alleged against Mr. Öztürk - non-observance of Regulation 1 § 2 of the Road Traffic Regulations - amounted to a \"regulatory offence\" (Regulation 49 § 1, no. 1, of the same Regulations). They did not fall within the ambit of the criminal law, but of section 17 of the Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz and of section 24 sub-section 2 of the Road Traffic Act (see paragraph 11 above). The 1968/1975 legislation marks an important step in the process of \"decriminalisation\" of petty offences in the Federal Republic of Germany. Although legal commentators in Germany do not seem unanimous in considering that the law on \"regulatory offences\" no longer belongs in reality to criminal law, the drafting history of the 1968/1975 Act nonetheless makes it clear that the offences in question have been removed from the criminal law sphere by that Act (see Deutscher Bundestag, Drucksache V/1269 and, inter alia, the judgment of 16 July 1969 by the Constitutional Court, Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, vol. 27, pp. 18-36).",
                "Whilst the Court thus accepts the Government's arguments on this point, it has nonetheless not lost sight of the fact that no absolute partition separates German criminal law from the law on \"regulatory offences\", in particular where there exists a close connection between a criminal offence and a \"regulatory offence\" (see paragraph 20 above). Nor has the Court overlooked that the provisions of the ordinary law governing criminal procedure apply by analogy to \"regulatory\" proceedings (see paragraph 21 above), notably in relation to the judicial stage, if any, of such proceedings."

                "52. In any event, the indications furnished by the domestic law of the respondent State have only a relative value. The second criterion stated above - the very nature of the offence, considered also in relation to the nature of the corresponding penalty - represents a factor of appreciation of greater weight.",
                "In the opinion of the Commission - with the exception of five of its members - and of Mr. Öztürk, the offence committed by the latter was criminal in character.",
                "For the Government in contrast, the offence in question was beyond doubt one of those contraventions of minor importance - numbering approximately five million each year in the Federal Republic of Germany - which came within a category of quite a different order from that of criminal offences. The Government's submissions can be summarised as follows. By means of criminal law, society endeavoured to safeguard its very foundations as well as the rights and interests essential for the life of the community. The law on Ordnungswidrigkeiten, on the other hand, sought above all to maintain public order. As a general rule and in any event in the instant case, commission of a \"regulatory offence\" did not involve a degree of ethical unworthiness such as to merit for its perpetrator the moral value-judgment of reproach (Unwerturteil) that characterised penal punishment (Strafe). The difference between \"regulatory offences\" and criminal offences found expression both in procedural terms and in relation to the attendant penalties and other legal consequences.",
                "In the first place, so the Government's argument continued, in removing \"regulatory offences\" from the criminal law the German legislature had introduced a simplified procedure of prosecution and punishment conducted before administrative authorities save in the event of subsequent appeal to a court. Although general laws on criminal procedure were in principle applicable by analogy, the procedure laid down under the 1968/1975 Act was distinguishable in many respects from criminal procedure. For example, prosecution of Ordnungswidrigkeiten fell within the discretionary power of the competent authorities and the 1968/1975 Act greatly limited the possibilities of restricting the personal liberty of the individual at the stage of the preliminary investigations (see paragraphs 21, 22 and 24 above).",
                "In the second place, instead of a penal fine (Geldstrafe) and imprisonment the legislature had substituted a mere \"regulatory\" fine (Geldbusse - see paragraph 17 above). Imprisonment was not an alternative (Ersatzfreiheitsstrafe) to the latter type of fine as it was to the former and no coercive imprisonment (Erzwingungshaft) could be ordered unless the person concerned had failed to pay the sum due without having established his inability to pay (see paragraph 33 above). Furthermore, a \"regulatory offence\" was not entered in the judicial criminal records but solely, in certain circumstances, on the central traffic register (see paragraph 39 above).",
                "The reforms accomplished in 1968/1975 thus, so the Government concluded, reflected a concern to \"decriminalise\" minor offences to the benefit not only of the individual, who would no longer be answerable in criminal terms for his act and who could even avoid all court proceedings, but also of the effective functioning of the courts, henceforth relieved in principle of the task of dealing with the great majority of such offences."

                "53. The Court does not underestimate the cogency of this argument. The Court recognises that the legislation in question marks an important stage in the history of the reform of German criminal law and that the innovations introduced in 1968/1975 represent more than a simple change of terminology.",
                "Nonetheless, the Court would firstly note that, according to the ordinary meaning of the terms, there generally come within the ambit of the criminal law offences that make their perpetrator liable to penalties intended, inter alia, to be deterrent and usually consisting of fines and of measures depriving the person of his liberty.",
                "In addition, misconduct of the kind committed by Mr. Öztürk continues to be classified as part of the criminal law in the vast majority of the Contracting States, as it was in the Federal Republic of Germany until the entry into force of the 1968/1975 legislation; in those other States, such misconduct, being regarded as illegal and reprehensible, is punishable by criminal penalties.",
                "Moreover, the changes resulting from the 1968/1975 legislation relate essentially to procedural matters and to the range of sanctions, henceforth limited to Geldbussen. Whilst the latter penalty appears less burdensome in some respects than Geldstrafen, it has nonetheless retained a punitive character, which is the customary distinguishing feature of criminal penalties. The rule of law infringed by the applicant has, for its part, undergone no change of content. It is a rule that is directed, not towards a given group possessing a special status - in the manner, for example, of disciplinary law -, but towards all citizens in their capacity as road-users; it prescribes conduct of a certain kind and makes the resultant requirement subject to a sanction that is punitive. Indeed, the sanction - and this the Government did not contest - seeks to punish as well as to deter. It matters little whether the legal provision contravened by Mr. Öztürk is aimed at protecting the rights and interests of others or solely at meeting the demands of road traffic. These two ends are not mutually exclusive. Above all, the general character of the rule and the purpose of the penalty, being both deterrent and punitive, suffice to show that the offence in question was, in terms of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, criminal in nature.",
                "The fact that it was admittedly a minor offence hardly likely to harm the reputation of the offender does not take it outside the ambit of Article 6 (art. 6). There is in fact nothing to suggest that the criminal offence referred to in the Convention necessarily implies a certain degree of seriousness. In this connection, a number of Contracting States still draw a distinction, as did the Federal Republic at the time when the Convention was opened for the signature of the Governments, between the most serious offences (crimes), lesser offences ( délits ) and petty offences (contraventions), whilst qualifying them all as criminal offences. Furthermore, it would be contrary to the object and purpose of Article 6 (art. 6), which guarantees to \"everyone charged with a criminal offence\" the right to a court and to a fair trial, if the State were allowed to remove from the scope of this Article (art. 6) a whole category of offences merely on the ground of regarding them as petty. Nor does the Federal Republic deprive the presumed perpetrators of Ordnungswidrigkeiten of this right since it grants them the faculty - of which the applicant availed himself - of appealing to a court against the administrative decision."

As the contravention committed by Mr. Öztürk was criminal for the purposes of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, there is no need to examine it also in the light of the final criterion stated above (at paragraph 50). The relative lack of seriousness of the penalty at stake (see paragraph 18 above) cannot divest an offence of its inherently criminal character."

The Government further appeared to consider that the applicant did not have the status of a person \"charged with a criminal offence\" because the 1968/1975 Act does not provide for any \"Beschuldigung\" (\"charge\") and does not employ the terms \"Angeschuldigter\" (\"person charged\") or \"Angeklagter\" (\"the accused\"). On this point, the Court would simply refer back to its well-established case-law holding that \"charge\", for the purposes of Article 6 (art. 6), may in general be defined as \"the official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence\", although \"it may in some instances take the form of other measures which carry the implication of such an allegation and which likewise substantially affect the situation of the suspect\" (see, as the most recent authorities, the Foti and others judgment of 10 December 1982, Series A no. 56, p. 18, § 52, and the Corigliano judgment of the same date, Series A no. 57, p. 13, § 34).
