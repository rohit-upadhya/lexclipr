                "233. The Court emphasises in this connection that the unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and a most grave violation of Article 5. Having assumed control over an individual, the authorities have a duty to account for his or her whereabouts. For this reason, Article 5 must be seen as requiring the authorities to take effective measures to safeguard against the risk of disappearance and to conduct a prompt effective investigation into an arguable claim that a person has been taken into custody and has not been seen since (see Kurt v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, §§ 123-24, Reports 1998-III).",

                "1. The case originated in an application (no. 39630/09) against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Mr Khaled El-Masri (“the applicant”), on 20 July 2009.",
                "2. The applicant was represented by Mr J.A. Goldston, Mr D. Pavli and Mr R. Skilbeck, from the Open Society Justice Initiative’s New York office, and Mr F. Medarski, a Macedonian lawyer. The Macedonian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Bogdanov.",
                "3. The applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been subjected to a secret rendition operation, namely that agents of the respondent State had arrested him, held him incommunicado, questioned and ill-treated him, and handed him over at Skopje Airport to agents of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) who had transferred him, on a special CIA-operated flight, to a CIA-run secret detention facility in Afghanistan, where he had been ill-treated for over four months.

I have no additional comments or facts, from any side, to convince me that what has been established in the official report of our Ministry is not the truth.’",

The Ministry of Interior had intensified security for the festive period and was operating a higher state of alert around the possible criminal activity. In line with these more intense activities, bus passengers were being subjected to a thorough security check, including an examination of their identity documents.",

Members of the UBK, the security and counter-intelligence service, are present at all border points in Macedonia as part of what is described as ‘Integrated Border Management and Security’. UBK officials participated in the interview of Mr El-Masri.",

The border point at Tabanovce is not linked to Interpol’s network, so the information had to be transmitted to Skopje, from where an electronic request was made to the central Interpol database in Lyon[s]. A UBK official in the Analytical Department apparently made this request using an electronic code, so the Macedonian authorities can produce no record of it.

He then left the border point at Tabanovce, although Macedonian officials were not able to describe how. Asked directly about this point in a separate meeting, the Minister of Interior ... said: ‘we’re not able to tell you exactly what happened to him after he was released because it is not in our interest; after the person leaves the border crossing, we’re not in a position to know how he traveled further.’",

When asked whether Mr El-Masri had received a stamp to indicate his departure by this means, [the Head of the UBK] answered: ‘Normally there should be a stamp on the passport as you cross the border out of Macedonia, but I can’t be sure. UNMIK [United Nations Administration Mission in Kosovo] is also present on the Kosovo border and is in charge of the protocol on that side ... My UBK colleague has just informed me that he has crossed the border at Blace twice in recent times and didn’t receive a stamp on either occasion.’",

According to confidential information we received (of which we know the source), a full description of Mr El-Masri was transmitted to the CIA via its Bureau Chief in Skopje for an analysis ... did the person in question have contact with terrorist movements, in particular with [al-Qaeda]? Based on the intelligence material about Khaled El-Masri in its possession – the content of which is not known to us – the CIA answered in the affirmative.

The claim was based on sections 141 and 157 of the Obligations Act (see paragraphs 91 and 92 below). The applicant claimed 3 million Macedonian denars (equivalent to approximately 49,000 euros) in respect of the non-pecuniary damage resulting from his physical and mental pain and the fear that he would be killed during his detention. He reiterated his complaints that he had been denied the right to establish any contact with the outside world. The fact that his family had had no information about his fate and whereabouts had added to his mental suffering. That had amounted to a separate violation of his family life under Article 8 of the Convention. He further argued that such actions by State agents amounted to a violation of Articles 3, 5 and 8 of the Convention. Besides the evidence submitted in his criminal complaint (see paragraph 67 above), the applicant requested that the civil courts hear oral evidence from him and that a psychological examination be carried out."

                "5. I can affirm that it was during my tenure as Minister of the Interior, in December 2003 and January 2004, that Macedonian agents belonging to the UBK, acting under my authority as Minister and under the direct supervision of the then UBK Director, were engaged in detaining a man who was travelling with a German passport under the name of Khaled El-Masri.",
                "6. Mr El-Masri attempted to enter Macedonia on a bus from Germany on 31 December 2003. Macedonian police officials stopped him at the Tabanovce border crossing with Serbia. He was taken off the bus and held at the border crossing because the police suspected that his identity might be fraudulent.",

Macedonia received a valid international warrant from the US bearing Mr El-Masri’s name and an official request to detain this man.",
                "8. Acting in compliance with the US request, the Macedonian government agreed to hold Mr El-Masri until he could be handed over to the US authorities for further interrogation. As Minister of the Interior I was kept informed of the UBK’s actions and authorised them from the very beginning, although I was not involved at the operational level. I also liaised with our US counterparts on behalf of the Macedonian government.",

                "10. Mr El-Masri was not regarded as a threat to Macedonia and held no intelligence value for Macedonia’s purposes. If the decision had been ours alone, we would have released him. However, we acted faithfully on the warrant of our US counterparts, who indicated that they would send an aircraft and a team of CIA agents to Macedonia to take custody of Mr El-Masri and fly him out of the country. As time passed I indicated to our US counterparts that Macedonia would have to release Mr El-Masri if this rendition could not take place quickly.",

                "12. The entire operation was thoroughly documented on the Macedonian side by UBK personnel in the Ministry of the Interior. This documentation was kept securely and ought to be available in the Ministry’s files. I cannot state exactly what the files contain but I know that the relevant materials were not destroyed while I was the Minister of the Interior.",
                "13. Some days after Mr El-Masri had been flown out of the country, I received a final report on the operation through the appropriate line of reporting in the Ministry of the Interior. In my recollection, the final report indicated that Macedonia had adhered exactly to the terms of a legitimate international warrant regarding Mr El ‑ Masri. Macedonia acted according to its domestic laws and procedures regulating the activities of the Ministry of the Interior.",
                "14. Macedonia’s status as a reliable partner in global counterterrorism was strengthened by the way we carried out this operation. Our US partners expressed great appreciation for Macedonia’s handling of the matter.",

I understand that Mr El-Masri’s situation resulted from a mistake. I maintain that if any mistake was made in Mr El ‑ Masri’s case, it was not Macedonia’s mistake, and I do not believe there was any intentional wrongdoing on the part of the Macedonian authorities.",

He further discussed the applicant’s case with other relevant domestic and foreign government officials and non-governmental representatives. He also interviewed the applicant on several occasions in 2006, as well as other witnesses. At the Open Society Justice Initiative’s request, on 28 March 2011 he submitted an expert report running to sixty-two pages in which he detailed the factual findings of his investigations into the applicant’s case. The report was based on a “considerable amount of original testimonial, documentary and other physical evidence related to the applicant’s case”, most of which was obtained from people who had requested anonymity given the confidential and sensitive nature of the matter. According to the expert, “the Government has classified as ‘Top Secret’ all the documentation in its files that might help to shed light on the case” (see paragraph 21 of the report). He made repeated site visits of the Tabanovce border crossing, the hotel and Skopje Airport and interviewed “witnesses and other sources who participated in or experienced the[se] events at first hand”. In the report, the expert gave detailed information about: the applicant’s arrival in the respondent State; the chronological sequence of events at the Tabanovce border crossing and the actions taken by the Macedonian border officials with respect to the applicant; the UBK’s deployment to Tabanovce and the on-site interrogation of the applicant; the UBK’s liaison with the CIA; and the landing, route and timing of a CIA-operated flight which had been used for the applicant’s transfer from Skopje Airport. As noted in the report, after the arrival of the UBK agents at the Tabanovce border crossing, “the Macedonian authorities took meticulous and wide-ranging measures ... to conceal from scrutiny anything out of the ordinary – including deviations from Macedonian law and procedures – that might happen to Mr El ‑ Masri while held in Macedonian custody. I have been struck by the attention to detail I have learned about on the part of the Macedonian authorities, as they sought to cover up or interfere with almost every avenue of independent investigation into the truth of what happened” (see paragraph 141 of the report).",

As regards the terminology used to refer to irregular transfer and detention of prisoners, the Venice Commission notes that the public debate frequently uses the term ‘rendition’. This is not a term used in international law. The term refers to one State obtaining custody over a person suspected of involvement in serious crime (e.g. terrorism) in the territory of another State and/or the transfer of such a person to custody in the first State’s territory, or a place subject to its jurisdiction, or to a third State. ‘Rendition’ is thus a general term referring more to the result – obtaining of custody over a suspected person – rather than the means. Whether a particular ‘rendition’ is lawful will depend upon the laws of the States concerned and on the applicable rules of international law, in particular human rights law. Thus, even if a particular ‘rendition’ is in accordance with the national law of one of the States involved (which may not forbid or even regulate extraterritorial activities of State organs), it may still be unlawful under the national law of the other State(s). Moreover, a ‘rendition’ may be contrary to customary international law and treaty or customary obligations undertaken by the participating State(s) under human rights law and/or international humanitarian law.",

The prohibition to extradite or deport to a country where there exists a risk of torture or ill-treatment must be respected.”",

The Special Rapporteur is concerned about situations where persons are detained for a long period of time for the sole purpose of intelligence-gathering or on broad grounds in the name of prevention. These situations constitute arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The existence of grounds for continued detention should be determined by an independent and impartial court.

The Special Rapporteur remains deeply troubled that the United States has created a comprehensive system of extraordinary renditions, prolonged and secret detention, and practices that violate the prohibition against torture and other forms of ill-treatment. This system required an international web of exchange of information and has created a corrupted body of information which was shared systematically with partners in the war on terror through intelligence cooperation, thereby corrupting the institutional culture of the legal and institutional systems of recipient States.",

The blanket invocation of State secrets privilege with reference to complete policies, such as the United States secret detention, interrogation and rendition programme or third-party intelligence (under the policy of ‘originator control’ ...) prevents effective investigation and renders the right to a remedy illusory.

Between May 2004 and October 2008, the applicant had remained totally passive and displayed no initiative in informing the Macedonian law-enforcement authorities about the alleged events. Instead, he had pursued remedies in other jurisdictions. Furthermore, he ought to have known long before October 2008 that any criminal investigation in the respondent State would have been ineffective. In this connection they referred to the absence of any contact between him and the law-enforcement authorities of the respondent State, as well as the absence of State prosecution proprio motu, despite the fact that the prosecuting authorities had already been alerted about his case by their German counterparts. The last inquiries at international and national level, which had ended in January 2007, long before the applicant had submitted his criminal complaint in October 2008, had not led to any finding of fact which would have been of relevance to that complaint. His criminal complaint had not contained any new evidence capable of reviving the State’s duty to investigate his allegations."

His lack of diligence was evident because he had taken no initiative in informing himself about the progress made in the investigation (the Government cited Bulut and Yavuz v. Turkey (dec.), no. 73065/01, 28 May 2002). Moreover, he had failed to communicate Mr H.K.’s statement to the domestic authorities and to seek the institution of criminal proceedings by the public prosecutor. Had the applicant requested the prosecution of an identified perpetrator, he would have been allowed to take over the prosecution as a subsidiary complainant if the public prosecutor dismissed his complaint. He had had no such opportunity in the present case, given that his criminal complaint of October 2008 had been filed against an unidentified perpetrator.

The internal investigation undertaken by the Ministry of the Interior (see paragraphs 64-66 above) could not be regarded as effective and independent within the meaning of Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention. Moreover, he had had no possibility of knowing about that inquiry, given the failure of the authorities to contact him or make their inquiry public. From the moment he had returned to Germany in late May 2004, he had actively sought to obtain sufficient evidence to build an “arguable case” to present to the national prosecuting authorities. The period of four and a half years between his release and the filing of the criminal complaint in October 2008 had not been excessive. On the contrary, that time had been entirely reasonable, considering that this was a complex case of disappearance, involving international intelligence cooperation, in which the US and Macedonian Governments had agreed to cover up the existence of a secret, multinational criminal enterprise. Accordingly, he had acted diligently and in compliance with the Court’s practice. He had sought in timely fashion to initiate a criminal investigation, but the authorities had not responded expeditiously and instead had secretly rejected his complaint. He had further sought in vain information from the public prosecutor about the progress of the investigation. The public prosecutor had not notified him of her decision rejecting the complaint until 22 November 2010, fourteen months after his application had been lodged with the Court. Since the criminal complaint had been lodged against an unidentified perpetrator, he had been prevented from initiating a private prosecution."

This concerns not only the interpretation of substantive provisions of the Convention, but also procedural provisions; it impacts on the obligations imposed on Governments, but also has effects on the position of applicants. Where time is of the essence in resolving the issues in a case, there is a burden on the applicant to ensure that his or her claims are raised before the Court with the necessary expedition to ensure that they may be properly, and fairly, resolved (see Varnava and Others v.

It sees no reasons that could justify departing from this principle, all the more so in the circumstances of the present case where allegations of inhuman treatment and unlawful deprivation of liberty purportedly are the result of a secret operation carried out without any legal basis. If the actions of the State agents involved have been illegal and arbitrary, it is for the prosecuting authorities of the respondent State to identify and punish the perpetrators. Alerting the public prosecutor’s office about these actions must be seen as an entirely logical step on the part of the victim."

There were merely some doubts about its effectiveness, and the applicant was required under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention to attempt it before submitting his application to the Court. It would be unreasonable to expect the applicant to bring his complaints to the Court before his position, in connection with the matter, had been finally settled at domestic level in line with the principle of subsidiarity, according to which it is best for the facts of cases to be investigated and issues to be resolved in so far as possible at the domestic level. It is in the interests of the applicant, and the effectiveness of the Convention system, that the domestic authorities, who are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention (see Varnava and Others, cited above, § 164)."

No other legal action in the respondent State was taken by the applicant prior to that date. In accounting for this delay, the applicant gave an explanation which cannot in itself be considered unreasonable. His case concerned allegations of “extraordinary rendition”, which included allegations of abduction, incommunicado detention and ill-treatment. According to the 2006 Marty Report, the authorities of most Council of Europe member States have denied allegations of their participation in rendition operations (see paragraph 43 above). Such policy of obstruction was reaffirmed in the 2007 Marty Report (see paragraph 46 above). Given the sensitivity of the matter and the concealment noted above, it was reasonable for the applicant to wait for developments that could have resolved crucial factual or legal issues. Indeed, the inquiries under way in the years prior to October 2008 revealed relevant elements that shed additional light on the applicant’s allegations and constituted a more solid background for his criminal claim. Given the complexity of the case and the nature of the alleged human rights violations at stake, it is understandable that the applicant decided to pursue domestic remedies only when he had some corroborative material available to him."

In cases in which there are conflicting accounts of events, the Court is inevitably confronted when establishing the facts with the same difficulties as those faced by any first-instance court. It reiterates that, in assessing evidence, it has adopted the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Creangă v.

The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 85, ECHR 1999-IV; Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII; and Rupa v. Romania (no. 1), no. 58478/00, § 97, 16 December 2008).

In such circumstances, the onus is on the Government to provide a plausible and satisfactory explanation as to what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned was not detained by the authorities, but left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty (see Tanış and Others v.

Knowing the truth about gross human rights violations and serious violations of humanitarian law afforded victims, their relatives and close friends a measure of satisfaction. The right to the truth inured to the benefit of the direct victims of the violation, as well as to their relatives and to society at large. Rights holders were entitled to seek and obtain information on various issues, namely the identity of the perpetrators, the progress and results of an investigation, and the circumstances and reasons for the perpetration of violations. On the other hand, the right to the truth placed comprehensive obligations on the State, including duties (1) to carry out an effective investigation; (2) to give victims and their relatives effective access to the investigative process; (3) to disclose all relevant information to the victims and the general public; and (4) to protect victims and witnesses from reprisals and threats.

Interights submitted that the present case presented an opportunity for the Court to recognise as impermissible the system of violations which had become known as “extraordinary rendition” and to determine the State’s responsibility under the Convention. The treatment of the rendered persons in preparation for or during the rendition process (including so-called “capture shock” treatment) and the use of coercive interrogation methods might amount to torture and/or ill-treatment. Extraordinary rendition practices inherently involved the removal of a person from one State to another where there was a real risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. Such removal was prohibited by the principle of non-refoulement, which was recognised in the Court’s case-law (Interights referred to Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, and Saadi, cited above). Under the non-refoulement principle, responsibility for complicity, participation or other forms of cooperation in “extraordinary renditions” would arise where the State authorities knew or ought to have known that the violations involved in renditions were being committed. In parallel to the “accomplice liability”, under general international law a State could be held responsible where it rendered aid or assistance to another State in the commission of an internationally wrongful act (“accessory responsibility”). The failure to prevent such violations was the most flagrant where the State had given its consent to the acts of foreign agents violating the rights at stake. In addition, acquiescence or connivance in the acts of the foreign agents might engage the State’s responsibility. After the rendition had taken place, the State had an obligation to conduct a prompt and effective investigation into allegations of secret detention and transfer, and to provide reparation, including compensation for non-pecuniary damage flowing from the breach."
            ],
            [
                "177. Redress stated that an investigation in the context of allegations of extraordinary rendition must be: prompt, independent, thorough and capable of leading to the identification and prosecution of the persons responsible; provide for public scrutiny and victim participation; and afford victims access to information in order to satisfy their right to the truth. The obligation to investigate was incorporated in both Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention. National-security considerations could not operate so as to bar a victim from access to such information. If national-security concerns were allowed to prevail over the victim’s right of access to information, the non-derogable and absolute character of Article 3 and the prohibition of unacknowledged detention would be undermined. In this connection it referred to the Council of Europe’s Guidelines of 30 March 2011 on eradicating impunity for serious human rights violations (see paragraph 105 above), according to which “impunity for those responsible for acts amounting to serious human rights violations inflicts additional suffering on victims”. An adequate remedy and reparation must include recognition of, and respect for, the victims of alleged breaches of Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention, so that they, their families and society, as a whole, could know the truth regarding the violations suffered. Besides compensation, other important components which addressed the long-term restorative aims of reparation must also be provided, including satisfaction (acknowledgment of the breach, an expression of regret or a formal apology), guarantees of non-repetition and rehabilitation. In this latter connection, Redress submitted an expert report of 28 March 2011 in which Dr M. Robertson, a chartered clinical psychologist, explained the psychological benefits for the victim of the public disclosure of the truth. According to her, public recognition of the truth and proper acknowledgment through some form of redress could play an integral role in the survivor’s recovery. Conversely, if the truth remained hidden and the perpetrators walked free, that could compound the survivor’s sense of helplessness and struggle to create meaning and obtain closure.",

That system was characterised by the enforced disappearance of individuals, which constituted a violation of the right to freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Article 3 of the Convention entailed non-refoulement obligations enjoining Contracting Parties from acting – and/or omitting to act – in ways that would result in the removal of any individuals from their jurisdiction when the Contracting Parties knew or ought to have known that their removal would expose them to a real risk of ill-treatment."

His complaints were supported by the evidence which had come to light in the course of the international and other foreign investigations. In the Court’s opinion, the applicant’s description of events and the available material were sufficient to raise at least a reasonable suspicion that the said Convention grievances could have been imputed to the State authorities as indicated by the applicant. He has thus laid the basis of a prima facie case of misconduct on the part of the security forces of the respondent State, which warranted an investigation by the authorities in conformity with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention. In any event, the fact that the applicant lodged a formal criminal complaint was not decisive since the information brought to the knowledge of the authorities about serious violations of Article 3 at the time gave rise ipso facto to an obligation under that Article that the State carries out an effective investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Gorgiev v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 26984/05, § 64, 19 April 2012)."

The applicant’s allegations regarding his transfer to Afghanistan, both in terms of time and manner, were strikingly consistent with the actual course of that aircraft. However, the investigating authorities remained passive and decided not to follow up on that lead. It is surprising that they took no notice of that information and failed to investigate the identity of the passenger who had boarded the aircraft that night.

In this connection it underlines the great importance of the present case not only for the applicant and his family, but also for other victims of similar crimes and the general public, who had the right to know what had happened. The issue of “extraordinary rendition” attracted worldwide attention and triggered inquiries by many international and intergovernmental organisations, including the United Nations human rights bodies, the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. The latter revealed that some of the States concerned were not interested in seeing the truth come out.

State secret privilege was also asserted by the US government in the applicant’s case before the US courts (see paragraph 63 above).

The Court does not underestimate the undeniable complexity of the circumstances surrounding the present case. However, while there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, an adequate response by the authorities in investigating allegations of serious human rights violations, as in the present case, may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory (see Anguelova v.

The Court has confirmed that even in the most difficult circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the conduct of the person concerned (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, § 79, Reports 1996-V, and Labita, cited above, § 119)."

This distinction would appear to have been embodied in the Convention to allow the special stigma of “torture” to attach only to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see Aksoy, cited above, § 62). In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which came into force on 26 June 1987, which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (Article 1 of the United Nations Convention) (see İlhan v.

Lithuania, no. 32293/05, § 47, 15 March 2011). There is no doubt that the applicant’s solitary incarceration in the hotel intimidated him on account of his apprehension as to what would happen to him next and must have caused him emotional and psychological distress. The applicant’s prolonged confinement in the hotel left him entirely vulnerable. He undeniably lived in a permanent state of anxiety owing to his uncertainty about his fate during the interrogation sessions to which he was subjected. The Court notes that such treatment was intentionally meted out to the applicant with the aim of extracting a confession or information about his alleged ties with terrorist organisations (see Dikme v. Turkey, no. 20869/92, §§ 82 and 95, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII).

He was placed in an adult nappy and dressed in a dark blue short-sleeved tracksuit. Shackled and hooded, and subjected to total sensory deprivation, the applicant was forcibly marched to a CIA aircraft (a Boeing 737 with the tail number N313P), which was surrounded by Macedonian security agents who formed a cordon around the plane. When on the plane, he was thrown to the floor, chained down and forcibly tranquillised. While in that position, the applicant was flown to Kabul (Afghanistan) via Baghdad (Iraq).

In the present case, it notes that the whole operation of transferring the applicant into the custody of the CIA was well rehearsed and that the applicant did not pose any threat to his captors, who clearly outnumbered him.

It is for that reason that the Court has repeatedly stressed in its case-law that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Chahal, cited above, § 118). This insistence on the protection of the individual against any abuse of power is illustrated by the fact that Article 5 § 1 circumscribes the circumstances in which individuals may be lawfully deprived of their liberty, it being stressed that these circumstances must be given a narrow interpretation having regard to the fact that they constitute exceptions to a most basic guarantee of individual freedom (see Quinn v.

The requirements of Article 5 §§ 3 and 4 with their emphasis on promptness and judicial supervision assume particular importance in this context. Prompt judicial intervention may lead to the detection and prevention of life-threatening measures or serious ill-treatment which violate the fundamental guarantees contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (see Aksoy, cited above, § 76).

Having assumed control over an individual, the authorities have a duty to account for his or her whereabouts. For this reason, Article 5 must be seen as requiring the authorities to take effective measures to safeguard against the risk of disappearance and to conduct a prompt effective investigation into an arguable claim that a person has been taken into custody and has not been seen since (see Kurt v.

He subsequently disappeared and was thereafter not seen until he returned to Germany on 29 May 2004. The Court has already established to the required standard of proof that the applicant was held in the hotel under constant guard by the Macedonian security forces between 31 December 2003 and 23 January 2004, when he was handed over, at Skopje Airport, into the custody of the US authorities.

His confinement in the hotel was not authorised by a court. Furthermore, the applicant’s detention in the respondent State has not been substantiated by any custody records, or, at least, no such documents have been submitted to the Court. The Court has already found that the failure to hold data recording such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Kurt, cited above, § 125). During his detention in the respondent State, the applicant did not have access to a lawyer, nor was he allowed to contact his family or a representative of the German embassy in the respondent State, as required by Article 36 § 1 (b) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (see paragraph 93 above). Furthermore, he was deprived of any possibility of being brought before a court to test the lawfulness of his detention (see paragraphs 84 and 90 above). His unacknowledged and incommunicado detention means that he was left completely at the mercy of those holding him (see Aksoy, cited above, § 83). Lastly, the Court finds it wholly unacceptable that in a State subject to the rule of law a person could be deprived of his or her liberty in an extraordinary place of detention outside any judicial framework, as was the hotel in the present case. It considers that his detention in such a highly unusual location adds to the arbitrariness of the deprivation of liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Bitiyeva and X v. Russia, nos. 57953/00 and 37392/03, § 118, 21 June 2007)."

Russia, no. 14811/04, §§ 152-53, 20 January 2011; Kadirova and Others v. Russia, no. 5432/07, §§ 127-30, 27 March 2012; and Chitayev v. Russia, no. 59334/00, § 173, 18 January 2007).",

The Court reiterates that a Contracting State would be in violation of Article 5 of the Convention if it removed an applicant to a State where he or she was at real risk of a flagrant breach of that Article (see Othman (Abu Qatada) v. the United Kingdom, no. 8139/09, § 233, ECHR 2012). In the present case, the Court has already established to the required standard of proof that the applicant was subjected to “extraordinary rendition” (see paragraph 221 above), which entails detention ...“outside the normal legal system” and which, “by its deliberate circumvention of due process, is anathema to the rule of law and the values protected by the Convention” (see Babar Ahmad and Others, cited above, §§ 113-14). Furthermore, the detention of terrorist suspects within the “rendition” programme run by the US authorities has already been found to have been arbitrary in other similar cases (see paragraphs 103, 106, 113, 119 and 123 above). In such circumstances, the Court considers that it should have been clear to the Macedonian authorities that, having been handed over into the custody of the US authorities, the applicant faced a real risk of a flagrant violation of his rights under Article 5. In this connection the Court reiterates that Article 5 of the Convention lays down an obligation on the State not only to refrain from active infringements of the rights in question, but also to take appropriate steps to provide protection against an unlawful interference with those rights to everyone within its jurisdiction (see Storck v. Germany, no. 61603/00, §§ 100-01, ECHR 2005 ‑ V, and Medova v. Russia, no. 25385/04, § 123, 15 January 2009). The Macedonian authorities not only failed to comply with their positive obligation to protect the applicant from being detained in contravention of Article 5 of the Convention, but they actively facilitated his subsequent detention in Afghanistan by handing him over to the CIA, despite the fact that they were aware or ought to have been aware of the risk of that transfer. The Court considers therefore that the responsibility of the respondent State is also engaged in respect of the applicant’s detention between 23 January and 28 May 2004 (see, mutatis mutandis, Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, no. 25965/04, § 207, ECHR 2010)."

The applicant’s “enforced disappearance”, although temporary, was characterised by an ongoing situation of uncertainty and unaccountability, which extended through the entire period of his captivity (see Varnava and Others, cited above, § 148). In this connection the Court would point out that in the case of a series of wrongful acts or omissions, the breach extends over the entire period starting with the first of the acts and continuing for as long as the acts or omissions are repeated and remain at variance with the international obligation concerned (see Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 321, and see also paragraph 97 above)."

The Court further recognises that these aspects of the concept extend to situations of deprivation of liberty (see Raninen v. Finland, 16 December 1997, § 63, Reports 1997 ‑ VIII). Article 8 also protects a right to personal development, the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. A person should not be treated in a way that causes a loss of dignity, as “the very essence of the Convention is respect for human dignity and human freedom” (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, §§ 61 and 65, ECHR 2002 ‑ III). Furthermore, the mutual enjoyment by members of a family of each other’s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life (see, mutatis mutandis, Olsson v.

The Court observes that Article 13 guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of this Article is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State. Where an individual has an arguable claim that he has been ill-treated by agents of the State, the notion of an “effective remedy” entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the complainant to the investigatory procedure (see Anguelova, cited above, §§ 161-62; Assenov and Others, cited above, §§ 114 et seq.; Süheyla Aydın v.

While the person might have refused to undergo certain measures suggested by the authorities (a healthcare institution and the police in the present case) prior to such measures being ordered by a court, this does not necessarily imply refusal of the person to comply with authoritative judicial decisions."

Even if the District Court may be presumed to have taken notice of the lack of consent on the part of the applicant in January 2006 despite avoiding its acknowledgment in writing, did not act in compliance with the domestic law as interpreted by the Constitutional Court, since no corroborating evidence was produced by the psychiatrist, who herself relied on the evidence obtained seven months before her report was drafted.

In a note to the Minister's principal private secretary dated 12 October 1992, the Director-General of the Prison Administration Department at the Ministry of Justice explained that the conditions referred to by the Livorno judge responsible for the execution of sentences were due essentially to the fact that fifty-five prisoners had been transferred to Pianosa as a matter of urgency in the night of 19 to 20 July 1992. That had caused practical problems which could to a large extent explain the inconvenience that had been noted. In addition, additional problems had been caused by building works in the prison."

On the basis of the information supplied by prisoners questioned in the prison, the experts had found that the allegations of ill-treatment were wholly unfounded apart from the incident concerning the moving of a handicapped prisoner in a wheelbarrow, which, however, had resulted from a lack of wheelchairs in the prison."

In a note of 12 December 1996 – which was appended to the Government's observations in the proceedings before the Commission – the President of the court responsible for the execution of sentences in Florence said that the incidents that had taken place in Pianosa Prison had been ordered or tolerated by the government of the day. He also considered that the applicant's allegations concerning the conditions during transfers were entirely credible and that transfers of prisoners to Pianosa Prison were carried out using questionable and unjustified methods, the real purpose of which was to intimidate prisoners. He further noted that the high-security wing of Pianosa Prison had been staffed by warders from other prisons who had not been subjected to any selection process and had been given “ carte blanche ”. The result, according to the President of the court, was that management of that wing of the prison had initially been characterised by abuse and irregularities.",

On 20 July 1992 the Minister of Justice issued an order subjecting the applicant to the special prison regime laid down in section 41 bis of Law no. 354 of 1975 until 20 July 1993. The Minister considered that the measure was necessary in particular because of serious public-order and safety considerations following an escalation of an aggressive and ruthless campaign by the Mafia, which had been responsible for the recent assassinations of three judges and eight policemen and for car-bomb attacks in large Italian cities. That situation made it necessary to sever connections between certain prisoners and their milieu. The applicant was subject to the measure concerned because he was of bad character and dangerous; those factors suggested that he had maintained contact with the criminal milieu which he would be able to use to issue instructions or establish links with the outside world that could in turn lead to a breakdown of public order or jeopardise security in prison institutions.

In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see the Tekin v.

In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be “inhuman” or “degrading”, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account (see, for instance, V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24888/94, § 71, ECHR 1999-IX, and the Raninen v.

He confined himself to describing a situation that he said was widespread at Pianosa at the time and to referring to the note of 12 December 1996 of the President of the court responsible for the execution of sentences (see paragraph 50 above).

Thus, there is nothing in the prison medical register to show that the problems the applicant had with his false tooth were caused by blows from a warder.

Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see, among other authorities, the W. v. Switzerland judgment of 26 January 1993, Series A no. 254-A, p. 15, § 30).",

To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty and set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the true facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals, that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention."

In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were “relevant” and “sufficient”, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings (see the Contrada v. Italy judgment of 24 August 1998, Reports 1998-V, p. 2185, § 54, and the I.A. v. France judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, pp. 2978-79, § 102).",

Although those rights are important, they are not absolute.

In their internal legal orders the Contracting States make the rights to vote and to stand for election subject to conditions which are not in principle precluded under Article 3. They have a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere, but it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see the Gitonas and Others v. Greece judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997 ‑ IV, pp. 1233-34, § 39, and Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24833/94, § 63, ECHR 1999-I)."

That affirmation is in contradiction with the tenor of the judgments of the Trapani District Court (see paragraph 23 above) and the Palermo Court of Appeal (see paragraph 26 above).

I wrote that clashes would again take place in the evening, by posting ‘ everybody is preparing for the night ’ [on Facebook]. People there had been saying ‘ We ’ ll give them hell in the evening; we have procured supplies ’ (meaning the fuel for Molotov cocktails had been bought). People are angry. There are also those who do not care and who are afraid, but those who are not afraid are very exasperated and will continue the protest at night. This is no longer a political situation where we could stay there and try to change something; this is already a situation of disorderly crisis which requires conciliatory steps by the State to be resolved.",

When [ such leaders] begin to react to the situation, it is usually too late and their actions have no effect. Mubarak, the Shah of Iran, and all others have gone this way.”"

In addition, fifty-two people had been arrested in connection with their participation in “actions causing a serious breach of public order”; some of them had been convicted of “administrative offences ” and sentenced to a few days ’ “administrative detention” or a fine, while others had been released.

The applicant, his colleague from REAL, and one of the journalists then spent some time in a nearby teahouse. After a while, the three of them returned to Baku.

Nor is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or taken before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or discontinuing suspicions which provide the grounds for detention. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, § 55, Series A no. 300 ‑ A )."

What may be regarded as “ reasonable ” will depend upon all the circumstances (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, § 32, Series A no. 182 ). The length of the deprivation of liberty may also be material to the level of suspicion required (see Murray, cited above, § 56)."

Consequently, the respondent Government have to furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the arrested person was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley, cited above, § 34 in fine )."

The Court notes that the applicant in the present case complained of the lack of “ reasonable ” suspicion against him throughout the entire period of his detention, including both the initial period following his arrest and the subsequent periods when his remand in custody had been authorised and extended by court orders. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a prerequisite for the lawfulness of the continued detention (see, among many other authorities, Stögmüller v. Austria, 10 November 1969, p. 40, § 4, Series A no. 9, and McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 44, ECHR 2006 ‑ X ). Accordingly, while reasonable suspicion must exist at the time of the arrest and initial detention, it must also be shown, in cases of prolonged detention, that the suspicion persisted and remained “ reasonable ” throughout the detention."

In the present case, according to the joint statement of the Prosecutor General ’ s Office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the formal charges against the applicant, the applicant was suspected of organising acts breaching public order in Ismayilli, by verbally inciting Ismayilli town residents to block the central streets and disrupt traffic, disobey lawful demands of the police, commit violence against the police, and disrupt the normal functioning of State authorities and private businesses. The applicant was initially charged with “organising public disorder” and “violent resistance to the police” under Articles 233 and 315.2 of the Criminal Code, respectively. Subsequently, leaving the description of the facts unchanged, the charge under Article 233 was replaced by a more serious charge under Article 220.1 (“mass disorder” ) of the Criminal Code."

The Court has to have regard to all the relevant circumstances in order to be satisfied that there existed any objective information showing that the suspicion against the applicant was “reasonable”. In this connection, the Court finds it material that the applicant was an opposition politician who had a history of criticizing the current Government in the wake of the upcoming presidential elections, that some members of parliament had threatened to sue him, and that before his arrest the applicant had posted on his blog sourced information showing that at least part of the official Government version of what had happened in Ismayilli might have been untrue or misrepresented and openly suggesting that the official version was a cover-up attempt. What also needs to be considered is that the applicant was charged with “organising” a riot that had already started in Ismayilli one day before his visit to the town and that had initially been sparked, in a spontaneous manner, by an incident of local significance. By all accounts, the applicant had nothing to do with the original incident of 23 January 2013 that had caused the riot or with what was going on in Ismayilli prior to his visit, and the prosecuting authorities ’ own account of the events, both in their press statement of 29 January 2013 and in the description of the charges against the applicant (see paragraphs 14 and 27 above), shows that most, if not all, of the damage caused by the rioting (such as burning of buildings and cars) had taken place on 23 January 2013, before the applicant ’ s arrival."

The question then is whether the arrest and detention were based on sufficient objective elements to justify a “reasonable suspicion” that the facts at issue had actually occurred (see Włoch v. Poland, no. 27785/95, § 108, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI). The very specific context of the present case calls for a high level of scrutiny of the facts. The Court ’ s task is to verify whether there existed sufficient objective elements that could lead an objective observer to reasonably believe that the applicant might have committed the acts alleged by the prosecuting authorities."

In this connection, the applicant submitted that there existed no information or evidence giving rise to a “reasonable” suspicion that he had committed any of the criminal offences with which he was charged. He consistently claimed, both at the domestic level and before the Court, that the prosecution had failed to produce any such evidence, either before the domestic courts or otherwise. The Court reiterates that the Government were silent on this point and have not submitted any specific arguments to rebut the applicant ’ s assertion on this issue.

No such statements or other information was presented to the courts deciding on the applicant ’ s remand in custody.

However, in the present case, the above directives were not taken into account. The vague and general references by both the prosecution and the courts, in their respective documents and decisions, to unspecified “case material”, in the absence of any specific statement, information or concrete complaint cannot be regarded as sufficient to justify the “reasonableness ” of the suspicion on which the applicant ’ s arrest and detention were based (compare Lazoroski v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, no. 4922/04, § 48, 8 October 2009 )."

As mentioned above, those records were not presented before the domestic courts, nor were the witnesses ’ names and statements otherwise mentioned in the prosecution ’ s procedural decisions (such as the decision to charge the applicant with criminal offences), the prosecution ’ s submissions to the domestic courts, the domestic courts ’ decisions, or the available transcripts of the court hearings.

That, however, does not affect the Court ’ s findings in connection with the present complaint, in which it is called upon to examine whether the deprivation of the applicant ’ s liberty during the pre ‑ trial period was justified on the basis of information or facts available at the relevant time. In this respect, having regard to the above analysis, the Court finds that the material put before it does not meet the minimum standard set by Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention for the reasonableness of a suspicion required for an individual ’ s arrest and continued detention.

Switzerland, 25 March 1983, § 38, Series A no. 62 ), but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations, which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, § 41, and Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § § 41-43, ECHR 2000 ‑ X ).

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Khuzhin and Others v. Russia, no. 13470/02, § 94, 23 October 2008, with further references).

The Government admitted that various circumstances surrounding the applicant ’ s political activities could not be ignored and that it could be suggested that his political ambitions “went counter to the mainstream line of the administration” of the country. However, any person in a similar position could make similar allegations and, in reality, it would have been impossible to prosecute a suspect with the applicant ’ s profile without far-reaching political consequences. The fact that the suspect ’ s political opponents might directly or indirectly benefit from his being detained should not prevent the authorities from prosecuting such a person if there were serious charges against him. The Government noted that statements and resolutions of various political institutions, public figures and NGOs made in respect of the applicant ’ s case might raise certain suspicion as to the authorities ’ real intent. However, such suspicion is not sufficient for the Court to conclude that the whole legal machinery of the respondent State in the present case was ab initio misused and that, from the beginning to the end, the authorities were acting in bad faith and in blatant disregard of the Convention. That would be a very serious claim requiring an incontrovertible and direct proof. However, in this case, such proof was absent. Therefore, the Government argued that no breach of Article 18 should be found in the present case."

The applicant reiterated that the real purpose of restricting his rights under Articles 5, 6, 13 and 14 of the Convention was to eliminate him as potentially one of the most serious opponents of the ruling party in the upcoming presidential election. He argued that the authorities had been planning to arrest him and remove him from public life for months, and that the events in Ismayilli were seen by them as a “good opportunity” to implement this plan. He further noted that his blog postings about the events in Ismayilli had also been a reason for his persecution, as he had first been “invited” to the Prosecutor General ’ s Office a day after his blog posting of 28 January 2013 which contained information that had “exploded” the newspaper headlines in the country. The applicant also referred to the statements and resolutions by international organisations, local and international NGOs and various officials, expressing deep concern over, or strongly condemning, the applicant ’ s arrest and noting that it gave rise to justified doubts and legitimate concerns that the criminal case against him was politically motivated and constituted an attempt to intimidate the opposition."

It can only be applied in conjunction with other Articles of the Convention (see Gusinskiy v. Russia, no. 70276/01, § 75, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV ). As it has previously held in its case-law, the whole structure of the Convention rests on the general assumption that public authorities in the member States act in good faith. Indeed, any public policy or individual measure may have a “hidden agenda”, and the presumption of good faith is rebuttable. However, an applicant alleging that his rights and freedoms were limited for an improper reason must convincingly show that the real aim of the authorities was not the same as that proclaimed or which could be reasonably inferred from the context. A mere suspicion that the authorities used their powers for some other purpose than those defined in the Convention is not sufficient to prove that Article 18 was breached (see Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no. 5829/04, § 255, 31 May 2011 )."

                "138. When an allegation under Article 18 of the Convention is made, the Court applies a very exacting standard of proof. As a consequence, there are only a few cases where a breach of that Convention provision has been found. Thus, in Gusinskiy (cited above, §§ 73-78), the Court accepted that the applicant ’ s liberty had been restricted, inter alia, for a purpose other than those mentioned in Article 5. It based its findings on an agreement signed between the detainee and a federal Minister for the Press, from which it was clear that the applicant ’ s detention had been applied in order to make him sell his media company to the State. In Cebotari v. Moldova (no. 35615/06, §§ 46 et seq., 13 November 2007) the Court found a violation of Article 18 of the Convention in a context where the applicant ’ s arrest was visibly linked to an application pending before the Court. In Lutsenko v. Ukraine (no. 6492/11, §§ 108-09, 3 July 2012) the prosecuting authorities seeking the applicant ’ s arrest explicitly indicated the applicant ’ s communication with the media as one of the grounds for his arrest, such reasoning clearly demonstrating that his arrest was an attempt to punish him for publicly disagreeing with accusations against him. In Tymoshenko v. Ukraine (no. 49872/11, § 299, 30 April 2013) the reasoning formally advanced by the authorities suggested that the actual purpose of the detention was to punish the applicant for a lack of respect towards the court which it was claimed she had been manifesting by her behaviour during the judicial proceedings. Furthermore, both the Lutsenko and Tymoshenko cases were similar in their circumstances in that both applicants who were former high-ranking Government officials and leaders of opposition parties were, soon after the change of power, accused of abuse of power and the authorities ’ actions against them were considered by the public to be part of the politically motivated prosecution of opposition leaders in Ukraine. However, in both cases, the Court chose to look at the matter separately from this general context of the allegedly politically motivated prosecution, because in each case it could discern other specific features (described above ) which led to a finding of a breach of Article 18 (see Lutsenko, cited above, § 108, and Tymoshenko, cited above, §§ 296 and 298-99)."

                "140. The Court takes note of the various opinions about the applicant ’ s case which suggest that he was subjected to politically motivated prosecution. However, as the political process and adjudicative process are fundamentally different, the Court must base its decision on “ evidence in the legal sense” and its own assessment of the specific relevant facts (see, mutatis mutandis, Khodorkovskiy, cited above, § 259). The Court notes that the circumstances of the present case suggest that the applicant ’ s arrest and detention had distinguishable features which allow the Court to analyse the situation independently of various opinions voiced in connection with this case."

Thus, the conclusion to be drawn from this finding is that the authorities have not been able to demonstrate that they acted in good faith. However, that conclusion in itself is not sufficient to assume that Article 18 was breached, and it remains to be seen whether there is proof that the authorities ’ actions were actually driven by improper reasons."

In particular, the Court refers to all the material circumstances which it has had regard to in connection with its assessment of the complaint under Article 5 § 1 (c) (see paragraph 92 above ), and considers them equally relevant in the context of the present complaint. Moreover, it considers that the applicant ’ s arrest was linked to the specific blog entries made by the applicant on 25, 28 and 30 January 2013. The blog post of 28 January 2013, in particular, included sourced information shedding light on the “true causes” of the Ismayilli protests, which the Government reportedly attempted to withhold from the public and which was immediately picked up by the press. Following the applicant ’ s blog entry, the information cited by the applicant was promptly removed from the websites of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Ministry of Taxes (see paragraph 13 above). Even though the prosecution did not make any express references to the applicant ’ s blog entries, the Court notes that the accusations against him were first made in the authorities ’ official press statement of 29 January 2013, immediately after the applicant ’ s blog post of 28 January 2013, and he was first “invited” to the Prosecutor General ’ s Office for questioning on the same day. Whereas by that time several days had passed from the applicant ’ s visit of Ismayilli on 24 January 2013, there is nothing in the case file to show that the prosecution had any objective information giving rise to a bona fide suspicion against the applicant at that time, and it has not been shown that they were in possession of any such information or witness statements at any point up to the moment of the applicant ’ s arrest on 4 February 2013."

The fourth option was the applicant's detention in St Patrick's, which option was adopted with “considerable reluctance” by the court as the only manner of vindicating the applicant's constitutional rights. The High Court acknowledged that it was a penal institution. However, having noted the conflicting constitutional rights of the applicant, the applicant's needs, the constitutional obligations of the State to the applicant and the relevant jurisprudence of the High and Supreme Courts in similar cases, the High Court judge was satisfied that the evidence supported his findings that, in the absence of any other facility within the State, the place most suitable to ensure the applicant's welfare was St Patrick's, and that the High Court could exercise its “inherent jurisdiction” developed by the jurisprudence (to which the judgment referred) in making an order for the applicant's detention there. It was noted that the applicant had been in that institution previously and seemed to have done well there. Accordingly, he ordered that the applicant be brought to St Patrick's by the police and be detained there for three weeks (until 18 July 1997 ), all parties agreeing that detention for longer was not appropriate.

It is not a solution. None of the other options are a solution either.

He also submitted that detention in a penal institution did not appropriately harmonise his conflicting rights under Article 42 § 5 and Article 40 § 4 (1). He also dealt, in his submissions, with the place of detention proposed by the High Court arguing that, if detention was necessary and lawful to protect and vindicate a child's rights, detention in a penal institution was not. A penal institution is a place of punishment, the effect of detention there, with or without conviction, constituted punishment and it was completely different to a high-security unit staffed by qualified childcare workers and operated in a manner consistent with Article 42 of the Constitution. His placement in a suitable high security environment would be more appropriate to his needs and the effect of such an order would be to oblige the Board to comply with its statutory duties and the State to comply with its constitutional duties through the Board.

This was the case, even though the State's obligations at that time to provide educational supervision did not extend to persons over 16 years of age. Accordingly, his detention was not “fruitless” (as in Bouamar ) as it was aimed at the facilitation of his educational supervision thereafter. Moreover, the applicant's period of detention was kept to a minimum and was therefore significantly shorter than in Bouamar.

Indeed, it was obvious that the Board had no proposals at all to place before the High Court as to what to do with the applicant after St Patrick's. The failure to provide this educational supervision after his release in July led to a further period of incarceration in St Patrick's in August 1997.

He was subjected to its disciplinary regime and it is not considered that the exceptions to that regime imposed by the High Court (concerning access to, assessment of and reporting on the applicant) rendered his stay in St Patrick's anything other than a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 § 1.

However, the relevant part of Article 5 § 1 (d) referring to “educational supervision” concerns the detention of “minors”, accepted by Ireland (section 2(1) of the Child Care Act 1991) to be persons under the age of 18. Since the applicant was therefore a minor throughout the relevant period, the only question for the Court is whether the detention was lawful and “for the purpose” of educational supervision ( Bouamar, cited above, p. 21, § 50) within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (d)."

The Court found as follows (at paragraphs 50-53):",
                "“50. ... The Court notes the confinement of a juvenile in a remand prison does not necessarily contravene sub-paragraph (d), even if it is not in itself such as to provide for the person's “educational supervision”. As is apparent from the words “for the purpose of” (“ pour ”), the “detention” referred to in the text is a means of ensuring that the person concerned is placed under “educational supervision”, but the placement does not necessarily have to be an immediate one. Just as Article 5 § 1 recognises ... the distinction between pre-trial detention and detention after conviction, so sub-paragraph (d) does not preclude an interim custody measure being used as a preliminary to a regime of supervised education, without itself involving any supervised education. In such circumstances, however, the imprisonment must be speedily followed by actual application of such a regime in a setting (open or closed) designed and with sufficient resources for the purpose.",
                "52. In the Government's submission, the placements complained of were part of an educative programme initiated by the courts, and Mr Bouamar's behaviour during the relevant time enabled them to gain a clearer picture of his personality.",
                "The Court does not share this view. The Belgian State chose the system of educational supervision with a view to carrying out its policy on juvenile delinquency. Consequently it was under an obligation to put in place appropriate institutional facilities which met the demands of security and the educational objectives of the 1965 Act, in order to be able to satisfy the requirements of Article 5 § 1 (d) of the Convention ... Nothing in the evidence, however, shows that this was the case. At the time of the events in issue, Belgium did not have – at least in the French-speaking region in which the applicant lived – any closed institution able to accommodate highly disturbed juveniles. ... The detention of a young man in a remand prison in conditions of virtual isolation and without the assistance of staff with educational training cannot be regarded as furthering any educational aim. ...",

The Court notes that the detention orders impugned in the present case were made against the background of enduring and considerable efforts by various authorities to ensure the best possible care and upbringing for the applicant. Nevertheless, the Court's case-law, outlined above, provides that if the Irish State chose a constitutional system of educational supervision implemented through court orders to deal with juvenile delinquency, it was obliged to put in place appropriate institutional facilities which met the security and educational demands of that system in order to satisfy the requirements of Article 5 § 1 (d)."

The only indication of his participation in recreational activities is a brief reference to his playing football in a medical report (see paragraph 43 above). Most importantly, the High Court itself was convinced that St Patrick's could not guarantee his constitutional educational rights or provide the special care he required: even with the special conditions the High Court attached to his detention, the High Court considered St Patrick's to be the best of four inappropriate options and that, accordingly, his detention there should be temporary."

Moreover, it is sufficient if the victim is humiliated in his or her own eyes (see Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, p. 16, § 32, and Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, ECHR 1999-VI)."

It is noted that the Court rejected Mr Aerts's complaint under Article 3 about his detention, when he was mentally ill, in the psychiatric wing of a prison which was accepted to be sub-standard. In the present case, the applicant was detained in a prison where a significant portion of the detainees were the same age as, or close in age to, the applicant. It was a penal institution with a regime adapted to juvenile detainees with particular educational and recreational activities of which facilities the applicant could have availed himself. That regime was further tempered, in the applicant's case, by the specific conditions imposed by the High Court (concerning access to, assessment of and reporting on the applicant), which conditions the applicant does not dispute were complied with. Furthermore, the fact that the applicant was subject to prison discipline does not, of itself, give rise to an issue under Article 3 given that it constituted restraint for his and for other's safety in light of his history of criminal activity, of self-harm and of violence to others (see Herczegfalvy v.

Even assuming that the feelings of depression, frustration and anger to which the above-described medical report referred (at paragraph 43) were caused by the applicant's incarceration (and it is noted that he had already been diagnosed as having a personality disorder), neither the prescribed treatment, the medical officer's view that the applicant was “quite well” or the consultant psychiatrist's diagnosis (see paragraph 44 above) demonstrate that the impact on him of his detention amounted to treatment falling within the scope of Article 3. Indeed, the applicant had been in St Patrick's in early 1997 and the High Court found on the evidence that he appeared to have done well there. Moreover, he has provided no evidence of the allegation, made in his initial application, that he was ill-treated by fellow inmates consequent on his unique status in that institution and indeed he only referred, without further substantiation or elaboration, to this matter in his first observations."

In addition, the Court does not consider that the fact that he was a minor is sufficient to bring the handcuffing of the applicant within the scope of Article 3: he was, as any adult could be, considered by the High Court to be a danger to himself and to others in light of his history of criminal activity, of self-harm and of violence to others.

As such, this criterion was open to far too broad an interpretation, and the Law did not, therefore, meet the Convention requirements of legal certainty and foreseeability.

The applicant and Mr Z. had been involved in disputes related to their joint business activity which had been the object of five sets of judicial proceedings between them. The applicant had apparently threatened Mr Z., stating in a letter to him that, inter alia, the only possible method of getting his money back was “the axe”, and that “a dog deserves a dog's death”.

On 14 October 1993 the prosecutor transmitted the file to the local police department with instructions to investigate Mr Z.'s complaint and to serve the applicant with a warning that he should cease his unlawful behaviour. On 20 October 1993, after hearing the applicant, a police officer drew up a report in which he stated, inter alia, that the applicant had repeated his threats against Mr Z., and that he appeared to have mental problems and was likely to carry out his threats. The police officer also heard a neighbour of the applicant who stated that he was a troublemaker."

In their report of 9 November 1995, the medical experts who examined the applicant during his confinement in a psychiatric hospital (see paragraph 26 below) concluded that he had a paranoiac psychosis, that he was aggressive and posed a threat to others.

It may be acceptable, in urgent cases or where a person is arrested because of his violent behaviour, that such an opinion be obtained immediately after the arrest. In all other cases a prior consultation is necessary.

There was no claim that the case involved an emergency. The applicant did not have a history of mental illness and had apparently presented a medical opinion to the effect that he was mentally healthy. In these circumstances, the Court cannot accept that in the absence of an assessment by a psychiatrist the views of a prosecutor and a police officer on the applicant's mental health, which were moreover based on evidence dating from 1993 and 1994, sufficed to justify an order for his arrest, let alone his detention for twenty-five days in August and September 1995.",

However, these provisions did not mention any competence of the prosecutor to order the detention of the individual concerned with the aim of securing his examination. Instruction no. 1/81 of the Minister of Public Health, which implied such a competence, did not lay down any rules in this respect and thus lacked the requisite clarity.",

The applicant’s lawyer challenged the refusal to bring the action, arguing that her client should have the opportunity to assess by himself whether or not, having regard to the living conditions at the home, it was in his interests to remain there. She pointed out that the enforced continuation of his stay in the home, on the pretext of providing him with treatment in his own interests, amounted in practice to a deprivation of liberty, a situation that was unacceptable. A person could not be placed in an institution without his or her consent. In accordance with the legislation in force, anyone under partial guardianship was free to choose his or her place of residence, with the guardian’s agreement.

Firstly, the applicant could at any time have applied personally to a court for restoration of his legal capacity, under Article 277 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“the CCP”), and release from guardianship would have allowed him to leave the home of his own accord. Secondly, his close relatives had not availed themselves of the possibility open to some of them, under Articles 113 and 115 of the Family Code (“the FC”), of asking the guardianship authority to replace his guardian. According to the Government, in the event of a refusal the applicants’ relatives could have applied to a court, which would have considered the merits of the request and, if appropriate, appointed a new guardian, who would then have been able to terminate the placement agreement. The Government also submitted in substance that the applicant’s close relatives could have challenged the contract signed between the guardian R.P. and the Pastra social care home. Lastly, they indicated that the applicant himself could have requested the guardianship authority to appoint an ad hoc representative on account of his alleged conflict of interests with his guardian, with a view to requesting to leave the institution and establish his home elsewhere (Article 123 § 1 of the FC)."

The applicant further submitted that he had been denied permission to travel on many other occasions by the home’s management. He added that, in accordance with a practice with no legal basis, residents who left the premises for longer than the authorised period were treated as fugitives and were searched for by the police. He stated in that connection that on one occasion the police had arrested him in Ruse and that, although they had not taken him back to the home, the fact that the Director had asked for him to be located and transferred back had amounted to a decisive restriction on his right to personal liberty. He stated that he had been arrested and detained by the police pending the arrival of staff from the home to collect him, without being informed of the grounds for depriving him of his liberty.

He had had no free choice as to his clothing, the preparation of his meals, participation in cultural events or the development of relations with other people, including intimate relationships as the home’s residents were all men.

Those circumstances reflected a widespread practice in Bulgaria whereby once people were deprived of legal capacity, even partially, they were deemed incapable of expressing their wishes.

They observed in that connection that the applicant had not been compulsorily admitted to a psychiatric institution by the public authorities under the Public Health Act, but had been housed in a social care home at his guardian’s request, on the basis of a civil-law agreement and in accordance with the rules on social assistance. Thus, persons in need of assistance, including those with mental disorders, could request various social and medical services, either directly or through their representatives, under the Social Assistance Act 1998 (see paragraphs 57-60 above).

As a rule, residents were able to leave the premises only with the express permission of the director of the home, and for a limited period. In cases of unauthorised leave, the police had the power to search for and return the persons concerned. The same restrictive regime applied to all residents, without any distinction according to legal status – whether they had full, partial or no legal capacity – and in the view of Interights this was a decisive factor.

Interights contended that in reality, when faced with a choice between a precarious, homeless existence and the relative security offered by a social care home, incapable persons in central and east European countries might opt for the latter solution, simply because no alternative services were offered by the State’s social welfare system.

Although the process of classification into one or other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of Article 5 depends (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, §§ 92-93, Series A no. 39). In order to determine whether someone has been deprived of his liberty, the starting-point must be his specific situation and account must be taken of a whole range of factors such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see Storck, cited above, § 71, and Guzzardi, cited above, § 92)."

Otherwise, there would be a sizeable gap in the protection from arbitrary detention, which would be inconsistent with the importance of personal liberty in a democratic society. The State is therefore obliged to take measures providing effective protection of vulnerable persons, including reasonable steps to prevent a deprivation of liberty of which the authorities have or ought to have knowledge (see Storck, cited above, § 102). Thus, having regard to the particular circumstances of the cases before it, the Court has held that the national authorities’ responsibility was engaged as a result of detention in a psychiatric hospital at the request of the applicant’s guardian (see Shtukaturov, cited above) and detention in a private clinic (see Storck, cited above).",

The Court observes at the outset that it is unnecessary in the present case to determine whether, in general terms, any placement of a legally incapacitated person in a social care institution constitutes a “deprivation of liberty” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1. In some cases, the placement is initiated by families who are also involved in the guardianship arrangements and is based on civil-law agreements signed with an appropriate social care institution. Accordingly, any restrictions on liberty in such cases are the result of actions by private individuals and the authorities’ role is limited to supervision. The Court is not called upon in the present case to rule on the obligations that may arise under the Convention for the authorities in such situations."

No members of the applicant’s family were involved in his guardianship arrangements, and the duties of guardian were assigned to a State official (Ms R.P.), who negotiated and signed the placement agreement with the Pastra social care home without any contact with the applicant, whom she had in fact never met. The placement agreement was implemented in a State-run institution by social services, which likewise did not interview the applicant (see paragraphs 12-15 above). The applicant was never consulted about his guardian’s choices, even though he could have expressed a valid opinion and his consent was necessary in accordance with the Persons and Family Act 1949 (see paragraph 42 above). That being so, he was not transferred to the Pastra social care home at his request or on the basis of a voluntary private-law agreement on admission to an institution to receive social assistance and protection. The Court considers that the restrictions complained of by the applicant are the result of various steps taken by public authorities and institutions through their officials, from the initial request for his placement in an institution and throughout the implementation of the relevant measure, and not of acts or initiatives by private individuals. Although there is no indication that the applicant’s guardian acted in bad faith, the above considerations set the present case apart from Nielsen (cited above), in which the applicant’s mother committed her son, a minor, to a psychiatric institution in good faith, which prompted the Court to find that the measure in question entailed the exercise of exclusive custodial rights over a child who was not capable of expressing a valid opinion."

Nevertheless, it observes that such leave of absence was entirely at the discretion of the home’s management, who kept the applicant’s identity papers and administered his finances, including transport costs (see paragraphs 25-26 above).

Instead, he was taken to Pastra by ambulance and placed in the home without being informed of the reasons for or duration of that measure, which had been taken by his officially assigned guardian. The Court observes in this connection that there are situations where the wishes of a person with impaired mental faculties may validly be replaced by those of another person acting in the context of a protective measure and that it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the true wishes or preferences of the person concerned. However, the Court has already held that the fact that a person lacks legal capacity does not necessarily mean that he is unable to comprehend his situation (see Shtukaturov, cited above, § 108). In the present case, domestic law attached a certain weight to the applicant’s wishes and it appears that he was well aware of his situation.

In support of that contention, the applicant argued that the Director of the home had deemed him capable of integrating into the community and that attempts had been made to bring him closer to his family, albeit to no avail. Accordingly, the authorities had based their decision to place him in the home on the simple fact that his family were not prepared to take care of him and he needed social assistance. They had not examined whether the necessary assistance could be provided through alternative measures that were less restrictive of his personal liberty. Such measures were, moreover, quite conceivable since Bulgarian legislation made provision for a wide range of social services, such as personal assistance, social rehabilitation centres and special allowances and pensions. The authorities had thus failed to strike a fair balance between the applicant’s social needs and his right to liberty.

Lastly, relying on the Ashingdane judgment (cited above, § 44), the Government submitted that there was an adequate link between the reason given for the placement, namely the applicant’s state of health, and the institution in which he had been placed.

On the basis of the study referred to in paragraphs 112 to 114 above, Interights submitted that in central and east European countries, the placement of mentally disordered persons in a social care home was viewed solely in terms of social protection and was governed by contractual law.

The Court had held that the lack of any fixed procedural rules on the admission and detention of such persons was striking. In its view, the contrast between this dearth of regulation and the extensive network of safeguards applicable to formal psychiatric committals covered by mental-health legislation was significant. In the absence of a formalised admission procedure, indicating who could propose admission, for what reasons and on what basis, and given the lack of indication as to the length of the detention or the nature of treatment or care, the hospital’s health-care professionals had assumed full control of the liberty and treatment of a vulnerable incapacitated person solely on the basis of their own clinical assessments completed as and when they saw fit. While not doubting that those professionals had acted in good faith and in the applicant’s best interests, the Court had observed that the very purpose of procedural safeguards was to protect individuals against any misjudgments and professional lapses (ibid., §§ 120-21)."

Furthermore, the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained.

The Court therefore concludes that the decision by the applicant’s guardian R.P. to place him in a social care home for people with mental disorders without having obtained his prior consent was invalid under Bulgarian law.

However, the objective need for accommodation and social assistance must not automatically lead to the imposition of measures involving deprivation of liberty. The Court considers that any protective measure should reflect as far as possible the wishes of persons capable of expressing their will.

In the instant case it is true that the expert medical report produced in the course of the proceedings for the applicant’s legal incapacitation referred to the disorders from which he was suffering. However, the relevant examination took place before November 2000, whereas the applicant was placed in the Pastra social care home on 10 December 2002 (see paragraphs 10 and 14 above). More than two years thus elapsed between the expert psychiatric assessment relied on by the authorities and the applicant’s placement in the home, during which time his guardian did not check whether there had been any change in his condition and did not meet or consult him. Unlike the Government (see paragraph 138 above), the Court considers that this period is excessive and that a medical opinion issued in 2000 cannot be regarded as a reliable reflection of the state of the applicant’s mental health at the time of his placement. It should also be noted that the national authorities were not under any legal obligation to order a psychiatric report at the time of the placement. The Government explained in that connection that the applicable provisions were those of the Social Assistance Act and not those of the Health Act (see paragraphs 57-60 and 137 above). Nevertheless, in the Court’s view, the lack of a recent medical assessment would be sufficient to conclude that the applicant’s placement in the home was not lawful for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 (e)."

While it is true that Article 5 § 1 (e) authorises the confinement of a person suffering from a mental disorder even where no medical treatment is necessarily envisaged (see Hutchison Reid, cited above, § 52), such a measure must be properly justified by the seriousness of the person’s condition in the interests of ensuring his or her own protection or that of others. In the present case, however, it has not been established that the applicant posed a danger to himself or to others, for example because of his psychiatric condition; the simple assertion by certain witnesses that he became aggressive when he drank (see paragraph 10 above) cannot suffice for this purpose.

Nevertheless, under that Article the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing him with the requisite medical assistance (see Kudła, cited above, §§ 92-94)."

In laying down such regulation, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. Whilst the final decision as to observance of the Convention’s requirements rests with the Court, it is no part of the Court’s function to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities any other assessment of what might be the best policy in this field. Nonetheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (ibid.; see also, among many other authorities, Cordova v.

In the Court’s view, the need to seek the intervention of the public prosecutor is scarcely reconcilable with direct access to court for persons under partial guardianship in so far as the decision to intervene is left to the prosecutor’s discretion.

In addition, the Court acknowledges that restrictions on a person’s procedural rights, even where the person has been only partially deprived of legal capacity, may be justified for the person’s own protection, the protection of the interests of others and the proper administration of justice. However, the importance of exercising these rights will vary according to the purpose of the action which the person concerned intends to bring before the courts. In particular, the right to ask a court to review a declaration of incapacity is one of the most important rights for the person concerned since such a procedure, once initiated, will be decisive for the exercise of all the rights and freedoms affected by the declaration of incapacity, not least in relation to any restrictions that may be placed on the person’s liberty (see also Shtukaturov, cited above, § 71).

Nevertheless, it seems clear that this problem may be solved by other, less restrictive means than automatic denial of direct access, for example by limiting the frequency with which applications may be made or introducing a system for prior examination of their admissibility on the basis of the file."

However, it is not necessary to establish whether this was the case. The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, Article 5 § 1 (e) of the Convention when read in the light of its object and purpose cannot be interpreted as only allowing the detention of “alcoholics” in the limited sense of persons in a clinical state of “alcoholism”. Under this provision, persons who are not medically diagnosed as “alcoholics”, but whose conduct and behaviour under the influence of alcohol pose a threat to public order or themselves, can be taken into custody for the protection of the public or their own interests, such as their health or personal safety. It does not, however, permit the detention of an individual merely because of his alcohol intake (see, in particular, the above-cited Witold Litwa v. Poland judgment, §§ 60 to 63).",

On another occasion, she prepared to throw a waste bin at an officer while he was assisting another member of the public (see paragraph 12, sub ‑ paragraph (v) above). After the officer raised his arm in order to protect himself, she slammed the bin on the floor. The Icelandic Supreme Court concluded that the descriptions contained in the police reports had not been refuted. The Court, seeing no reason for reaching a contrary conclusion, finds it established that the applicant's conduct and behaviour were under the strong influence of alcohol and could reasonably be considered to entail a threat to public order.

                "(i) In the night of Sunday 31 January 1988 at 3.40 a.m., the applicant went to a local police station in a Reykjavík suburb accompanied by two taxi drivers. Although she only had ISK 100 in her possession, the taxi fare amounted to ISK 1.825. According to a police report (signed by Police Officer R.B.), the taxi drivers had stated that “they had been driving [the applicant] during the night, but since she had refused to pay they had driven her to the nearest police station.” The police report further stated that she was “obviously drunk and agitated” and that she was “very agitated, foul-mouthed and disruptive.” The applicant was then transferred to Reykjavík Police Headquarters where she was, on the decision of Assistant Police Inspector H.Ó., detained in custody until the next morning.",

She expressed surprise over the fact that not only had she been subjected to a string of accusations by the police but also she had been held in detention without being given any reasons. She was released at 9.25 a.m.",
                "(ii) On Friday 18 May 1990 at 0.05 a.m., the applicant arrived at the Reykjavík police headquarters at Hverfisgata.

She would not calm down despite repeated requests and finally it became necessary to restrain her by placing her in police custody.”",

Since the relevant hand-written card file was no longer available, the time of her release could not be confirmed.",
                "(iii) On Saturday 8 December 1990 at 10.15 p.m., the applicant went again to the Reykjavík police headquarters. A police report (signed by Police Officer M.M. and addressed to the Police Commissioner) entitled “Intoxication, arrest and detention in police custody” was drawn up on her arrival:",

The relevant police report (signed by Police Officer M.M.), entitled “Intoxication, improper behaviour, and detention in police custody”, stated that her visit did not seem have any purpose and that she was very obviously drunk. Before she could be stopped, she had burst into the office of the inspector in charge and addressed him in derogatory terms as a “son of a bitch” and a “eunuch”. She was then arrested and held in police custody. The reason for her arrest according to the police report was that she had directed a stream of verbal abuse at the inspector. The decision had been taken by Inspector B.S.",
                "The relevant custody record indicated that the applicant had been held in detention from 0.18 a.m. until 10.38 a.m. the following morning. The reason for her detention was registered as: “policemen; violent behaviour towards policemen (106-107)”. The reference in brackets appears to be Articles 106 and 107 of the General Penal Code (see paragraphs 27 below).",

The police report concerning the incident (signed by Police Officer H.D.), stated that she was very obviously intoxicated and agitated and that she made a habit of visiting the police station when under the influence of alcohol. Moreover, she had made a lot of noise, including calling out the names of various police officers. Her noises and screams increased to the point of disturbing the peace required for the work of the station. The applicant grabbed a waste bin standing at the entrance to the police station and prepared herself to throw the bin at Police Inspector R.A. who was helping a man to wash blood off his face. The applicant slammed the bin onto the floor with a loud bang when the policeman raised his hand in order to protect himself. The applicant had been ordered many times to leave the station, but to no avail. Instead, without permission, she had entered a corridor at the station and reached the personnel lounge, while carrying a glass containing a liquor mixture. According to R.A., she had threatened Assistant Inspector K.G. and had become very agitated when kindly requested to stop screaming and to leave the station.",
                "When she refused to leave she was arrested and brought to the detention facility. The decision was taken by Inspector R.A. The police report stated the reason for her arrest as “state of intoxication etc.” According to the relevant custody record she was detained from approximately 9.20 p.m. until 7.34 a.m. the following morning. The reason for her detention was recorded as “Alcoholic Beverages Act, drunkenness in a public place (section 21).”",
                "(vi) On Saturday 11 January 1992 at 2.39 a.m., the police was called to the Hotel Saga in Reykjavík. According to the relevant police report (signed by Police Officer H.R.), when the police arrived the applicant had been restrained by the hotel staff. She was very obviously intoxicated and agitated. The applicant was arrested and taken into custody for “intoxication”. The decision was taken by Assistant Inspector K.G. According to the relevant custody record (dated 14 February 2001 ) the applicant was detained from 3.14 a.m. until 9.17 a.m. the following morning.

She had not behaved dangerously after consuming alcohol and had not endangered public safety; nor had her detention in a prison cell been necessary for the protection of her own interests. Had her detention been ordered for such reasons, the police could have been expected to have secured evidence in support, for instance by means of medical observation pursuant to the Alcoholic Beverages Act 1998 or a criminal investigation. Even the police reports did not state that public safety was jeopardised by the applicant's behaviour. The real reason for her detention was that the police had become annoyed.",

That provision would otherwise become nugatory, as such confirmation was normally unavailable when police became involved with intoxicated persons. The purpose of that provision must be borne in mind, namely to permit national authorities to take measures with respect to persons who were under the influence of alcohol or other inebriating substances, or persons whose mental condition was otherwise such as to present a danger to themselves or their environment. In that connection the Government prayed in aid the Court's judgment in Witold Litwa v. Poland case (cited above) and decision in Dieudonné Duriez-Costes v. France (no. 50638/99, dec. 24.10.2000). As indicated in the relevant police reports, on all of the six occasions when the applicant had been deprived of her liberty, she bore all the external signs of intoxication, which could explain why her behaviour was unrestrained. Thus the measures were covered by Article 5 § 1 (e)."

While agreeing with the Government's view as to the non-conclusive character of the medical certificate of 13 December 1996, the Court does not find that the other evidence before it enables it to ascertain that - five years ago or more, at the time of the impugned events - the applicant was addicted to alcohol or was an alcoholic in the narrow medical meaning of the term. However, it is not necessary to establish whether this was the case. The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, Article 5 § 1 (e) of the Convention when read in the light of its object and purpose cannot be interpreted as only allowing the detention of “alcoholics” in the limited sense of persons in a clinical state of “alcoholism”. Under this provision, persons who are not medically diagnosed as “alcoholics”, but whose conduct and behaviour under the influence of alcohol pose a threat to public order or themselves, can be taken into custody for the protection of the public or their own interests, such as their health or personal safety. It does not, however, permit the detention of an individual merely because of his alcohol intake (see, in particular, the above-cited Witold Litwa v. Poland judgment, §§ 60 to 63).",
                "Accordingly, what is decisive for the issue of applicability of sub-paragraph (e) to the case under review is whether the applicant behaved when drunk in such a way as to pose a threat to public order.",

Each time, this included verbal abuse against the officers. On one occasion, she threatened to assault the officers and lashed about with a leather belt (see paragraph 12, sub-paragraph (iii) above). On another occasion, she prepared to throw a waste bin at an officer while he was assisting another member of the public (see paragraph 12, sub ‑ paragraph (v) above). After the officer raised his arm in order to protect himself, she slammed the bin on the floor. The Icelandic Supreme Court concluded that the descriptions contained in the police reports had not been refuted. The Court, seeing no reason for reaching a contrary conclusion, finds it established that the applicant's conduct and behaviour were under the strong influence of alcohol and could reasonably be considered to entail a threat to public order. It is further satisfied that the purpose of the measures was to avert that kind of threat. In other words, the matter was covered by the notion of “alcoholic” in sub-paragraph (e), which is therefore applicable."

The applicant disagreed with the Government's view that Article 61 § 1, sub-paragraph 7, of the Code of Criminal Procedure could provide a basis for her detention. That provision empowered the police to make an arrest under certain conditions as a first step in order to resolve a problem. However, she had neither lost control in a public place nor caused a public outrage. Nonetheless, she had been both arrested and detained in a prison cell.",

The measures had all been made necessary by the applicant's own conduct and behaviour vis-à-vis the police, namely her repeated disturbances by noise and harassment while police officers were carrying out their routine duties. From time to time over a certain period she had visited the police station, either to see Police Officer J.J.H. or for no apparent purpose. On most occasions she had left the police station without any difficulty. In some instances she had completely lost control while in a state of heavy intoxication and had thus created a danger both for the police personnel working at the station and for members of the public present in the reception area."

Although the above-mentioned provisions did not specify what measures the police were to take in order to prevent such conduct, on each occasion the police had resorted to the most lenient types of measures. Before the applicant was detained, attempts had first been made to take less severe measures, notably to walk with her and calm her down. For example, on 25 May 1991 she had agreed to be driven home by the police; on 5 November 1991 and 12 June 1992 she had complied with police orders to leave the station. But on 31 January 1988 she had been detained, since her state of heavy intoxication and unruly behaviour had made it impossible to talk to her and to take a statement from her. On 18 May and 8 December 1990 and on 19 January and 24 June 1991 she had come to the police station of her own accord late at night under the influence of alcohol, had ignored repeated requests to leave and had behaved in a threatening and hostile manner towards the police officers, thereby seriously disturbing their work and public order in the station's reception area. Yet again, on 11 January 1992, her intoxication and agitation in a hotel had made her detention necessary."

Those rules had been adhered to in every respect by the policemen involved in arresting the applicant. The above-mentioned provisions in Article 61 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure were both very clear and adequately circumscribed to enable the applicant to assume that her conduct could lead to her arrest, as they were based on the fundamental role and duty of the police to maintain law and order in society. Thus Article 61 § 1 sub-paragraph 7 clearly provided that the police could arrest a person who had lost control in a public place or had caused public outrage, following an assessment of the need for such a measure, as provided for in Article 61 § 2.",

It was also worth mentioning the applicant's earlier experience of the police response to such conduct.

The detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less stringent measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or the public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained. That means that it does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is in conformity with national law, it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see the above cited Witold Litwa v. Poland, § 78).",

It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently accessible and precise to allow the person – if necessary with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Varbanov v.

It further considered that the police had sufficient reasons for detaining the applicant for a short period and had no other means at their disposal. Thus the Supreme Court appears to have reached the view that the impugned arrest and detention of the applicant on six occasions between 31 January 1988 and 24 June 1991 had a legal basis and were justified. The Court, bearing in mind the primary role played by national authorities, notably the courts, in interpreting and applying national law, has considered the matter itself and sees no reason for arriving at a contrary conclusion. Although the Supreme Court's reasoning made no express reference to some of the legal sources relied on by the Government, notably Article 61 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the general customary powers of the police and various police instructions, the Court is satisfied on the evidence before it that the arrest and detention in question conformed to the national substantive and procedural rules.

Moreover Article 61 § 2 only addressed the necessity of “immediate arrest”. Neither this nor any other relevant statutory provisions relied on by the Government specifically dealt with detention or the maximum duration of detention or release, as did, for instance, the last sentence of section 16 (2), of the more recent Police Act 1997 (“No person may be held for longer than is necessary” – see paragraph 33 above)."

This is in particular the case of the 1988 Rules, which entered into force on 1 July 1988 and applied, not to the first instance of detention occurring in January 1988, but to the five instances which occurred after 1 July 1988. Under those rules, conduct resulting from the use of alcohol and causing disorder or significant disturbance or inconvenience could warrant detention, provided it was highly likely that this situation would continue if the person were to remain at liberty. Detention was not justified in cases involving intoxication only and when alternative measures could be used, for instance taking the person home. However, the Court notes, although they implied that detention could be ordered only if it was necessary, even those provisions omitted to specify when detention ceased to be justified and the detainee had a right to be released.",

The court observed that the applicant’s brother, Mr B. Azimov, was serving a prison sentence in Tajikistan; however, other members of his family, including his elder brother Mr R. Azimov, were all living in Tajikistan. The applicant’s first wife lived in Tajikistan with their five children and his second wife had been able to leave Tajikistan freely and come to Russia.

The Court emphasises that the conduct of the person concerned, however undesirable or dangerous, is not a decisive factor. The protection afforded by Article 3 of the Convention allows no balancing of the risk of harm if the person is sent back against the danger he or she may represent to the community if not sent back and is, therefore, broader than that provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (see Saadi, cited above, § 138, and Muminov v.

His behaviour was legitimate if it was assumed that there was a high risk that criminal proceedings against him in Tajikistan would be accompanied by torture or other forms of ill-treatment.

            [
                "128. The Russian courts seemed to consider the case of Barot as an isolated episode. However, the Court’s case-law under Article 3 of the Convention does not require domestic courts to establish with certitude that the asylum-seeker would be tortured if returned home – it needs only establish that there is a “real risk” of ill-treatment (see Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 24027/07, 11949/08, 36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09, § 173, 10 April 2012, with further references). The Court reiterates that “requesting an applicant to produce “indisputable” evidence of a risk of ill-treatment in the requesting country would be tantamount to asking him to prove the existence of a future event, which is impossible, and would place a clearly disproportionate burden on him” (see Rustamov v. Russia, no. 11209/10, § 117, 3 July 2012). Any such allegation always concerns an eventuality, something which may or may not occur in the future. Consequently, such allegations cannot be proven in the same way as past events. The applicant must only be required to show, with reference to specific facts relevant to him and to the class of people he belonged to, that there was a high likelihood that he would be ill-treated."

This was probably the case. However, the Russian courts overlooked another very important aspect of the case, namely the substance of the accusations against the applicant. The story presented by the applicant to the Russian authorities was substantially different from the one contained in the extradition requests from Tajikistan and public statements of the Tajikistani authorities. The applicant was wanted in Tajikistan not for being a member of Vatandor but on charges of aiding the IMU, deemed to be a terrorist organisation (see paragraphs 12-13 above). The applicant was arrested on the basis of the extradition request accompanied by the indictments dated 26 and 30 March 2009. Some time later the Minister of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan stated that the applicant was the leader of a terrorist cell who had been arrested in Russia in connection with the terrorist attack of 3 September 2010 in Khudjand (see paragraph 17 above)."

It is, however, to be expected that the applicant would not want to acknowledge his affiliation with the IMU in the Russian courts: in the event of successful extradition such an acknowledgment might be used against him in Tajikistan. Therefore, the Russian courts had to consider carefully not only the risks related to the applicant’s presumed membership of Vatandor and his role in the events of 1995, but also the risks related to his alleged (and more recent) affiliation with the IMU and involvement in their activities, real or imaginary. In the Court’s opinion, this aspect of the case was not addressed in the domestic judgments at all.",

In the modern world there is virtually no State that would not proclaim that it adheres to the basic international human rights norms, such as the prohibition of torture, and which would not have at least some protecting mechanisms at the domestic level. Those elements are important, but they should not be assessed formalistically. Where reliable sources have reported practices resorted to or tolerated by the authorities which are manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention (see Saadi, §§ 147-48, and Gaforov, § 138, both cited above), the domestic courts should have a somewhat critical approach to diplomatic assurances and other similar “information from official sources”."

The Russian courts did not explain why those opinions should be disregarded in the present case. The Court emphasises that reference to a general problem concerning human rights observance in a particular country is normally insufficient to bar extradition (see Kamyshev v. Ukraine, no. 3990/06, § 44, 20 May 2010), but the current human rights record of Tajikistan, which is not a Council of Europe member State, adds credibility to the applicant’s assertion that, if extradited, he might be subjected to ill-treatment (see paragraphs 90-98 above)."

                "138. The Court reiterates that in assessing the general situation in a particular country it attached certain weight to the information contained in recent reports from independent international human rights protection bodies and organisations or governmental sources (see, for example, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, §§ 99-100, Reports 1996 ‑ V; Müslim v.

The Court further stresses that in many previous cases concerning Central Asian republics it has considered reports from UN bodies and certain NGOs worthy of attention. Thus, the Court has already examined cases involving extradition to Tajikistan of persons charged with politically and/or religiously motivated criminal offences (see Khodzhayev v. Russia, no. 52466/08, 12 May 2010; Khaydarov v. Russia, no. 21055/09, 20 May 2010; and Gaforov, cited above).

Russia, no. 17185/05, 23 September 2010, the Court found that the forced removal to Tajikistan of the applicant, who had been charged, inter alia, with terrorism and gangsterism in a religious context, was in breach of Russia’s obligation to protect him against ill-treatment."

However, the present case is not borderline, and the domestic court’s analysis was deficient in many respects. In such circumstances the Court is prepared to disagree with their findings.

It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 § 1, and the notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary, and thus contrary to the Convention. To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article 5 § 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention should be appropriate; and the length of the detention should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Rustamov, cited above, § 150, with further references)."

Belgium, no. 51564/99, § 42, ECHR 2002 ‑ I; and Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no. 5829/04, § 142, 31 May 2011). The circumstances of the present case surrounding the applicant’s detention pending expulsion may be reasonably interpreted as suggesting that the real intention of the authorities was to keep the applicant in prison with a view to extradition after the maximum period set by the law for that purpose had expired."
            ],
            [
                "165. Thus, the authorities were aware of the applicant’s irregular immigration status from the moment of his arrest on 3 November 2010 (see paragraph 31 above). Nevertheless, they did not cite that ground for detaining him until the time-limit provided for the detention pending extradition had expired. It was the Moscow Regional Court examining the applicant’s extradition case which recommended that the law-enforcement authorities re-detain the applicant on this new ground (see paragraph 57 above). Most importantly, the applicant was detained “with a view to expulsion” while the extradition proceedings were still going on (see paragraph 61 above). The Court is aware that the Russian authorities have occasionally used the expulsion (administrative removal) procedure instead of extradition (see paragraph 84 above). The applicant’s extradition was “under the control of the President of the Russian Federation” (see paragraph 28 above), which implies that handing him over to the Tajikistani authorities (no matter whether as a result of expulsion or extradition) must have been regarded as a top priority. All this supports the applicant’s claim that the authorities abused their power to order the “expulsion detention”, and that the new ground for detention was cited primarily to circumvent the requirements of the domestic law, which set a maximum time-limit for “extradition detention”. The Court reiterates in this respect “detention under Article 5 § 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith” and “must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government” (see Rustamov, cited above, § 150). It appears that those two conditions were not met in the present case, at least during the short period when the applicant’s extradition proceedings were still pending, and probably even after they were over."

                "166. The Court further observes that even where the purpose of the detention is legitimate, its length should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Shakurov, cited above, § 162). In the present case the applicant had already been in detention with a view to extradition for one year before the authorities ordered his detention pending expulsion. His detention pending expulsion lasted for over seventeen months. In total, the applicant has been in detention for over two years and five months. The question is whether that duration is reasonable."
            ],
            [
                "167. The Court considers that the overall length of the applicant’s detention may be divided into two periods. The first period lasted more than one year – between 3 November 2010, the date of the applicant’s arrest, and 6 December 2011, the date of the last domestic judicial decision in this case. That period can mostly be attributed to the three sets of proceedings which took place simultaneously: extradition, expulsion and asylum proceedings. Those proceedings were pursued by the authorities with proper diligence, and the Court cannot detect any long periods of inactivity imputable to the State during that time."
            ],
            [
                "168. It is the period from 6 December 2011 onwards which is a source of concern for the Court. The applicant’s detention during that time was mainly attributable to the temporary suspension of the enforcement of the extradition and expulsion orders due to the indication made by the Court under Rule 39 on 23 November 2011."

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, §§ 99-129, ECHR 2005 ‑ I). However, the implementation of an interim measure indicated by the Court does not in itself have any bearing on whether the deprivation of liberty to which that individual may be subjected complies with Article 5 § 1 (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v. France, no. 25389/05, § 74, ECHR 2007 ‑ II). Detention should still be lawful and not arbitrary."

Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 48205/09, §§ 49-51, 15 November 2011; Al Husin v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 3727/08, §§ 67-69, 7 February 2012; and Umirov, cited above, §§ 138-42)."

That being said, suspension of the domestic proceedings due to the indication of an interim measure by the Court should not result in a situation were the applicant languishes in prison for an unreasonably long period. The Court observes in the present case that no specific time-limits for the applicant’s detention pending expulsion were expressly set by the courts (see paragraphs 60 and 65 above). According to Article 31.9 § 1 of the CAO the expulsion decision must be enforced within two years (see paragraph 80 above). It appears that after the expiry of that period the applicant should be released. This will admittedly be done; however, the possible implications of Article 31.9 § 1 of the CAO for the applicant’s detention are a matter of interpretation, and the rule limiting duration of the detention of an illegal alien is not set clearly in the law. It is also unclear what would happen after the expiry of the two-year time-limit, since the applicant would clearly remain in an irregular situation in terms of immigration law and would again be liable to expulsion and, consequently, to detention on this ground."

The Court also notes in this regard that the maximum penalty in form of deprivation of liberty for an administrative offence under the CAO in force is thirty days (see paragraph 81 above) and that detention with a view to expulsion should not be punitive in nature and also should be accompanied by appropriate safeguards, as established by the Russian Constitutional Court (see paragraph 83 above). In this case the “preventive” measure, in terms of its gravity, was much more serious than the “punitive” one, which is not normal. The Court also reiterates that throughout the whole period of the applicant’s detention, when the interim measure applied by the Court was in force, the authorities did not re-examine the question of the lawfulness of the applicant’s continuous detention in breach of Article 5 § 4 (see paragraph 154 above),"

Turkey (no. 2), no. 22426/10, § 34, 17 January 2012; see also, mutatis mutandis, Mikolenko v. Estonia, no. 10664/05, §67, 8 October 2009)."

In so far as the treaties laid down the conditions in which a country was obliged to consent to the extradition of criminals to another country, it was appropriate to preclude the situation where a witness, who was summoned to appear in another country, was detained there without heed for the substantive conditions or formalities required for extradition.",
                "Subsequently, the various States generally refrained from laying down, in their extradition or mutual assistance treaties, an obligation for witnesses to appear abroad, as was first the case in the Treaty of 1843 between Belgium and the Netherlands ( see Von Martitz, op. cit., and vol. II, p. 722, and 725, no. 37). The same guarantees were nevertheless maintained for witnesses residing in one of the States parties who were summoned in the other and who appeared there voluntarily. The issue gave rise to difficult negotiations between Switzerland and Italy during discussion of the extradition treaty that was to replace one that had been concluded with Sardinia in 1843. On the proposal of the Swiss Government, it was finally decided that a witness could never be forced to appear before the foreign court. When the personal appearance of a witness was required, the Government of his country would advise him to comply with the request. If the witness agreed to leave, in no case could he be arrested or intercepted for an act pre-dating his appearance during his obligatory stay in the place where the judge examining him exercised his duties or while he was travelling ( Article 14 of the Convention of 22 July 1868, applicable until the entry into force for Switzerland and Italy of the European Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters, RS 12, p. 160, cf. FF 1868 III, pp. 444-445, 869-870).",
                "8 (b) ... It is evident that the fact of travelling, in response to a summons, to another country, without having been requested to do so by the Government of the country of residence, does not render the safe-conduct requirement devoid of justification. In responding to a summons he received as witness and in travelling for that purpose to another country, the individual in question, if he were not guaranteed safe conduct, would be deprived of the benefit of the safeguards provided for in extradition treaties, and it would seem logical to consider that in complying with the summons he should be immune from arrest and prosecution, as the Federal Court previously decided, in respect of inter-cantonal relations, in its aforementioned judgment (ATF 3, p. 245). This is also the opinion that the Federal Council expressed in its dispatch on the interpretation, on this point, of the European Convention ( ‘ According to the convention, the interested parties enjoy this immunity regardless of the channel through which the summons is served ’, FF 1966 I 493.) ...",
                "(c) Some doubt may admittedly exist as to the exact meaning of Article XV, paragraph 2, of the convention between Switzerland and Spain. However, taking account of the terms of this provision and comparing this text with previous texts, it appears that it must indeed be considered that the immunity resulting therefrom applies to any witness who, having been duly summoned, has appeared voluntarily in the other country, without it being necessary to refer to the form of summons provided for in Article XIV or the intervention of the Government of the country of residence as provided for in Article XV, paragraph 1.",

Experience has shown that, unless a safe-conduct is issued, a summons is rarely complied with in such cases. It would not be understood if such protection were granted only pursuant to a treaty. Moreover, the traditional treaty clause does not appear totally sufficient. In principle it would concern witnesses and experts alone, and only when they appear freely. However, detainees may also be witnesses... ’ (Report of the Committee of Experts, p. 61/62)."

                "“ 2 (a) The safe-conduct clause was inserted into international treaties in order to avoid disguised extradition: a witness required to appear in another country cannot be detained there without heed for the substantive conditions or formalities required for extradition (see, for the background to this clause, Federal Court judgment ATF 104 Ia 452ss., point 5). It will in any event be necessary, under Article 12 of the [European Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters] and section 73 of the [Federal Law on international mutual assistance in criminal matters], for the authorities of the requesting State to have summoned this witness to appear by serving an order for that purpose. That is not the case here, since the investigating judge did not issue the appellant with an order to appear according to the formalities provided for in Article 17, paragraph 1, of the Geneva Code of Criminal Procedure, taken together with section 31 of the said Law. The appellant cannot therefore, in principle, rely on the immunity attached to an official order when it has not been issued, as in the present case. On this specific point, this case differs from the factual situation underlying the Federal Court judgment ATF 104 Ia 448 cited by the appellant.",
                "(b) The appellant relies on Article 170 of the Geneva Code of Criminal Procedure, under which any person summoned before the investigating judge must be served with a letter or order for that purpose ( para. 1); exceptionally, a summons may be addressed by any other means that is necessary in order to reach the witness ( para. 2). He submits in this connection that Mr Perret ’ s letter of 8 March 1995 is equivalent in substance to a summons within the meaning of Article 170, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Code of Criminal Procedure.",
                "( c) Article 170 of the Geneva Code of Criminal Procedure enshrines the rule that it is the judge who conducts the proceedings. While the parties have the right to request the examination of witnesses, in accordance with Article 174 of the said Code, the service of an order to appear is exclusively a matter for the judge. As to Article 170, paragraph 2, of the Code, it refers in particular to exceptional cases where, because of the urgency, the judge notifies an order to appear informally, by telephone or cable, for example. However, the wording of this provision does not prevent the judge, if need be, from requesting a lawyer to bring a witness to the hearing; on the other hand, it probably does not empower a lawyer to summon a witness of his own accord, without the judge authorising or being informed of the witness ’ appearance.",
                "( d) On 7 March 1995 Mr Perret asked the investigating judge to examine I. as a witness, explaining that he would take care of the ‘ summons ’ himself. However, neither Mr Perret, nor I. insisted on the service of an order to appear in the form provided for by Article 174, paragraph 1, of the Geneva Code of Criminal Procedure, taken together with section 31 of the said Law. Nevertheless, the lack of reaction on the part of the investigating judge in this regard could be interpreted as an implicit acquiescence to Mr Perret ’ s proposal to call I. as a witness at the hearing of 13 March 1995, on the basis of an informal summons within the meaning of Article 170, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Code of Criminal Procedure. In addition, Mr Perret was entitled to assume that the investigating judge would have served an order to appear on the appellant if a formal request had been made to him, as was the case for the witness M. A diligent lawyer could well have been expected to make sure what the investigating judge had decided. In any event, the judge himself could not have relied on the absence of a formal order to consider that the appellant would have appeared ‘ spontaneously ’ at the hearing of 13 March 1995; he could not have been unaware of Mr Perret ’ s request for the appellant ’ s examination. The fact that Mr Perret did not address his letter of 8 March 1995 to the investigating judge, strange as this may seem, makes no difference. From the point when the investigating judge received a request for the appellant to be called to give evidence as a witness it was his duty to take a formal decision on this matter. By failing to do so, the investigating judge created some ambiguity as to his intentions, and the appellant, summoned through the intermediary of Mr Perret, should not have to assume the consequences thereof. The difference in treatment between the witness M. and the appellant in this regard would indeed appear excessive and therefore arbitrary.",
                "Thus, in failing to give a clear decision as to the means of summoning the appellant to the hearing of 13 March 1995, the investigating judge cast doubt in the mind of the appellant, who was entitled to consider, in good faith, that he had been duly summoned to the hearing of 13 March 1995, as a witness protected by the immunity referred to in Article 12 of the [European Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters] and section 73 of the [Federal Law on international mutual assistance in criminal matters].",

The fact that he had not sought a formal summons as required by the European Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters and that he had accepted a more informal means of being called to give evidence, through the intermediary of his daughter and her lawyer, had been used by the Federal Court to deprive him of his rights under that convention.

Accordingly, the applicant concluded that the summons addressed to him by the investigating judge on 20 April 2005 at his daughter ’ s address in Bremgarten clearly did not comply with the requirements of that convention.

If the investigating judge had complied with the rules of the European Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters, the applicant ’ s questioning could clearly not have taken place within a period of fifteen days from the time when it was first discussed between the judge and the defence.

                "60. The Court observes that the second part of Article 5 § 1 ( f) applies to a person “against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition”. In the present case, the US authorities requested the applicant ’ s provisional arrest pursuant to the extradition treaty of 14 November 1990 between Switzerland and the USA. On the basis of that treaty, he was arrested and detained in order to be extradited to the United States. Accordingly, the Court takes the view that the applicant ’ s detention falls within the scope of Article 5 § 1 ( f) of the Convention, a point that is not in dispute between the parties."

                "61. The Court would emphasise at the outset that, in its duly reasoned judgment of 14 July 2005, the Federal Court, ruling on an appeal from the Federal Office of Justice, found in substance that the applicant ’ s detention had been “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. Moreover, the fact that the applicant was not ultimately extradited to the United States of America but to the Russian Federation was not the result of a finding that his detention had been unlawful, but can be explained by the priority given by the Federal Court, in its judgment of 22 December 2005, to the extradition request lodged by Russia, which was the applicant ’ s State of nationality. Lastly, it should be observed that the justified nature of the detention was confirmed by a decision dated 6 December 2007 of the Federal Criminal Court, which rejected a request for compensation by the applicant."

In this connection, it observes that the applicant ’ s allegations contained two main parts : first, he contended that the Swiss authorities had wrongly refused to grant him the benefit of the safe-conduct clause. Second, and regardless of the answer to the first question, he argued that the stratagem used by the national authorities, in circumventing the formal conditions for summoning witnesses to give evidence in Switzerland, was at odds with the principle of good faith and thus infringed Article 5 § 1 of the Convention."

As to whether the applicant was entitled to rely on the safe-conduct clause, he regarded as improper the Government ’ s argument to the effect that he was in Switzerland for private and business purposes and that the European Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters, and more specifically its safe-conduct clause, were not therefore applicable to his situation."
            ],
            [
                "65. In this connection, the Court would point out that the aim of the safe-conduct clause is to avoid the situation where a witness who is required to give evidence in another country is then detained there without the substantive and procedural conditions for extradition being fulfilled. The witness thus enjoys immunity from arrest or prosecution in respect of any charges or convictions that pre-date his departure from the territory of the requested State ( see the Federal Court judgment ATF 104 Ia 448, paragraph 33 above )."

The Court observes that the applicant did not visit Switzerland specially to give evidence in the criminal proceedings against his daughter, but freely chose to go there, independently of the fact that he would be questioned by the investigating judge. The applicant indeed indicated clearly, in his testimony to the investigating judge of the Canton of Bern, on 2 May 2005, that he was visiting Switzerland of his own accord to see his daughter and for business. The professional purpose of his visit to Switzerland is also apparent from an article by the applicant that was published on 6 June 2005 in the newspaper Izwestija."

In addition, the Court finds that no “summons” to appear before the Swiss authorities had been served on the applicant in his State of residence, in accordance with Article 12 of the European Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters and section 73 of the Federal Law on international mutual assistance in criminal matters ( see paragraphs 31-32 above ). It should also be noted that the applicant was already in Switzerland when the investigating judge issued him with a summons to appear for questioning on 2 May 2005, that summons being sent to his daughter ’ s private address in Bern. As no inter-State cooperation, in terms of mutual legal assistance, was involved in the present case, it follows that there was no need to protect the applicant from arrest or prosecution in respect of prior offences or convictions and that the safe-conduct clause was not therefore applicable in his case. The present case can be distinguished in this connection from those that led to the above-mentioned judgments of the Federal Court ( see paragraphs 33-34 above ), in which the individuals concerned had appeared in Switzerland in response to a summons issued by the prosecution authorities, albeit improperly."

Moreover, the Court shares the Government ’ s opinion that the applicant, who travelled frequently and had access to legal advice, must have been aware of the risks that he was taking by going abroad, especially in view of the criminal proceedings opened against him in the USA in 2004. There is no evidence that he ever raised the issue of safe-conduct protection himself when he agreed to be questioned by the investigating judge. By consenting to travel to Switzerland without availing himself of the safeguards in the relevant mutual legal assistance instruments, he knowingly waived the benefit of the immunity that the safe-conduct clause would have accorded.",

In this connection the Court would reiterate the above-mentioned principle : whilst the use by the authorities of certain stratagems to counter criminal activities is not per se at odds with the principle of good faith, in the light of the Convention, not every ruse can be justified ( see the case-law cited above in paragraph 59)."

In the present case the Court observes that, on the basis of the information that the applicant would be going to Switzerland for private and business purposes and that he was prepared to give evidence in the case concerning his daughter, the investigating judge summoned him to appear on 2 May 2005, one of the dates proposed by the applicant himself. It can thus been seen that the judge did not use any ruse or trickery to secure the applicant ’ s presence in Switzerland."

Subsequently, as a result of a telephone conversation about the proceedings against the applicant ’ s daughter, the investigating judge informed a public prosecutor in Pennsylvania that he would be questioning the applicant on the agreed date. On the basis of that information, the US Department of Justice sent the Swiss authorities a request for the applicant ’ s provisional arrest pursuant to the extradition treaty of 14 November 1990 between Switzerland and the USA. Further to that request the Federal Office of Justice issued, in compliance with the formalities, an arrest order that was sent to the investigating judge, who ordered the applicant ’ s arrest. He was arrested as planned on 2 May 200 5 after his questioning in the proceedings concerning his daughter. The next day, the applicant ’ s detention was confirmed by an order of provisional detention pending extradition issued by the Federal Office of Justice. In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that the Swiss authorities did not show any bad faith in dealing with the applicant and that, in informing the US authorities of his presence in Switzerland, they acted in compliance with their obligations of inter-State cooperation against cross-border crime."

In their submission, there was no plausible reason why a seven-day detention period was necessary, marking as it did such a radical departure from ordinary law and even from the three-day period permitted under the special powers of detention embodied in the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 (see paragraph 33 above).

The Government have argued that in view of the nature and extent of the terrorist threat and the resulting problems in obtaining evidence sufficient to bring charges, the maximum statutory period of detention of seven days was an indispensable part of the effort to combat that threat, as successive parliamentary debates and reviews of the legislation had confirmed (see paragraphs 26-29 above). In particular, they drew attention to the difficulty faced by the security forces in obtaining evidence which is both admissible and usable in consequence of training in anti-interrogation techniques adopted by those involved in terrorism. Time was also needed to undertake necessary scientific examinations, to correlate information from other detainees and to liaise with other security forces. The Government claimed that the need for a power of extension of the period of detention was borne out by statistics. For instance, in 1987 extensions were granted in Northern Ireland in respect of 365 persons. Some 83 were detained in excess of five days and of this number 39 were charged with serious terrorist offences during the extended period.",
                "As regards the suggestion that extensions of detention beyond the initial forty-eight-hour period should be controlled or even authorised by a judge, the Government pointed out the difficulty, in view of the acute sensitivity of some of the information on which the suspicion was based, of producing it in court. Not only would the court have to sit in camera but neither the detained person nor his legal advisers could be present or told any of the details. This would require a fundamental and undesirable change in the law and procedure of the United Kingdom under which an individual who is deprived of his liberty is entitled to be represented by his legal advisers at any proceedings before a court relating to his detention. If entrusted with the power to grant extensions of detention, the judges would be seen to be exercising an executive rather than a judicial function. It would add nothing to the safeguards against abuse which the present arrangements are designed to achieve and could lead to unanswerable criticism of the judiciary. In all the circumstances, the Secretary of State was better placed to take such decisions and to ensure a consistent approach. Moreover, the merits of each request to extend detention were personally scrutinised by the Secretary of State or, if he was unavailable, by another Minister (see paragraph 37 above)."

In the Commission ’ s opinion, given the context in which the applicants were arrested and the special problems associated with the investigation of terrorist offences, a somewhat longer period of detention than in normal cases was justified. The Commission concluded that the periods of four days and six hours (Mr McFadden) and four days and eleven hours (Mr Tracey) did satisfy the requirement of promptness, whereas the periods of five days and eleven hours (Mr Brogan) and six days and sixteen and a half hours (Mr Coyle) did not."

Judicial control of interferences by the executive with the individual ’ s right to liberty is an essential feature of the guarantee embodied in Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), which is intended to minimise the risk of arbitrariness. Judicial control is implied by the rule of law, \"one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society ..., which is expressly referred to in the Preamble to the Convention\" (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Klass and Others judgment, Series A no. 28, pp. 25-26, para. 55) and \"from which the whole Convention draws its inspiration\" (see, mutatis mutandis, the Engel and Others judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 28, para. 69)."

The obligation expressed in English by the word \"promptly\" and in French by the word\" aussitôt\" is clearly distinguishable from the less strict requirement in the second part of paragraph 3 (art. 5-3) (\"reasonable time\"/\" délai raisonnable \") and even from that in paragraph 4 of Article 5 (art. 5-4) (\"speedily\"/\" à bref délai \"). The term \"promptly\" also occurs in the English text of paragraph 2 (art. 5-2), where the French text uses the words\" dans le plus court délai \". As indicated in the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment ( 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 76, para. 199), \"promptly\" in paragraph 3 (art. 5-3) may be understood as having a broader significance than\" aussitôt \", which literally means immediately. Thus confronted with versions of a law-making treaty which are equally authentic but not exactly the same, the Court must interpret them in a way that reconciles them as far as possible and is most appropriate in order to realise the aim and achieve the object of the treaty (see, inter alia, the Sunday Times judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 30, para. 48, and Article 33 para. 4 of the Vienna Convention of 23 May 1969 on the Law of Treaties).",

Whereas promptness is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see the above-mentioned de Jong, Baljet and van den Brink judgment, Series A no. 77, p. 25, para. 52), the significance to be attached to those features can never be taken to the point of impairing the very essence of the right guaranteed by Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), that is to the point of effectively negativing the State ’ s obligation to ensure a prompt release or a prompt appearance before a judicial authority."

The investigation of terrorist offences undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems, partial reference to which has already been made under Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) (see paragraph 53 above). The Court takes full judicial notice of the factors adverted to by the Government in this connection. It is also true that in Northern Ireland the referral of police requests for extended detention to the Secretary of State and the individual scrutiny of each police request by a Minister do provide a form of executive control (see paragraph 37 above). In addition, the need for the continuation of the special powers has been constantly monitored by Parliament and their operation regularly reviewed by independent personalities (see paragraphs 26-29 above). The Court accepts that, subject to the existence of adequate safeguards, the context of terrorism in Northern Ireland has the effect of prolonging the period during which the authorities may, without violating Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), keep a person suspected of serious terrorist offences in custody before bringing him before a judge or other judicial officer.",

To attach such importance to the special features of this case as to justify so lengthy a period of detention without appearance before a judge or other judicial officer would be an unacceptably wide interpretation of the plain meaning of the word \"promptly\". An interpretation to this effect would import into Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) a serious weakening of a procedural guarantee to the detriment of the individual and would entail consequences impairing the very essence of the right protected by this provision. The Court thus has to conclude that none of the applicants was either brought \"promptly\" before a judicial authority or released \"promptly\" following his arrest.

It noted that judicial control of interference by the executive with an individual’s right to liberty was an essential feature of the guarantees embodied in Article 5 § 3, the purpose being to minimise the risk of arbitrariness in the pre-trial detention of accused persons. Certain procedural and substantive guarantees ensure that judicial control: the judge (or other officer) before whom the accused is “brought promptly” must be seen to be independent of the executive and of the parties to the proceedings; that judge, having heard the accused himself, must examine all the facts arguing for and against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for the accused’s liberty, and that judge must have the power to order an accused’s release. It not being disputed that Mr Caballero fell within the scope of section 25 of the 1994 Act, the Commission found that the possibility of any consideration by a Magistrate of his pre-trial release on bail had been excluded in advance by the legislature by section 25 of the 1994 Act. This removal of the judicial control of pre-trial detention required by Article 5 § 3 of the Convention was found by the Commission to amount to a violation of that Article.",
                "As to Article 5 § 5, the Commission noted that it was not disputed that Mr Caballero’s pre-trial detention complied with domestic law and that he did not have a domestic remedy for detention giving rise to a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. It concluded therefore that there had been a violation of Article 5 § 5 of the Convention.",
                "The Commission further concluded that there had been no violation of Article 13 in conjunction with Article 5 of the Convention. It noted, in this respect, that Article 5 § 4 of the Convention was the lex specialis in respect of complaints about detention which was unlawful under domestic law and the Convention. It also noted its finding of a violation of Article 5 § 5 and recalled that Article 13 did not guarantee a remedy to challenge domestic legislation (section 25 of the 1994 Act) before a national authority on the basis of the Convention."

They considered the above-cited Caballero case to be indistinguishable from the present case as regards just satisfaction: each person was entitled to be presumed innocent prior to trial; the pre-trial detention of all persons had to be lawful, and the deduction of pre-trial detention from a subsequent sentence was recognition of time lawfully served and not reparation for a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention."

Although it is not this Court’s task to speculate as to whether the applicant would have been released on bail in the absence of section 25 of the 1994 Act (see the previous paragraph), it nevertheless notes that during that hearing the Magistrates’ Court failed to remark that section 25 of the 1994 Act applied and it considered and rejected a substantive bail application by the applicant because it feared that the applicant would commit further offences and might interfere with witnesses or obstruct justice given the nature and the seriousness of the charges against him. The Court does not find that this supports the applicant’s contention that he would have been released on bail by the Court were it not for section 25 of the 1994 Act either in December 1996 or in February 1997 (as he suggested) or at all (see the above-cited Hood judgment, at § 85).",

In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element to torture, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which in Article 1 defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see Selmouni, cited above, § 97; and Akkoç v.

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

At the same time, the Court does not lose sight of his prompt attempts to bring the matter to the attention of the prosecution authorities, as is confirmed by the fact that the KCPO ordered his forensic medical examination as early as 24 May 2004. As regards the first applicant's silence on the matter before the SIZO administration, the Court finds it to be of no relevance, as by the time of his transfer there (on 22 June 2004), the prosecution authorities had arranged for his two medical examinations and had delivered a ruling refusing to bring proceedings against the police officers to establish their criminal liability."

Thus, the Court notes that the first applicant's attempts to reverse the KCPO ruling of 18 June 2004 on its refusal to prosecute the police officers were dismissed under the pretext that the matter would be examined in the context of his own trial (see paragraph 95 above). The Court questions the adequacy of such approach in principle given that the purpose of the criminal proceedings against the applicant was to find him innocent or guilty of the criminal charges levelled against him rather than to attribute responsibility for alleged beatings or afford redress for an alleged breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see Toteva v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 42027/98, 3 April 2003). The Court observes that the examination by the Ternopil Court of the applicant's allegations of his ill-treatment in police custody was confined to the repeated questioning of the police officers concerned and of the medical experts, who denied that electric shocks had been given to the applicant and submitted that his injuries might have been inflicted by “blunt objects” without giving further explanations. The Court finds it striking that the trial court ignored altogether – as is apparent from its judgment of 31 August 2007 – the alternative medical findings in the case file supporting the first applicant's allegation (see paragraphs 32 and 109 above). As to the subsequent examination of the case by the Supreme Court, the Court cannot but conclude that it was superficial and in apparent disregard of essential documents and facts. In particular, the Supreme Court confined its efforts to analysing the video -recording of the investigative activities in which no injuries were visible on the applicant's body, and this was sufficient for it to find his complaint unsubstantiated. Furthermore, it found that the first applicant “had never referred to any specific persons who had allegedly ill ‑ treated him” and that he “had always replied that he was well when enquiries were made about his health”, although it had been established by that time that he had raised quite specific complaints on numerous occasions naming specific officers (see paragraphs 61, 82 and 113 above), and his injuries sustained in police custody had been officially documented."

The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or dispelling suspicions which were the grounds for detention (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, § 55, Series A no. 300 ‑ A). However, the requirement that the suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention. Moreover, in the absence of a reasonable suspicion, the arrest or detention of an individual must never be imposed for the purpose of making him confess, testify against others or elicit facts or information which may serve to ground a reasonable suspicion (see Cebotari v.

He was thus interviewed by the investigator in respect of that murder and confessed to it, and the police conducted searches at his registered and actual places of residence (see paragraphs 35-38 above). Looking beyond the appearances and the language used, and concentrating on the realities of the situation, the Court considers that the applicant's administrative detention was in reality part of his detention on remand under Article 5 § 1 (c) as a criminal suspect in the murder case without, however, safeguarding his procedural rights as a suspect, notably the right to defence (see Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 116, ECHR 2008 ‑ ..., and Doronin v. Ukraine, no. 16505/02, § 55-56, 19 February 2009).

That finding holds true even more in the present case, where, unlike in the case of Doronin, there was no judicial decision regarding the applicant's administrative detention, and the suspicion of the drug offence ceased to exist even formally on 22 May 2004, whilst the applicant spent another day in administrative detention (see paragraphs 11-12 and 129 above)."

Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention may be justified in a given case only if there are clear indications of a genuine public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the right to liberty (see Ječius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, § 93, ECHR 2000 ‑ IX). The persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the validity of the continued detention. However, after a certain lapse of time it does not in itself justify deprivation of liberty and the judicial authorities should give other grounds for continued detention (see Jabłoński v. Poland, no. 33492/96, § 80, 21 December 2000). Those grounds, moreover, should be expressly mentioned by the domestic courts, and the arguments brought for and against release must not be “general and abstract” (see Iłowiecki v. Poland, no. 27 504/95, § 61, 4 October 2001, and Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, § 63, ECHR 2003-IX)."

Their rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities, thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6. The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, § 68, Reports 1996 ‑ VI)."

Although the admissibility of evidence is, as a matter of principle, a prerogative of domestic courts, with the role of this Court being limited to assessing the overall fairness of the proceedings, particular considerations apply to evidence recovered by a measure found to violate Article 3 of the Convention. Thus, according to the Court's case-law, admission of statements obtained as a result of torture as evidence to establish the relevant facts in criminal proceedings renders the proceedings as a whole unfair irrespective of their probative value and of whether their use was decisive in securing the defendant's conviction (see Gäfgen v. Germany, cited above, § 166, with further references)."

France, no. 29731/96, § 89, ECHR 2001 ‑ II). As a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, § 55, 27 November 2008).

Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly called for in the case of serious charges, for it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies (see Salduz, cited above, § 54)."

Austria, 8 July 1986, Series A, no. 103; Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, Series A, no. 298; Sürek v. Turkey (no.1) [GC], no. 26682/95, ECHR 1999-IV; Janowski v.

                "(i) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual's self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly.",
                "(ii) The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must look at the interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the impugned statements and the context in which they were made. In particular, it must determine whether the interference in issue was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts.",
                "(iv) In a democratic society individuals are entitled to comment on and criticise the administration of justice and the officials involved in it. Limits of acceptable criticism in respect of civil servants exercising their powers may admittedly in some circumstances be wider than in relation to private individuals. However, it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent to which politicians do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with the latter when it comes to the criticism of their actions. Moreover, civil servants must enjoy public confidence in conditions free of undue perturbation if they are to be successful in performing their tasks and it may therefore prove necessary to protect them from offensive, abusive or defamatory attacks when on duty.",

                "“[T]he [authorities] applied law and practice under which there was a presumption that remand in custody was necessary in cases where the sentence faced went beyond a certain threshold of severity ...[While] the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element .... the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of pre-trial detention ...",
                "That is particularly true in the present case where under the applicable domestic law and practice the characterisation in law of the facts - and thus the sentence faced by the applicant - was determined by the prosecution authorities without judicial control of the question whether or not the evidence supported reasonable suspicion that the accused had committed an offence attracting a sentence of the relevant length ...",
                "The only other ground for the applicant's lengthy detention was the domestic courts'finding that there were no exceptional circumstances warranting release. However, that finding was not based on an analysis of all pertinent facts. The authorities regarded the applicant's arguments that he had never been convicted, that he had a family and a stable way of life, and that after the passage of time any possible danger of collusion or absconding had receded, as irrelevant.",
                "They did so because by virtue of Article 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Supreme Court's practice the presumption under that provision was only rebuttable in very exceptional circumstances where even a hypothetical possibility of absconding, re-offending or collusion was excluded due to serious illness or other exceptional factors. It was moreover incumbent on the detained person to prove the existence of such exceptional circumstances, failing which he was bound to remain in detention on remand throughout the proceedings ...",
                "The Court reiterates that continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty. Any system of mandatory detention on remand is per se incompatible with Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see the Letellier v. France judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, §§ 35-53; the Clooth v. Belgium judgment of 12 December 1991, Series A no. 225, § 44; the Muller v.

In particular, they drew attention to the difficulty faced by the security forces in obtaining evidence which is both admissible and usable in consequence of training in anti-interrogation techniques adopted by those involved in terrorism. Time was also needed to undertake necessary scientific examinations, to correlate information from other detainees and to liaise with other security forces. The Government claimed that the need for a power of extension of the period of detention was borne out by statistics. For instance, in 1987 extensions were granted in Northern Ireland in respect of 365 persons. Some 83 were detained in excess of five days and of this number 39 were charged with serious terrorist offences during the extended period.",

Not only would the court have to sit in camera but neither the detained person nor his legal advisers could be present or told any of the details. This would require a fundamental and undesirable change in the law and procedure of the United Kingdom under which an individual who is deprived of his liberty is entitled to be represented by his legal advisers at any proceedings before a court relating to his detention. If entrusted with the power to grant extensions of detention, the judges would be seen to be exercising an executive rather than a judicial function. It would add nothing to the safeguards against abuse which the present arrangements are designed to achieve and could lead to unanswerable criticism of the judiciary. In all the circumstances, the Secretary of State was better placed to take such decisions and to ensure a consistent approach. Moreover, the merits of each request to extend detention were personally scrutinised by the Secretary of State or, if he was unavailable, by another Minister (see paragraph 37 above)."

It is also true that in Northern Ireland the referral of police requests for extended detention to the Secretary of State and the individual scrutiny of each police request by a Minister do provide a form of executive control (see paragraph 37 above). In addition, the need for the continuation of the special powers has been constantly monitored by Parliament and their operation regularly reviewed by independent personalities (see paragraphs 26-29 above). The Court accepts that, subject to the existence of adequate safeguards, the context of terrorism in Northern Ireland has the effect of prolonging the period during which the authorities may, without violating Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), keep a person suspected of serious terrorist offences in custody before bringing him before a judge or other judicial officer.",

To attach such importance to the special features of this case as to justify so lengthy a period of detention without appearance before a judge or other judicial officer would be an unacceptably wide interpretation of the plain meaning of the word \"promptly\". An interpretation to this effect would import into Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) a serious weakening of a procedural guarantee to the detriment of the individual and would entail consequences impairing the very essence of the right protected by this provision.
