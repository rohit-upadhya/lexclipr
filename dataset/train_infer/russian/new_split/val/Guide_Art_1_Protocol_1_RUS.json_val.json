Following the death of the first applicant ’ s father in 1986 and ensuing division-of-property proceedings between his surviving wife and seven children, the first applicant ’ s mother was allotted 250 out of the 625 shares in the plot. In 1999 she transferred those shares, together with the nine sixteenths of the plot to which she was otherwise entitled as a heir of her late husband, to the first applicant. Combining the shares that she obtained as a result of this transfer and the one sixteenth of the plot that she had inherited from her father, the first applicant became the owner of 484.43 shares, or 77.5%, of the plot. On the plot, there existed a dilapidated one-storey cabin."

In 2005 he was recognised as a disabled person and has since then been in receipt of a disability pension. At about that time, the two applicants moved from Burgas to Sinemorets, allegedly because they were no longer able to afford living in Burgas. They submitted that they put all their savings into the reconstruction of the cabin, converting it into a solid one-storey brick house. They did not apply for a building permit. The reconstruction took place in 2004-05. Since that time, the two applicants have lived in that house. In 2006 two of the other co-owners of the plot formally notified the first applicant that they did not agree with the reconstruction. According to the Government, there was evidence that the construction had not been finalised before 2009."

The Tsarevo District Court dismissed the claim. On an appeal by the claimants, on 7 June 2009 the Burgas Regional Court quashed that judgment and made a declaration in the terms sought by the claimants, finding that they were the owners of 140.57 out of the total of 625 shares of the plot and the house built in the place of the old cabin. It also held that the first applicant was the owner of the remaining 484.43 shares of the plot and the house. The first applicant attempted to appeal on points of law, but in a decision of 22 June 2009 ( опр. № 566 от 22.06.2009 г. по гр. д. № 1974/2009 г., ВКС, I г. о. ), the Supreme Court of Cassation refused to admit the appeal for examination.

The Supreme Administrative Court has held that this legislative solution demonstrates the heightened public interest in controlling the security, hygiene and aesthetics of construction; that the exact manner in which a building fails to conform to the building regulations is irrelevant, since all buildings put up without a permit are subject to demolition; and that this does not run counter to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see реш. № 9768 от 04.07.2012 г. по адм. д. № 6382/2012 г., ВАС, II о. ).

The claim concerned the alleged unlawfulness of the enforcement of the demolition order, and the claimant relied on, inter alia, Article 8 of the Convention. In upholding the lower court ’ s decision to dismiss the claim, the Supreme Administrative Court analysed the demolition in terms of that Article, finding that it had amounted to an interference with the claimant ’ s right to respect for her home. It said that the enforcement authority should have taken into account that the house had been the claimant ’ s only home. It however went on to conclude that that interference had been proportionate because (a) the claimant had not attempted to legalise the house under the amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above) as she could have, since the house fell under them; (b) the claimant had not attempted to seek judicial review of the enforcement under Article 294 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006 ( see paragraph 35 below ) or to obtain a declaratory judgment under Article 292 of that Code ( see paragraph 33 below ) on the basis that after the demolition order she had procured a certificate attesting that the house had been built in 1984 and could be tolerated; and (c) the claimant had been able to rent a dwelling after her eviction from the house, which showed that she had means to afford alternative accommodation.",

It examined the matter by reference to the principle of proportionality, as enshrined in Article 6 of the Code (see paragraph 27 above) and Article 8 of the Convention, but held that even though the building was the claimants ’ only home, it was still subject to demolition because it was illegal and because there were no alternative means of combatting illegal construction, especially considering that the claimants had knowingly erected the building in a zone where construction was prohibited. Any arguments relating to their poor health or lack of means were irrelevant. The balance between the competing interests had been resolved at the legislative level. Holding otherwise would mean that illegal buildings inhabited by persons in poor health or persons who had no other place to live could not be demolished, which would render building regulations nugatory.

                "46. The Government submitted that the decision ordering the demolition of the house in which the applicants lived was lawful. It had been judicially reviewed and upheld. It was also necessary for the protection of public safety. The national authorities had a wide margin of appreciation to tackle the problem of illegal construction. The impossibility to legalise unlawful buildings had been put in place in view of the strong public interest to ensure the safety, hygiene and aesthetics of construction. The demolition of a building because it had been erected without a permit was a proportionate measure required in all cases and not capable of being eschewed at the discretion of the building control authorities. Those authorities had acted straight away when apprised of the illegality of the house inhabited by the applicants, and had not tolerated an illegal situation for a long time : the applicants had started inhabiting the house at the earliest in 2009 and the demolition procedure had started in 2011. The applicants had constructed the house knowing full well that they had not obtained the required permit. All such buildings, unless falling under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, were subject to demolition; the courts had inquired into that point in the applicants ’ case. The authorities had allowed the first applicant to comment on the intended demolition, and had invited her to comply with the demolition order of her own accord. In as much as she argued that she had no other place to live, it had to be noted that in June 2013, after the beginning of the demolition proceedings, she had donated a flat that she owned in Burgas and that, although the authorities did not have an obligation to provide the applicants, who did not belong to a particularly vulnerable group, with alternative accommodation, they had explored the possibility of settling them in a municipal flat. The second applicant was in receipt of a sufficiently high pension and the first applicant was able to work. They could thus afford to pay market rent in Sinemorets, and their personal circumstances were not as dire as they sought to paint them. The authorities had endeavoured to take all these matters into account when sending a social worker to interview the first applicant. It was equally possible to have the proportionality of the demolition reviewed in proceedings under Article 278 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006. The interference with the applicants ’ right to respect for their home was therefore proportionate. Article 8 of the Convention could not be construed as precluding the enforcement of the building regulations in respect of those who sought to flout them, or as requiring the authorities to provide persons in the applicants ’ situation with a place to live."

The applicants submitted that they had lived in the house undisturbed for nearly seven years, even though the local authorities were fully aware that it had been constructed without a permit, as the applicants had paid taxes in respect of the house and had their address registration there, and as Sinemorets was a small village. It was moreover widely known that many buildings in villages and small towns in Bulgaria had been constructed without a permit. The Ombudsman of the Republic had commented on that, saying that the authorities did not systematically combat illegal construction and had to do so pre-emptively rather than ex post facto. In spite of that recommendation, the only way of dealing with illegal buildings envisaged by the law was their demolition. The applicants were particularly vulnerable because the second applicant was handicapped and had a small pension, and the first applicant had been unemployed since 2003. The only illegality affecting the house was that it had been constructed without a permit; it otherwise fully complied with the applicable regulations. The public interest did not require its demolition, which would result in rendering two elderly persons with health problems homeless. The rules governing the demolition of buildings constructed without a permit, as interpreted by the Supreme Administrative Court, did not envisage any proportionality assessment or a procedure affording proper guarantees in that respect, and did not leave any discretion to the competent authorities, which were required to enforce them regardless of individual circumstances."

France, no. 27013/07, 17 October 2013 ). An analogy may also be drawn with cases concerning evictions from properties previously owned by the applicants but lost by them as a result of civil proceedings brought by a private person, civil proceedings brought by a public body, or tax enforcement proceedings (see, respectively, Zehentner v. Austria, no. 20082/02, 16 July 2009 (proceedings brought by a creditor); Brežec v. Croatia, no. 7177/10, 18 July 2013 (proceedings brought by the true owner of the premises); Gladysheva v.

                "53. Under the Court ’ s well- established case-law, as expounded in those judgments, the assessment of the necessity of the interference in cases concerning the loss of one ’ s home for the promotion of a public interest involves not only issues of substance but also a question of procedure: whether the decision-making process was such as to afford due respect to the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see Connors, § 83; McCann, § 49; Kay and Others, § 67; Kryvitska and Kryvitskyy, § 44; and Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iii), all cited above ). Since the loss of one ’ s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home, any person risking this – whether or not belonging to a vulnerable group – should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under that Article (see, among other authorities, McCann, § 50; Ćosić, § 22; Zehentner, § 59; Kay and Others, § 68; Buckland, § 65; and Rousk, § 137, all cited above). The factors likely to be of prominence in this regard, when it comes to illegal construction, are whether or not the home was established unlawfully, whether or not the persons concerned did so knowingly, what is the nature and degree of the illegality at issue, what is the precise nature of the interest sought to be protected by the demolition, and whether suitable alternative accommodation is available to the persons affected by the demolition (see Chapman, cited above, §§ 102-04). Another factor could be whether there are less severe ways of dealing with the case; the list is not exhaustive. Therefore, if the person concerned contests the proportionality of the interference on the basis of such arguments, the courts must examine them carefully and give adequate reasons in relation to them (see Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iv) in fine, and Winterstein and Others, § 148 (δ) in fine, both cited above ); the interference cannot normally be regarded as justified simply because the case falls under a rule formulated in general and absolute terms. The mere possibility of obtaining judicial review of the administrative decision causing the loss of the home is thus not enough; the person concerned must be able to challenge that decision on the ground that it is disproportionate in view of his or her personal circumstances (see McCann, §§ 51-55; Ćosić, §§ 21-23; and Kay and Others, § 69-74, all cited above). Naturally, if in such proceedings the national courts have regard to all relevant factors and weigh the competing interests in line with the above principles – in other words, where there is no reason to doubt the procedure followed in a given case – the margin of appreciation allowed to those courts will be a wide one, in recognition of the fact that they are better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions, and the Court will be reluctant to gainsay their assessment (see Pinnock and Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 31673/11, § § 28-34, 24 September 2013)."

                "54. The Court cannot agree with the position, expressed by some Bulgarian administrative courts, that the balance between the rights of those who stand to lose their homes and the public interest to ensure the effective implementation of the building regulations can as a rule properly be struck by way of an absolute rule permitting of no exceptions (see paragraphs 26 and 37 above). Such an approach could be sustained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which gives the national authorities considerable latitude in dealing with illegal construction (see paragraphs 73 - 76 below ), or in other contexts (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § § 106-09, ECHR 2013 (extracts), with further references). But given that the right to respect for one ’ s home under Article 8 of the Convention touches upon issues of central importance to the individual ’ s physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community, the balancing exercise under that provision in cases where the interference consists in the loss of a person ’ s only home is of a different order, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of those concerned (see Connors, cited above, § 82). This can normally only be examined case by case. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Bulgarian legislature has given active consideration to this balance, or that in opting for a wholesale rather than a more narrowly tailored solution it has taken into account the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], nos. 29381/09 and 32684/09, § 89, ECHR 2013 (extracts), and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Animal Defenders International, cited above, § § 114-16 ).

Nor can the Court accept the suggestion that the possibility for those concerned to challenge the demolition of their homes by reference to Article 8 of the Convention would seriously undermine the system of building control in Bulgaria (see paragraph 37 above). It is true that the relaxation of an absolute rule may entail risks of abuse, uncertainty or arbitrariness in the application of the law, expense, and delay. But it can surely be expected that the competent administrative authorities and the administrative courts, which routinely deal with various claims relating to the demolition of illegal buildings (see paragraphs 26, 27, 34 and 37 - 39 above), and have recently showed that they can examine such claims in the light of Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 30 above), will be able to tackle those risks, especially if they are assisted in this task by appropriate parameters or guidelines. Moreover, it would only be in exceptional cases that those concerned would succeed in raising an arguable claim that demolition would be disproportionate in their particular circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann, § 54; Paulić, § 43; and Bjedov, § 67, all cited above )."

In her appeal, the first applicant raised, albeit briefly, the points that the applicants now put before the Court: that the house was her only home and that she would be severely affected by its demolition ( see paragraph 15 above ). The Supreme Administrative Court did not even mention, let alone substantively engage with this point (see, mutatis mutandis, Brežec, cited above, § 49). This is hardly surprising, as under Bulgarian law it is not relevant for the demolition order ’ s lawfulness. Under the applicable statutory provisions, as construed by the Supreme Administrative Court, any building constructed without a permit is subject to demolition, unless it falls under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, and it is not open to the administrative authorities to refrain from demolishing it on the basis that this would cause disproportionate harm to those affected by that measure (see paragraphs 25 - 27 above)."

All the applicants could have obtained in proceedings under that provision – which are conducted solely before the administrative enforcement authority rather than an independent tribunal, with no possibility for judicial review of the decisions taken in their course – would have been a temporary reprieve from the effects of the demolition order rather than a comprehensive examination of its proportionality (see paragraph 32 above)."

Nor does it appear that, as suggested by the Supreme Administrative Court in its judgment of 1 June 2015 in a similar case ( see paragraph 30 above ), it would have been possible, as matters stand, to obtain a proper examination of the proportionality of the demolition by seeking judicial review of the enforcement of the demolition order under Article 294 et seq. of the 2006 Code (see paragraph 35 above ). Such examination could in principle be carried out in proceedings for judicial review of enforcement (see J.L. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 66387/10, § § 44- 46, 30 September 2014). But the case-law under these provisions shows that the Bulgarian administrative courts generally decline to examine arguments relating to the individual situation of the persons concerned by the demolition. They do so either on the basis that the proper balance between their rights under Article 8 of the Convention and the countervailing public interest to combat illegal construction has been resolved at the legislative level and that demolition is the only means of tackling illegal construction, or that such points can only be examined in proceedings for judicial review of the demolition order itself (see paragraphs 37 - 39 above). The only court that appears to have shown some willingness to entertain such arguments in proceedings under Article 294 et seq. of the Code is the Pazardzhik Administrative Court, which however did so when imposing interim measures in such proceedings rather than when dealing with the merits of the cases (see paragraph 40 above). It is also unclear whether persons in the position of the second applicant, who is not the addressee of the demolition order and has no property rights over the house, would have standing to bring such a challenge (see paragraph 36 above)."

The case-law under that provision, which is only intended to prevent the enforcement of administrative decisions where newly emerged facts militate against it, shows that in such proceedings the Bulgarian administrative courts just check whether facts which have come to pass after the issuing or the demolition order or its upholding by the courts – such as a lapse of the limitation period for enforcement or an intervening legalisation of the building – could preclude enforcement (see paragraph 34 above). There appears to be no case in which the courts have allowed such a claim, and thus blocked the enforcement of a demolition order, on the basis of arguments relating to the personal circumstances of those concerned. Moreover, in the applicants ’ case the enforcement proceedings started less than one month after the demolition order was upheld by the courts (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above)."

In the alternative, the Government submitted that the interference with the first applicant ’ s possessions was justified. The demolition, which was a measure of control of property, was lawful and would not impose an excessive burden on the applicants as their financial situation, as evident from the property disposal transactions carried out by them, was not so dire, and as they had wilfully acted in defiance of the law. Moreover, the house did not exclusively belong to the first applicant; the other co-owners of the plot were entitled to a share of it, and some of them had objected to its construction. The legitimate aim sought to be achieved by the demolition was to enforce the building regulations, which required a permit for each newly constructed building.

The applicants had built the house to have a place to live when they grew old.

This means that a measure must be both appropriate for achieving its aim and not disproportionate to that aim (see, among other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 50, Series A no. 98). However, the High Contracting Parties enjoy a margin of appreciation in this respect, in particular in choosing the means of enforcement and in ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement would be justified (see, as a recent authority, Depalle v. France [GC], no. 34044/02, § 83, ECHR 2010).

For that reason, unlike Article 8 of the Convention, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not in such cases presuppose the availability of a procedure requiring an individualised assessment of the necessity of each measure of implementation of the relevant planning rules. It is not contrary to the latter for the legislature to lay down broad and general categories rather than provide for a scheme whereby the proportionality of a measure of implementation is to be examined in each individual case (see James and Others, cited above, § 68, and Allen and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 5591/07, § 66, 6 October 2009 ). There is no incongruity in this, as the intensity of the interests protected under those two Articles, and the resultant margin of appreciation enjoyed by the national authorities under each of them, are not necessarily co-extensive (see Connors, cited above, § 82). Thus, although the Court has in some cases assessed the proportionality of a measure under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the light of largely the same factors as those that it has taken into account under Article 8 of the Convention (see Zehentner, §§ 52-65 and 70-79; Gladysheva, §§ 64-83 and 90-97; and Rousk, §§ 108 - 27 and 134-42, all cited above, as well as Demades v.

The order that the house be demolished, which was issued a reasonable time after its construction (contrast Hamer, cited above, § 83 ), simply seeks to put things back in the position in which they would have been if the first applicant had not disregarded the requirements of the law. The order and its enforcement will also serve to deter other potential lawbreakers (see Saliba, cited above, § 46), which must not be discounted in view of the apparent pervasiveness of the problem of illegal construction in Bulgaria (see paragraphs 41 - 43 above).

Budějovický Budvar produces a beer in the town of České Budějovice in Bohemia ( Czech Republic ) which is also called “ Budweiser ”. The term comes from Budweis, the German name for the town. The applicant company alleges that Budějovický Budvar has only been marketing beer under the “Budweiser” name since 1895, whereas Budějovický Budvar says that it has been entitled to use that appellation since 1265, when King Ottakar II of Bohemia conferred the right to produce the beer on a number of independent brewers in České Budějovice ( Budweis in German ). The brewers used a special technique and beers produced by this method became known by the term “ Budweiser ”, just as beers produced using the methods of another Czech town, Plzeň ( Pilsen in German ), became known as “ Pilsner ”."

The NIIP did not grant the application immediately because it was opposed by Budějovický Budvar, which alleged that “ Budweiser Bier” had been registered in its name as an appellation of origin since 1968.

In a judgment of 8 March 1995 ( which, in the absence of an appeal, became final ), the Lisbon Court of First Instance granted the applicant company ’ s application on the ground that the product to which the registration referred, namely the beer known as “ Budweiser Bier ”, was not an appellation of origin or indication of source. The Court of First Instance noted that under the terms of the Lisbon Agreement of 31 October 1958 such protection was reserved to the geographical name of a country, region, or locality, which served to designate a product originating therein, the quality and characteristics of which were due exclusively or essentially to the geographical environment, including natural and human factors. “ Budweiser ” did not come within this category.

In a judgment of 21 October 1999, the Lisbon Court of Appeal overturned the impugned judgment and ordered the NIIP to refuse to register “ Budweiser ” as a trade mark. The Court of Appeal did not consider that there had been a breach of Article 189 § 1 ( l ) of the Code of Industrial Property, as the expression “Budweiser” was incapable of misleading the Portuguese public as to the origin of the beer concerned. However, it found that such a registration would infringe the Bilateral Agreement and, consequently, Article 189 § 1 (j) of the Code of Industrial Property. In that connection, it noted that the Bilateral Agreement had remained in force, following an exchange of notes between the Czech and Portuguese governments (see paragraph 25 below) and had been incorporated into domestic law by virtue of Article 8 of the Constitution, which contained a clause providing for international law to take effect in the Portuguese legal system."

The applicant company also alleged that, in any event, the protected appellation of origin “ Českobudějovický Budvar ” did not correspond to the German expression “ Budweiser ”, so that the Bilateral Agreement could not be used to challenge its application for registration. The applicant company argued that, even supposing that the German expression “ Budweiser ” was an accurate translation of the Czech appellation of origin, the Bilateral Agreement applied only to translations between Portuguese and Czech, not to translations into other languages. It submitted, lastly, that the Bilateral Agreement was unconstitutional owing to a formal defect in that it had been adopted by the government, not Parliament, in breach of Articles 161 and 165 of the Constitution governing parliamentary sovereignty."

In any event, the effect of Article 65 of the TRIPs Agreement was that it had not become binding under Portuguese law until 1 January 1996, that is to say after the entry into force of the 1986 Bilateral Agreement. The Supreme Court therefore found that the TRIPs Agreement could not take precedence over the Bilateral Agreement.",

The appellation of origin “ Českobudějovický Budvar ”, which became “ Budweis ” or “ Budweiss ” in German, indicated a product from the České Budějovice region in Bohemia. It was therefore protected by the Bilateral Agreement.",

In most cases, once registered the mark is deemed to have been valid since the date the application for registration was filed ( system of retrospective protection through registration). The date of filing also determines priority in the system of international marks. Lastly, in some countries, an application to register a mark may itself be the subject of provisional registration, while in others it may be the subject of an assignment, security assignment or licence and (provided the mark is subsequently registered) create an entitlement to compensation in the event of fraudulent use by a third party."

In that connection, it acknowledged that the legal position of an applicant for the registration of a trade mark incontestably gave rise to financial interests, including a right of priority over subsequent applications.

In other words, the applicant company had a conditional right, which however was extinguished retrospectively for failure to satisfy the condition, namely that it did not infringe third-party rights. The Chamber therefore concluded that while it was clear that a trade mark constituted a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, this was so only after final registration of the mark, in accordance with the rules in force in the State concerned. Prior to such registration, the applicant did, of course, have a hope of acquiring such a “possession”, but not a legally protected legitimate expectation. Accordingly, when the Bilateral Agreement came into force on 7 March 1987 the applicant company did not have a “possession”. The manner in which the Bilateral Agreement had been applied by the Portuguese courts could not, therefore, constitute interference with a right of the applicant company ( see paragraphs 50-52 of the Chamber judgment )."

It submitted that the Chamber had, however, failed to draw the logical conclusions from its reasoning relating to the financial interests at stake in an application for registration. It argued that an application for registration had a pecuniary value and was therefore a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as, under the Court ’ s case -law, the concept of “possessions”, which had an autonomous meaning, was not limited to the ownership of physical goods but included certain other rights and interests that constituted assets."

In accordance with the priority rule, one of the characteristic features of the property rights bound up in an application for registration of a trade mark was a legitimate expectation that the application would not be defeated by a third - party intellectual property right that arose after the application for registration was filed. The applicant company possessed such a legitimate expectation, as indeed the dissenting judges had acknowledged in their opinion appended to the Chamber judgment.

That interference with its rights was not provided for by law, since the Supreme Court ’ s interpretation of the Bilateral Agreement was erroneous and contrary to the general principles of international law. The Portuguese courts had wrongly ruled that the Bilateral Agreement afforded protection of the appellations of origin referred to in Appendix A against translations of the names concerned into any other language, when in fact the Agreement only covered translations into Portuguese and Czech.

Furthermore, the interference was disproportionate as it had failed to strike the requisite fair balance between the general interest and the right of individuals. It also pointed out in that connection that it had not received any compensation for the loss of the use of its mark, despite the fact that there were no exceptional circumstances to justify the lack of payment. Furthermore, conflicts between trade marks and indications of source were now commonplace and the means were available under international law to resolve them satisfactorily. The Supreme Court ’ s decision to give the 1986 Bilateral Agreement precedence over the prior application to register the “ Budweiser” mark was contrary to international law, in particular the TRIPs Agreement and the relevant Community directives."

When the application for registration was lodged on 19 May 1981 the right to use the term “ Budweiser ” had already been registered by Budějovický Budvar, which explained why the NIIP had not immediately processed the application. In that connection, the Government stressed that when the Bilateral Agreement between Portugal and the Czech Republic was signed in 1986, only Budějovický Budvar was entitled to use the term “ Budweiser ” ( as an appellation of origin ). Budějovický Budvar had, moreover, immediately contested the NIIP ’ s decision in 1995 to register the mark and had gone on to win the proceedings.

In point of fact, such dealings were generally the result of a dispute between two companies over an application to register a mark with the transfer of the application serving to settle the dispute. In the Government ’ s submission, that practice tended to support the view that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was not applicable to such applications."

In any event, the interference was provided for by law, namely the Bilateral Agreement of 1986, which formed part of Portuguese domestic law. It also pursued a legitimate aim: the Portuguese courts ’ decision under the Bilateral Agreement was primarily intended to ensure compliance with domestic law, particularly as it concerned the Portuguese State ’ s international obligations, but also to avoid risks of confusion over a product ’ s source. The Government observed in that connection that, although the Portuguese courts had not relied on Article 189 § 1 (l) of the Code of Industrial Property as a basis for refusing registration of the mark, it was apparent from the Supreme Court ’ s judgment that it had also taken into account in its reasoning the risk of confusion with the Czech appellation of origin. The Government added that any interference there may have been had been entirely proportionate. Noting that the State enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation when it came to defining the public interest, the Government observed that the State was entitled to determine the conditions under which a trade mark would be eligible for registration. In particular, it was at liberty to decide that third-party interests should be protected, under a procedure provided for by law.

In that connection, it notes at the outset that the question whether the applicant company became the owner of the “Budweiser” mark on 20 June 1995 when it was issued with a registration certificate by the NIIP – a point that was argued in detail by the parties at the hearing before the Grand Chamber – is ultimately of secondary importance, the reason being that the issue of the certificate to the applicant company was in breach of the provisions of Article 7 of the Code of Industrial Property (see paragraph 43 above) and therefore cannot alter the nature of the “possession” to which the applicant company lays claim or the reality of its overall legal position for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

It agrees with the Chamber that such applications may give rise to a variety of legal transactions, such as a sale or licence agreement for consideration, and possess – or are capable of possessing – a substantial financial value. With regard to the Government ’ s submission that dealings in respect of applications for the registration of a mark are of negligible or symbolic value only, it is noted that in a market economy, value depends on a number of factors and it is impossible to assert at the outset that the assignment of an application for the registration of a trade mark will have no financial value. In the instant case, as the applicant company did not fail to point out, the mark in question possessed a definite financial value on account of its international renown."

The parties disagreed about whether, prior to the entry into force of the new Code of Industrial Property of 2003, it had been possible under Portuguese law to obtain compensation for the illegal or fraudulent use by a third party of a mark in respect of which an application for registration was pending. For its part, the Court considers that, in the light of the Lisbon Court of Appeal ’ s decision of 10 May 2001, such a possibility cannot be wholly ruled out."

These elements taken as a whole suggest that the applicant company ’ s legal position as an applicant for the registration of a trade mark came within Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as it gave rise to interests of a proprietary nature. It is true that the registration of the mark – and the greater protection it afforded – would only become final if the mark did not infringe legitimate third - party rights, so that, in that sense, the rights attached to an application for registration were conditional. Nevertheless, when it filed its application for registration, the applicant company was entitled to expect that it would be examined under the applicable legislation if it satisfied the other relevant substantive and procedural conditions. The applicant company therefore owned a set of proprietary rights – linked to its application for the registration of a trade mark – that were recognised under Portuguese law, even though they could be revoked under certain conditions. This suffices to make Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 applicable in the instant case and to make it unnecessary for the Court to examine whether the applicant company could claim to have had a “legitimate expectation”.",

France [GC], no. 11810/03, §§ 90 and 93, ECHR 2005- IX).

However, the Court notes that in the present case the applicant company complained mainly of the manner in which the national courts interpreted and applied domestic law in proceedings between two rival claimants to the same name, it being contended in particular that the courts wrongly gave retrospective effect to the Bilateral Agreement, rather than of the retrospective application of a law which deprived them of their pre-existing possessions. The Court observes that, even in cases involving litigation between individuals and companies, the obligations of the State under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 entail the taking of measures necessary to protect the right of property. In particular, the State is under an obligation to afford the parties to the dispute judicial procedures which offer the necessary procedural guarantees and therefore enable the domestic courts and tribunals to adjudicate effectively and fairly in the light of the applicable law. However, the Court reiterates that its jurisdiction to verify that domestic law has been correctly interpreted and applied is limited and that it is not its function to take the place of the national courts, its role being rather to ensure that the decisions of those courts are not flawed by arbitrariness or otherwise manifestly unreasonable. This is particularly true when, as in this instance, the case turns upon difficult questions of interpretation of domestic law. The Court reiterates its settled case-law that, according to Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention ( see García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, ECHR 1999- I)."

Belgium, 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332). The reason for this is that in the present case the very question whether the legislation was retrospectively applied is in itself in issue whereas, in the above - mentioned cases, not only was the retrospective effect of the legislation indisputable, it was also intentional. Indeed, it has not been established that the applicant company had a right of priority in respect of the “ Budweiser ” mark when the Bilateral Agreement, which is alleged to have been applied retrospectively, came into force. In this connection, the Court points out that the only effective registration in existence when the Bilateral Agreement took effect on 7 March 1987 was of the appellations of origin that had been registered in Budějovický Budvar ’ s name under the Lisbon Agreement of 31 October 1 958. While it is true that that registration was subsequently cancelled (see paragraph 18 above), the Court cannot examine what consequences the cancellation of the registration had on the right of priority attached to the mark."

Confronted with the conflicting arguments of two private parties concerning the right to use the name “Budweiser” as a trade mark or appellation of origin, the Supreme Court reached its decision on the basis of the material it considered relevant and sufficient for the resolution of the dispute, after hearing representations from the interested parties.

In the first place, that assertion is not borne out by the legislation at issue as interpreted by the domestic courts. The fact that the domestic courts ruled in a dispute between private litigants that the tips at issue represented “remuneration” within the meaning of the applicable legislation cannot of itself be said to engage the liability of the respondent State under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It would observe in this connection that the interpretation and application of domestic legislation in a given dispute is essentially a matter for the domestic courts. It notes that after full argument on the competing interpretations canvassed for the notion of “remuneration”, the domestic courts ruled that the employer, and not the customer, paid the tips at issue out of its own funds to the applicants and their colleagues. This conclusion cannot be considered arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable, having regard to the scope of the expression “remuneration” and indeed to the applicants’ acceptance that title in the tips at issue passed to the employer. Moreover, the applicants cannot claim that they had a legitimate expectation that the tips at issue would not count towards remuneration. Such a view assumes that the customer intended that this would not be the case. However, this is too imprecise a basis on which to found a legitimate expectation which could give rise to “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v.

In the opinion of the Court, it was for the applicants to come to a contractual arrangement with their employer as to how the tips at issue were to be dealt with from the point of view of their wage entitlement.

For that reason, tips paid in cash to waiters or to the tronc did not count as remuneration. However, he considered that the same reasoning could not apply to tips which were built into payments made by cheque or credit card to their employer since the amounts became the latter’s property. The employer thereafter paid an equivalent amount to the applicants. In his view, tips paid in this manner should count against the minimum remuneration requirement. Lord Justice Staughton rejected the attempts of the applicants’ counsel to interpret the applicable legislation differently. He further rejected counsel’s argument that the applicants had a right to the cheque and credit card tips as money had and received for their use. In Lord Justice Staughton’s opinion, it was decisive that the employer was paying the tips with its own money even if they had been paid by the customers to the employer in the belief that the latter would pass the tips on to the waiters and on the understanding that it would do so."

However, the applicants could not rely on the principle of legitimate expectation to base an argument that it was the intention of the customers to transfer property in the tips directly to them without the tips first becoming the property of their employer.

In either case, the employee had a legal right to claim the payment from the intermediary. That legal right was a property right.

They further maintained that it was irrelevant that the employer paid the entire sum collected by way of tips on credit cards and cheques rather than make deductions to cover matters such as transaction charges.

That provision protects the peaceful enjoyment of existing possessions; it does not confer any right to secure further possessions in the future. Should the Court not accept that reasoning in the instant case and find that there has been an interference with the applicants’ possessions, the Government contended that it was entirely consistent with the objectives of the minimum wage legislation (to curb unduly low pay), and it was not manifestly without reasonable foundation to treat all payments from an employer as counting towards the minimum level of remuneration.

Tips paid in this manner became the property of the employer for the simple reason that the vouchers signed by customers were made out in the employer’s name and were cleared through the latter’s account. It has not been disputed either that the applicants duly received from their employer their share in the tips in accordance with the proportion agreed by the waiting staff. Accordingly, there was no interference with each applicant’s agreed right to an appropriate share of the tips. They each received, in the form of “additional pay”, what the tronc system would have intended them to receive, minus tax and national insurance contributions which were payable on the amounts received. It is to be observed that the applicants received the tips in the form of additional pay speedily since, unlike their employer, they did not have to wait until the credit card or cheque payments had been processed. Furthermore, payment of the gratuity was guaranteed even if the credit card or cheque transaction turned out to be fraudulent. The employer bore the risk of fraud and did not require the applicants or other employees to indemnify it against that risk."

For the applicants, however, if the gratuities were indeed paid to them along these lines then it must be accepted that wages owed to them under the applicable legislation remained unpaid. The Court does not agree with this argument. The applicants were entitled to a minimum wage, and they have not disputed that their employer complied with its statutory obligations in this connection and, indeed, paid the applicants more than the minimum entitlement, having regard to the additional pay which appeared in their wage slips."

                "43. The applicants cannot maintain that they had a separate right to the tips and a separate right to minimum remuneration calculated without reference to those tips. In the first place, that assertion is not borne out by the legislation at issue as interpreted by the domestic courts. The fact that the domestic courts ruled in a dispute between private litigants that the tips at issue represented “remuneration” within the meaning of the applicable legislation cannot of itself be said to engage the liability of the respondent State under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It would observe in this connection that the interpretation and application of domestic legislation in a given dispute is essentially a matter for the domestic courts. It notes that after full argument on the competing interpretations canvassed for the notion of “remuneration”, the domestic courts ruled that the employer, and not the customer, paid the tips at issue out of its own funds to the applicants and their colleagues. This conclusion cannot be considered arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable, having regard to the scope of the expression “remuneration” and indeed to the applicants’ acceptance that title in the tips at issue passed to the employer. Moreover, the applicants cannot claim that they had a legitimate expectation that the tips at issue would not count towards remuneration. Such a view assumes that the customer intended that this would not be the case. However, this is too imprecise a basis on which to found a legitimate expectation which could give rise to “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v. Ireland, judgment of 29 November 1991, Series A no. 222, p. 23, § 51; Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v.

Germany [GC], no. 42527/98, § 83, ECHR 2001-VIII). In the opinion of the Court, it was for the applicants to come to a contractual arrangement with their employer as to how the tips at issue were to be dealt with from the point of view of their wage entitlement.

In the ECJ’s view, such criteria had not been applied in the present case, since the status of the existing channels had not been amended under the transitional schemes and they had continued their broadcasting activities to the detriment of operators such as the applicant company, which, because it had not been allocated any broadcasting frequencies, had been unable to exercise its rights and make use of its licence.",

According to AGCOM, this delay was due to several factors. Firstly, the legal situation was complicated because it was difficult to identify the available broadcasting frequencies as a result of the court decisions in which the over-quota channels had been allowed to continue broadcasting. In addition, the transitional arrangements introduced by Law no. 66/2001 (see paragraphs 63-64 below), which had allowed the channels in question to continue broadcasting in analogue mode, had prevented the plan from being implemented on account of the incompatibility between the interests of the channels likely to be allowed to broadcast under the plan and the interests of the channels that were legally entitled to continue their existing operations."

Damage had thus been sustained as a result of an unlawful act for which the authorities incurred non-contractual liability, concerning both the breach of legitimate expectations and the delay in allocating the frequencies. The fact that the authorities had launched a public tendering procedure for the frequencies in 1999, although the situation in the broadcasting sector had not been clarified and there were outstanding technical issues, had been “risky”. The Consiglio di Stato considered that the question of redress for the damage sustained by the applicant company should take this context into account.

As to the criteria for determining the damages to be awarded, the Consiglio di Stato pointed out that, as regards the losses sustained, the applicant company had been fully aware, at the time of the call for tenders, of the circumstances of the case and the conditions to which the licence was subject. Furthermore, the sequence of events that had prevented the frequencies from being allocated had been largely foreseeable. Accordingly, the applicant company should have known that it was unlikely to obtain the frequencies, at least in the short term. In addition, it could have purchased the frequencies under section 1 of Law no. 66/2001 (see paragraph 64 below).",

It refused to take into account the expert valuation submitted by the applicant company and held that it was unlikely that the company would have purchased shares in the market, even in the event that the over-quota channels had relinquished the frequencies. In the Consiglio di Stato ’s view, the comparison between the applicant company and the two leading operators (Mediaset and RAI) was unjustified, especially as it did not take into account the other nationwide operator (La 7), which, although it had greater economic power than the applicant company, was nevertheless operating at a loss.",

In judgment no. 420 of 5 December 1994, the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the provisions allowing the three channels controlled by the Mediaset group (Canale 5, Italia Uno and Retequattro) to occupy a dominant position. It held that the provision whereby the same operator could hold several television-broadcasting licences on condition that it did not exceed 25% of the total number of national channels – that is, three channels in all – was not sufficient to prevent concentration of television channels, and was accordingly in breach of Article 21 of the Constitution in that it did not make it possible to guarantee the plurality of information sources. The Constitutional Court considered that the existence of legislation to prevent dominant positions from being established was an essential requirement to justify the State’s relinquishment of its monopoly on broadcasting. The creation of such dominant positions in this sector would not only have had the effect of changing the rules on competition but would also have led to the emergence of an oligopoly and would have breached the fundamental principle of plurality of information sources. The Constitutional Court thus held that the mere coexistence of a State-owned company and private companies (a mixed system) within the broadcasting sector was not sufficient to secure respect for the right to receive information from several competing sources.

It held that the transition period laid down in that provision was acceptable, given that at the time the law was passed the alternative means of transmission in Italy could not be said to have been competitive in relation to traditional analogue broadcasting, hence the need to introduce a transition period to encourage the development of digital broadcasting. However, the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the failure to specify a fixed deadline for the expiry of the transition period. Referring to the technical conclusions set out in AGCOM’s decision no. 346/2001, resulting from a study of the number of cable and satellite television viewers in Italy, it ruled that 31 December 2003 was a reasonable date for the expiry of the transition period.",

This de facto situation does not therefore guarantee respect for external pluralism of information, which is an ‘essential requirement’ laid down by the relevant constitutional case-law ... In this context, given the persistence (and aggravation) of a situation which was ruled illegal in judgment no. 420/1994 and the continued operation of channels considered ‘over quota’ by the legislature in 1997, a deadline must be set that is absolutely certain, definitive and hence binding, in order to ensure compatibility with constitutional rules ...”"

The Parliamentary Assembly is therefore concerned by the concentration of political, commercial and media power in the hands of one person, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.",
                "2. The Parliamentary Assembly cannot accept that this anomaly be minimised on the grounds that it only poses a potential problem. A democracy is judged not only by its day-to-day operations but by the principles the country upholds with regard to its own citizens and internationally. The Assembly recalls that, in accordance with Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, States have a duty to protect and, when necessary, take positive measures to safeguard and promote media pluralism.",
                "3. The Assembly deplores the fact that several consecutive Italian governments since 1994 have failed to resolve the problem of conflict of interest and that appropriate legislation has not yet been adopted by the present Parliament. It disagrees that the leading principle of the Frattini Bill currently under consideration – that only managers, not owners, should be held responsible – provides a genuine and comprehensive solution to the conflict of interest concerning Mr Berlusconi.",
                "4. Through Mediaset, Italy’s main commercial communications and broadcasting group, and one of the largest in the world, Mr Berlusconi owns approximately half of the nationwide broadcasting in the country. His role as head of government also puts him in a position to influence indirectly the public broadcasting organisation, RAI, which is Mediaset’s main competitor. As Mediaset and RAI command together about 90% of the television audience and over three quarters of the resources in this sector, Mr Berlusconi exercises unprecedented control over the most powerful media in Italy.",
                "5. This duopoly in the television market is in itself an anomaly from an antitrust perspective. The status quo has been preserved even though legal provisions affecting media pluralism have twice been declared anti-constitutional and the competent authorities have established the dominant positions of RAI and the three television channels of Mediaset. An illustration of this situation was a recent decree of the Prime Minister, approved by Parliament, which allowed the third channel of RAI and Mediaset’s Retequattro to continue their operations in violation of the existing antitrust limits until the adoption of new legislation. Competition in the media sector is further distorted by the fact that the advertising company of Mediaset, Publitalia ’80, has a dominant position in television advertising. The Assembly deplores the continued exclusion of a potential national broadcaster, Europa 7, winner of a 1999 government tender to broadcast on frequencies occupied by Mediaset’s channel, Retequattro.",
                "6. The Assembly believes that the newly-adopted ‘Gasparri Law’ on the reform of the broadcasting sector may not effectively guarantee greater pluralism simply through the multiplication of television channels in the course of digitalisation. At the same time, it manifestly allows Mediaset to expand even further, as it gives the market players the possibility to have a monopoly in a given sector without ever reaching the antitrust limit in the overall integrated system of communications (SIC). The Assembly notes that these concerns led the President of the Republic to oppose the previous version of the law.",
                "7. The Assembly is particularly concerned by the situation of RAI, which is contrary to the principles of independence laid down in Assembly Recommendation 1641 (2004) on public-service broadcasting. RAI has always been a mirror of the political system of the country and its internal pluralism has moved from the proportionate representation of the dominant political ideologies in the past to the winner-takes-all attitude reflecting the present political system. The Assembly notes with concern the resignations of the President of RAI and of one of the most popular journalists in the country in protest against the lack of balanced political representation in the Council of Administration and against the political influence over RAI’s programming.",
                "8. While the printed media in Italy has traditionally provided greater pluralism and political balance than the broadcasting sector, most Italians receive their news through the medium of television. The high cost of newspaper compared to television advertising is having a damaging effect on the Italian printed media. However, the Assembly wishes to record its approval of government measures to help small- and medium-sized newspapers and other measures to boost newspaper readership.",
                "9. The Assembly is extremely concerned that the negative image that Italy is portraying internationally because of the conflict of interest concerning Mr Berlusconi, could hamper the efforts of the Council of Europe aimed at promoting independent and unbiased media in the new democracies. It considers that Italy, as one of the strongest contributors to the functioning of the Organisation, has a particular responsibility in this respect.",
                "10. The Assembly points out that several international bodies, such as the OSCE representative on Freedom of the Media and, most recently, the European Parliament, have expressed concerns similar to its own. It welcomes the measures for safeguarding media pluralism proposed in the European Parliament resolution on the risks of violation, in the European Union and especially in Italy, of freedom of expression and information (Article 11 § 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights) of 22 April 2004, namely that the protection of media diversity should become a priority of European Union competition law.",

                "Media pluralism is achieved when there is a multiplicity of autonomous and independent media at the national, regional and local levels, ensuring a variety of media content reflecting different political and cultural views. In the Commission’s opinion, internal pluralism must be achieved in each media sector at the same time: it would not be acceptable, for example, if pluralism were guaranteed in the print-media sector, but not in the television one. Plurality of the media does not only mean, in the Commission’s view, the existence of a plurality of actors and outlets, it also means the existence of a wide range of media, that is to say different kinds of media.",

                "– a legislative framework establishing limits for media concentration; the instruments for achieving this include permissible thresholds (to be measured on the basis of one or of a combination of elements such as the audience share or the capital share or revenue limits) which a single media company is allowed to control in one or more relevant markets;",

                "In respect of the provisions in the Gasparri Law aiming at protecting media pluralism, the Commission considers at the outset that the mere increase in the number of channels which will be brought about by digital television is not sufficient in itself to guarantee media pluralism. Newly available channels may have very small audiences but with similar amounts of output. Finally, larger companies will enjoy greater purchasing power in a wide range of activities such as programme acquisitions, and will thus enjoy significant advantages over other national content providers.",
                "The Commission considers therefore that the threshold of 20% of the channels is not a clear indicator of market share. It should be combined, for instance, with an audience share indicator.",
                "As regards the second threshold set out in the Gasparri Law, that is 20% of the revenue in the Integrated Communications Systems (SIC), the Commission considers that SIC certainly reflects a modern trend but should not, at least in this very broad definition, be used already at this stage instead of the ‘relevant market’ criterion, as its effect is to dilute the effectiveness of the instruments aimed at protecting pluralism. Indeed, it may allow an individual company to enjoy extremely high degrees of revenue shares in individual markets, whilst at the same time remaining below the 20% threshold for the whole sector.",
                "Indeed, the Commission notes that the combined effect of the new framework set out in the Gasparri Law has relaxed the previous anti-concentration rules whose maximum permissible levels had been exceeded by Mediaset and RAI. Retequattro has accordingly been allowed to continue to occupy analogue frequencies.",

                "As regards the provisions on migration of radio and television broadcasters from analogue to digital frequencies, the Commission has the impression that the Gasparri Law has taken the approach of attempting to hold back on finding a real solution to the problem of media concentration in the television market until some future point in time and it relies heavily on the point when digitalisation will come into full effect. In the Commission’s view, this approach is not satisfactory, as, if the status quo is maintained, it is likely that Mediaset and RAI will remain the dominant actors in Italian television. In this respect, the Commission recalls that while general anti-trust measures [are aimed] against the abuse of dominant positions, in the media sector dominant positions are forbidden as such.",
                "In respect of the privatisation of RAI, which should lead to a lesser degree of politicisation of the public broadcaster, the Commission notes that change at RAI will allow for government control over the public broadcaster for an unforeseeable period of time. For as long as the present government stays in office, this will mean that, in addition to being in control of its own three national television channels, the Prime Minister will have some control of the three public national television channels. The Commission expresses concern over the risk that this atypical situation may even strengthen the threat of monopolisation, which might constitute, in terms of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, an unjustified interference with freedom of expression.",

The duopoly was accompanied by a practical monopoly by Mediaset in the commercial television sector and the advertisement market. Before digitalisation, the duopoly’s audience share was around 90% (both owned three channels). Combined revenues and the advertisement market also provided evidence of the duopoly.",
                "Italy also has an ongoing record of control over public-service television by political parties and governments. As its Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi co-owns Mediaset, the usual fears of governmental control of RAI are aggravated by worries of widespread governmental control of the nation’s most important source of information, television.",

However, neither universal digitalisation nor equal competition rules alone can guarantee cultural diversity and political pluralism in the media, especially if the already existing media concentration is practically maintained or even enhanced by the law. The Gasparri Law’s rules of transition from analogue to digital, despite their innovative force, allow the duopoly to use its acquired economic might to expand into new digital markets.",

Freedom of the press and other news media affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of political leaders. It is incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on political issues and on other subjects of public interest. Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them (see, for example, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24, and Lingens, cited above, §§ 41-42)."

The Court notes that on 28 July 1999 the appropriate authorities granted the applicant company a licence for nationwide terrestrial television broadcasting in accordance with Law no. 249/1997, authorising it to install and operate an analogue television network. As regards the allocation of frequencies, the licence referred to the national frequency-allocation plan, adopted on 30 October 1998, and gave the applicant company twenty-four months to bring its installations into line with the relevant requirements (see paragraph 9 above). However, as is clear from the decisions of the domestic courts (see paragraph 14 above), that obligation could not be satisfied by the applicant company until such time as the authorities had adopted the adjustment programme and implemented the frequency-allocation plan. The Court considers that in such circumstances the applicant company could reasonably have expected the authorities to adopt, within the twenty-four months following 28 July 1999 at the latest, the instruments needed to regulate its terrestrial broadcasting activities. Provided that it upgraded its installations as it was required to do, the applicant company should then have been entitled to transmit television programmes."

However, section 3(6) of the same Law established a transitional scheme whereby the over-quota channels could continue broadcasting on terrestrial frequencies on a temporary basis after 30 April 1998, provided that they complied with the obligations imposed on channels holding licences and that their programmes were broadcast simultaneously on satellite or cable (see paragraph 60 above)."

In the light of that judgment, the applicant company could have expected that the frequencies which should have been allocated to it would be freed up by the start of 2004.

Changes in the market since 1999 should therefore be taken into consideration.

Secondly, the applicant company could legitimately have expected the authorities, within the twenty-four months following 28 July 1999, to take the necessary legal measures to regulate its television-broadcasting activities, thereby enabling it to transmit programmes (see paragraph 175 above). For the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, that expectation constituted a “possession” (see paragraph 179 above), the use of which was controlled by the same laws found to have been insufficiently foreseeable in relation to Article 10 (see paragraph 188 above).

The Convention did not guarantee any property rights independently from the domestic law of sovereign States.

This was also indicated by the fact that her 67% loss of working capacity under the pre-2008 system would have been equivalent to 54% health impairment under the new methodology; however, it had been assessed at 40% in 2009, which thus indicated a certain improvement in her health. The regular statutory reviews foreseen by the expert opinions prior to the withdrawal of the disability pension suggested only that the applicant’s ailments were susceptible to evolution, whereas the periodic reviews subsequent to that withdrawal had been requested by the applicant, rather than ordered by the authorities, and could therefore not be interpreted as proof of any subsisting legitimate expectation."

The Government further asserted that ex post facto legislation was typical of any social-security system, because of the lengthy and continuing nature of the social-security relationship between an insured person and the State. Applications for such benefits were normally not adjudicated on the basis of the law as in force at the beginning of the insurance relationship but rather under the law as it stood when the request was decided upon. Amendments enacted in the meanwhile to social-security laws might thus inevitably impose an individual burden on the insured. Any ex post facto legislation could only be validly disputed if the new law concerned those already in receipt of a benefit at the time of the entry into force of the retroactive law; however, this was not the case here."

To dispense the applicant from making the necessary contributions would be unfair and discriminatory towards those in a comparable situation who had diligently contributed to the social-security scheme. With regard to the actual aggregate of contributions made by the applicant, the Government submitted that this was a necessary but not a sufficient precondition, which was not capable of substituting for a valid national legal basis."

The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose. However, the rules are not “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 37, Series A no. 98; and Sargsyan v.

In applications concerning claims other than those relating to existing possessions, the idea behind this requirement has also been formulated in various other ways throughout the Court’s case-law.

It took the view that “where the proprietary interest is in the nature of a claim it may be regarded as an “asset” only where it has a sufficient basis in national law, for example where there is settled case-law of the domestic courts confirming it” (see Kopecký, cited above, § 52)."

Ireland, 29 November 1991, § 51, Series A no. 222; and Stretch v. the United Kingdom, no. 44277/98, § 35, 24 June 2003). In this line of cases, the “legitimate expectation” was thus based on a reasonably justified reliance on a legal act which had a sound legal basis and which bore on property rights (see Kopecký, cited above, § 47). Respect for such reliance follows from one aspect of the rule of law, which is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention and which implies, inter alia, that there must be a measure of legal protection in domestic law against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see, as a recent authority, Karácsony and Others v.

Many national legal systems recognise that such individuals require a degree of certainty and security, and provide for benefits to be paid – subject to the fulfilment of the conditions of eligibility – as of right (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 51). The principles which apply generally in cases under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are equally relevant when it comes to social and welfare benefits (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 54). The Court has previously addressed the issue of legitimate expectation in the context of social benefits on a number of occasions (see, for example, Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, § 44, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX, and Klein v. Austria, no. 57028/00, § 45, 3 March 2011."

In those legal systems where the national legislation requires mandatory contributions of employees to the social-security system, the legislation normally provides that those who have made adequate contributions and satisfied the statutory requirements of disability will receive some form of long-term disability benefit, on grounds of the principles of social solidarity and equivalency, for the period of the disability persisting or until the age of retirement. Such insurance schemes, which are typically mandatory, provide such protection, that is, the availability of benefits, for the entire period of insurance and on every occasion when the conditions of the insurance are satisfied. The relevant legal conditions are however subject to evolution. In this connection, it may be reiterated that in Gaygusuz v. Austria (16 September 1996, § 41, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV) the Court found that the right to emergency assistance – a social benefit linked to the payment of contributions to the unemployment insurance fund – was, in so far as provided for in the applicable legislation, a pecuniary right for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In Klein (cited above, § 43) it was noted that entitlement to a social benefit – in that instance, a pension payable from a lawyers’ pension scheme – was linked to the payment of contributions, and, when such contributions had been made, an award could not be denied to the person concerned. Contributions to a pension fund may thus, in certain circumstances and according to the domestic law, create a property right (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 39; Apostolakis v. Greece, no. 39574/07, §§ 28 and 35, 22 October 2009; Bellet, Huertas and Vialatte v. France (dec.), nos. 40832/98, 40833/98 and 40906/98, 27 April 1999; Skórkiewicz v.

Ukraine (dec.), no. 4519/11, §§ 34, 37-43, 48, 3 June 2014). If, however, a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a welfare benefit – whether conditional or not on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation must be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 54)."

Accordingly, from 2001 until 2009/10, that is, for almost ten years, the applicant fulfilled all the conditions of eligibility for receiving a disability pension as of right (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 51, quoted in paragraph 80 above). The decision granting her a disability pension in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Act and which formed the basis of her original entitlement could thus be regarded as representing an “existing possession” (see Kopecký, § 35(c)). Further, it seems undeniable that throughout the said period, she could, on the basis of the said “legal act”, entertain a “legitimate expectation” (ibid., § 47) of continuing to receive disability benefits should her disability persist to the requisite degree, there being no dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law (ibid., § 50)."

Due to that legislative change, she was denied disability allowance on the ground that she was not eligible under the newly introduced contribution rules. This state of affairs was then reaffirmed in the applicant’s individual case, with authoritative force, by the final judgment of the Nyíregyháza Administrative and Labour Court, adopted on 20 June 2013 (see paragraph 23 above). It is only if her legitimate expectation continued to exist until 1 January 2012 that this legislative amendment could be considered to constitute an interference with the applicant’s possessions within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

The change in the law effectively imposed on a certain category of insured persons, including the applicant, a condition whose advent had not been foreseeable during the relevant potential contributory period and which they could not possibly satisfy once the new legislation entered into force – a combination of elements which is ultimately difficult to reconcile with the rule of law. The Court points out at this juncture that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are “practical and effective” rather than theoretical and illusory (see Perdigão v. Portugal [GC], no. 24768/06, § 68, 16 November 2010). To hold that although a person has contributed to an insurance scheme and has satisfied its contributory requirement, he or she could be totally deprived of the legitimate expectation of eventual benefits would sit uncomfortably with this principle."

Furthermore, whilst approving the withdrawal of the applicant’s disability pension as of 1 February 2010, the Labour Court expressly confirmed that a new medical assessment could take place in 2012 and drew her attention to the possibility of making a renewed application should her health deteriorate (see paragraph 16 above)."

By way of contrast, the hope of recognition of the survival of an old property right which it has long been impossible to exercise effectively cannot be considered as a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, nor can a conditional claim which lapses as a result of the non-fulfilment of the condition (see the recapitulation of the relevant principles in Malhous, decision cited above, with further references, in particular to the Commission’s case-law)."

It noted that the defence of the complaint directed against this finding was restricted to the representation that this finding was not supported in the files and that, due to this shortcoming, it had not been necessary to deal with the finding in greater detail. The Administrative Court considered that this approach was mistaken as, under the relevant provision of the administrative regulations, no evidence was required for facts which were generally known and, therefore, it was not necessary for evidence to be contained in the administrative files; however, counter-evidence against an official finding that a certain fact was generally known would have been admitted.",

In the court’s view, Chapter 6, Article 3, of the Convention on the Settlement of Matters Arising out of the War and the Occupation ( Vertrag zur Regelung aus Krieg und Besatzung entstandener Fragen – “the Settlement Convention”) of 23 October 1954 between the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the French Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany excluded German jurisdiction over the applicant’s case.",
                "In its reasoning, the Regional Court noted that, under the terms of that Article’s paragraph 3 taken in conjunction with paragraph 1, claims or actions against persons having acquired or transferred title to property on the basis of measures carried out with regard to German external assets or other property, seized for the purpose of reparation or restitution, or as a result of the state of war, or on the basis of specific agreements, were not admissible. These particular provisions had been confirmed upon German unification.",
                "According to the Regional Court, Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3, of the Settlement Convention applied, mutatis mutandis, to the applicant’s claims against the defendant, which had obtained the painting on loan and had not acquired property, because any review of the aforementioned measures should be excluded.",
                "The Regional Court found that the confiscation of the applicant’s father’s property under Decree no. 12 on the “confiscation and accelerated allocation of agricultural property of German and Hungarian persons and of those having committed treason and acted as enemies of the Czech and Slovak people”, issued by the President of the former Czechoslovakia on 21 June 1945, constituted a measure within the meaning of Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3.",
                "The Regional Court rejected, in particular, the applicant’s argument that this provision did not apply as it only concerned measures carried out with regard to German external assets or other property and his father had never been a German citizen. In this respect, the court, referring to case-law of the Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ), stated that the view of the confiscating State was decisive. The aim and purpose of this provision, namely to sanction, without any further examination, confiscation measures implemented abroad could only be achieved by excluding such measures from judicial review in Germany.",
                "Moreover, the Regional Court found that the confiscation measure in question pursued one of the purposes mentioned in Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3. Having regard to German case-law regarding other “Beneš Decrees”, especially Decree no. 108 on the “confiscation of enemy property and the national reform fund”, it considered that Decree no. 12, while also pursuing economic aims, was intended to expropriate the property of German and Hungarian nationals, that is, “enemy property”.",
                "The Regional Court further noted that the applicant’s father’s painting had been expropriated under Decree no. 12. The competent Czechoslovakian authorities had interpreted its provisions as applying to the applicant’s father, regarding him as a “person of German nationality”. The applicant’s father had unsuccessfully appealed against this decision which had been confirmed by the Bratislava Administrative Court in 1951. The German courts were not in a position to review the lawfulness of the confiscation at issue.",
                "Finally, the Regional Court considered that the painting at issue, as part of the inventory of the agricultural property, had been included in the confiscation measure.",

The Regional Court considered that the question underlying the litigation before it would not be clarified in such proceedings. Irrespective of the question of whether the plaintiff was of German origin, he had no equalisation claims under the said legislation, which only applied to persons who resided in the Federal Republic of Germany or West Berlin on 31 December 1952. In any event, there was no right to compensation for the loss of works of art ( Kunstgegenstände )."

                "18. On 9 July 1996 the Cologne Court of Appeal ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The Court of Appeal confirmed that the applicant’s action was inadmissible as German jurisdiction in respect of his claim was excluded under Chapter 6, Article 3 § 1, in conjunction with paragraph 3, of the Settlement Convention.",
                "The Court of Appeal considered that the notion of German jurisdiction included the competence, derived from State sovereignty and generally vested by the State in the courts, to administer justice. German jurisdiction was delimited by international agreements, customary international law and the generally recognised rules of international law. Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3, taken in conjunction with paragraph 1, of the Settlements Convention excluded German jurisdiction in respect of claims and actions against persons, who, as a consequence of reparation measures, had directly or indirectly acquired title to German property confiscated abroad.",
                "The Court of Appeal confirmed that the provisions in question continued to be in force under the Treaty of 12 September 1990 on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany. Article 7 of this Treaty, which provided for the termination of the operation of quadripartite rights and responsibilities with respect to Berlin and Germany as a whole, was amended by the Agreement of 27 and 28 September 1990 according to which the Settlement Convention was suspended and later terminated with the exception of the provisions specified in paragraph 3 of that Agreement, inter alia, Chapter 6, Article 3 §§ 1 and 3. That Agreement was valid under public international law and under German constitutional law.",
                "The Court of Appeal further considered that Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3, of the Settlement Convention applied in the applicant’s case. In the court’s view, this provision was the procedural consequence of the notion that the legal relations resulting from the liquidation of German property abroad by foreign powers for the purpose of reparation were “final and unchallengeable” ( Endgültigkeit und Unanfechtbarkeit ) for the Federal Republic of Germany and the private persons concerned.",
                "According to the Court of Appeal, the applicant’s constitutional rights, in particular his right to property, his right of access to a court and his right to a decision by the legally competent court ( gesetzlicher Richter ), had not been infringed. Basic rights protected individuals against acts of domestic public authorities and not against the exercise of public authority by a foreign State abroad. The domestic legislator was therefore not prevented from limiting domestic legal protection against violations of basic rights by a foreign State if this was necessary to attain more important goals.",
                "When applying Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3, of the Settlement Convention, the domestic law of the expropriating State concerning the concrete confiscation measure had to be taken into account, as this provision was aimed at excluding litigation in Germany regarding confiscation measures based on legislation concerning enemy property.",
                "As regards the applicant’s objections against the lawfulness, in particular under public international law, of the confiscation and expropriation of his father’s property, the Court of Appeal found that by virtue of Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3 of the Settlement Convention, German courts had no jurisdiction. Likewise, this provision did not allow recourse to be had to general rules of public international law or to German ordre public when examining the admissibility of the action. The applicant’s argument that the provisions of the Settlement Convention and their application to him as a national and head of a neutral State violated the law of peace was accordingly rejected.",
                "According to the Court of Appeal, the painting at issue constituted external assets within the meaning of Chapter 6, Article 3 § 1, of the Settlement Convention, referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 3. The Court of Appeal noted that the applicant’s father had indisputably never had German nationality. However, following the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, it considered that the notion of “German external assets” had to be interpreted in the light of the law of the expropriating State. The confiscation in dispute had been found to be in compliance with the legislation of the expropriating State: the competent Czechoslovakian administrative authorities as well as the Bratislava Administrative Court had found that Presidential Decree no. 12 of 21 June 1945 applied to the applicant’s father’s confiscated property. Article 1 § 1 (a) of this decree provided for the confiscation of agricultural properties of “all persons of German or Hungarian nationality” irrespective of their citizenship. The notions of “German nationality”, or of “German origin” (“ deutsche Volkszugehörigkeit ”), likewise used at that time, comprised as relevant elements a person’s citizenship and nationality, the latter depending on the mother tongue. At the relevant time, the Czechoslovakian authorities indisputably regarded the applicant’s father as of German origin in that broader sense.",
                "The Court of Appeal also found that the painting at issue, as part of the confiscated agricultural property, had been subject to the expropriation measure. There were no doubts as to the effectiveness of the expropriation, as it was sufficient under the relevant case-law that such expropriations had been implemented and that the previous owners had been deprived of their factual power of disposition. Furthermore, the painting had been confiscated for the purpose of reparation within the meaning of Chapter 6, Article 3 §§ 1 and 3, of the Settlement Agreement. The limitation of the confiscation measures to persons belonging to enemy States in itself justified such a conclusion. The assets of the persons concerned were confiscated as enemy assets.",
                "Finally, the Court of Appeal considered that both the defendant and the intervener belonged to the group of persons protected by Chapter 6, Article 3 § 3, of the Settlement Agreement. German jurisdiction was excluded whenever the plaintiff intended to challenge measures within the meaning of Chapter 6, Article 3 § 1."

                "The Federal Constitutional Court considered in particular that, for the purposes of the civil court decisions, questions as to the existence or non-existence of certain rules of customary international law on the confiscation of neutral assets or on the determination of citizenship were irrelevant as they concerned the issue of the lawfulness of the expropriation by the former Czechoslovakia. The German civil courts had not decided this issue and, under public international law, they had not been obliged to do so. Moreover, to the extent that the civil courts had regarded the expropriation as a measure within the meaning of Chapter 6, Article 3 § 1, of the Settlement Convention, they had expressly refrained from qualifying the applicant’s father’s nationality. Their interpretation of the terms “measures with regard to German external assets” as comprising any measures which, in the intention of the expropriating State, were directed against German assets, could not be objected to under constitutional law. The bar on litigation did not constitute an agreement to the detriment of Liechtenstein, as only the Federal Republic of Germany and its courts were under this treaty obligation.",
                "The Federal Constitutional Court further recalled that the exclusion of jurisdiction did not amount to a violation of the right of property as these clauses and the Settlement Convention as a whole served to settle matters dating back to a time before the entry into force of the German Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ) on 23 May 1949.",
                "Finally, there was no indication of arbitrariness or of a violation of other constitutional rights. The Federal Constitutional Court confirmed that Chapter 6, Article 3 §§ 1 and 3, of the Settlement Convention had not been set aside by the Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany: while Germany obtained full sovereignty, its obligations under treaties with the Three Powers were not affected. This had also been the legal opinion of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Three Powers, which otherwise would not have settled the suspension and termination of parts of the Settlement Convention in a separate agreement.",

In the case of the applicant’s father in his capacity as Head of State of the sovereign State of Liechtenstein, the finding of the Bratislava Administrative Court in 1951, according to which his “ethnic German origin” was “generally known”, was incomprehensible.",

The exclusion of German jurisdiction, which had been established in the Settlement Convention and had been maintained in the Agreement of 27 and 28 September 1990 following the Two-Plus-Four Treaty, neither prejudiced nor affected de facto the power to dispose of property. This was true at least for the great majority of cases where property had remained within the territory of the former Czechoslovakia. The provision had only consequences of a procedural nature, and no qualification of the individual confiscation measures was involved. Furthermore, only German jurisdiction was excluded, not the possibility of lodging claims in foreign courts. In particular, the applicant was not prevented from instituting proceedings before Czech or Slovak courts, claiming restitution of the property confiscated in 1946. Finally, a statutory regulation and international obligation could only cover the usual course of events and not exceptional situations.",

The question of whether or not their interpretation of Chapter 6, Article 3, of the Settlement Convention was correct in an individual case was irrelevant. At least, having regard to the reasoning adopted by the Bratislava Administrative Court, the assumption of the German courts that the property had been seized as German property for reparation purposes in a more general sense was not arbitrary, but defendable.

In the instant case, the German courts had elements at their disposal which indicated that the authorities of the former Czechoslovakia, when confiscating the painting at issue as part of the agricultural property of the applicant’s father, had carried out a measure with regard to “German external assets or other property, seized for the purpose of reparation”. In particular, the property had been confiscated in application of Decree no. 12 on the “confiscation and accelerated allocation of agricultural property of German and Hungarian persons and of those having committed treason and acted as enemies of the Czech and Slovak people”. Moreover, in the proceedings before the Bratislava Administrative Court, the administrative authorities of the former Czechoslovakia had made it clear that they regarded the applicant’s father as a person of German nationality within the meaning of this decree."

France and Spain, judgment of 26 June 1992, Series A no. 240, p. 34, § 110)."

In the light of these findings and having regard to the limited power of review exercisable by the Court (see paragraphs 49-50 above), it cannot be said that the German courts’ interpretation of Chapter 6, Article 3, of the Settlement Convention was inconsistent with previous German case-law or that its application was manifestly erroneous or was such as to lead to arbitrary conclusions."

Furthermore, in examining whether the limitation on the applicant’s access to the German courts was compatible with the principles established in the Court’s case-law (see paragraphs 44-48 above), the Court attaches particular significance to the nature of the applicant’s property claims in respect of the painting at issue. As part of the applicant’s father’s agricultural property in the former Czechoslovakia, it had been expropriated by the authorities of the former Czechoslovakia in 1946 and had remained within the latter State’s territory and later within the territory of the Czech Republic. As the Government pointed out, the exclusion of German jurisdiction did not affect the great majority of such cases where property had remained within the territory of the expropriating State. The genuine forum for the settlement of disputes in respect of these expropriation measures was, in the past, the courts of the former Czechoslovakia and, subsequently, the courts of the Czech or Slovak Republics. Indeed, in 1951 the applicant’s father had availed himself of the opportunity of challenging the expropriation in question before the Bratislava Administrative Court (see paragraph 12 above)."

The Court finds that, for the applicant, the possibility of instituting proceedings in the Federal Republic of Germany to challenge the validity and lawfulness of the expropriation measures, which had been carried out by the former Czechoslovakia at a time prior to the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany under its 1949 Constitution, was a remote and unlikely prospect. It was only when, in 1991, the municipality of Cologne received the painting on loan from the Czech Republic that the applicant brought proceedings before the German courts and that the exclusion of German jurisdiction under Chapter 6, Article 3, of the Settlement Convention became operative. It prevented the applicant from obtaining a decision by the German courts, under the principles of German private international law, on his property claim and especially his argument that the confiscation measures of 1946 constituted a violation of the German ordre public (see paragraphs 15 and 34 above)."

In its decision the Federal Constitutional Court had deviated from the opinion of the Cologne Court of Appeal, by proceeding on an assumption – not previously made in this case – that the occupation treaties of the three Western Allies constituted an original legal regime independent of the law of the Four Powers and invoked a legal position of the Western Allies which had not been discussed."

The Federal Constitutional Court had only confirmed this legal opinion – which therefore could not have been surprising for the applicant – and developed the legal arguments thereon.

Turkey (merits) (judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI). He considered that the Government’s arguments giving effect to such an unlawful confiscation contradicted the previous German practice not to recognise confiscation measures under the Beneš Decrees.

Thus in 1991, when the painting concerned came to Germany, the applicant could no longer have had any legitimate expectation of enjoying any property right over it.

Russia, no. 22000/03, § 31, 15 February 2007). In assessing the reasonableness of the delay in enforcement due regard must be paid to the fact that a delay of one year and four months in the enforcement of a monetary award against the State body has been found by the Court to be excessive (see Zubko and Others v.

The Government’s submissions do not contain any justification for such substantial delays in the enforcement of the judgments in the applicant’s favour.

Likewise, in cases concerning non-enforcement of judicial decisions, any domestic means to prevent a violation by ensuring timely enforcement is, in principle, of greatest value. However, where a judgment is delivered in favour of an individual against the State, the former should not, in principle, be compelled to use such means (see, mutatis mutandis, Metaxas, cited above, § 19): the burden to comply with such a judgment lies primarily with the State authorities, which should use all means available in the domestic legal system in order to speed up the enforcement, thus preventing violations of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Akashev, cited above, §§ 21-22).",

Where such a compensatory remedy is available in the domestic legal system, the Court must leave a wider margin of appreciation to the State to allow it to organise the remedy in a manner consistent with its own legal system and traditions and consonant with the standard of living in the country concerned. The Court is nonetheless required to verify whether the way in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the Convention principles, as interpreted in the light of the Court’s case-law (see Scordino, cited above, §§ 187-191). The Court has set key criteria for verification of the effectiveness of a compensatory remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings.

In the present case the Court observes that it is purely on account of his status as a child “born of adultery” that the applicant was refused the right to request an abatement of the inter vivos division signed by his mother, that status being the basis of the Court of Cassation’s decision – interpreting the transitional provisions of the 2001 Law – to exclude application in his case of the provisions relating to the new inheritance rights recognised by that Law. In cases, such as the present, concerning a complaint under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that the applicant has been denied all or part of a particular asset on a discriminatory ground covered by Article 14, the relevant test is whether, but for the discriminatory ground about which the applicant complains, he or she would have had a right, enforceable under domestic law, in respect of the asset in question (see, mutatis mutandis, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.)

The Court cannot accept that argument, however. It notes that whilst inter vivos gifts have the immediate effect of transferring ownership, according to the case-law of the Court of Cassation this does not become a division for inheritance purposes until the death of the donor. The succession is both opened and definitively liquidated or divided on the date of the ascendant’s death (see paragraph 24 above), which in this case was not until 1994. By that date the applicant’s filiation had been established. It was thus indeed on grounds of his status as a child “born of adultery” that the applicant was excluded from his mother’s estate."

                "The difficulty submitted for your examination does indeed arise from the different approach proposed by the transitional provisions of the 1972 and 2001 Laws. Whilst neither successions already open, nor inter vivos gifts granted prior to the coming into force of the Law of 1972, could be challenged under that Law, the Law of 2001 allows children born outside marriage whose father or mother was, at the time of conception, bound by marriage to another person to assert inheritance rights in respect of successions already open prior to publication of that Law.",
                "That difference justifies a non-restrictive application of the provisions of the Law of 2001. Only where there has been actual division, or an agreement has been reached between the parties or a final court decision delivered can the new inheritance rights of such children be excluded where the succession has already been opened. On account of the action for an abatement, the succession already open on the date of publication of the Law of 2001 cannot have “given rise to division” on the date of publication of that Law.",
                "I therefore find the submission that the Law of 3 December 2001 is not applicable difficult to sustain. The terms of section 14 of the Law of 3 January 1972, however, are entirely unambiguous. Heirs who have acquired rights under this Law to the reserved portion of the estate cannot exercise those rights “ to the detriment of inter vivos gifts granted before the Law came into force”. Should, then, these provisions be deemed to have been tacitly repealed?",
                "Without having regard to the time factor, the applicant maintains in his supplementary pleadings that it must be concluded from the clear contradiction between the transitional provisions of the two Laws that those governing the Law of 1972 have been tacitly repealed. Whilst the approach is different between the transitional provisions enacted in 1972 and those enacted in 2001, they do not, however, appear to me to conflict.",

There is nothing to justify calling that legal security into question in 2002, since the earlier transitional provisions complement those laid down by the 2001 Law.",

In that connection, whilst it remains debatable whether there had actually been division prior to publication of the Law of 3 December 2001, the existence of an inter vivos gift granted prior to the coming into force of the Law of 3 January 1972 is not in dispute. ...”"

An inter vivos division ( donation-partage ) is a deed by which the donor divides his or her property immediately among his or her heirs ( inter vivos transfer). It is an anticipated, definitive and negotiated division. Title to the property is transferred at the time of the donation, which is also the first (anticipated) step in a succession that will be opened later. According to the case-law of the Court of Cassation, an inter vivos division becomes a division for the purposes of inheritance on the donor’s death.

It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded by those provisions. Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions – and to this extent it is autonomous – there can be no room for its application unless the facts in issue fall within the ambit of one or more of the latter (see, among many other authorities, Van Raalte v. the Netherlands, 21 February 1997, § 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I; Petrovic v. Austria, 27 March 1998, § 22, Reports 1998 ‑ II; Zarb Adami v. Malta, no. 17209/02, § 42, ECHR 2006 ‑ VIII; and Konstantin Markin v. Russia [GC], no. 30078/06, § 124, ECHR 2012 (extracts)).",

The Court reiterates that the concept of “possessions” referred to in the first part of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 has an autonomous meaning which is not limited to ownership of physical goods and is independent from the formal classification in domestic law: certain other rights and interests constituting assets can also be regarded as “property rights”, and thus as “possessions” for the purposes of this provision (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 100, ECHR 2000 ‑ I)."

Bosnia ‑ Herzegovina Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 60642/08, § 52, 17 October 2011), in particular on intestacy or through voluntary dispositions (see, mutatis mutandis, Marckx, cited above, § 50, and Merger and Cros, cited above, § 37). However, “possessions” can be either “existing possessions” or assets, including claims, in respect of which the applicant can argue that he or she has at least a “legitimate expectation” of obtaining effective enjoyment of a property right (see, among other authorities, Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, § 31, Series A no. 332; Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 35, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX; and Association nationale des pupilles de la Nation v. France (dec.), no. 22718/08, 6 October 2009). A legitimate expectation must have a “sufficient basis in national law” (see Kopecký, cited above, § 52; Depalle v. France [GC], no. 34044/02, § 63, ECHR 2010; and Saghinadze and Others v. Georgia, no. 18768/05, § 103, 27 May 2010).

Latvia [GC], no. 55707/00, § 79, ECHR 2009). However, the hope of recognition of the survival of an old property right which it has long been impossible to exercise effectively cannot be considered as a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, nor can a conditional claim which lapses as a result of the non-fulfilment of the condition (see the recapitulation of the relevant principles in Malhous v. the Czech Republic (dec.)

In the present case the Court observes that it is purely on account of his status as a child “born of adultery” that the applicant was refused the right to request an abatement of the inter vivos division signed by his mother, that status being the basis of the Court of Cassation’s decision – interpreting the transitional provisions of the 2001 Law – to exclude application in his case of the provisions relating to the new inheritance rights recognised by that Law. In cases, such as the present, concerning a complaint under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that the applicant has been denied all or part of a particular asset on a discriminatory ground covered by Article 14, the relevant test is whether, but for the discriminatory ground about which the applicant complains, he or she would have had a right, enforceable under domestic law, in respect of the asset in question (see, mutatis mutandis, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 55, ECHR 2005 ‑ X, and Andrejeva, cited above, § 79). That test is satisfied in the present case."

The Court cannot accept that argument, however. It notes that whilst inter vivos gifts have the immediate effect of transferring ownership, according to the case-law of the Court of Cassation this does not become a division for inheritance purposes until the death of the donor. The succession is both opened and definitively liquidated or divided on the date of the ascendant’s death (see paragraph 24 above), which in this case was not until 1994. By that date the applicant’s filiation had been established. It was thus indeed on grounds of his status as a child “born of adultery” that the applicant was excluded from his mother’s estate."

The Court reiterates that in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention, Article 14 affords protection against different treatment, without an objective and reasonable justification, of persons in similar situations. For the purposes of Article 14, a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it “has no objective and reasonable justification”, that is, if it does not pursue a “legitimate aim” or if there is not a “reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised” (see Mazurek, cited above, §§ 46 and 48). Moreover, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see Stec and Others, cited above, §§ 51 and 52, ECHR 2006 ‑ VI). The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and the background, but the Court must determine in the last resort whether the Convention requirements have been complied with. Since the Convention is first and foremost a system for the protection of human rights, the Court must however have regard to the changing conditions in Contracting States and respond, for example, to any emerging consensus as to the standards to be achieved (see Konstantin Markin, cited above, § 126)."

Ireland, 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112) and under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 (see Vermeire v. Belgium, 29 November 1991, Series A no. 214 ‑ C, and Brauer v.

The Court has extended this case-law to voluntary dispositions by confirming the prohibition on discrimination where testamentary dispositions are concerned (see Pla and Puncernau v. Andorra, no. 69498/01, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII). Accordingly, as early as 1979, in Marckx, the Court held that restrictions on children’s inheritance rights on grounds of birth were incompatible with the Convention.

In interpreting the transitional provision concerned, the Court of Cassation considered that division for inheritance purposes had taken place in 1994, at the time of the applicant’s mother’s death (see paragraph 23 above), in line with long-standing case-law authority to the effect that in respect of inter vivos divisions the death of the donor triggers both the opening of the succession and the division (see paragraph 24 above). A legitimate child who had been omitted from the inter vivos division or not yet conceived when the deed was signed would not have been precluded from obtaining his or her reserved portion or share of the estate in accordance with Articles 1077-1 and 1077-2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 25 above).

In that connection it considers that the applicant’s half-brother and half-sister knew – or should have known – that their rights were liable to be challenged. At the time of their mother’s death in 1994 there was a statutory five-year time-period for bringing an action for abatement of an inter vivos division. The legitimate heirs should therefore have known that their half-brother had until 1999 to claim his share in the estate and that such an action was capable of calling into question not the division as such, but the extent of the rights of each of the descendants. Moreover, the action for abatement that the applicant did finally bring in 1998 was pending before the national courts at the time of delivery of the judgment in Mazurek, which declared that inequality of inheritance rights on grounds of birth was incompatible with the Convention, and at the time of publication of the 2001 Law, which executed that judgment by incorporating the principles established therein into French law. Lastly, the applicant was not a descendant whose existence was unknown to them, as he had been recognised as their mother’s “illegitimate” son in a judgment delivered in 1983 (see paragraph 12 above; see, mutatis mutandis, Camp and Bourimi, cited above, § 39).

The applicant challenged that submission (see paragraph 46 above). In the particular circumstances of the case, in which European case-law and the national legislative reforms showed a clear tendency towards eliminating all discrimination regarding the inheritance rights of children born outside marriage, the Court considers that the action brought by the applicant before the domestic courts in 1998 and dismissed in 2007 is a weighty factor when examining the proportionality of the difference in treatment (see paragraphs 22 and 68 above, and paragraph 72 below).

Questions concerning inheritance on intestacy could fall within the scope of Article 8 but that provision did not guarantee a right to inherit. A decision not to call into question a legal situation acquired in 1970 was not an interference with the applicant’s right to respect for his family life."

                "80. If, however, the Court were to consider that there had been interference, this had been prescribed by law, namely, the 1972 Law prohibiting heirs to a reserved portion of the estate from exercising those rights to the detriment of gifts granted prior to 1972. It had pursued a legitimate aim, namely, guaranteeing peaceful family relations by securing long-standing rights. Relying on the Court’s judgment in Marckx, the Government submitted that it would be contrary to the principle of legal certainty to set aside a division implemented several years (1972 Law) or even several decades (2001 Law) before the legislative and jurisprudential changes amending the inheritance rules applicable to children “born of adultery”. Lastly, that interference had been proportionate because the implementation of the impugned provisions by the domestic courts was limited both in time and in respect of the voluntary dispositions concerned. The Government concluded that the transitional provisions, as interpreted by the domestic courts, were in conformity with the decision in Mazurek and with the Convention. The 2001 Law, in particular, provided for application of the new provisions with regard to the time factor, taking account of acquired situations that it would be undesirable from a social point of view – and unfeasible in certain cases – to call into question. The Government stressed the margin of appreciation available to the State when balancing the competing interests."

The question which arises under this head is whether the overall economic activities carried out by the applicants constituted “possessions” coming within the scope of the protection afforded by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In this regard, the Court notes that it is undisputed that the applicants all lived in Boydaş village until 1994. Although they did not have registered property, they either had their own houses constructed on the lands of their ascendants or lived in the houses owned by their fathers and cultivated the land belonging to the latter. The Court further notes that the applicants had unchallenged rights over the common lands in the village, such as the pasture, grazing and the forest land, and that they earned their living from stockbreeding and tree-felling.

It was further noted in the Human Rights Report Turkey that in 1995 the practice of evacuation of villages and hamlets had continued. Many houses in the villages were either destroyed or made uninhabitable. People were forced to emigrate from the region. Pressure was exerted on the inhabitants until they left their villages.

As to the cause of the movement of the population, the Turkish authorities maintained that the movement was not caused by the violence in the region alone. They contended that economic factors also accounted for the “migration”. The report, recognising the situation of internal displacement due to the conflict in the region, confirmed the Government ’ s stand point. However, it pointed out that there was no doubt that there had been a major displacement and migration to towns affecting those caught in the crossfire of the conflict: on the one hand Turkish security forces had targeted villages suspected of supporting the PKK. On the other hand the PKK had assassinated inhabitants of the villages “collaborating” with the State authorities (i.e. belonging to the village guards system) or refusing to support the PKK.

However, the first returns had occurred in 1997, as the region had not been secure before the latter date. Despite obvious improvements, security remained the main concern conditioning mass return movements. On the one hand, the authorities felt reluctant to allow for a large influx of returnees fearing the return of PKK militants. For that reason, they scrutinize every application and did not authorize returns to certain areas. On the other hand, the displaced population was in most cases unable to return without state financial or subsistence assistance and sometimes reluctant because of fresh memory of the atrocities committed in the past. Nevertheless, the South Eastern Anatolia Project (GAP), which is a comprehensive development programme aimed at the ending of the disparities between this region and the rest of the country, financed a number of projects concerning the return and resettlement of displaced persons. Among them was the “town-villages project”, which, through the construction of centralised villages, had allowed 4,000 displaced persons to return to their region. According to the official figures, approximately 28,000 persons had returned to 200 villages up to July 2001. Even so, a number of human rights organisations were critical of the Government ’ s efforts since the application forms for those who wished to return included a question concerning the reason for leaving the village. According to these organisations, displaced persons were not allowed to return unless they gave the actions of the PKK as a reason. Furthermore, there had been allegations that return was authorised only to the villages within the village guard system."

He further reported the concerns regarding the plan of a new centralised settlement pattern, as opposed to the traditional pattern of one large settlement (village) surrounded by smaller settlements (hamlets). Mr Deng noted that, although establishing security in the region through promoting centralised settlement units was a legitimate policy, the authorities should consult the displaced themselves.

However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, §§ 65-69, and Menteş and Others v.

In this regard, the Court points out that under the emergency rules then in force the governor of the state of emergency region was the hierarchical superior of the aforementioned two authorities who exercised powers delegated to them and implemented the decisions taken by the governor of the state-of-emergency region (see paragraph 80 above). Taking all these elements together, it considers that it is understandable if the applicants formed the belief that, having received negative answers from the local authorities who exercised emergency powers at the time, it was pointless for them to attempt to secure satisfaction through the administrative courts (see, mutatis mutandis, Selçuk and Asker v.

The Court further notes that the Government referred to cases which concerned the award of compensation by the administrative courts to plaintiffs who had brought actions as a result of damage they had suffered due to the lack of security in the state of emergency region and their inability to have access to their property (see paragraphs 49 and 50 above). Undoubtedly, these decisions illustrate the real possibility of obtaining compensation before these courts in respect of damage sustained on account of the disturbances or acts of terrorism in the region. However, as the Court has constantly held in similar cases, despite the extent of village destruction or evacuation in the state of emergency region, there appears to be no example of compensation having been awarded in respect of allegations that villagers have been forcibly evicted from their homes and that property has been deliberately destroyed by members of the security forces or of prosecutions having been brought against those forces as a result of such allegations (see, mutatis mutandis, Selçuk and Asker, cited above, § 68, and Gündem v. Turkey, judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1131, § 60). On that account, the Court points out that in the cases referred to by the Government, the administrative courts awarded compensation on the basis of the doctrine of social risk, which is not dependent on proof of fault. Thus, under Turkish law an administrative law action is a remedy based on the strict liability of the State, in particular for the illegal acts of its agents, whose identification is not, by definition, a prerequisite to bringing an action of this nature."

                "106. For the Court, however, when an individual formulates an arguable claim in respect of forced eviction and destruction of property involving the responsibility of the State, the notion of an “effective remedy”, in the sense of Article 13 of the Convention, entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access by the complainant to the investigative procedure (see Menteş and Others v. Turkey, cited above, p. 2715, § 89). Otherwise, if an action based on the State ’ s strict liability were to be considered a legal action that had to be exhausted in respect of complaints under Article 8 of the Convention or Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the State ’ s obligation to pursue those guilty of such serious breaches might thereby disappear."

As regards a civil action for redress for damage sustained through illegal acts or patently unlawful conduct on the part of State agents, the Court recalls that a plaintiff must, in addition to establishing a causal link between the tort and the damage he has sustained, identify the person believed to have committed the tort (see Yaşa v. Turkey, judgment of 2 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2431, § 73). In the instant case, however, those responsible for the forced eviction of the applicants from their village are still unknown."

Accordingly, the Court does not consider that a remedy before the administrative or civil courts can be regarded as adequate and effective in respect of the applicants ’ complaints, since it is not satisfied that a determination can be made in the course of such proceedings concerning the allegations that villages were forcibly evacuated by members of the security forces.",
                "Furthermore, the Court points out that the applicants ’ complaints in the instant case essentially relate to their forced displacement and inability to return to their homes in Boydaş village, not to their inability to recover damages from the authorities."

                "109. Finally, the Court considers that a complaint to the chief public prosecutor ’ s office could in principle provide redress for the kind of violations alleged by the applicants. However, any prosecutor who receives a complaint alleging a criminal act by a member of the security forces must decline jurisdiction and transfer the file to the Administrative Council (see paragraph 86 above). On that account, the Court reiterates that it has already found in a number of cases that the investigation carried out by this body cannot be regarded as independent since it is composed of civil servants, who are hierarchically dependent on the governor, and an executive officer is linked to the security forces under investigation, (see İpek v. Turkey, no. 25760/94, § 207, 17 February 2004; Yöyler v. Turkey, no. 26973/95, § 93, 24 July 2003; and Güleç v. Turkey, no.21593/93, § 80, Reports 1998 ‑ IV). It notes in this connection that the applicants filed petitions with various administrative authorities complaining about the forced evacuation of their village by the security forces (see paragraphs 15 and 29 above). These proceedings did not result in the opening of a criminal investigation or any inquiry into the applicants ’ allegations. The Court is therefore of the opinion that the applicants were not required to make a further explicit request to this effect by filing a criminal complaint with the chief public prosecutor ’ s office as this would not have led to any different result."

In this regard, they argued that the alleged incidents could not be of a continuing nature.

In such a situation, the six-month period might be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware, or should have become aware, of these circumstances ( see Hazar and Others v.

The Court further points out that it was not until 22 July 2003 that the applicants were told that there was no obstacle to their return to their homes in Boydaş village (see paragraph 37 above). In these circumstances, the Court considers that the six-month time-limit within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention started to run on 22 July 2003 at the earliest and, consequently, that the applications were brought prior to that date, i.e. 3 December 2001.",

The Government noted in this connection that under Turkish law all transactions related to immovable property and all proof concerning ownership had to be based on records of land registry. In cases where the immovable property, such as land, was not recorded at the registry, proof of ownership had to be established in accordance with the rules set out in the Civil Code. Further, where no land survey had been conducted, a decision of a judge was necessary to provide proof of ownership. Finally, the Government stressed that the statements of the mayor of Boydaş village (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above) had no evidential value as such unless they had been admitted as evidence by a national judge in a case which concerned the ownership of land or the ownership of movable property such as livestock."

They noted that in the rural area where they lived the patriarchal family system prevailed, wherein adults married, built houses on their fathers ’ land and made use of their fathers ’ property as a natural requirement of the social system. In that connection, the applicants argued that “property rights” should not be regarded as exclusively covering property which was registered under a personal title, but should include all the economic resources jointly enjoyed by all the villagers.

Relying on the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, they also claimed that the statements given by the mayor of Boydaş village (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above) should be taken into account with a view to proving that they had been using their ascendants ’ registered and unregistered property in accordance with the local traditions and that they had been earning their living from stockbreeding and forestry."

The Netherlands, judgment of 23 February 1995, Series A no. 306-B, p. 46, § 53, and Matos e Silva, Lda., and Others v. Portugal, judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports 1996 -IV, p. 1111, § 75)."

In this regard, the Court notes that it is undisputed that the applicants all lived in Boydaş village until 1994. Although they did not have registered property, they either had their own houses constructed on the lands of their ascendants or lived in the houses owned by their fathers and cultivated the land belonging to the latter. The Court further notes that the applicants had unchallenged rights over the common lands in the village, such as the pasture, grazing and the forest land, and that they earned their living from stockbreeding and tree-felling.

In this connection, the Court notes that despite the applicants ’ persistent demands, the authorities refused any access to Boydaş village until 22 July 2003 on the ground of terrorist incidents in and around the village (see paragraphs 15, 17 and 18 above). These disputed measures deprived the applicants of all resources from which they derived their living.

The first rule, which is set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose. However, the rules are not “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, inter alia, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, pp. 29-30, § 37, which partly reiterates the terms of the Court ’ s reasoning in Sporrong and Lönnroth v.

The measures did not amount to control of the use of property either since they did not pursue such an aim. The Court considers therefore that the situation of which the applicants complain falls to be dealt with under the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 since the impugned measures undoubtedly restricted the applicants ’ rights to use and dispose of their possessions ( Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, § 187, ECHR 2001-IV).",

The applicants asserted that the impugned measures had a legal basis in domestic law in that the governor of the state-of-emergency region could order the permanent or temporary evacuation of villages and impose residence restrictions pursuant to Article 4 (h) of Decree no. 285 and Article 1 (b) of Decree no. 430 in force at the relevant time (see paragraph 82 above). They argued however that the state-of-emergency governor ’ s office had employed illegal methods to depopulate the region rather than relying on the aforementioned provision. In their opinion, the motive behind this choice was to blame the illegal organisations, such as the PKK and the TİKKO ( Workers and Peasants ’ Independence Army of Turkey ), for village evacuations, to avoid the economic burden of re-housing the population and to grant impunity to the security forces for their illegal acts."

They asserted that the “return to village and rehabilitation project” had been developed by the authorities to remedy the problems of those who had had to leave their homes on account of the terrorist incidents in the region (see paragraphs 45-48 above). The aim of this project was to ensure the voluntary return of the displaced population. Thus, its implementation had been subjected to the strict control of Parliament (see paragraphs 39-42 above). The Government had also obtained the support of several international agencies to assist in the successful implementation of this project (see paragraph 44 above). Despite budgetary restraints and serious economic difficulties, the Government had spent approximately sixty million euros within the context of this project. An important amount of this money had been used for improvement of the infrastructure in the region. The progress achieved so far had been positive and encouraging given the fact that 94,000 persons, which was approximately 25% of the total number of displaced persons, had already returned to their settlement units between June 2000 and December 2003."

Against this background, the Government concluded that the measures taken by the authorities had been proportionate to the aims pursued."

The Court recognises that the interference complained of in the instant case did not lack a basis. As noted above, armed clashes, generalised violence and human rights violations, specifically within the context of the PKK insurgency, compelled the authorities to take extraordinary measures to maintain security in the state of emergency region. These measures involved, among others, the restriction of access to several villages, including Boydaş, as well as evacuation of some villages on the ground of the lack of security. However, it observes that in the circumstances of the case the refusal of access to Boydaş had serious and harmful effects that have hindered the applicants ’ right to enjoyment of their possessions for almost ten years, during which time they have been living in other areas of the country in conditions of extreme poverty, with inadequate heating, sanitation and infrastructure (see paragraphs 14, 57 and 63 above). Their situation was compounded by a lack of financial assets, having received no compensation for deprivation of their possessions, and the need to seek employment and shelter in overcrowded cities and towns, where unemployment levels and housing facilities have been described as disastrous (see paragraph 63 above)."

In this connection, it points out that the return to village and rehabilitation project referred to by the Government has not been converted into practical steps to facilitate the return of the applicants to their village. According to the visual records of 29 December 2003, Boydaş village seems to be in ruins and without any infrastructure (see paragraph 38 above). Besides the failure of the authorities to facilitate return to Boydaş, the applicants have not been provided with alternative housing or employment. Furthermore, apart from the aid given to Mr Kazım Balık and Mr Müslüm Yılmaz by the Social Aid and Solidarity Fund, which in the Court ’ s opinion is insufficient to live on, the applicants have not been supplied with any funding which would ensure an adequate standard of living or a sustainable return process. For the Court, however, the authorities have the primary duty and responsibility to establish conditions, as well as provide the means, which allow the applicants to return voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence, or to resettle voluntarily in another part of the country (see in this respect Principles 18 and 28 of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2, dated 11 February 1998).

The owners of a property adjacent to the land, Mr and Mrs Graham (“the Grahams”) occupied the land under a grazing agreement until 31 December 1983. On 30 December 1983 a chartered surveyor acting for the applicant companies wrote to the Grahams noting that the grazing agreement was about to expire and requiring them to vacate the land. In January 1984 the applicant companies refused a request for a further grazing agreement for 1984 because they anticipated seeking planning permission for the development of all or part of the land and considered that continued grazing might damage the prospects of obtaining such permission."

At the conclusion of his thirty -page judgment, Neuberger J remarked that the result he had reached did not accord with justice and could not be justified by practical considerations: the justification advanced for the right to acquire title to land by adverse possession – namely the avoidance of uncertainty – had in his view little relevance to the use of registered land where the owner was readily identifiable by inspecting the register of the relevant title at the Land Registry.

The extinction of the applicant companies ’ title was not, in his view, a deprivation of possessions nor a confiscatory measure for which payment of compensation would be appropriate, but simply a logical and pragmatic consequence of the barring of the right to bring an action after the expiration of the limitation period. In the alternative, Mummery LJ found that any deprivation was justified in the public interest, the conditions laid down in the 1980 Act being reasonably required to avoid the risk of injustice in the adjudication of stale claims and as ensuring certainty of title: those conditions were not disproportionate, the period of twelve years being reasonable and not imposing an excessively difficult burden on the landowner."

Despite Pye ’ s notification to quit the land in December 1983, its peremptory refusal of a further grazing licence in 1984 and the totally ignored later requests for a grazing licence, after 31 December 1983 the Grahams stayed in occupation of the disputed land using it for what purposes they thought fit. Some of those purposes (i. e ., the grazing) would have fallen within a hypothetical grazing agreement. But the rest are only consistent with an intention, verified by Mr Michael Graham, to use the land as they thought best. That approach was adopted from the outset. In my judgment, when the Grahams remained in factual possession of the fully enclosed land after the expiry of the mowing licence they manifestly intended to assert their possession against Pye.",
                "... Before your Lordships ’ House, it was conceded that the Human Rights Act [incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights ] did not have a retrospective effect. But Pye submitted that, even under the common- law principles of construction applicable before the Human Rights Act came into effect, the court should seek to apply the law so as to make it consistent with the [Convention]. Any such old principle of construction only applied where there was an ambiguity in the language of a statute. No such ambiguity in the Act of 1980 was demonstrated to your Lordships.”"

                "“The Grahams have acted honourably throughout. They sought rights to graze or cut grass on the land after the summer of 1984, and were quite prepared to pay. When Pye failed to respond they did what any other farmer in their position would have done: they continued to farm the land. They were not at fault. But the result of Pye ’ s inaction was that they enjoyed the full use of the land without payment for 12 years. As if that were not gain enough, they are then rewarded by obtaining title to this considerable area of valuable land without any obligation to compensate the former owner in any way at all. In the case of unregistered land, and in the days before registration became the norm, such a result could no doubt be justified as avoiding protracted uncertainty where the title to land lay. But where land is registered it is difficult to see any justification for a legal rule which compels such an apparently unjust result, and even harder to see why the party gaining title should not be required to pay some compensation at least to the party losing it. It is reassuring to learn that the Land Registration Act 2002 has addressed the risk that a registered owner may lose his title through inadvertence. But the main provisions of that Act have not yet been brought into effect, and even if they had it would not assist Pye, whose title had been lost before the passing of the Act. While I am satisfied that the appeal must be allowed for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend, this is a conclusion which I (like the judge [Neuberger J] ...) ‘ arrive at with no enthusiasm ’ .” ( JA Pye ( Oxford ) Ltd and Others v.

One example given was the position of the rights of adverse possessors (section 75(1) of the Land Registration Act 1925 was referred to).

However, adverse possession does not merely bar claims. Its effect is positive: ‘ a squatter does in the end get a title by his possession and the indirect operation of the [ Limitation Act ]. .. ’ This can only be justified by factors over and above those which explain the law on limitation. In this context it should be noted that a landowner may be barred even where he or she is quite blameless. As we have explained above, adverse possession can take place without it being readily detectable. In any event, this particular justification has much greater force in relation to unregistered land than it does for land with registered title. Unregistered title ultimately depends upon possession. It therefore behoves a landowner to be vigilant to protect that possession and not to sleep on his or her rights. ... [ w ] here title is registered, ... the basis of title is primarily the fact of registration rather than possession. Registration confers title because the registration of a person as proprietor of land of itself vests in him or her the relevant legal estate ...”",
                "(ii) Because if land and its ownership are out of kilter, the land may become unmarketable. Where the registered owner has disappeared, and cannot be traced, and a squatter takes possession, the doctrine of adverse possession “does at least ensure that in such cases land remains in commerce and is not rendered sterile”. Where there have been dealings “off the register”, such as where a farmer agrees to a land swap with a neighbour under a “gentleman ’ s agreement” but does not register the change, “adverse possession fulfils a useful function”.",
                "(iii) Because in case of mistake the innocent but mistaken squatter of land may have incurred expenditure. In such circumstances adverse possession can be justified on grounds of hardship, and there are parallels with the principles of proprietary estoppel.",
                "(iv) Because it facilitates and cheapens investigation of title to land.

Whilst accepting that in the case of unregistered land the law of adverse possession served two important public interests – namely the prevention of uncertainty and injustice arising from stale claims, and ensuring that the reality of unopposed occupation of land and its legal ownership coincided – the Chamber considered that the importance of these aims was more questionable in the case of registered land where the ownership of the land was readily identifiable by inspecting the proprietorship register of the relevant title at the Land Registry. However, the Chamber noted that, despite the major changes to the law of adverse possession made by the Land Registration Act 2002 (“the 2002 Act”), in the case of registered land the law itself had not been abolished, and it rejected the applicant companies ’ argument that it served no continuing public interest so far as registered land was concerned.

The Chamber noted criticism of the state of the law by the domestic courts and the Law Commission, and further noted that the result for the applicant companies was one of exceptional severity in that not only were they deprived of their property but they received no compensation for their loss. The lack of compensation had to be viewed in the light of the lack of procedural protection for the right of property within the legal system in force at the relevant time. In this respect the Chamber attached weight to the fact that since the present case the law had been amended to provide for notice to be given to a paper owner before title is transferred, thereby giving the paper owner an opportunity to stop the running of the limitation period. The Chamber saw the changes in the law as an indication that Parliament had recognised the deficiencies in the procedural position of registered landowners before the 2002 Act.

Secondly, they saw no justification for depriving them of the land without having to pay any compensation.

The only interference with the applicant companies ’ land came about through the actions of private individuals, the squatters, who obtained adverse possession in 1983- 8 4. The outcome of the proceedings was dictated by the applicant companies ’ own inaction. They contended that the application to the present facts of the conventional case-law as to the necessity, in principle, for compensation to be paid in respect of deprivations of property confirmed the logic of analysing the case by reference to Article 6: the purpose of a limitation period is to deprive a claimant, at the end of the relevant time period, of any opportunity of enforcing his rights through the courts.

The Court declined, in Beyeler, to determine whether the interference with the applicant ’ s property rights constituted a “deprivation of possessions”, as it sufficed to examine the situation complained of in the light of the general rule in the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 ( see Beyeler, cited above, § 106)."

Those rules provided that at the end of the limitation period, the paper owner ’ s title to unregistered land was extinguished (section 17 of the 1980 Act). In the case of registered land, the position was amended to take into account the fact that until the register was rectified, the former owner continued to appear as registered proprietor. Thus in the present case section 75(1) of the 1925 Act provided that on expiry of the limitation period the title was not extinguished, but the registered proprietor was deemed to hold the land in trust for the adverse possessor."

The provisions of the 1925 and 1980 Acts which were applied to the applicant companies were part of the general land law, and were concerned to regulate, amongst other things, limitation periods in the context of the use and ownership of land as between individuals. The applicant companies were therefore affected, not by a “deprivation of possessions” within the meaning of the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1, but rather by a “control of use” of land within the meaning of the second paragraph of the provision."

The Court accepts that to extinguish title where the former owner is prevented, as a consequence of the application of the law, from recovering possession of land cannot be said to be manifestly without reasonable foundation.

In other words, the Court must determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest and the interest of the individuals concerned. In determining whether a fair balance exists, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation, with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see AGOSI, cited above, § 52, and, for a more recent authority concerning a deprivation of possessions, Jahn and Others, cited above, § 93 ). In spheres such as housing, the Court will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation ( see Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, § 49, ECHR 1999- V ). In other contexts, the Court has underlined that it is not in theory required to settle disputes of a private nature. It can nevertheless not remain passive, in exercising the European supervision incumbent on it, where a domestic court ’ s interpretation of a legal act appeared “unreasonable, arbitrary or ... inconsistent ... with the principles underlying the Convention ” ( see Pla and Puncernau v. Andorra, no. 69498/01, § 59, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII ).

In a case concerning a dispute over the interpretation of patent law, and at the same time as noting that even in cases involving litigation between individuals and companies the State has obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to take measures necessary to protect the right of property, the Court reiterated that its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention, and not to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless Convention rights and freedoms may have been infringed ( see Anheuser-Busch Inc., cited above, § 83)."

The Chamber (at paragraph 55 of its judgment) found that the relevant provisions – section 75 of the 1925 Act in particular – went further than merely precluding the applicant companies from invoking the assistance of the courts to recover possession of their property. The Court observes that the Court of Appeal in the present case was of the view that the Grahams had not established the requisite intention to possess the land, so that time had not started to run against the applicant companies ( see paragraph 17 above). It nevertheless considered that the extinguishment of title at the end of the limitation period of an action for recovery of land was a logical and pragmatic consequence of the barring of the right to bring an action after the expiration of the limitation period. The House of Lords disavowed the Court of Appeal ’ s interpretation of the law on intention to possess, but did not comment on the suggestion that to terminate title at the end of the limitation period was “logical and pragmatic”. Even though the general position in English law is that the expiry of a limitation period bars the remedy but not the right, the Court accepts that where an action for recovery of land is statute-barred, termination of the title of the paper owner does little more than regularise the respective positions, namely to confirm that the person who has acquired title by twelve years ’ adverse possession is the owner. Moreover, the law reflected the aim of the land registration legislation, which was to replicate the preregistration law so far as practicable. As already noted above ( see paragraph 74 ), such a regime cannot be considered as “manifestly without reasonable foundation”."

The fact that the rules contained in both the 1925 and 1980 Acts had been in force for many years before the first applicant even acquired the land is nevertheless relevant to an assessment of the overall proportionality of the legislation. In particular, it is not open to the applicant companies to say that they were not aware of the legislation, or that its application to the facts of the present case came as a surprise to them.

It is in any event the case that very little action on the part of the applicant companies would have stopped time running. The evidence was that if the applicant companies had asked for rent, or some other form of payment, in respect of the Grahams ’ occupation of the land, it would have been forthcoming, and the possession would no longer have been “adverse”. Even in the unlikely event that the Grahams had refused to leave and refused to agree to conditions for their occupation, the applicant companies need only have commenced an action for recovery, and time would have stopped running against them."

Further, in the cases in which a situation was analysed as a control of use, even though the applicant had lost possessions ( see AGOSI and Air Canada, both cited above), no mention was made of a right to compensation. The Court would note, in agreement with the Government, that a requirement of compensation for the situation brought about by a party failing to observe a limitation period would sit uneasily alongside the very concept of limitation periods, whose aim is to further legal certainty by preventing a party from pursuing an action after a certain date. The Court would also add that, even under the provisions of the 2002 Act, which the applicant companies use as confirmation that the provisions of the earlier legislation were not compatible with the Convention, no compensation is payable by a person who is ultimately registered as the new owner of registered land on expiry of the limitation period."

The Court would note here that the applicant companies were not without procedural protection. While the limitation period was running, and if they failed to agree terms with the Grahams which put an end to the “adverse possession”, it was open to them to remedy the position by bringing a court action for repossession of the land. Such an action would have stopped time running.

The 2002 Act requires, in effect, the giving of notice to a paper owner before the expiry of the limitation period, to give him time, if he wishes, to take action to deal with the adverse possessor. It improves the position of the paper owner and, correspondingly, makes it more difficult for an adverse possessor to acquire a full twelve years ’ adverse possession. The provisions of the 2002 Act do not, however, apply to the present case, and the Court must consider the facts of the case as they are.

In the present case, too, whilst it would be strained to talk of the “acquired rights” of an adverse possessor during the currency of the limitation period, it must be recalled that the registered land regime in the United Kingdom is a reflection of a long-established system in which a term of years ’ possession gave sufficient title to sell. Such arrangements fall within the State ’ s margin of appreciation, unless they give rise to results which are so anomalous as to render the legislation unacceptable. The acquisition of unassailable rights by the adverse possessor must go hand in hand with a corresponding loss of property rights for the former owner. In James and Others, the possibility of “undeserving” tenants being able to make “windfall profits” did not affect the overall assessment of the proportionality of the legislation ( see James and Others, cited above, § 69), and any windfall for the Grahams must be regarded in the same light in the present case."

                "In this instance the legislature gave the Act retrospective effect. The retrospective component of the special rules on liability introduced for pilots infringes the fundamental principle of legal certainty, according to which the content of the law must in principle be foreseeable and accessible so that those subject to the law may foresee to a reasonable degree the consequences of a given action at the moment when that action is carried out.",
                "This violation of the principle is not, in the circumstances of the case, disproportionate in relation to the general objective underlying the contested legislation. The legislature intended to preserve in the legislation on pilots the rules on liability which it had not wanted to amend in 1967 and which the case-law prior to 1983 and legal writing inferred from section 5 of the Pilots Act 1967 and sections 64 and 251 of the Shipping Act (Book II, Title II, of the Commercial Code). Moreover it took into account the considerable financial implications that would result, in a way that could not have been foreseen, for the relevant public authorities from the reversal of the case-law.",
                "In the light of all these considerations, exempting from liability the organisers of a pilot service and limiting the personal liability of pilots cannot be regarded as a failure to comply with the requirements of Articles 6 and 6 bis of the Constitution, even having regard to the retrospective effect of the Act in question.",

                "Attributing retrospective effect to a legal rule means in principle that that rule applies to legal relationships that came into being and were not definitively terminated before its entry into force; such a rule can therefore apply only to pending and future disputes and cannot bear in any way on disputes that have been concluded.",
                "According to a fundamental principle of our legal system, a judicial decision may be varied only on appeal. By applying the contested distinction so as to limit the effect of the Act with regard to the past, the legislature sought to respect that principle and did not therefore operate a distinction contrary to Articles 6 and 6 bis of the Constitution.",

On 22 November 1990 that court confirmed in substance its judgment of 5 July 1990 (see paragraph 7 above).",
                "Accordingly, on 19 April 1991, the Court of Cassation dismissed the twenty-fifth applicant's appeal on points of law. Reproducing the reply given by the Court of Arbitration to its question for a preliminary ruling, it dismissed a first submission according to which the retrospective effect of the 1988 Act infringed the former Articles 6 and 6 bis of the Constitution. It then declared inadmissible the submission based on an alleged violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), after noting that the twenty-fifth applicant had not invoked that provision (P1-1) in the Court of Appeal. Finally, it rejected the submission that, by taking effect in respect of proceedings that were in progress, the 1988 Act prevented the courts from deciding the disputes as brought before them, contrary to the principles of the independence of the courts and equality of arms between the parties. The Court of Cassation held as follows:",

A retrospective law applicable to pending disputes, even where the State is a party to the dispute, does not impair the judge's independence in carrying out his task and accomplishing his duty. Any pressure brought to bear on a judge by such a law is no different from the pressure that all laws exert on him. The fact that the judgment applies such a law does not constitute a violation of the right to a fair hearing of the case by an independent tribunal.\"",

The application to have the Act declared void lodged with the Court of Arbitration had not rendered such proceedings superfluous, because complaints based on the violation of provisions of international law taken separately fell outside the jurisdiction of that court (see paragraph 19 above).

                "5. Flats represented nearly 20 % of the pre-war housing stock of Bosnia and Herzegovina [1] (around 250,000 housing units out of 1, 315 ,000 ). By local standards, they were a particularly attractive type of home, equipped with modern conveniences and located in urban centres. Practically all flats were under the regime of “social ownership” – a concept which, while it does exist in other countries, was particularly highly developed in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (“the SFRY”). They were generally built by socially owned enterprises or other public bodies for allocation to their employees, who became “ occupancy right holders ” [2]. All citizens of the SFRY were required to pay a means-tested contribution to subsidise housing construction. However, the amount an individual had contributed was not amongst the legal criteria taken into account in the waiting lists for allocation of such flats."
            ],
            [
                "6. The rights of both the allocation right holders ( public bodies which nominally controlled the flats) and the occupancy right holders were regulated by law (the Housing Act 1984, which is still in force in Bosnia and Herzegovina [3] ). In accordance with this Act, an occupancy right, once allocated, entitled the occupancy right holder to permanent, lifelong use of the flat against the payment of a nominal fee. When occupancy right holders died, their rights transferred, as a matter of right, to their surviving spouses (indeed, spouses held occupancy rights in common) or registered members of their family households who were also using the flat (sections 19 and 21 of this Act). In practice, these provisions on transfer meant that occupancy rights originally allocated by public bodies to their employees could pass, as of right, to multiple generations for whom the initial employment-based link to the allocation right holder no longer existed. Occupancy rights could be cancelled only in court proceedings (section 50 of this Act) on limited grounds (sections 44, 47 and 49 of this Act), the most important of which was failure by the occupancy right holders to physically use their flats for their own housing needs for a continuous period of at least six months, without justified grounds (such as, military service, medical treatment, prison sentence, or temporary work elsewhere in the SFRY or abroad ). Although inspections were foreseen to ensure compliance with this requirement (section 42 of this Act), occupancy rights were rarely, if ever, cancelled on these grounds prior to the 1992-95 war. Moreover, on 24 December 1992 the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina annulled the inspection provisions [4]."

            [
                "7. Following its declaration of independence on 6 March 1992, a brutal war started in Bosnia and Herzegovina. More than 2.2 million people left their homes as a consequence of “ethnic cleansing” or generalised violence. As a rule, they fled to areas controlled by their own ethnic groups. All parties to the conflict quickly adopted procedures allowing the flats of those who had fled the territory under their control to be declared “abandoned” and allocated to new occupancy right holders. While the alleged rationale for the allocation of “abandoned” properties was to provide humanitarian shelter to displaced persons, particularly attractive properties – typically urban flats – were commonly awarded to the military and political elites. In some cases, occupancy rights were cancelled pursuant to the aforementioned section 47 of the Housing Act 1984, because of failure by the occupancy right holders to use their flats for a continuous period of at least six months. In most cases, however, the authorities applied legislation specially enacted for those purposes : the Abandoned Flats Act 1992 [5], the Abandoned Flats Decree 1993 [6], the Refugee Accommodation Decree 1993 [7], the Refugee Accommodation Act 1995 [8] and the Abandoned Property Act 1996 [9]."

Pursuant to that Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of two Entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. In the immediate aftermath of the war, legislation on abandoned property remained in force in both Entities and reallocation of flats continued nearly unabated, which further reinforced ethnic separation."

Initially, however, in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina only those who could prove that they were genuine refugees or displaced persons were entitled to return to their pre-war homes (former section 3(2) of the Restitution of Flats Act 1998 [11] ). The vague terms of this provision left broad discretion to the housing authorities and reportedly led to abuses. The High Representative [12] therefore repealed it in July 1999. Nevertheless, as a result of strong resistance of the military of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (see decision CH/97/60 et al. of the Human Rights Chamber of 7 December 2001, § 56), a similar restriction remained in force as regards military flats (section 3a of this Act). While this was done on the pretext of creating a pool of flats which could be used to house destitute war veterans and their families, the domestic Human Rights Chamber held that there was no evidence that the property was necessarily being used for this stated purpose (see, for example, its decision CH/97/60 et al. of 7 December 2001, § 154). The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe maintained, in its third-party submissions to that Chamber, that many high-ranking military officials in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina whose housing needs were otherwise met had nevertheless been allocated military flats, in direct contravention of domestic legislation, and that the Ministry of Defence of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina had almost 2,000 unclaimed military flats at its disposal to pursue the legitimate aim of housing war veterans without the need to reach out for claimed ones (see decision CH/02/8202 et al. of the Human Rights Chamber of 4 April 2003, § 121; see also the High Representative's submissions in decision CH/97/60 et al. of the Human Rights Chamber of 7 December 2001, § 61 )."

The Decree was respected in what is today the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and those who had purchased military flats located in that Entity could not register their ownership and remained, strictly speaking, occupancy right holders ( a purchase contract does not of itself transfer title to the buyer under domestic law).

Having established the excessive length of the restitution proceedings, the Human Rights Commission held that they did not constitute an effective remedy which would have to be used as a condition for the examination of the applicant's substantive complaints. In accordance with domestic jurisprudence, it considered that although the purchase contract of 9 March 1992 had not of itself transferred title to the impugned flat to the applicant, it had conferred on him valuable personal rights (that is, the rights to occupy the flat and to be registered as owner ) amounting to “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. The Human Rights Commission further held that the situation complained of (that is, the applicant's inability to repossess the flat and to register his title to it) undoubtedly amounted to a continuing interference with the peaceful enjoyment of his “possessions”. While assessing the proportionality of the interference, the Human Rights Commission held that the applicant's service in the VJ forces after the 1992-95 war demonstrated his disloyalty to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Taking into consideration also the serious shortage of housing units and compensation to which the applicant was entitled, the Human Rights Commission concluded that the interference was justified.

First, those who served in foreign armed forces after the 1992-95 war. Since those who were granted a refugee or equivalent status in a country outside the former SFRY are exempted, the restriction affects only those who served in the forces of the successor States of the SFRY and, in reality, almost exclusively those who served in the VJ forces referred to in paragraph 15 above. The second category is those who acquired an occupancy or equivalent right to a military flat in a successor State of the SFRY. At present, people falling into those categories are only entitled to the refund of the amount paid for their flats in 1991/92 plus interest at the rate applicable to overnight deposits (see section 39e of the Privatisation of Flats Act 1997, as amended on 11 July 2006). Previously the compensation was calculated differently : the value of a flat was to first be calculated at a rate of approximately EUR 300 per square metre, the age of the flat was to then be taken into consideration with the depreciation of 1% of its value for each year [24]."

The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among other authorities, Iatridis v.

While this situation resembles a de facto expropriation ( Papamichalopoulos and Others, cited above), the Court does not consider it necessary to rule on whether the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 applies in this case. As noted above, the situation envisaged in the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 is only a particular instance of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property as guaranteed by the general rule set forth in the first sentence. The Court therefore considers that it should examine the situation complained of in the light of that general rule ( Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 106, ECHR 2000 ‑ I).

Moreover, it should be reiterated that the various rules incorporated in this Article are not distinct in the sense of being unconnected (see paragraph 55 above). One of the effects of this is that the existence of a “public interest” required under the second sentence, or the “general interest” referred to in the second paragraph, are in fact corollaries of the principle set forth in the first sentence, so that an interference with the exercise of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 must also pursue an aim in the public interest."

In this regard, the Court notes that there is no indication that the applicant participated, as part of the VJ forces, in any military operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, let alone in any war crimes. He is treated differently merely because of his service in those forces. It is well known that the nature of the recent war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was such that service in certain armed forces was to a large extent indicative of one's ethnic origin. The ARBH forces, loyal to the central authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina were, despite some notable exceptions, mostly made up of Bosniacs [27]. The same is true for the HVO (mostly made up of Croats) and VRS forces (mostly made up of Serbs). Similar patterns are noted in the neighbouring countries. Accordingly, the contested measures, although apparently neutral, have the effect of treating people differently on the ground of their ethnic origin. The Court has held in comparable situations that, as a matter of principle, no difference in treatment which is based exclusively or to a decisive extent on a person's ethnic origin is capable of being objectively justified in a contemporary democratic society (see Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 27996/06 and 34836/06, § 44, 22 December 2009; D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 176, ECHR 2007 ‑ XII; and Timishev v. Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, § 58, ECHR 2005 ‑ XII )."
            ],
            [
                "61. Secondly, the respondent Government argued that the contested measures were justified in view of the scarce housing space and a pressing need to accommodate destitute members of the ARBH forces and their families in the aftermath of the 1992-95 war. However, they have failed to demonstrate that thus freed housing space was indeed used to accommodate those who were deserving of protection. Neither the statistics provided by the respondent Government within the context of this case nor those to which the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina referred in its decision U 83/03 of 22 September 2004, § 21, are of any assistance. They simply confirmed that most military flats were allocated to war veterans, war invalids and families of killed members of the ARBH forces, without indicating their housing situation or their income. Moreover, according to reliable reports ( mentioned in paragraph 10 above) many high-ranking officials whose housing needs had otherwise been met were nevertheless allocated military flats."
            ],
            [
                "62. Thirdly, as regards the possibility for the applicant to acquire a tenancy right in Serbia, it is noted that he has not been allocated a flat. In addition, he can only acquire a tenancy right of limited duration (see paragraph 41 above), which the Supreme Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina does not consider to be equivalent to occupancy right for the purposes of the restitution legislation (see paragraph 40 above)."
            ],
            [
                "63. Fourthly, the Court has not overlooked the fact that the Privatisation of Flats Act 1997 envisages compensation (see paragraph 37 above). The respondent Government assessed that the applicant should receive around EUR 10,750, but they based their assessment on criteria which were no longer in force. Since 11 July 2006 the applicant has only been entitled to a refund of the amount actually paid for the flat plus interest at the rate applicable to overnight deposits ( that is, less than EUR 3,500). The Court agrees with the respondent Government that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances, but neither of the amounts mentioned above is reasonably related to the market value of the impugned flat ( see James and Others, cited above, § 54; Pincová and Pinc v. the Czech Republic, no. 36548/97, § 53, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII; and Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § § 9 5 -97, ECHR 2006 ‑ V ). While it is true that even a total lack of compensation can be regarded as justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in exceptional circumstances, the Court does not consider the circumstances of the present case to be such ( contrast Jahn and Others, cited above, § 117, concerning land acquired under the land reform implemented from 1945 in the Soviet Occupied Zone of Germany and continued after 1949 in the GDR)."
            ],
            [
                "64. Lastly, the Court has noted that, strictly speaking, the applicant is neither a refugee (because of his Serbian nationality) nor an internally displaced person ( because he left the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina ). While it is true that international principles on housing and property restitution for refugees and displaced persons apply equally to “other similarly situated displaced persons who fled across national borders but who may not meet the legal definition of refugee ” (see Pinheiro Principle 1.2, cited in paragraph 44 above), it is uncertain whether the applicant could be considered to have “fled” Sarajevo within the meaning of that provision (see paragraphs 52 - 53 above). In any event, the Court does not consider it necessary to answer that question, because the reasons set out in paragraphs 60 - 63 above are sufficient to find a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",

Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 31107/96, § 32, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI ). Since the present applicant expressly agreed to compensation in lieu of restitution (see paragraph 70 above), the Court considers that the respondent Government should pay him the current value of the disputed flat ( compare Demopoulos and Others, cited above ). It is noted that the parties disagreed about the amount of that compensation. Having regard to the information available to it on prices on the Sarajevo property market (see, by analogy, Brumărescu, cited above, § 24), the Court assesses the current market value of the flat at EUR 60,000. Accordingly, it awards the applicant EUR 60,000 under this head, plus any tax that may be chargeable.

Poland (dec.), no. 52595/99, 28 June 2001 ). In particular, the mere fact that the State, through its judicial system, provided a forum for the determination of such a private-law dispute does not give rise to an interference by the State with property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, Kuchař and Štis v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 37527/97, 21 October 1998).The State may be held responsible for losses caused by such determinations if court decisions are not given in accordance with domestic law or if they are flawed by arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, Vulakh and Others v. Russia, no. 33468/03, § 44, 10 January 2012). However, it should be borne in mind that the Court ’ s jurisdiction to verify that domestic law has been correctly interpreted and applied is limited, and it is not its function to take the place of the national courts.

The two other defendants in the case were H. Ltd and G.-T. Ltd, companies to which K.K. had ceded 100% of his shares in Rustavi 2 by virtue of share-purchase agreements dated 26 December 2005 and 17 November 2006 (see paragraphs 1 5 and 1 7 above)."

Ltd, K.K. claimed that he had been coerced into selling his shares in the company to those companies by the leaders of the then governing party, UNM. He claimed that, as the then President Saakashvili had been dissatisfied with the editorial policy of Rustavi 2, he had summoned K.K. into his office and ordered him to cede his shares in the company to the two above-mentioned companies, which had been owned by trusted people from the President ’ s entourage. President Saakashvili had threatened K.K. by saying that the State would create problems for him and his family in the event that he refused to cooperate. Subsequently, K.K. had met with a number of other high-ranking State officials, such as the Minister of the Interior and the Chief Public Prosecutor, and they had all told him to comply with the President ’ s instruction. Consequently, K.K. had had no other choice but to sell his shares in the company to the other two companies under share-purchase agreements dated 26 December 2005 and 17 November 2006 for the total price of GEL 571,400 ( approximately EUR 214,000). That price, which had been imposed on K.K. by the State, had been far below the actual value of the television channel. In his claim, K.K. thus requested that the impugned agreements be declared null and void ab initio for having been concluded in contravention of legal order and good morals and/or under duress, in accordance with Article 54 and/or 85 of the Civil Code (see paragraphs 18 3 and 18 6 below)."

In that connection, K.K. also submitted that, when residing in Germany, he had lodged, through his lawyers, a criminal complaint with the Chief Public Prosecutor ’ s Office on 1 December 2008 (“the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008”), exposing in detail all the circumstances surrounding the threats that he had received from the then President Saakashvili and certain other high-ranking State officials.

The investigation had been commenced immediately on the charge of intentional infliction of injury of a less serious nature (Article 118 § 1 of the Criminal Code ). As the offence was classified as a less serious one under domestic legislation, and taking into account the age (seventy-five years old) and state of health of the offender as well as the interests of her grand-daughter, the investigative authorities decided, before charging the woman, to allow time for reconciliation with the victim.

According to information he had received from the lawyers, he knew that the impugned act had been committed by his mother as a result of justified emotional strain, since the victim – her son-in-law – had verbally harassed her on a regular basis. He also knew that, given the petty nature of the offence in question, the proceedings would probably be concluded with the ordering of victim-offender mediation."

As confirmed by the transcript of the hearings, the second, third and fourth applicants had the possibility to freely challenge all the evidence adduced by the claimant, including the auditor ’ s expert opinion assessing the market value of Rustavi 2 (see paragraph 7 6 above) and Rustavi 2 ’ s balance sheets on which the opinion had been based, and were able to question the auditor in person.

In arriving at that conclusion, the judge cited the following. Firstly, he noted that one of the legal grounds for lodging the claim for annulment of the impugned agreements had been Article 85 of the Civil Code on the basis of duress (see paragraphs 7 5 above). However, the judge observed that the claimant had failed to substantiate duress with sufficient evidence. Thus, although K.K. had lodged the criminal complaints, including that of 1 December 2008, regarding the loss of his business interests as a result of alleged pressure from the then President of Georgia, the mere fact of lodging those complaints, without the investigation having established any concrete facts, such as the actual use of threats or violence against K.K., could not be taken by the civil courts as proof of duress. Judge T.U. thus concluded that the claimant had failed to discharge the burden of proof."

                "111. Since the facts as presented by the claimants were not sufficient for the purposes of Article 85 of the Civil Code, Judge T.U. decided to assess the validity of the share-purchase agreements of 26 December 2005 and 17 November 2006 under Article 54 of the Civil Code, the other legal grounds relied on by K.K. in his statement of claim (see paragraph 7 5 above), by assessing whether or not the contracts could be found to be unenforceable on the grounds of public policy (see paragraph 18 3 below). In that connection, the judge referred to a State auditor ’ s expert opinion dated 9 September 2015 which had established that, using an asset-based valuation method ( აქტივებზე დაფუძნებული მეთოდი ) the value of Rustavi 2 – the company as such together with all its assets and liabilities – in 2005-06 had been approximately GEL 7,322,686 (approximately EUR 2,727,041). However, since the claimant had given up the company under the impugned share-purchase agreements for, overall, as little as GEL 571,400 (approximately EUR 212,766), that significant price difference itself meant that the contracts contradicted sound reason, ethical and equitable principles and public policy considerations. The judge also stated that the available case -file material did not confirm that even the derisory price stipulated in the impugned purchase agreements – GEL 571,400 – had in actual fact been paid to K.K. by G.-T. Ltd and H. Ltd."
            ],
            [
                "112. The judge attached further significance to the fact that, after having acquired Rustavi 2 shares by virtue of the above-mentioned share-purchase agreements, G.-T. Ltd and H. Ltd had further disposed of those shares in very short periods of time, fourteen days and nine months respectively, at almost the same price for which they had been purchased from K.K. All those circumstances clearly suggested that neither of the two purchasers had ever been genuinely interested in acquiring and running the television company, and moreover that media had never formed part of their ordinary business activities. All in all, and particularly given the manifest difference between the value of the ceded property and the derisory payment received in exchange, the judge concluded that the share-purchase agreements of 26 December 2005 and 17 November 2006 had been illusory, entered into in disregard of various public considerations, and were unenforceable under Article 54 of the Civil Code. That being so, those agreements were also void ab initio, which entailed the extinguishment of all possible legal consequences relating to the conclusion of the defective agreements, pursuant to Article 61 § 1 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 18 4 below). In the light of the above factual findings, and noting that there were no specific statutory time-limits in relation to claims concerning ab initio void contracts, the judge decided to apply the general statute of limitations of ten years under Article 128 § 3 of the Civil Code."

            [
                "113. The judge then continued by noting that it was legitimate for the shares in the company in the current owners ’ possession to be retrieved in favour of K.K., given that they could not be considered bona fide purchasers. In that connection, the judge firstly noted that the third applicant, who had always run various businesses with his brother ( the fourth applicant ), had been the authorised representative of a company which had bought Rustavi 2 from G.-T. Ltd on 1 December 2006, that is to say only fourteen days after G.-T. Ltd had obtained the property from K.K. (see paragraphs 1 7 and 1 9 above ). In other words, the third and fourth applicants had known about the derisory price for which K.K. had given up the television company, and thus should have realised that they had been acquiring property which had been clearly tainted. In that regard, the judge relied on Article 187 § 2 of the Civil Code, in accordance with which a third-party acquirer of movable property, such as shares in the company, could not be considered a bona fide owner if the property in question had been misappropriated from the original owner. In his reasoning, Judge T.U. also referred to the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008 as well as the follow-up criminal complaints lodged by K.K. with the Chief Public Prosecutors Office in 2008 - 09, by which the latter had brought the authorities ’ attention to the wrongful acts committed against him. The judge considered that the existence of those criminal complaints should have rebutted the presumption of regularity of any subsequent transfers of Rustavi 2 shares in the eyes of the relevant domestic authorities."

The applicants mainly argued that Judge T.U., in his injunction order, had not sufficiently explained whether the freezing of the company ’ s own assets and the owners ’ shares in that company had been truly necessary. The judge had not elaborated on why it had not been possible to proceed with an examination of the property dispute on the merits without applying such drastic measures against the television company and its owners. The applicants complained of the disproportionate and sweeping nature of the interim measures applied, measures which had clearly interfered with their property interests. They feared that the actual result of the impugned measures would be the opposite of what the first-instance judge had allegedly pursued. Without being able to manage its various movable and immovable assets freely and fully, the television company could suffer serious financial setbacks, which would have an adverse impact on its ability to perform its media activities with the requisite independence. In that connection, the applicants specified certain particular aspects of doing business in the media sector, such as, for instance, the seasonality of media production, which created the need for maintaining permanent access to the banking sector. Citing the relevant case-law of the Constitutional Court of Georgia and the Strasbourg Court, all four applicants referred to both the company ’ s various proprietary interests as well as the first applicant ’ s right to impart information under Article 10 of the Convention."

In its reasoning, the appellate court began by stating that the standard of proof in interlocutory proceedings was always lower than that normally applied by a civil court to the merits of a property dispute. Thus, it was not necessary to address the necessity of the applied interim measures from the standpoint of preponderance of evidence. Rather, in the appellate court ’ s view, it was sufficient to establish that a prima facie situation existed militating in favour of an interim measure. In that connection, the Court of Appeal referred to the history of numerous transfers of Rustavi 2 shares from one private party to another within very short periods of time (see paragraphs 10 -2 8 above). Given the ease with which the television company had changed hands in the past, there was a prima facie risk that another change in ownership could occur whilst the proceedings on the merits were still ongoing, something which would unduly thwart the execution of a final court decision. It stated that the legitimate aim pursued by the interim injunction of 5 August 2015 had been the need to avoid the creation of any new barriers to the enforcement of a final court decision in the future."

In that connection, the court stated that, whilst all the other freezing measures seemed reasonable, it could not comprehend the rationale behind restricting the company ’ s right to rent some of its various movable and immovable assets (see paragraph 8 5 above). That particular restriction, which did not have any relevance to the legitimate aim pursued, ought therefore to be lifted, and the television company would be allowed to rent a number of its assets for a limited but renewable period of time (thus rental contracts should not exceed three months)."

The appellate court further confirmed the appropriateness of Judge T.U. ’ s decision to apply Article 54 of the Civil Code and the general ten ‑ year statute of limitations (Article 128 § 3 of the Civil Code) to the facts of the case, and agreed that the current owners of Rustavi 2 could not be considered bona fide third-party acquirers."

However, given that Articles 198 and 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure only provided for the possibility to apply or maintain an interim injunction against an actual party to proceedings, the continued application of the freezing order against Rustavi 2 had become unlawful on 7 June 2016."

The freezing order had had a damaging impact on the television company ’ s financial sustainability, which could lead to its insolvency and the cessation of its broadcasting activities.

Specifically, in so far as Judge M.T. was concerned, the Grand Chamber stated that the applicants had failed to explain what the link between the judge ’ s personal experience and the subject-matter of the ownership dispute had been. As regards the President of the Supreme Court, the Grand Chamber firstly stated that, although N.Gv. had brought disciplinary charges against her back in 2006, this fact was irrelevant because he had not been party to the ownership dispute in question. The Grand Chamber also emphasised that the President of the Supreme Court had not examined the ownership dispute as single-judge but as a member of the collegial body composed of nine judges. The court then stated that the applicants had not presented any proof capable of showing that the President had expressed any negative statements or attitudes in respect of N.Gv. in relation to the events that had occurred more than a decade previously. The Grand Chamber further attached significance to the fact that, although the disciplinary proceedings had resulted in the President ’ s dismissal from her previous judicial post back in 2006, that disciplinary record had already been irrevocably erased and she had been able to obtain re-election to the highest judicial office in the country.

Notably, it ruled that, given the particular factual circumstances, the dispute should not have been examined with reference to Article 54 of the Civil Code, which the lower courts had referred to, but rather in accordance with Article 85 of the Civil Code. Indeed, the essence of K.K. ’ s civil claim was proving that he had been coerced into giving up the television channel by signing the share-purchase agreements of 26 December 2005 and 17 November 2006 because of threats from high-ranking State officials, such as the President of Georgia, the Minister of the Interior and the Chief Public Prosecutor. The Supreme Court stated that examining the ownership dispute through the lens of Article 85 of the Civil Code did not involve a need for establishment of any new factual findings. On the contrary, the cassation instance specified, by reference to its previous case-law, that “duress was not a matter of fact but of legal evaluation”, stating that “ the lower courts had erred in their legal evaluation of the factual description of duress.”"

In K.K. ’ s case, since the duress had been the pressure exerted upon him by high-ranking State officials of the former UNM government, such a situation had lasted until the change in the ruling forces brought about by the results of the parliamentary election of October 2012. However, even prior to the change in the ruling forces, a fact which could have triggered the running of a statutory limitation period of one year under Article 89 of the Civil Code, K.K. had already exercised his right to repudiate as void the relevant share-purchase agreements by lodging a criminal complaint on 1 December 2008 regarding the misappropriation of his property by high-ranking State officials."

That being so, the Grand Chamber concluded that, by lodging the criminal complaint regarding the misappropriation of his property by the State machinery with the prosecuting authority on 1 December 2008, K.K. had done nothing else but voice his claim over Rustavi 2. Consequently, it had been on 1 December 2008 that K.K. had interrupted, under Article 138 of the Civil Code, the running of the statutory time-limit of either one year – specifically applicable under Article 89 of the Civil Code to claims of duress within the meaning of Article 85 – or of three years – normally applicable, under Article 1008 of the Code, to all types of civil wrongs."

That being so, the burden of proving that his allegations had been untrue had shifted onto the respondents, who, in their written submissions, had failed to effectively rebut the claimant ’ s allegations.

                "225. In March 2007 the Judicial Group on Strengthening Judicial Integrity adopted the Commentary on the Bangalore Principles. Its relevant parts read as follows:",
                "“65. Outside court too, a judge should avoid deliberate use of words or conduct that could reasonably give rise to a perception of an absence of impartiality. Everything from his or her associations or business interests to remarks which the judge may consider to be ‘ harmless banter ’ may diminish the judge ’ s perceived impartiality. All partisan political activity and association should cease upon the assumption of judicial office. Partisan political activity or out of court statements concerning issues of a partisan public controversy by a judge may undermine impartiality. They may lead to public confusion about the nature of the relationship between the judiciary on the one hand and the executive and legislative branches on the other. Partisan actions and statements, by definition, involve a judge in publicly choosing one side of a debate over another. The perception of partiality will be reinforced if, as is almost inevitable, the judge ’ s activities attract criticism and/or rebuttal. In short, a judge who uses the privileged platform of judicial office to enter the partisan political arena puts at risk public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary. There are some exceptions. These include comments by a judge on an appropriate occasion defensive of the judicial institution, or explaining particular issues of law or decisions to the community or to a specialized audience, or defence of fundamental human rights and the rule of law. However, even on such occasions, a judge must be careful, as far as possible, to avoid entanglements in current controversies that may reasonably be seen as politically partisan. The judge serves all people, regardless of politics or social viewpoints. That is why the judge must endeavour to maintain the trust and confidence of all people, so far as that is reasonably possible. ...",
                "67. The potential for conflict of interest arises when the personal interest of the judge (or of those close to him or her) conflicts with the judge ’ s duty to adjudicate impartially. Judicial impartiality is concerned both with impartiality in fact and impartiality in the perception of a reasonable observer. In judicial matters, the test for conflict of interest must include both actual conflicts between the judge ’ s self-interest and the duty of impartial adjudication and circumstances in which a reasonable observer would (or might) reasonably apprehend a conflict. For example, although members of a judge ’ s family have every right to be politically active, the judge should recognize that such activities of close family members may, even if erroneously, sometimes adversely affect the public perception of the judge ’ s impartiality. ...",
                "69. A judge should discourage members of the judge ’ s family from engaging in dealings that would reasonably appear to exploit the judge ’ s judicial position. This is necessary to avoid creating an appearance of exploitation of office or favouritism and to minimize the potential for disqualification. ...",
                "81. The generally accepted criterion for disqualification is the reasonable apprehension of bias. Different formulae have been applied to determine whether there is an apprehension of bias or prejudgment. These have ranged from ‘ a high probability ’ of bias to ‘ a real likelihood ’, ‘ a substantial possibility ’, and ‘ a reasonable suspicion ’ of bias. The apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable, fair minded and informed persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. The test is ‘ what would such a person, viewing the matter realistically and practically – and having thought the matter through – conclude. Would such person think that it is more likely than not that the judge, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly ’? The hypothetical reasonable observer of the judge ’ s conduct is postulated in order to emphasize that the test is objective, is founded in the need for public confidence in the judiciary, and is not based purely upon the assessment by other judges of the capacity or performance of a colleague. ...",
                "90. Depending on the circumstances, a reasonable apprehension of bias might be thought to arise (a) if there is personal friendship or animosity between the judge and any member of the public involved in the case; (b) if the judge is closely acquainted with any member of the public involved in the case, particularly if that person ’ s credibility may be significant in the outcome of the case; (c) if, in a case where the judge has to determine an individual ’ s credibility, he had rejected that person ’ s evidence in a previous case in terms so outspoken that they throw doubt on the judge ’ s ability to approach that person ’ s evidence with an open mind on a later occasion; (d) if the judge has expressed views, particularly in the course of the hearing, on any question at issue in such strong and unbalanced terms that they cast reasonable doubts on the judge ’ s ability to try the issue with an objective judicial mind; or (e) if, for any other reason, there might be a real ground for doubting the judge ’ s ability to ignore extraneous considerations, prejudices and predilections, and the judge ’ s ability to bring an objective judgment to bear on the issues. Other things being equal, the objection will become progressively weaker with the passage of time between the event which allegedly gives rise to a danger of bias and the case in which the objection is made. ...",
                "143. The judge ’ s family, friends, and social, civic and professional colleagues with whom he or she associates regularly, communicates on matters of mutual interest or concern, and shares trust and confidence, are in a position to improperly influence, or to appear to influence, the judge in the performance of his or her judicial functions. They may seek to do so on their own account or as peddlers of influence to litigants and counsel. A judge will need to take special care to ensure that his or her judicial conduct or judgment is not even sub-consciously influenced by these relationships.”"

This is especially striking in light of the flexibility showed by the company to at least modify the order and allow the company to engage in normal, almost routine financial relations. The request was rejected based on ridiculous justification that the judgment on merits was in favour of the civil claimants.",

For instance, N[.]Gv[.] was blackmailed by the Government and requested to step aside from Rustavi 2. The so-called audit of the measurement company TV MR Georgia and amendments to the Law on Broadcasting were tailored and directed against Rustavi 2. The latter was confirmed by MP [G.][T.]",
                "The decision of Judge T[.][U.] on the appointment of temporary managers in Rustavi 2, dated November 5 2015, is probably the most vivid example. After the Constitutional Court suspended provisions on immediate enforcement and thus delayed transfer of the company to the government proxy [K.K.], Judge [T.U.] appointed temporary managers in Rustavi 2. The November 5 2015 decision demonstrates the true motives of the government: Judge [T.U] criticised the editorial policy of Rustavi 2 by saying that the company focuses on the court proceedings against it and thus endangers the right of the Georgian public to receive important information. In addition, according to the judge, while reporting on important matters for public, objective and fair standards shall be followed, which is not guaranteed under the current management. At the same time, Judge [T.U] granted unlimited authority of the temporary managers to change editorial policy, cancel the programs, dismiss and fire journalists working at the company, and exercise all managerial and representative functions.",

The scope of a case “referred to” the Court in the exercise of the right of individual application is determined by the applicant ’ s complaint or “claim” which is the term used in Article 34 of the Convention (see, as a recent authority, Radomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/12, § § 108-09, 20 March 2018, and Foti and Others v. Italy, 10 December 1982, § 44, Series A no. 56). The wording of Article 34 indicates that a “claim” or complaint in Convention terms comprises two elements, namely factual allegations and the legal arguments underpinning them. These two elements are intertwined because the facts complained of ought to be seen in the light of the legal arguments adduced and vice versa. An illustration of this intrinsic link between the factual and legal components of a complaint may be found in the Rules of Court. Thus, Rule 47 § 1 (e) and (f) of the Rules of Court provides that all applications must contain, amongst other things, a concise and legible statement of the facts and of the alleged violation(s) of the Convention and the relevant arguments. By virtue of Rule 47 § 5 ( 1 ), a failure to comply with these requirements may, under certain conditions, result in the application not being examined by the Court (see Radomilja and Others, cited above, §§ 110-11)."

However, this does not prevent an applicant from clarifying or elaborating upon his or her initial submissions during the Convention proceedings. The Court may take account not only of the original application but also of the additional documents intended to complete the latter by eliminating any initial omissions or obscurities. Likewise, the Court may clarify those facts proprio motu (see again, as a recent authority, Radomilja and Others, cited above, § § 121 and 122, and K.-H.W. v.

Ukraine, no. 39424/02, § 38, ECHR 2008, and Saghinadze and Others v. Georgia, no. 8768/05, § 72, 27 May 2010 )."

Thus, it is evident that the first applicant made its various complaints in relation to the injunction proceedings, whilst the second to fourth applicants, the owners of Rustavi 2, called into question the ownership dispute. If the first applicant wished to extend the scope of its application to the ownership dispute as well, it should have stated so in section “F” of its original application form – “Statement of alleged violation(s) of the Convention and/or Protocols and relevant arguments” – in a clear manner, similarly to what it did subsequently, in its post- notification submissions. Indeed, according to Rule 47 §§ 1 (f) and 2 (a) of the Rules of Court, when determining the nature and scope of the submitted complaints, the Court cannot be expected to have regard to any document other than the concise and legible statement of the alleged violation(s) of the Convention as described by the applicant. Thus, it was on the basis of how the first applicant itself described the alleged violations of the Convention in the relevant part of its application form that the Court, who is free to attribute to the facts of the case a characterisation in law different from that given by the applicant or, if need be, to view the facts in a different manner (see Foti and Others, cited above, § 4 4), construed the first applicant ’ s complaints as relating to the injunction proceedings and the second to fourth applicants ’ around the ownership dispute."

Thus, whilst the first applicant had called into question the injunction order of 5 August 2015, in so far as that order had frozen its various assets, the final domestic decision in that connection had been, as a matter of domestic civil procedure (see Articles 197 (1) and 419 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, cited in paragraphs 19 6 and 200 above), the Tbilisi Court of Appeal ’ s decision of 20 November 2015. That decision had finally upheld the contested injunction order. Questions relating to interim injunctions were examined only at two levels of jurisdiction, and the decision of the second and thus highest level of jurisdiction in the injunction proceedings was final and binding. The Government emphasised that that approach had been consistently restated and maintained by the Supreme Court in its case-law (see paragraphs 20 4, 20 6 -0 7, 2 10 and 21 5 above). As regards the application of 17 November 2016 that the first applicant, together with the other three applicants, had lodged with the Supreme Court under Articles 196 and 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 14 8 above), that course of action had been an inappropriate legal remedy and thus could not have stopped the running of the six-month period. In particular, the Government submitted that whilst the use of those legal provisions had been reserved only for actual parties to the proceedings, the first applicant had irrevocably lost its standing as a co ‑ respondent on 7 June 2016, when the judgment of 3 November 2015 in its part concerning the first applicant had become final upon its confirmation by the appellate instance. The first applicant had itself acknowledged at the domestic level losing its standing as a party (see paragraph 14 9 above). The Government argued that, under Article 83 of the Code of Civil Procedure, only actual parties to the proceedings could lodge applications with the domestic courts. The Government emphasised that, after the first applicant had ceased to be a co- respondent, it had not applied to become involved in the proceedings as a third party, under Articles 88-92 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In that connection, the Government brought the Court ’ s attention to the Supreme Court ’ s decision of 18 May 2018 (case no. 194-194-2018), which clearly stated that no provision in the Code of Civil Procedure could be construed to confer upon individuals and legal entities the right to address a domestic court without complying with the basic procedural requirements of access (see paragraph 21 6 above)."

The Government also submitted that the first applicant ’ s application of 17 November 2016 to lift the interim injunction of 5 August 2015 under Article 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure had moreover been ill-founded. They submitted in that connection that the contested injunction had concerned all respondents to the dispute, not just the first applicant. The imposed interim measures had thus been necessary in their totality because, even after the first applicant had ceased to be a co-respondent, the ownership dispute had continued with respect to the second, third and fourth applicants, the owners of the first applicant. That being so, the value of shares held by the owners of the company would have been at risk of diminishing and even disappearing if the company had been allowed to enter into various legal relationships as a separate legal entity. As regards the first applicant ’ s reference to Article 196 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 25 7 below), the Government reiterated that the wording of that provision made it clear that it could be relied on only by actual parties to the proceedings – either a claimant, a respondent or a third party with or without an independent claim (see their argument in paragraph 25 3 above). The Government also emphasised that, in the light of all the above-mentioned procedural shortcomings, the first applicant ’ s application of 17 November 201 6, which had represented an inappropriate legal remedy, had not been examined on the merits by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 15 1 above). In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Government concluded that first applicant ’ s application of 17 November 201 6 had represented a mere attempt to stop the running of the six - month time-limit which had otherwise started from the delivery of the Tbilisi City Court ’ s decision of 20 November 2015, the final decision, within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, with respect to the injunction proceedings.

Alternatively, the Government also suggested that the first applicant ’ s complaints concerning the injunction proceedings were inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, within the meaning of Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention. In particular, if the first applicant had considered that the injunction order of 5 August 2015 had become unlawful after it had lost the standing of a co-respondent on 7 June 2016, it should have lodged an interlocutory appeal under Articles 414 ‑ 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, requesting the lifting of the injunction by reference to Article 199 (1) of the same Code. As regards the first applicant ’ s application of 17 November 2016, the Government emphasised that, apart from lacking the relevant standing for lodging such an application, Rustavi 2 had addressed the impugned application to the wholly inappropriate domestic court. Thus, it had lodged the application with the Supreme Court, whilst the rules on lodging interlocutory appeals had made it crystal clear that such appeals should first be lodged with the court which had allegedly committed the alleged procedural breach. In particular, if the first applicant had considered that the Tbilisi Court of Appeal had omitted to discontinue the injunction measure after the termination of the copyright proceedings, the application for lifting the injunction order on the basis of Article 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure should first have been lodged with the latter court in accordance with the procedure on interlocutory appeals. In support of that argument, the Government invited the Court to take note of the relevant judicial practice of the Supreme Court. In particular in its decision of 29 December 2016 (case no. AS-806-773-2016), a copy of which has been submitted to the Court by the applicants (see paragraphs 20 7 and 20 8 above ), the Supreme Court stated that an application for the lifting of the interim measure made on the basis of Article 199 (1) ought to be lodged with the competent court and examined under Article 197 (1), 419 and 420 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the provisions that regulated the procedure for lodging interlocutory appeals.",

In particular, the first applicant argued that, taking into account the nature of the disputed injunction measure – the freezing of Rustavi 2 ’ s assets – the measure had had a significant and direct effect on the civil right at stake in the ownership dispute. In support of its position, the first applicant drew a number of parallels with the Court ’ s judgment in the case of Pekárny a cukrárny Klatovy, a.s., v. the Czech Republic ( nos. 12266/07 and 3 others, § 64 ‑ 73, 12 January 2012)."

However, the first applicant argued that the six-month time-limit should not be calculated from the final decision of 20 November 2015 because there had been two further possibilities for calling into question the injunction order of 5 August 2015. In particular, the first applicant referred to Articles 196 and 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, the two provisions that constituted the legal grounds for its application of 17 November 2016 lodged with the Supreme Court. As regards Article 196, the first applicant claimed that by virtue of that provision any entity or individual subject to an injunction – whether it was a claimant, respondent, third person or just an affected person without the status of a party to the proceedings – could apply for that interim measure to be replaced with another one. The first applicant emphasised, by reference to the Supreme Court ’ s decision of 13 November 2012 concerning civil case no. AS-1185-1114-2012 (see paragraph 20 9 above), that the right to lodge an application under Article 196 of the Code of Civil Procedure was not constrained by any time ‑ limits and depended only on a change of circumstances in the case at hand.

As regards the alternative provision for applying for the lifting of an interim injunction, Article 199 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the first applicant submitted that the cited provision had been an appropriate remedy because, following the withdrawal of the copyright claim by K.K. and the termination of the dispute with respect to the first applicant, the Tbilisi Court of Appeal had been obliged to lift the injunction freezing Rustavi 2 ’ s assets. Since that court had failed to do so, the first applicant had been allowed to lodge under Article 199 1 an appeal against the final appellate decision of 20 November 2015 with the highest judicial instance, the Supreme Court. In that connection, the first applicant claimed that the relevant domestic law and practice did not oblige it to lodge its application for the replacement or lifting of the interim measure under the procedure reserved for interlocutory appeals (whereby an appeal was first lodged with the same court that had issued a ruling negatively affecting the party ’ s rights or interests). The first applicant also asserted that the Tbilisi Court of Appeal ’ s judgment of 7 June 2016 had not been served on it. In the light of these circumstances, the first applicant claimed that it had been entitled to address its application of 17 November 2016 directly to the Supreme Court. The first applicant also stated that the exercise of the right under Article 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, similarly to that under Article 196, was not subject to any statutory limits, and therefore its application of 17 November 2016 could not be said to have been time ‑ barred."

As regards the question of whether or not the first applicant had had the requisite procedural standing for lodging an application for changing or lifting of the interim injunction under Articles 196 and 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure after it had lost its status as co-respondent, Rustavi 2 argued that it had been allowed to do so by virtue of the general rule contained in Article 2 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure which had guaranteed the right to judicial protection to everyone (see paragraph 19 2 above). In addition, the first applicant referred to the Supreme Court ’ s decision of 13 May 2016 in case no. AS-277-263-2016 to prove that under domestic law it was open even for a person not constituting a party to the civil proceedings to challenge an interim measure affecting his/her/its rights (see paragraph 20 3 above). As regards the possibility of getting involved in the proceedings in the capacity of a third party, under Articles 88-92 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 19 5 above) the first applicant claimed that lodging an application for obtaining such a procedural status would have been a futile exercise. What mattered, in the first applicant ’ s opinion, was the fact that the Supreme Court had, in actual fact, examined its application of 17 November 2016 on the merits, without acknowledging the existence of any procedural deficiency (see paragraph 15 1 above). In any event, the first applicant also suggested that the freezing of its various assets by virtue of the injunction order of 5 August 2015 had been a continuing situation that had uninterruptedly lasted from the date of its application until 2 March 2017, the date of the delivery by the Supreme Court of its ruling on the injunction matter and of the final judgment on the merits of the ownership dispute."

In the same vein, since it had resorted to the appropriate remedies for challenging the finally imposed interim injunction, the first applicant submitted that its complaints about the injunction proceedings were not inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, within the meaning of Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention."

                "262. The Court observes that the essence of the first applicant ’ s grievances before the Court is that the Tbilisi City Court ’ s injunction order of 5 August 2015, which froze its various assets and prevented it from entering into certain legal relations, was imposed in breach of fair ‑ trial guarantees and interfered with certain of its other rights under the Convention. Since the core of the alleged violations was the imposition of the above-mentioned injunction order by the first - instance court, the first question that needs to be answered is what constituted the final domestic decision in the injunction proceedings at stake. The answer to this question is straightforward, as the relevant domestic law makes it clear that the proceedings relating to injunction measures are conducted at two levels of jurisdiction only, with the second, and the highest, instance delivering, under the procedure reserved for interlocutory appeals, final decisions on the matter (see Articles 197 (1) and 419 § 3 of the CCP, as well as the Supreme Court ’ s relevant practice, cited in paragraphs 20 4, 20 6 - 7, 210 and 21 5 above ). This was not even disputed by the first applicant (see paragraph 257 above). Consequently, it was the Tbilisi Court of Appeal ’ s decision of 20 November 2015, which finally upheld the disputed injunction order of 5 August 2015 and stated that no further appeal lay (see paragraph 12 8 above), which represented the final domestic decision within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention."

                "263. The second question that needs to be addressed relates to the first applicant ’ s claim that the imposition of interim measures by the injunction order of 5 August 2015 created “a continuing situation”. The Court considers that this argument is ill-founded in the light of its relevant case-law, since, whenever the alleged violation of a Convention right is caused by a particular event produced at a particular time ( the delivery of a court decision or other written legal act being a vivid example ), the legal consequences of such an event, which may even stretch over significant time, do not qualify as “a continuing situation” for the purposes of the calculation of the six- month rule contained in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (see, amongst many other authorities, Călin and Others v. Romania, nos. 25057/11 and 2 others, § § 58-60, 19 July 2016; Posti and Rahko v. Finland, no. 27824/95, § § 39-40, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII; Meltex LTD v.

                "264. The third and final question before the Court regarding the admissibility of the relevant part of the first applicant ’ s complaints is whether, after the injunction order of 5 August 2015 had been irrevocably upheld by the final decision of 20 November 2015, the first applicant ’ s application of 17 November 2016, requesting either replacement or lifting of the imposed interim measures under Articles 196 and 199 (1) of the CCP, could be considered as an additional effective remedy. In this regard, the Court observes that the rule on exhaustion requires, under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, that the only remedies to be exhausted are those that are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 74, ECHR 1999-V). However, an applicant is not obliged to have recourse to remedies that are inadequate or ineffective (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 67, Reports 1996 ‑ IV ), and the pursuit of such remedies will unavoidably have consequences for the identification of the “final decision” and, correspondingly, for the calculation of the starting point for the running of the six-month rule ( compare, for example, Prystavska v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 21287/02, 17 December 2002, and Kucherenko v. Unkraine (dec.), no. 41974/98, 4 May 1999)."

                "265. In this connection, the Court duly notes the parties ’ extensive arguments regarding the question of whether or not the first applicant had had the requisite locus standi for lodging an application under either Article 196 or Article 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Notably, the parties have exchanged their views on whether, after it had ceased to be a co-respondent, the first applicant was still entitled to lodge an application under those two provisions. The Court observes that, even assuming that the first applicant had had the requisite standing for lodging such an application, it is clear, as a matter of relevant domestic law and practice, that this application ought to have been lodged in accordance with Articles 197 (1), 41 9 and 420 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that is to say in accordance with the rules governing the examination of interlocutory appeals. Indeed, examination of the Supreme Court ’ s practice, including the decisions submitted by the first applicant itself, consistently demonstrates that applications for changing or lifting of injunction measures were identical, in so far as their processing was concerned, to interlocutory appeals (see paragraphs 20 6, 20 8, 20 9 -1 2 and 217 above). Processing of an interlocutory appeal in accordance with Articles 197 (1), 419 and 420 of the Code meant, in its turn, that such an appeal should first be lodged with the court that had allegedly breached the party ’ s procedural rights and interests."
            ],
            [
                "266. In particular, the Court observes that, in a situation similar to the one examined in the present case, the Supreme Court of Georgia ruled in its decision of 29 December 2016 (case no. AS-806-773-2016) that where a domestic court failed to lift the interim injunction after one of the preconditions listed in Article 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure had materialised, such a failure could be challenged by the affected party through the lodging an interlocutory appeal under Article 197 (1) of the same Code (see paragraphs 20 7 and 20 8 above). In other words, the Court notes that the only procedurally appropriate manner of lodging an application under Articles 196 and/or 199 1 of that Code would have been for the first applicant to lodge an interlocutory appeal with the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, the very same court that had allegedly failed to lift the disputed injunctions after it had terminated the main proceedings in relation to this particular applicant. Since the first applicant did not do so, it can be concluded that it failed to use the claimed remedies in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law, as interpreted and applied by domestic courts. The latter finding automatically renders the first applicant ’ s procedurally defective application of 17 November 2016 immaterial for the purposes of the calculation of the six-month rule ( compare, for instance, Rezgui v. France (dec.), no. 49859/99, 7 November 2000; Polcarová v. the Czech Republic (dec.) [Committee], no. 52256/15, § 58, 15 May 2018; and Sazas v. Slovenia (dec.) [Committee], no. 53257/13, §§ 24-27 10 October 2017 )."

                "267. Furthermore, the remedies provided in Articles 196 and 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure embody extraordinary remedies in the injunction proceedings. The Court observes that, as acknowledged by the first applicant and confirmed by the judicial practice, the lodging of an application under either of the two above-mentioned provisions was not subject to any time-limits. However, the Court reiterates its well-established case-law, according to which remedies that have no precise time-limits, thus creating uncertainty and rendering nugatory the six-month rule contained in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, are not effective remedies within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 (see, amongst many other authorities, Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 6986/03, § 39, 15 November 2007; Williams v. the United Kingdom (dec.) no. 32567/06, 17 February 2009; Kolu v. Finland (dec.), no. 56463/10, 3 May 2011; and Denisov v. Russia (dec.), no. 33408/03, 6 May 2004). Indeed, the possibility for requesting either the replacement or the lifting of the interim injunctions was not regulated by any specific time-limits and was free to use at any moment providing that certain unforeseen circumstances had emerged, and such features of the remedies in question generate unacceptable uncertainties as to the final point in the proceedings (compare, for instance, Smadikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 10810/15, §§ 39, 41, 46 and 49, 31 January 2017 )."
            ],
            [
                "268. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that, even if the first applicant had lodged its application of 17 November 20 1 6 in compliance with the procedural formalities (see the findings in paragraph 26 6 above), this application could not have been taken into account for the calculation of the six-month time-limit because it would have been based on Articles 196 and 199 1 of the CCP, two extraordinary remedies falling outside the normal chain of domestic remedies envisaged for examination of injunction proceedings (compare, mutatis mutandis, Martynets v. Russia (dec.), no. 29612/09, 5 November 2009, and AO “Uralmash” v. Russia (dec.), no. 13338/03, 10 April 2003 ). It should also be reiterated in this regard that whenever an injunction is contested before the Court, only those domestic remedies that form part of the ordinary chain of domestic exhaustion reserved for the injunction proceedings are taken into account for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, irrespective of whether any arguably remedial action may or may not have occurred at a later stage in the parallel set of the proceedings on the merits (see, for instance, RTBF v. Belgium, no. 50084/06, § § 90-91, ECHR 2011 (extracts); Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France (dec.), no. 71111/01, 2 February 2006; and Maurice v. France (dec.), no. 11810/03, 6 July 2004 )."

The Court thus concludes that the first applicant ’ s application of 17 November 20 1 6 did not constitute an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. It therefore follows that the date from which the six-month period began to run was 20 November 201 5, the date on which the Tbilisi Court of Appeal rendered the decision finally upholding the contested injunction measures (compare Tucka v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) (dec.), no. 34586/10, §§ 12-15, 18 January 2011; Riedl ‑ Riedenstein and Others v. Germany (dec.), no. 48662/99, 22 January 2002; and Babinsky v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 35833/97, 11 January 2000). However, as the first applicant lodged its complaints under Articles 6 § 1, 10 and 18 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 with this Court on 3 March 2017, these belated complaints must be declared inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

In particular, the first applicant argued that Article 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure – the provision setting down the framework for involvement of a third party without an independent claim – could hardly have applied in its situation because it had been unable to claim, within the meaning of the wording of that domestic provision, that the outcome of the ownership dispute could have affected its civil rights and responsibilities vis-à-vis either the claimant, K.K., or the respondents, the second to fourth applicants."

The second to fourth applicants maintained that the reasons contained in the Supreme Court ’ s judgment of 2 March 2017 had been based on an erroneous reading of domestic law and a misconstrued assessment of the case -file material. They argued, in their extensive submissions, that the Supreme Court had not sufficiently explained, in reply to their objection, why the application of Article 85 of the Civil Code to the circumstances of the case had not been time-barred under the statute of limitations contained in Article 89, the latter provision being lex specialis in relation to Article 85. The second to fourth applicants also objected to the reference by the Supreme Court to the time-limit contained in Article 1008 of the Civil Code because the latter provision had been completely irrelevant for the purposes of examining the question of duress in contractual relations. The Supreme Court had also failed, in the second to fourth applicants ’ opinion, to sufficiently explain which pieces of evidence had established, on the balance of probabilities, the fact that K.K. had been coerced into signing the share-purchase agreements of 26 December 2005 and 17 November 2006. The three applicants also complained that the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008, in which K.K. had allegedly described the circumstances surrounding the pressure exerted on him, had not formed part of the civil case file despite its having been mentioned as a significant piece of evidence in the judgment of 2 March 2017. Even assuming that the claimant, K.K., had truly lodged that criminal complaint on 1 December 2008, the three applicants argued, with reference to a commentary by a domestic legal expert, that the mere act of lodging a criminal complaint could not suffice for the purposes of affecting the running of the time-limit provided for in Article 89 of the Civil Code. In particular, amongst other statements, the legal commentary submitted by the applicants contained a statement, which was not supported by reference to judicial practice, that the lodging of a criminal complaint could not lead to the exercise of the right to void a contract within the meaning of Article 89."

At the outset, and in reply to the second to fourth applicants ’ arguments, the Court reiterates that it is not its role to ascertain whether or not the rules of substantive or procedural law were correctly followed by the domestic courts in the course of the examination of the ownership dispute (see, for instance, Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], no. 22251/08, § 61, 5 February 2015 ). Thus, it is wholly immaterial from the standpoint of the Convention whether the Supreme Court could, pursuant to domestic law, quash the decision of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal and to deliver the final ruling of 2 March 2017 on the dispute without remitting the case for reconsideration to the lower courts. That being said, the Court cannot but note that there was nothing unusual in the Supreme Court overruling the decision of the appellate court and delivering, in the capacity of the final, cassation instance, the final decision on the civil dispute at hand (see, in particular, Article 411 of the Code of Civil Procedure, cited in paragraph 19 9 above; and compare, for instance, G.S. v. Georgia, no. 361/13, § § 25 ‑ 27, 21 July 2015; Gogitidze and Others v. Georgia, no. 6862/05, § 36, 12 May 2015; and Gorelishvili v. Georgia, no. 12979/04, § § 16 ‑ 19, 5 June 2007)."

The question before the Court is not whether the Supreme Court overstepped the bounds set by the domestic procedural law when deciding on the ownership dispute ( compare Sotiris and Nikos Koutras ATTEE v. Greece, no. 39442/98, § 17, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII) but whether the delivery of its final decision entailed an unjustified limitation of the second to fourth applicants ’ rights to equality of arms and/or adversarial proceedings, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In that connection, the only relevant assertion that the three applicants have voiced before the Court is their reference to the alleged change in approach at the last, cassation level of the proceedings with respect to the judicial examination (see paragraph 28 5 above). The Court does not exclude that, in principle, a sudden change in the judicial examination at the highest and last level of jurisdiction might, under certain circumstances, place an applicant at a disadvantage vis-à-vis his or her opponent as regards the opportunity to present legal arguments with a view of influencing the relevant highest court (see, mutatis mutandis, Súsanna Rós Westlund v. Iceland, no. 42628/04, §§ 40-41, 6 December 2007 ). It should also be borne in mind that the judges of the Supreme Court were expected to themselves respect the principle of adversarial proceedings when they decided to apply Article 85 of the Civil Code to the ownership dispute (see, for instance, Clinique des Acacias and Others v. France, nos. 65399/01 and 3 others, § 38, 13 October 2005, and Skondrianos v. Greece, nos. 63000/00 and 2 others, §§ 29-30, 18 December 2003 )."

However, contrary to the applicants ’ initial allegations, it became clear, after the notification of the case to the Government and receipt of the parties ’ additional submissions, that the ownership dispute had never been examined at the lower levels of jurisdiction – the Tbilisi City Court and the Tbilisi Court of Appeal – solely under Article 54 of the Civil Code. On the contrary, it was clear from both the legal grounds mentioned in K.K. ’ s civil action of 4 August 2015 and the reasons contained in the decisions of the first-instance and appellate courts, that Article 85 of the Civil Code had been constantly discussed throughout the proceedings. The second to fourth applicants had had ample opportunity to submit their arguments with respect to Article 85 before the domestic courts, and both the first-instance and the appellate court had given due consideration to Article 85 of the Civil Code in their respective decisions (see paragraphs 7 5, 8 1, 110 -1 1 and 145 above).The Court attaches particular importance to the fact that the second to fourth applicants argued, in their initial statement of defence made before the first-instance court, that it was not Article 54 but rather Articles 85 ‑ 89 of the Civil Code which should have been held applicable to the circumstances of the ownership dispute (see paragraph 8 2 above). Against this background, when the three applicants themselves insisted that the case ought to be examined under Article 85 of the Civil Code, the Court finds it striking that they now reproach the Supreme Court for applying that legal provision."

                "291. Furthermore, the Court does not see any advantage afforded to K.K. over the second to fourth applicants in the proceedings before the Supreme Court. Both sides were equal in their opportunity to make written submissions, and neither of them was obviously able to adduce any new factual evidence during the appeal-on-points-of-law proceedings (contrast Súsanna Rós Westlund, cited above, § 71 ). If anything, it might even be considered that the second to fourth applicants were placed in a procedurally more advantageous position vis-à-vis their opponent given that it was only them, and not their opponent, who were able to file with the Supreme Court an amicus brief addressing, amongst other legal issues, Article 85 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 15 8 above). As regards the second to fourth applicants ’ complaint that they did not address Article 85 of the Civil Code in their appeal on points of law, the Court does not see how that fact could be held imputable to the Supreme Court. The applicants knew or should have known that Article 85, together with Article 54, had been invoked by the claimant, K.K., and that both the first-instance and the appellate courts had addressed that legal provision in their decisions. If, despite the above-mentioned circumstances, the applicants decided not to address Article 85 in their appeal on points of law, that was caused either by their omission or tactical choice, and, in either scenario, they should assume the legal consequences of their approach to present the case before the Supreme Court (compare, mutatis mutandis, Roberts and Roberts v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 38681/08, § 37, 5 July 2011)."

The Court further observes that the Supreme Court ’ s decision to examine the ownership dispute through the lens of Article 85 of the Civil Code, the provision originally invoked by the claimant and addressed by the lower courts, was not a factual assessment but a legal one (see paragraph 16 5 above). In essence, the Supreme Court, having regard to the submissions of both parties in the case file, did nothing else but clarify a point of law and, in the light of that clarification, accepted the argument of duress that had been made by the claimant and contested by the second to fourth applicants from the very beginning to the end of the proceedings. Consequently, it cannot be said that the principles of the equality of arms or the adversarial nature of proceedings were infringed (compare with the very similar situation in APBP v. France, no. 38436/97, § § 30-34, 21 March 2002 ). In the light of the latter conclusion, the fact that the Supreme Court dispensed with an oral hearing in the present case cannot raise any arguable issue under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The cassation instance was fully capable of properly reviewing the lower courts ’ interpretation of the pertinent legal provisions on the sole basis of the parties ’ written submissions and other material in the case file, especially since numerous oral hearing had been held with the participation of both parties before the two lower courts (see, as the leading authority on this country-specific matter, Rizhamadze v. Georgia, no. 2745/03, § § 37-40, 31 July 2007, and Gogoladze v. Georgia, no. 4683/03, § § 31-37, 11 December 2007 )."

                "– that the Supreme Court had wrongly used the statutory time-limit of three years prescribed by Article 1008 of the Civil Code with respect to the situation of duress under Article 85 and should, instead, have applied the time-limit of one year set out in Article 89 of the same Code;",

                "295. The Court reiterates that the Contracting States have greater latitude when dealing with civil cases concerning civil rights and obligations than they have when dealing with criminal cases (see, amongst many other authorities, Levages Prestations Services v. France, no. 21920/93, § 46, 23 October 1996, and Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, § 32, no. 14448/88, 27 October 1993). The requirements of Article 6 § 1 as regards cases concerning civil rights are thus less onerous than they are for criminal charges (see, as a recent authority, Bartaia v. Georgia, no. 10978/06, § § 28 and 32, 26 July 2018; see also König v. Germany, no. 6232/73, § 96, 28 June 1978). Furthermore, according to its long-standing and established case-law, it is not for this Court to deal with alleged errors of law or fact committed by the national courts unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention, for instance where it can, exceptionally, be said that they are constitutive of “ unfairness ” incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention. While this provision guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way in which evidence should be assessed, these being primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts. Normally, issues such as the weight attached by the national courts to given items of evidence or to findings or assessments in issue before them for consideration are not for the Court to review. The Court should not act as a fourth instance and will not therefore question under Article 6 § 1 the judgment of the national courts, unless their findings can be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable. According to the thinking underlying the notion of “a manifest error of assessment” ( une erreur manifeste d ’ appréciation – a concept of French administrative law), as used in the context of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, if the error of law or fact by the national court is so blatantly evident that, from the standpoint of an objective observer, no reasonable court could ever have made it, this manifest error may disturb the fairness of the proceedings (compare, for instance, Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], no. 22251/08, § § 61-62, ECHR 2015, and the other authorities cited therein )."

As regards the second to fourth applicants ’ first claim, the one concerning the Supreme Court ’ s alleged omission to apply the statutory time-limit under Article 89 to the situation of duress (see paragraph 28 6 above), the Court observes that this allegation is manifestly ill-founded. In its judgment of 2 March 2017, the Supreme Court concluded that the time-limit mentioned in Article 89 specifically applied to the circumstances of the case in conjunction with Article 85. Indeed, the Supreme Court found that K.K. had been in a continuing situation of duress until the parliamentary election of October 2012, which had led to the change of the ruling power in the country. The cassation instance then cited Article 138 of the Civil Code, which deals with the general rule on interruption of the running of time-limits. In that connection, the Supreme Court found that by lodging the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008, K.K. had interrupted, within the meaning of Article 138, the running of the statutory time-limit under Article 89. In addition to its analysis of the situation under Article 89 of the Civil Code, the Supreme Court also noted that the act of duress was so blatant that it could be considered a civil tort, and under Article 1008 of the Civil Code the time-limit for claiming damages in respect of a tort was three years. That being so, the Supreme Court developed an alternative line of reasoning, stating that, even if the situation were to be considered as a tort, the three-year limitation period under Article 1008 would still have been interrupted, within the meaning of Article 138 of the Civil Code by the lodging of the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008. In short, the same result – interruption of the statutory time-limit even before the situation constitutive of either duress or tort had ceased to pertain – would have been reached irrespective of whether the time-limit of one year under Article 89 and or the time-limit of three years under Article 1008 of the Civil Code had been applied."

The Court further observes that the second to fourth applicants had themselves been perfectly aware of the existence of the above-mentioned domestic legal practice under Articles 85-89 and 138 of the Civil Code – interruption of the relevant one-year time-limit by lodging of a criminal complaint – because that was exactly the subject-matter of the constitutional complaint brought by the second applicant on 16 February 2016 (see paragraph 13 3 above). In the light of the foregoing, it cannot be said that the Supreme Court either circumvented the one-year time-limit applicable under Article 89 of the Civil Code to the situation of duress or erred in interpreting the relevant domestic law by ruling that the relevant time-limit had been interrupted under Article 138 of the Civil Code (contrast, for instance, Anđelković v.

The second to fourth applicants ’ only response to K.K. ’ s reference to that complaint was that “the mere fact of lodging a criminal complaint ... was not sufficient to turn the allegation of coercion into an established fact ... ” (see paragraph 8 1 above). It should also be noted that the civil case file had contained a copy of the two follow-up criminal complaints lodged by K.K. on 28 January and 12 March 2009, which documents had reproduced the content of the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008. Furthermore, the fact that K.K. had lodged the criminal complaint on 1 December 2008 had apparently been a matter of public knowledge, because it had been well documented in the Georgian Public Defender ’ s annual report of 2008 as well as in the report of the US Department of State concerning the property row over Rustavi 2 (see paragraphs 22 2 and 22 3 above). In the light of the foregoing, the Court is unable to share the second to fourth applicants ’ concern that the absence of the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008 from the civil case rendered the Supreme Court findings on the facts manifestly unreasonable (contrast Khamidov v.

Having regard to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the second to fourth applicants ’ applications for the recusal of Judge N.G., in so far as the disciplinary proceedings against the latter were concerned, and Judge Sh.K., were left without examination owing to the applicants ’ failure to comply with the relevant procedural requirements. Specifically, whilst Article 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure – the provision setting out the formal rules for lodging recusal applications – imperatively stated that such applications must be made in writing and, at the very latest, before the parties have exchanged their last oral arguments, the second to fourth applicants had already, as a matter of fact, applied after the exchange of the parties ’ pleadings, on 7 and 9 June 2016 (see paragraphs 14 1 and 14 2 above ).The applicants did not convincingly explain to the domestic courts why they had waited so long before applying. On the other hand, the Court notes that, according to the material available in the case file, the applicants knew or should have known about the facts on which they grounded their recusal applications much earlier. Thus, with respect to Judge Sh.K., the applicants should have known of that particular judge ’ s specialisation in criminal law as early as 27 April 2016 (see paragraph 13 8 above), whilst, as regards the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings against Judge N.G., they should have known of that fact by 1 June 2016 at the latest, when the Director General of Rustavi 2 had mentioned that fact during the press conference (see paragraphs 13 9 above). The Court takes note of the second applicant ’ s claim that it was 3 June 2016 when it applied for the recusal of Judge N.G. on account of the disciplinary proceedings for the first time (see paragraph 28 7 above). However, whilst that applicant did not submit a proof of its assertion, the available case -file material clearly shows that the first time the second applicant lodged a signed written application for recusal of the mentioned judge on the relevant grounds was 7 June 201 6 (see paragraph 14 1 above)."

The Court notes that private- law disputes do not themselves engage the responsibility of the State under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Ruiz Mateos v. the United Kingdom, no. 13021/87, Commission decision of 8 September 1988, Decisions and Reports (DR) 57, pp. 268 and 275; Tormala v. Finland (dec.), no. 41258/98, 16 March 2004; Eskelinen v. Finland (dec.), no. 7274/02, 3 February 2004; Kranz v. Poland (dec.), no. 6214/02, 10 September 2002; and Skowronski v. Poland (dec.), no. 52595/99, 28 June 2001 ). In particular, the mere fact that the State, through its judicial system, provided a forum for the determination of such a private-law dispute does not give rise to an interference by the State with property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, Kuchař and Štis v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 37527/97, 21 October 1998).The State may be held responsible for losses caused by such determinations if court decisions are not given in accordance with domestic law or if they are flawed by arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, Vulakh and Others v. Russia, no. 33468/03, § 44, 10 January 2012). However, it should be borne in mind that the Court ’ s jurisdiction to verify that domestic law has been correctly interpreted and applied is limited, and it is not its function to take the place of the national courts. Rather, the Court ’ s role is to ensure that the decisions of those courts are not arbitrary or otherwise manifestly unreasonable (see, for example, Anheuser-Busch Inc. v. Portugal [GC], no. 73049/01, § 83, ECHR 2007 ‑ I)."

In the light of the above-mentioned case-law principles, the Court considers that the second to fourth applicants ’ complaints about the outcome of the ownership dispute do not raise a prima facie issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Indeed, this provision cannot be construed as a guarantee that the desired outcome will be obtained in civil litigation (see, for instance, Burdiashvili and Others v. Georgia (dec.), no. 26290/12, § 36, 4 April 2017; see, mutatis mutandis, Slivenko and Others v. Latvia (dec.) [GC], no. 48321/99, § 121, ECHR 2002 ‑ II (extracts); and see Sardin v.

Having regard to its previous findings about the absence of any “manifest error of assessment” in the Supreme Court ’ s judgment of 2 March 217 (see paragraphs 29 5 ‑ 9 7 above), and reiterating that it is not its role to interpret and apply domestic law, the Court finds that the judicial determination of the ownership dispute cannot amount to an interference with the second to fourth applicants ’ property rights (compare, for instance, Zagrebačka banka d.d. v.

The three applicants further maintained that, in the light of the relevant circumstances of the case, with reference being made to the events allegedly constitutive of a State-led campaign against Rustavi 2 (see paragraphs 3 2 -4 9 above), the dominant purpose of the judicial determination of the ownership dispute had been to silence Rustavi 2 by depriving its owners – the second to fourth applicants – of their shares in the company."

In so far as the applicability of Article 18 is at stake, the Court confirmed in that landmark case that this provision cannot have an independent existence. It can only be applied in conjunction with an Article of the Convention or the Protocols thereto which sets out or qualifies the rights and freedoms that the High Contracting Parties have undertaken to secure to those under their jurisdiction. Whilst there can be a breach of Article 18 even if there is no breach of the Article in conjunction with which it applies, a breach of the former provision can only arise if the right or freedom at issue is subject to restrictions permitted under the Convention, (ibid., §§ 287 and 290 )."

In the light of these cited principles, the first question before the Court is whether Article 18 of the Convention can be relied on in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. In other words, the issue is whether the rights and freedoms protected by the latter provision are subject to permissible restrictions. It should be noted in this connection that in the case of OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia, (no. 14902/04, § § 263-66, 20 September 2011) the Court, without giving a definitive answer to the question of whether Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was prone to permissible restrictions, implicitly accepted that Article 18 of the Convention can, in principle, be brought to bear in conjunction with the former provision. However, the problem in the case at hand is that the second to fourth applicants ’ reference to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was manifestly ill-founded. With the Court ’ s having been unable to establish the existence of an interference by the State with the relevant applicants ’ property interests (see paragraphs 31 0- 1 2 above), Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 cannot be said to have ever been engaged. This is what distinguishes the present case from that of OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos, where the Court accepted that there had been multiple instances of interference with the applicant company ’ s property rights and proceeded to the examination of the merits of the relevant complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, reaching the findings of both violations and non-violations of the substantive provision (compare OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos, cited above, §§ 558, 563-75, 588-607 and 664)."

With respect to the first- instance court, the second to fourth applicants asserted that Judge T.U., the single judge who had decided the case, had neither been independent from the executive branch of government, nor impartial. In support of their assertions, the three applicants firstly averred that the examination of the case had started with “forum shopping”. They asserted in that regard that, being aware that Judge T.U. had been the only civil judge specialising in intellectual- property disputes on duty at the Tbilisi City Court, K.K. had artificially included in his action a clearly unmeritorious copyright claim. Secondly, the second to fourth applicants referred to the fact that Judge T.U. ’ s mother had been accused of a criminal offence. They argued that, from the perspective of an objective observer, it looked questionable that the criminal investigation had been revived and the charge formally preferred against that woman twenty months after the relevant incident (see paragraph 9 7 above). Those dubious circumstances might lead the public to think that, by renewing the criminal case against the judge ’ s mother after such an inexplicable delay, which coincided with the commencement of the examination of the Rustavi 2 ownership dispute, the authorities had wished to obtain leverage over the examining judge. The fact that Judge T.U. ’ s mother had eventually been convicted had not detracted from the way in which the State had used those criminal proceedings against her as a way of exerting pressure on the judge. Thirdly, the second to fourth applicants referred to the Facebook posts made by Judge T.U. ’ s wife on 7 July, 13 August and 2 October 2015, complaining that those posts contained negative views of Rustavi 2. With such biased attitudes held by the judge ’ s closest family member against the television channel, it was objectively justifiable to assume that the judge himself could not have been impartial during the examination of the ownership dispute over the television company. The second to fourth applicants argued that the inference drawn from the Facebook posts was not that specific posts influenced specific decisions of Judge T.U., but that the collection of posts had provided a reasonable basis for a fear that the judge ’ s wife and the judge himself had not been impartial in relation to Rustavi 2 and its owners. The fact that the judge ’ s wife had posted such views of Rustavi 2 repeatedly showed that she had consistently held such views. In that connection, the second to fourth applicants referred to Principle 4.8 of the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct in accordance with which a judge must not allow his or her family, social or other relationships to influence improperly his or her judicial conduct. They argued that the actions of a judge ’ s close family member sufficed to raise concerns as to the impartiality of the judge even in the absence of a direct proof that such views were also held by the judge himself. Lastly, the second to fourth applicants also claimed that the speed with which Judge T.U. had examined the ownership dispute as well as the preliminary and interim rulings that he had issued to the detriment of the applicants, including Judge T.U. ’ s refusal to recuse himself from the case, proved further his personal bias against them."

                "321. With respect to the appellate instance, the second to fourth applicants submitted that the Tbilisi Court of Appeal had not been impartial during the examination of the ownership due to the participation of Judge N.G. In particular, the three applicants argued that the latter judge had had close links with Judge T.U. as both had been founding members of the Union of Judges of Georgia, the association of judges that had publicly expressed its support towards Judge T.U. and criticised the Director General of Rustavi 2 (see paragraph 13 5 above). In that connection, the second to fourth applicants submitted that the public statements issued by the association had been uncalled for as Rustavi 2 had never attacked the judiciary but had simply reported, in a neutral manner, on the civil proceedings. Being a public watchdog, the television channel had been fully entitled to do so. The second to fourth applicants also denied that the first applicant, Rustavi 2, had ever tried to artificially create conditions for the recusal of the various judges, including Judge N.G. The television channel had merely been exercising its freedom of expression, whilst the judges had been under an obligation to keep a low profile and tolerate the legitimate criticism of the media. They also argued that the fact that the statements of the Union of Judges of Georgia had not addressed the merits of the case was not important at all. Rather, for the purposes of assessing impartiality, the significance lay in the fact that those statements had expressed support towards Judge T.U. and his arbitrary decisions."

            [
                "322. Lastly, as regards the cassation instance, the second to fourth applicants claimed that it had lacked independence and impartiality because of two judges on its bench, Judge M.T. and the President of the Supreme Court. As regards the former judge, the applicants referred to the fact that, prior to being elected to the Supreme Court, she had worked as the head of the legal department of a bank owned by the former Prime Minister and had donated GEL 34,000 (approximately EUR 10,600) to the GDC between 2012 and 2014 (see paragraph 15 7 above), a fact which proved that she had clear political sympathies towards the ruling party. However, since the ownership dispute over Rustavi 2 had been a politically sensitive one, it had been inappropriate for the judge with a clear political orientation to sit in the case. With regard to the President of the Supreme Court, the applicants referred to the fact that she could have held animosity towards the Director General of Rustavi 2, N.Gv., since it had been the latter who had brought disciplinary charges against the former back in 2006, while N.Gv. had been a member of the High Council of Justice. Those disciplinary proceedings, led by N.Gv., had resulted in the judge being dismissed from her judicial post in 2006. The second to fourth applicants claimed that those facts had constituted a sufficient basis for an objective observer to suspect that the President of the Supreme Court could be biased against Rustavi 2 ’ s Director General. Lastly, although the second to fourth applicants ’ challenge had been directed against only two of the nine judges in that composition of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 161 above), they claimed that it had been perfectly possible for those two judges to exert influence over the rest of the bench. They also submitted that, as a matter of principle, the main question was not whether such influence had actually been exerted but that the likelihood of such influence had existed. Therefore, the lack of independence or impartiality on the part of two judges had tainted the whole bench of the Supreme Court that had examined the ownership dispute, in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.",

The Government submitted that the second to fourth applicants ’ complaints concerning Judge T.U., Judge N.G., Judge M.T. and the President of the Supreme Court fell short of the standard of proof required under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and were unable to refute the presumptions of independence and impartiality of the first, appellate and cassation courts."

            [
                "324. As regards Judge T.U, the Government firstly submitted that the allegations of “forum-shopping” were unsubstantiated. First of all, contrary to the applicants ’ allegations, T.U. had not been the only judge at the Tbilisi City Court who had been expert in issues related to copyright law. At the material time, two other judges in the same court had been specialists in examining copyright disputes. Furthermore, the Government referred to the fact that the assignment of the ownership dispute to that particular judge had been conducted in alphabetical order, pursuant to section 5 of the Allocation of Cases to Judges Act of June 1998 (see paragraph 9 1 above). As regards the challenge to Judge T.U. on the basis of the initiation of the criminal proceedings against his mother, the Government submitted that those proceedings had commenced in January 2014, long before K.K. had brought the ownership dispute to the court on 4 August 2015. As regards the reasons for the delay between the incident and charges being brought against the woman, the Government referred to the documents confirming that it had been caused by the prosecution authorities ’ decision to give the parties time for reconciliation (see paragraph 9 7 above). The Government emphasised that such practice was far from being unusual. They submitted statistical data from the Chief Public Prosecutor ’ s Office demonstrating that in 2014 the investigation of offences under Article 118 of the Criminal Code, the same provision under which Judge T.U. ’ s mother had been charged, had commenced in 1,032 cases, out of which charges had been brought only in 115 cases, whilst the remaining cases had ended with reconciliation between the parties. Furthermore, the Government submitted documents which disclosed that Judge T.U. ’ s mother had eventually been convicted on 11 December 2017, that is to say well after Judge T.U. had delivered the judgment in favour of K.K. (see paragraphs 98 before). Judge T.U. had never shown personal bias and no circumstances existed that could objectively justify the second to fourth applicants ’ fear that the judge had been pressurised by the authorities into deciding the ownership dispute in favour of K.K."

            [
                "325. As regards the issue related to the Facebook posts published by Judge T.U. ’ s wife, the Government submitted that the second to fourth applicants had not presented any evidence to show that Judge T.U. had been under the influence of his spouse while adjudicating on the case. Neither the Bangalore Principles, to which the three applicants referred, nor any other international document on the impartiality of judges contained any provision restricting the freedom of expression of judges ’ family members or their right to form opinions, positive or negative, with regard to events and individuals. Furthermore, the impugned Facebook posts had not expressed any opinion on the outcome of the civil case, they had simply made negative comments about Rustavi 2 and its Director General. However, as long as it had not been showed that the judge had been influenced by those opinions, it could not be said that the he had lacked either independence or impartiality. The Government attached importance to the fact that Judge T.U. had emphasised in his decision of 19 October 2015 that his spouse had never agreed the contents of the Facebook posts with him, nor had he been aware of the existence of those posts. They also submitted that, as a matter of fact, Judge T.U. had taken a number of decisions, both procedurally and on the merits, in favour of the applicants, and that those decisions could be taken as an indication of the absence of any particular bias against them. Lastly, the Government invited the Court, by submitting the relevant documentary proof, to take note of the fact that Judge T.U. ’ s term of office had expired on 29 April 2016. He had subsequently applied to the High Council of Justice for reappointment for life and took part in an open recruitment competition but, far from receiving favourable treatment, he had in fact been passed over by the Council in favour of another candidate. Those developments in Judge T.U. ’ s career further underscored, in the Government ’ s view, the baseless nature of the second to fourth applicants ’ suggestion that he had been acting under the influence of the Government in his adjudication of the Rustavi 2 dispute."

As regards the independence and impartiality of the appellate level of jurisdiction involved in the examination of the ownership dispute, and in particular the complaints made against Judge N.G., the Government first acknowledged that at the time of the examination of the ownership dispute, Judges T.U. and N.G. had been members of the association of judges together with approximately fifty other acting judges. The Government argued that nothing in the association ’ s statements of 31 August and 20 October 2015 had demonstrated any indication of personal bias or a predetermined position on the part of Judge N.G. or Judge T.U. The impugned statements had not concerned the merits of the ownership dispute. Rather, they had been aimed at protecting the judiciary from the virulent attacks in the media at that time. In general, the Government argued, with reference to relevant comparative material relating to such countries as Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Portugal, that the practice of protecting individual judges from attacks in the media by non-governmental organisations and associations of judges was not uncommon."

As regards the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Court, particularly the accusations levelled by the second to fourth applicants against Judge M.T. and the President of that court, the Government submitted that the relevant complaints were manifestly ill-founded. As regards the former judge, the Government stated that her connection as an employee of the bank owned by Mr Ivanishvili ’ s family, which was in no way connected to the ownership dispute, could not cast legitimate doubts on her impartiality during the examination of the ownership dispute. The Government further submitted documentary proof of the following facts. Before being elected as a Supreme Court judge in 2015, Judge M.T. had held various judicial offices in different courts in Georgia from 1985 to 2005. She had then worked for ten years in the private sector from 2005 to 2015. She had made donations to the GDC only between 2012 and 2014, that is to say during the period when she had been employed in the private sector. There was no information on Judge M.T. ’ s political activity following her appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court on 12 June 2015. On the contrary, according to a letter of the State Audit Service, since 12 June 2015 M.T. had not made any donations to the GDC or any other political party. As regards the President of the Supreme Court, the Government emphasised that there was no proof capable of showing that the President had held or expressed any negative attitudes in respect of the Director General of Rustavi 2 in relation to the events that had occurred more than a decade previously – the disciplinary proceedings that had been conducted against her in 2006. On the other hand, the Government argued that a judge ’ s negative attitude towards one of the parties due to past affairs could be discerned only in cases where the judge clearly expressed his or her willingness for retribution. In any event, the judgment of 2 March 2017 was adopted unanimously by nine judges of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court. In these circumstances, any concerns regarding the independence and impartiality of the two particular judges could not have affected the judicial decision adopted by nine judges in consensus. The Government also emphasised in that regard that the majority of the judges sitting in the Grand Chamber (five out of nine) had become members of the Supreme Court during the period 2009 - 11, when President Saakashvili and his UNM party had been in power and during which time the then Director General of Rustavi 2, N.

An important and relevant aspect of that context was the fact that, as the Supreme Court noted in its judgment of 2 March 2017 (see paragraph 17 3 above), Rustavi 2 had been waging a concerted, extra-curial campaign throughout with the aim of pressurising various judges and creating conditions for their recusal. The Government referred in that connection to the various insults that had been directed at the judges by the Director General of the television channel (see paragraphs 17 5 - 7 6 above), urging the Court to take this aspect into account when examining the relevant complaints."

Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 49, ECHR 2013 (extracts), with further references therein ). A member of the tribunal must be independent of both the executive and also of the parties (see, for instance, Ringeisen v. Austria, judgment of 16 July 1971, Series A no. 13, p. 39, § 95, and Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 24, § 55)."

                "331. The Court reiterates that impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways. According to the Court ’ s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to a subjective test where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge, that is to say whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and also according to an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, for example, Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 118, ECHR 2005-XIII, and Micallef, cited above, § 93). In the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues the Court has focused on the objective test (see Micallef, cited above, § 95, and Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 75, 23 April 2015). However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test) (see Kyprianou, cited above, § 119). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports 1996-III)."
            ],
            [
                "332. As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge ’ s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Micallef, cited above, § 96, and Morice, also cited above, § 76). The objective test mostly concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other actors in the proceedings (see Micallef, cited above, § 97). It must therefore be decided in each individual case whether the relationship in question is of such a nature and degree as to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the tribunal (see Pullar, cited above, § 38). In this connection even appearances may be of a certain importance or, in other words, “justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done” (see Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 6639/11, § 63, 25 September 2018, and De Cubber v. Belgium, 26 October 1984, § 26, Series A no. 86). What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public. Thus, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw (see Castillo Algar v. Spain, 28 October 1998, § 45, Reports 1998-VIII). The Court further restates that appearance of partiality under the objective test is to be measured by the standard of an objective observer (see, amongst other authorities, Pullar, cited above, § 39, A.K. v. Liechtenstein, no. 38191/12, § 75, 9 July 2015; and Miminoshvili v. Russia, no. 20197/03, § 114, 28 June 2011). The Court further observes that the appearance that a judge is not impartial can be given not only by apparent conflict of interest (see, for instance, Micallef, cited above, § 102; Ramljak v. Croatia, no. 5856/13, § 31, 27 June 2017; and Dorozhko and Pozharskiy v.

                "335. The Court reiterates that it is the role of the domestic courts to manage their proceedings with a view to ensuring the proper administration of justice. It is of the opinion that the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in developing methods for the assignment of cases to particular judicial formations. A wide range of factors, such as, for instance, resources available, qualification of judges, conflict of interests, judicial workload etc., must be taken into account by the authorities when assigning a case. The Court has previously held that, although it is not its role to assess whether there were valid grounds for the domestic authorities to (re)assign a case to a particular judge or court, it must be satisfied that such (re)assignment was compatible with Article 6 § 1, and, in particular, with the requirements of independence and impartiality ( compare, mutatis mutanids, with Sutyagin v. Russia, no. 30024/02, § 187 178-93, 3 May 2011). On the facts of the present case, the Court cannot see indices of the type of judicial “forum shopping” alleged by the applicants. Whilst the applicants claimed that Judge T.U. had been the only judge at the Tbilisi City Court specialising in the examination of intellectual- property law, the documents available in the case file suggest that, in actual fact, two other judges with such a specialisation had also been available. Of further significance in that connection is that Judge T.U. himself explained in detail the way in which the ownership dispute had been allocated to him. Specifically, he confirmed that the decision on allocation had been made, under section 5 of the Allocation of Cases to Judges Act of June 1998, in alphabetical order (see paragraphs 9 1 and 32 4 above). The applicants were unable to refute Judge T.U. ’ s credible explanation and did not provide any evidence in support of an alternative version as to how the case might have been assigned to him."

The three applicants only argument in that regard was that the delay between the date of the criminal act committed by the judge ’ s mother ( 7 January 2014 ) and the date of bringing the charges against her ( 24 September 2015 ) was suspicious and thus indicative of the fact that the criminal proceedings had been revived after the ownership dispute had been assigned to Judge T.U. However, the Court notes that both the prosecution authority at the domestic level and the Government in the Convention proceedings provided a sound explanation in respect of those circumstances. Thus, according to the material available in the case file, given the senior age and the state of health of the accused, Judge T.U. ’ s mother, as well as the less-serious character of the impugned offence under domestic legislation (Article 118 of the Criminal Code), the prosecution authority had given her, in accordance with the well-established practice, time for reconciliation with the victim of the offence, her son-in-law. The existence of such a reconciliatory practice is confirmed by the statistical data of the prosecutor ’ s office regarding the prosecution of offences committed under Article 118 of the Criminal Code in 2014 - 15. It was only after all the possibilities for reconciliation had been exhausted, that the prosecution authority had brought charges against the offender (see paragraphs 9 7 - 8 and 32 4 above)."

Public confidence, in its turn, rests, amongst other things, upon institutional and individual independence of a judge and his or her impartiality, the latter being an essential quality required of a judge. Impartiality must exist both as a matter of fact (subjective test) and as a matter of reasonable appearance (objective test) (see the case-law principles summarised in paragraphs 33 1- 33 3 above )."

The Court considers that, as a matter of principle, a judge should consider disqualifying him or herself from sitting if the judge has made public statements relating to the outcome of the case. The Court notes that Judge T.U. did not make any such statements. Since the Facebook posts in question were made not by the Judge but by his spouse, the objective test applies. Two interrelated questions arise: (i) whether the character of those statements was such as to raise objectively justifiable concerns about the impartiality of the judicial review of the ownership dispute over Rustavi 2 shares and (ii) whether the statements published by Judge T.U. ’ s wife can be said to have been associated with the judge himself."

In so far as the first question is concerned, regarding the character of the impugned public statements, the Court recognises that those statements conveyed the negative views of the author of the posts in relation to Rustavi 2 as a television channel and to its Director General, N.Gv., personally. However, neither of these two represented an actual party to the ownership dispute. The judge ’ s wife did not comment in any manner on the eventual outcome of the on-going ownership dispute. None of the Facebook posts, one of which predated the assignment of the ownership dispute to Judge T.U., could be understood as creating an impression that the judge ’ s spouse was attempting to exploit her husband ’ s judicial position or influence him."

As to the second question, the Court notes that, according to the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, a judge shall not allow his or her family, social or other relationships to influence his or her judicial conduct (see point 4.8 of the Bangalore Principles cited in paragraphs 22 4 above). The requirement of judicial impartiality cannot prevent a judge ’ s family expressing their views on issues affecting society. However, it cannot be excluded that the activities of close family members might, in certain circumstances, adversely affect the public ’ s perception of a given judge ’ s impartiality (see paragraph 67 of the Commentary on the Bangalore Principles, cited in paragraph 22 5 above). The Court notes that, in the case at hand, the second to fourth applicants have not presented any evidence that Judge T.U. was influenced by his spouse ’ s social networking statements while adjudicating the case. There is no proof in the case file that the judge ever discussed the ownership dispute over Rustavi 2 shares with his spouse either privately or in public. In his decision of 19 October 2015, the judge emphasised that his spouse had never agreed the contents of her Facebook posts with him and that he had not even been aware of the existence of those posts. The Court thus considers that, from the standpoint of an objective observer, the judge sufficiently distanced himself from the opinions which his wife published on Facebook."

Lastly, the Court reiterates that a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention cannot be grounded on the alleged lack of independence or impartiality of a decision-making tribunal if the decision taken was subject to subsequent oversight by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and ensures respect for the guarantees laid down in that provision (see, for instance, Helle v. Finland, 19 December 1997, § 46, Reports 1997 ‑ VIII ). In this connection, the Court is not oblivious to the fact that the second to fourth applicants had access to the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, an instance with full jurisdiction to re-examine the ownership dispute on matters of fact and law. The impartiality of the appellate court is examined below (see paragraphs 349 -5 3 below). The Court considers that the Court of Appeal not only ensured a full re-examination of the merits of the ownership dispute but also addressed, albeit not in the same detailed manner as that was subsequently done by the Supreme Court, the second to fourth applicants ’ challenge to Judge T.U. ’ s independence and impartiality (see paragraphs 10 6, 14 7 and 17 3 above; and contrast with Kyprianou, cited above, § 134, and Henryk Urban and Ryszard Urban v.

                "349. However, the Court considers that, from the standpoint of an objective observer, viewing the matter realistically and practically, the second to fourth applicants ’ allegations concerning Judge N.G. are unsubstantiated. To start with, the Court reiterates that a judge, like any other individual, is entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly, but in exercising these rights, he or she should conduct himself or herself in such a manner as to preserve the dignity of the judicial office and the impartiality and independence of the judiciary ( see its findings in paragraph 344 above; and compare, mutatis mutandis, N.F. v. Italy, no. 37119/97, § § 31 and 32, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX; Kudeshkina v. Russia, no. 29492/05, § 86, 26 February 2009; and Harabin v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 62584/00, 29 June 2004 ). A judge may form or join associations of judges or participate in other organisations representing the interests of judges (see the Commentary to the Bangalore Principles, cited in paragraph 22 5 above). Thus, it does not see anything improper in the fact that both Judge T.U. and Judge N.G had been founding members, together with sixteen other judges, of the Union of Judges of Georgia, an association representing acting judges ’ interests. At the time of the examination of the ownership dispute, Judge T.U. and Judge N.G were still members of the organisation, together with some fifty other acting judges in Georgia."
            ],
            [
                "350. As regards the issuance of the statements by the association of judges on 31 August and 20 October 2015, the Court does not see anything improper about that occurrence either. Firstly, it attaches significance to the fact that those statements were made in response to the Rustavi 2 Director General ’ s public attacks on Judge T.U. The terms and expressions that the Director General had used with respect to that particular judge in his televised statements included : “a Sonder - judge” (the latter expression being used with a Nazi connotation ), “soil will burn under the judge”, illiterate”, “corrupt”, “puppet”, “pseudo-servant of Themis”, “armed with an axe”, “ for- hire” and “scoundrel” (for more epithets used by Rustavi 2 ’ s Director General in the course of the domestic proceedings, see paragraphs 17 5 ‑ 6 above). It furthermore is evident from the available case -file material that the Director General did not even hide the fact that he was making such abusive public statements intentionally, with the aim of provoking the judge and obtaining grounds for requesting the latter ’ s recusal (see paragraphs 10 4 and 17 3 above). In that regard, the Court considers it important to emphasise that, whilst parties to the proceedings may defend their rights and legal interests even in a boisterous manner, which may include resort to exuberant speech, they are nevertheless expected to confine such conduct strictly to the courtroom (see, for instance, Čeferin v. Slovenia, no. 40975/08, § 54, 16 January 2018). In the present case, however, Rustavi 2 ’ s Director General, chose to voice his criticism of Judge T.U. not in a courtroom, although he had every possibility to do so given the involvement of Rustavi 2 as a party to the proceedings at that time, but by employing Rustavi 2 ’ s powerful media premises and with the inappropriate goal of provoking the judge and artificially creating the preconditions for the latter ’ s recusal."
            ],
            [
                "351. Furthermore, whilst Judge T.U. was subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than an ordinary person (see Morice, cited above, § 131), the Court considers that Rustavi 2 ’ s Director General overstepped the bounds of that permissible criticism by proffering through that television channel strong personal affronts in respect of the judge ( see, amongst many other authorities, Rodriguez Ravelo v. Spain, no. 48074/10, § 46, 12 January 2016; Kincses v. Hungary, no. 66232/10, § 37, 27 January 2015; Saday v. Turkey, no. 32458/96, § 35, 30 March 2006; and Skałka v. Poland, no. 43425/98, § 36, 27 May 2003). Since Rustavi 2 ’ s Director General ’ s gratuitous media attacks on Judge T.U. could be seen as an improper attempt to influence the judge ’ s decision-making and contribute to the erosion of the authority of the judiciary in general (see also his attempts to reach out to the President of the Tbilisi City Court in paragraphs 17 7 and 17 8 above), the Court does not find anything unfitting in the judicial association ’ s decision to issue public statements in defence of the judiciary in general and Judge T.U. in particular, especially since the latter was precluded himself from replying by a duty of discretion (see Radobuljac v. Croatia, no. 51000/11, § 54, 28 June 2016, and Morice, cited above, § 108). As regards the content of those statements, the Court observes that they were civil and balanced."

Finland, no. 47221/99, § 33, ECHR 2004 ‑ V). Secondly, having regard to the general question of the significance of the appearance of judicial independence from the executive and legislative branches, the Court is ready to accept that, in addition to the need for judges to refrain from taking part publicly in controversial political discussions (see the Court ’ s findings in paragraphs 344 and 349 above), it would be normally preferable for professional judges to refrain, during their mandate, from partisan political activities, such as contributing to political parties or campaigns (see also the Bangalore Principles and the Commentary thereto, cited in paragraphs 22 4 and 22 5 above). However, according to the case ‑ file material, Judge M.T. contributed to the political party in question some years previously, at a time when she was employed in the private sector (see paragraph 32 7 above).

Requests for recusal of domestic judges should not be aimed at paralysing the defendant State ’ s legal system and this aspect bears special importance where courts of last instance are concerned and where such requests cannot, therefore, be decided upon by the appeal court (see A.K., cited above, § § 80 and 82).",

In practice, however, it is very difficult to establish the existence of personal bias of a judge under the subjective test, and the Court normally prefers to assess the situation from the objective standpoint. For instance, in the case of Tocono and Profesorii Prometeişti, the Court held that the judge ’ s personal grudge towards a party to the proceedings could only be discerned under the objective test by having due regard not only to past events that could, from the perspective of an objective observer, be considered as the plausible cause of the animosity but also to the question of whether or not the judge had ever expressed a willingness to retaliate ( see Tocono and Profesorii Prometeişti, cited above, §§ 28-33 )."

A set of disciplinary proceedings leading to dismissal is a serious matter which, in principle, can have a significant effect on the private and professional life of the person concerned. With this mind, the Court considers that the enlarged bench of the Supreme Court, the body seized with the relevant request for recusal of its President, had to subject the request to a serious scrutiny. The Court observes that in its ruling of 2 March 2017, the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court extensively addressed the relevant arguments of the second to fourth applicants, carefully assessing them under both the subjective and objective tests contained in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

Denmark, 24 May 1989, § 47, Series A no. 154), the Court further notes that the second to fourth applicants have not presented, either at the domestic level or in the proceedings before it, any information to show that the President of the Supreme Court held such a negative attitude with regard to N.Gv. in relation to the past affairs that had occurred more than a decade before. Leaving aside the lack of proof of the President ’ s willingness to retaliate ( again contrast Tocono and Profesorii Prometeişti, cited above, §§ 28 ‑ 33, and Remli, cited above, §§ 43-48), there is also no evidence in the case file to show that the judge ever expressed any views at all either about Rustavi 2, N.Gv. or the latter ’ s role in the disciplinary proceedings conducted against her. In the circumstances when the second to fourth applicants had been systematically introducing ill-founded recusal requests against many different judges of all three levels of jurisdiction and when the attacks broadcast by Rustavi 2 against some of the judges involved in the case had been sustained, the Court considers that the Supreme Court ’ s well ‑ reasoned decision to maintain the President was not, given the circumstances of the case and the elements relied on when seeking her recusal, unjustified."

In the case of Morice, the French courts had explicitly established the existence of personal animosity between the applicant and the judge challenged for bias, whereas in the case at hand the second to fourth applicants were unable to show proof of any personal or professional conflict between them and the President of the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 359-362 and 162 above and contrast with ibid., §§ 50 and 86)."

By its final judgment of 9 July 2002 the Court of Appeal found inter alia that the applicant company had been entitled to rely on the second paragraph of section 43 (2) of the Law on Foreign Investments and that the amended section 51 of the Customs Code could not have any bearing on the applicant company since according to section 46 of Law No. 780 it could not have retroactive effect on the duty free shops opened prior to its enactment.",

In the applicant's view this law had been enacted in order to encourage foreign investors to invest their money in the Moldovan economy, in conditions of security while not being afraid of any change of legislation or of changes of the political course of Moldova. In such circumstances, any ambiguous part of the text concerning the guarantees afforded to it by this law should have been interpreted in its favour.

Insofar as the judgment of the Supreme Court is to be interpreted as meaning that, because of its limited impact, the Order did not interfere with the possessions of the applicant company for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court is unable to accept this view. While it is true that the Order did not prevent the applicant company from carrying on other activities authorised under its articles of association, as for instance the conducting of an ordinary retail business, and while the company could in principle have applied for a new licence to open a duty-free shop at an airport location, it is beyond dispute that the Order had the immediate and intended effect of preventing the applicant from continuing to operate its duty-free business at the Leuşeni Customs Office and of terminating the applicant's existing licence to carry on business at that location. In these circumstances, the Court finds that there was a clear interference with the applicant's right to the peaceful enjoyment of its possessions for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Consistently with the Court's case-law referred to in paragraph 49 above, such interference constitutes a measure of control of use of property which falls to be examined under the second paragraph of that Article."

The measure must also be proportionate to the aim pursued; however, it is only necessary to examine the proportionality of an interference that is lawful (see Katsaros, cited above, § 43)."

In so far as the lawfulness of the interference is concerned, the Court notes that the main dispute between the parties both before the domestic courts and before the Court is whether the duty free regime enjoyed by the applicant company in accordance with the Decree was “customs, tax and other incentives” for the purpose of the second paragraph of subsection 2 of section 43 and whether it could therefore be entitled to enjoy the former more favourable legislation for at least ten years as provided for in subsection 1 of section 43."

As noted above (paragraph 38), the Government submitted a letter from the Customs Department supporting this interpretation of the section. It was further contended by the Government that the Law on Foreign Investments and the Customs Code were organic laws and that the Code, being the more recent in time, was applicable in the case."

The Court observes that similar arguments were advanced by the Customs Department before the Court of Appeal in the present case and were rejected by that court, which concluded that section 43 of the Law was applicable to the applicant's business and that the effect of the 2002 legislation was to change the conditions of activity of the applicant company, which had been created with foreign investment before the enactment of such legislation. The Court of Appeal further held that, pursuant to the second paragraph of section 43 of the Law, enterprises such as the applicant company with foreign capital, which had enjoyed customs, tax and other incentives in accordance with the legislation of the Republic of Moldova formerly in force, had the right to enjoy those incentives for ten years after the new legislation came into effect.

It noted that such a conclusion required three elements, namely the same parties ( eaedem personae ), the same object ( eadem res ) and the same cause of action ( eadem causa petendi ). Moreover, where the arguments raised were different, it had to be seen whether they could have been raised at the time of the principal judgment. In the present case, it considered that there had been no doubt that the requirement of eaedem personae had been met, despite the fact that the applicant had attempted to bring the present proceedings against the State and that the other proceedings had been against the Attorney General, as it was clear that the defendant in both cases was the Maltese Government. The element of eadem res had also been satisfied in so far as the present case concerned the same lease of the same property, with the same tenants and the same circumstances that had led the applicant to institute proceedings the first time round. Similarly, the element of eadem causa petendi had also been satisfied, since the applicant ’ s applications to the court were to a great extent the same, if not identical, despite the fact that he had made further arguments and submitted that his situation had remained unchanged notwithstanding the 2009 amendments to the Civil Code. The court considered that the changes to the application had not changed the nature of the action, namely a claim that the restrictions on the rent imposed by the law had been disproportionate. This matter had already been dealt with by the court in the first set of proceedings (no. 49/05), where it had decided that a fair balance had been struck by the authorities; it was not therefore open to the applicant to relitigate the matter. The court further held that even though the applicant had argued that despite the 2009 amendments (if they applied at all) he had remained a victim of the alleged violation, there was already a judgment in his respect stating that the law in so far as it applied to his case had not breached his rights, and the more recent amendments had not worsened his situation. Thus, the Civil Court (First Hall) held that there could not have been a breach of his rights even under the new law. Lastly, it concluded that any new arguments put forward by him should have been incorporated into the first set of proceedings.

Firstly, he could not resume possession of his property (except in extreme circumstances which were difficult to attain ). Secondly, he could not charge a fair rent, as the law only provided for it to be doubled every fifteen years, which did not reflect increases in the property market (which, as an example, had increased by more than 40% over the seven - year period between 2004 and 2011)."

The applicant submitted that such restrictions had not been in the public interest, given the huge amount of vacant property on the Maltese islands (27.6% of total dwellings), particularly on the island of Gozo, where the property at issue was located and where “homelessness does not feature as a notable problem” (substantiated by the relevant census statistics and other documentation submitted to the Court dated 2005 and 2006 respectively ). Indeed, the Government had not submitted any evidence of an emergency situation existing in 1979 when the laws had been amended in the tenants ’ favour (following twenty years of a free market). Nor had these laws done any good, given that people had started to mistrust the Government, who could tip the balance to one end or another at their convenience. In fact, people had stopped investing in residential property, opting to invest in holiday accommodation which was not subject to restrictions. Thus, instead of achieving the Government ’ s alleged aim of decent residential accommodation, the measure had been counterproductive. The Government had not even substantiated that there were tenants in need of protection nowadays. In fact, if this were so, it would be in stark contrast to the liberalisation of leases undertaken after 1995. Thus, the Government had failed to prove that the existence of such restrictions to date pursued any existing and current public interest. In reality, as in the present case, the restrictions had solely aimed to enrich tenants and impoverish landlords. The applicant noted that in the present case, the tenant and his sister had received by donation a plot of land measuring 2,185 square metres, which had been subsequently parcelled out into nine building plots and sold to third parties. Despite such land availability or the relevant income, couple C remained housed by the applicant at an extremely low rent. To add insult to injury, the tenants were ready to move out had they been paid a financial incentive (key money) of EUR 232,494."

The applicant reiterated that in his view, it was not without doubt that the 2009 amendments were applicable to him, and in particular the new definition of tenant was surely not applicable, as clearly could be seen from Article 39 (4) of Act X of 2009 (see paragraph 29 above). Thus, the amendments had only marginally ameliorated his position, in that the minimum rent had been adjusted to EUR 185 per year and was revisable every three years. Any other provisions were either inapplicable or had already been provided for by the 1979 law. Admitting that he had erred in his claims during the proceedings before the RRB in 1998, he considered that under domestic law an appeal could only be lodged in respect of applications for the repossession of premises or on a point of law; however, neither of these categories applied to his case. He further noted that, had the proper regime been applied, the rent should have been adjusted to EUR 246 in 1994 and EUR 363 in 2009, and in that case the amendments of 2009 would not even have applied to him. In addition, he submitted that the Government ’ s calculations as to the increases available to him were incorrect. In reality, it had only been in 2013 that such an increase had been due and this would have amounted to EUR 194.63 per year in his current position, while under the HD Ordinance it would have amounted to EUR 381.83. Thus, even assuming the Government ’ s rental estimate for that year amounting to EUR 2,900 (see paragraph 15 above) to be correct (although the applicant considered it improbable), the said rents would still have amounted to 6.7 % and 13.17 % of the current market value respectively. This went to show how meagre the improvements had been, and the fact that an increase according to inflation did not reflect price increases in immovable property, which according to the Immovable Price Index Notice (Subsidiary legislation 246.08) had been 42.92% for the period between 2004 and 2012."

Moreover, he had inherited the premises in 1984, thus at the time he had become its owner, the property had already been subject to that law. It followed that the property had not lost any worth since he had inherited it. The Government were of the opinion that no right existed to maintain in force an existing regime, that is to say that a certain regime would never be regulated in future. Furthermore, the 1959 law had been an emergency ordinance with the aim of ameliorating specific situations."

They noted that various people were still dependent on leases, irrespective of the amount of vacant property. According to information submitted by them, the number of applications for social housing in 1988 was 4,982 and in 1989 was 1,622; it continued to decrease, reaching a low in 200 1 with 249 applications, increasing gradually until 2012 when there were 932 applications, which by 2013 were down again to 756 (in 2008 it was 693). Indeed, the 1979 amendments had come about as a legislative reaction to protect tenants, following the years of unrestricted leases, and whose leases and emphyteutic grants of dwelling houses covered by prevailing laws were at the time coming to an end. Had it not been for such restrictions, the number of persons in need of social housing aid would have been greater."

The Government further submitted that by means of amendments in 2009 and 2010, which applied to the applicant ’ s premises, the Government aimed to gradually eliminate protected tenancies. Those amendments had helped to mitigate interference with owners ’ rights. They had introduced an increase in the amount of rent by introducing a minimum rent of EUR 185 per year. The rent could be increased every three years in accordance with inflation. While owners retained their rights to dispose of the property, tenants had limited rights and were obliged to take good care of the property as well as incur all expenses related to ordinary repairs and maintenance. In the event that owners were to make extraordinary repairs to the property, the law allowed for a further increase in the annual rent by 6% of the value of the repairs. Furthermore, tenants could only use a property for its intended purpose and any other use, or non-use, for twelve months, would entitle owners to ask for the dissolution of the contract. Lastly, the revision of the definition of tenant had been more favourable to land owners (see Relevant domestic law above). The law had thus struck a balance between the rights of tenants and those of owners, who under these circumstances could make some profit."

In any event, they pointed out that the Convention did not give a right to receive profits, and the discrepancy between market values and that rent had to fall within the margin of appreciation of the State to legislate and put in place social measures. Furthermore, they noted that the low rent received since 1998 was not a result of the 1979 laws, but of a wrong decision by the RRB which had not been appealed against. They considered that the applicant should have appealed had he considered that the decision was not based on a correct application and interpretation of law. They further noted that despite that decision, since 2010, according to the amended legal regime, the applicant had been entitled to a rent of EUR 185 per year, which in 2012 could have been increased to EUR 246 per year.

The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 37, Series A no. 98; Beyeler v.

In particular, its second paragraph, while recognising that States have the right to control the use of property, subjects their right to the condition that it be exercised by enforcing “laws”. Moreover, the principle of lawfulness presupposes that the applicable provisions of domestic law are sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v.

                "56. Furthermore, a measure aimed at controlling the use of property can only be justified if it is shown, inter alia, to be “in accordance with the general interest”. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the “general” or “public” interest. The notion of “public” or “general” interest is necessarily extensive. In particular, spheres such as housing of the population, which modern societies consider a prime social need and which plays a central role in the welfare and economic policies of Contracting States, may often call for some form of regulation by the State. In that sphere, decisions as to whether, and if so when, it may fully be left to the play of free market forces or whether it should be subject to State control, as well as the choice of measures for securing the housing needs of the community and of the timing for their implementation, necessarily involve consideration of complex social, economic and political issues. Finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, the Court has on many occasions declared that it will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is in the “public” or “general” interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Hutten-Czapska, cited above, §§ 165-166)."

In cases concerning the operation of wide-ranging housing legislation, that assessment may involve not only the conditions of the rent received by individual landlords and the extent of the State ’ s interference with freedom of contract and contractual relations in the lease market, but also the existence of procedural and other safeguards ensuring that the operation of the system and its impact on a landlord ’ s property rights are neither arbitrary nor unforeseeable. Uncertainty – be it legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities – is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State ’ s conduct. Indeed, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time, and in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Immobiliare Saffi v.

Moreover, in situations where the operation of the rent-control legislation involves wide-reaching consequences for numerous individuals and has economic and social consequences for the country as a whole, the authorities must have considerable discretion not only in choosing the form and deciding on the extent of control over the use of property, but also in deciding on the appropriate timing for the enforcement of the relevant laws. Nevertheless, that discretion, however considerable, is not unlimited and its exercise cannot entail consequences at variance with the Convention standards (see, mutatis mutandis, Hutten-Czapska, cited above, § 223, and Amato Gauci, cited above, § 59 )."

In particular, although the property was originally decontrolled and not subject to rent or other contractual restrictions, the applicant subsequently could not exercise his right of use in terms of physical possession, as the house was occupied by tenants who were Maltese citizens and he could not terminate the lease (see, mutatis mutandis, Statileo v. Croatia, no. 12027/10, § 126, 10 July 2014). Thus, while he remained the owner of the property, he was subjected to a forced landlord-tenant relationship for what appears to be an indefinite period of time. He could only bring the lease to an end if his tenants failed to pay the rent or caused considerable damage to the house, or if they otherwise failed to comply with the conditions of the lease or their obligations thereunder, or if they used the premises for a purpose other than mainly as their ordinary residence. The Court further considers that the possibility of the tenants leaving the premises voluntarily was remote, especially since the tenancy could be inherited (despite the disputed application of the definition of tenant, which was varied only slightly by the 2010 amendments). The Government ’ s contention that transfer of the tenancy by inheritance was improbable given that couple C were of an advanced age and currently living alone was not substantiated and remains to be considered as pure speculation. It follows that these circumstances inevitably left the applicant in a state of uncertainty as to whether he would ever be able to recover his property."

                "63. Moreover, the applicant could not increase the rent more than as provided for by the recent amendments. The Court points out that in the application of the 1979 and subsequent amendments to his case, he was in an even worse position as regards the amount of rent payable because of an error in the RRB proceedings, which he admitted (see paragraph 44 above). In fact it is not disputed that the RRB had based its decision on a regime which was not applicable to the property at issue, thus providing a lower rent, and that the applicant had not appealed. In this connection, the Court does not find it necessary to determine whether an appeal before the RRB would have been possible in the instant case, as in any event it has not been contested that, even if the proper law was applied, the RRB could not have awarded more than what was established by law which, according to the applicant, was not a fair amount of rent. It follows, however, that this further pejoration in the rent payable is attributable to him, and the assessment of the proportionality of the measure will thus take into account what he would have received in rent under the applicable regime complained of, as also amended in 2009 and 2010, and not what he actually received. Further, the Court notes that it is not up to it to interpret domestic law, and for the purposes of the present case it can in any event consider that the 2009 and 2010 amendments – slightly improving a landlord ’ s position – applied to the applicant ’ s case. The parties are also in disagreement as to the maximum amount of rent applicable; however, it suffices for the Court to note that in 2013 such rent would not in any event have exceeded EUR 382 annually (see paragraph 44 above), which is less than 1/7 th of the rental market value as established by the Government for that year (EUR 2,900). The Court considers that State control over levels of rent falls into a sphere subject to a wide margin of appreciation by the State, and its application may often cause significant reductions in the amount of rent chargeable (see, in particular, Mellacher and Others, cited above, § 45). Nevertheless, this may not lead to results which are manifestly unreasonable, such as amounts of rent allowing only a minimal profit (see Amato Gauci, cited above § 62)."

Thus, in its balancing exercise the Court will have to determine whether such a degree of tenant protection to the detriment of owners is still justified thirty years after those amendments, that is to say, from 2008 onwards."

Firstly, the Court notes that the documentation provided by the applicant confirms that there is and has been in the last decade a substantial amount of vacant property in the country. Secondly, as admitted by the Government, steps were being taken to phase out controlled leases and that new leases were no longer controlled after 1995. Despite this open regime being in force for nearly two decades, it seems from the statistics submitted by the Government that from 2008 onwards less than 2% of the population were requesting aid for social housing. Regrettably, the Government have not submitted information as to how many tenants still benefit today from protected rents and whether these protected rents are justified in respect of each tenant (see Bittó and Others, cited above, §§ 109-110). In addition, as had been established in other cases (see Amato Gauci, cited above), there has been a rise in the standard of living in Malta over the past decades. It follows from the above that the needs and the general interest which may have existed in 1979 must have decreased over the three decades that ensued. Indeed, as submitted by the Government, the minimum wage in 2008 was EUR 146 a week or EUR 7,592 per year, and in 2013 it was EUR 162 a week or EUR 8,424 per year. The Court further observes that the national minimum pension according to the Social Security Act is, according to circumstances, four fifths (if the husband was maintaining his wife) or two thirds of the relevant minimum wage. It follows that, for example, for the year 2013, even assuming couple C were dependent solely on one individual ’ s minimum wage (EUR 8,424 per year), what they should have paid in annual rent for lodging purposes according to the 1979 amendments (which the Court noted in paragraph 6 3 above could not in any case be more than EUR 382 per year) amounted to less than 5% of their annual income (what they were actually paying amounted to less than 2.2 %).

In assessing the pecuniary damage sustained by him, the Court has, as far as appropriate, considered the estimates provided and had regard to the information available to it on rental values in the Maltese property market during the relevant period. It has further considered the legitimate purpose of the restriction imposed, reiterating that legitimate objectives in the “public interest”, such as those pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see James and Others, cited above, § 54, and Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, § 94, ECHR 2005-VI). However, the situation in the present case might be said to involve a degree of public interest which is less marked than in previous similar Maltese rent-law cases and which does not justify such a substantial reduction compared with the free market rental value (see Amato Gauci, cited above, § 77). It further considers that a one- off payment of 5% interest should be added to the above amount (see Ghigo v. Malta (just satisfaction), no. 31122/05, § 20, 17 July 2008 ). The Court, also bearing in mind that it was because of the applicant ’ s own fault that he was receiving an even lower rent, considers it reasonable to award EUR 11,550, from which must be deducted the sums already deposited in court by couple C in rent since 200 8, which can still be retrieved by the applicant."

As to the expenses relating to the second set of proceedings, while they have not yet been paid, the Court observes that they nonetheless remain due. As to expenses in connection with the proceedings before it, the Court notes the absence of a breakdown of costs, or any details as to the number of hours worked and the rate charged per hour.

In the present case, it had been the sole generally known source of detailed information about accounting methods and had been accessible to businesses in the same way as the Official Gazette.

It had clearly been following the Financial Bulletin, since it had kept its accounts according to the Rules and had changed its accounting method on 1 January 1992, and not on its registration in the Register of Commerce in May 1991.

Even though this provision specified neither the authority entitled to issue the accounting principles nor the legal form under which they should be adopted, the Court accepts the Government’s argument that there was a general authorisation for the Ministry of Finance to regulate accounting pursuant to section 14 of the Socio-economic Information Act, as amended. Under this general authorisation, and in order to clarify the obligations arising from section 25 of the Private Business Activities Act, the Ministry of Finance issued the Rules, which defined two possible forms of book-keeping, and the Regulations, which established, inter alia, the obligation for businesses to increase their income tax base when they passed from single to double-entry book-keeping. The Court adds that even though the increase of the income tax base as such falls into the category of matters governed by tax legislation, it is in fact an accounting operation, the regulation of which was fully within the competence of the Ministry of Finance."

The Court further observes that, although intended for the public, neither the Rules nor the Regulations were published in full or announced in the Official Gazette in the form of a “decree” or “ruling”. They could not, therefore, constitute legislative or regulatory instruments binding on citizens and legal entities in general under the Official Gazette Act. The Court recalls, however, that the term “law” is to be understood in its substantive sense and not in its formal one (see the Kruslin and Huvig v. France judgments of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-A and 176-B, p. 21, § 29, and p. 53, § 28, respectively). It also recalls that the Convention does not contain any specific requirements as to the degree of publicity to be given to a particular legal provision. Furthermore, it is not for the Court to express a view on the appropriateness of the methods chosen by the legislature of a Contracting State, or to decide on whether the manner of publishing tax and accounting principles is compatible with the requirements of Czech law. Its task is confined to determining whether the methods applied by the Contracting State are in conformity with the Convention."

The first, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph and is of a general nature, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, among other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among many authorities, Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, § 44, ECHR 1999 ‑ V, and Vistiņš and Perepjolkins v. Latvia [GC], no. 71243/01, § 93, 25 October 2012)."

Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 58, ECHR 1999-II). The requirement of lawfulness, within the meaning of the Convention, demands compliance with the relevant provisions of domestic law and compatibility with the rule of law, which includes freedom from arbitrariness (see Hentrich v. France, judgment of 22 September 1994, Series A no. 296-A, § 42, and Kushoglu v. Bulgaria, no. 48191/99, §§ 49-62, 10 May 2007 )."

The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole. The requisite balance will not be found if the person concerned has had to bear an individual and excessive burden (see, among other authorities, Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden, 23 September 1982, §§ 69 and 73, Series A no. 52). In other words, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see, for instance, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 50, Series A no. 98).",

Subsequently, while the bailiff service was trying to enforce the ruling of 1 April 2008 and was confronted with a complete lack of cooperation from the tax authorities and the airport administration, on 24 July 2008 Cherkasy City Council authorised the airport administration to sell the aircraft at a public auction. As a result, five of the planes were sold to third parties (see paragraphs 121, 123, 124 and 133 above). As regards the three remaining planes, they had been damaged to such an extent that, as established by technical experts in December 2010 and August 2011, they could no longer be considered as aircraft (see paragraphs 125 and 127 above)."

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint under the Convention.

France judgment of 22 September 1994, Series A no. 296-A, pp. 19-20, § 42, and the Lithgow and Others judgment cited above, p. 47, § 110). The Court observes that in certain respects the statute lacks clarity, particularly in that it leaves open the time-limit for the exercise of a right of pre-emption in the event of an incomplete declaration without, however, indicating how such an omission can subsequently be rectified. Indeed, this seems to have been implicitly acknowledged by the Court of Cassation in its judgment of 16 November 1995 (see paragraph 63 above). That factor alone cannot, however, lead to the conclusion that the interference in question was unforeseeable or arbitrary and therefore incompatible with the principle of lawfulness."

It had not been signed by the real buyer and the place of delivery in Italy had not been indicated. In addition, the RAC held that the communications of 1 and 2 December 1983 could not have started time running for the purposes of the two-month limitation period as they had not been made by the seller and did not satisfy the requirements of Article 57 of the royal decree. The uncertainty as to who the real owner of the painting was had consequently prevented the two-month limitation period from starting to run, bearing in mind, too, that the authorities had had to make inquiries to establish who the owner was and that it was for the person declaring the sale to prove ownership. The RAC considered that the parties had had a duty to declare the sale and that their failure to do so meant that the two-month time-limit was no longer applicable.

In addition, it considered that the fact that the State had twice declined to exercise its right of pre-emption in 1977 was irrelevant as what was in the public interest had to be assessed in the light of the current position and requirements. In that regard it observed that not all the information needed for the purposes of identifying the owner of the painting had been made available to the Ministry, which had thus not been in a position until September 1988 to decide in the light of all the facts whether to exercise its right of pre-emption."

The validity of the transfer is not therefore a decisive factor, given that the exercise of the right of pre-emption does not have the effect of substituting the authorities for the vendor in negotiations between individuals, but rather the – opposite – effect of annulling the sale and constituting an acquisition...",

The Court of Cassation observed in that regard that, even if the first declaration had been invalid, the right of pre-emption could nonetheless have been exercised once the authorities had received all the information required under the statute (pointing out in that connection, as the Consiglio di Stato had already noted, that the Ministry had not exercised its right of pre-emption until it was certain that the painting had been purchased on behalf of Mr Beyeler and in consideration of a sum of money paid by him).

Compensation to which owners of property over which the State exercised its right of pre-emption were entitled was calculated on a different basis from the one used to calculate compensation payable in other cases of expropriation; furthermore, there was no right of judicial review. Although the agreed price stated in the transfer document might constitute sufficient compensation where the pre-emption occurred within the two-month period laid down by the statute, that was no longer true where the right of pre-emption was exercised several years later, as had happened in the instant case. The applicant had also been treated differently from a person who had failed to make a declaration of transfer. The court considered, having regard to section 31(3) of Law no. 1089 of 1939, that where, in the latter type of case, it was impossible to determine the agreed price, the State would have to pay the owner compensation equivalent to the market value of the work."

                "60. In a judgment of 14 June 1995 the Constitutional Court declared the constitutionality issue raised by the Court of Cassation unfounded. It stressed, firstly, the special nature of the provisions of Law no. 1089 of 1939, which were intended to “protect assets related to the fundamental interests of the cultural life of the country”. The special nature of such assets had accordingly justified the authorities' being granted different, more restrictive powers than those they had in respect of other property. Consequently, there had been no discriminatory treatment as the property was different in kind from that concerned in ordinary expropriation proceedings. Nor was there any difference in treatment between cases where an invalid declaration was made and cases where the sale had not been declared, as, even in the latter case, the compensation payable would be the price agreed at the time of the sale. If the agreed price on an undeclared sale was not known, it had to be determined on the basis of any available evidence."

            [
                "61. Furthermore, as regards the appropriate price payable by the State when it exercised its right of pre-emption late, the Constitutional Court reiterated that that issue could not be decided on the basis of the criteria used to determine the amount of compensation in ordinary expropriation proceedings, as the proceedings were of a different kind and the amount paid in situations such as the one in the instant case was, in any event, dependent on a contractual element that had been freely decided by the parties. It followed from this latter point that, under normal circumstances, namely in cases where the right of pre-emption was exercised within the prescribed time-limit, the price, despite being less than the market value, would nonetheless not be derisory or symbolic. Lastly, the Constitutional Court noted that section 61 of Law no. 1089 of 1939 was to be found in the part of the statute dealing with “penalties”. A crucial factor was, therefore, the fact that the owner's economic loss was a consequence of an irregularity or of a failure on his part to declare the sale of the property, thus rendering the sale nugatory and entitling the State to exercise its right of pre-emption at any time. However, as it did not amount to a real criminal or administrative penalty, it was right that the authorities should have a discretion to exercise their right of pre-emption at any time. Moreover, individuals could rectify the position at any time by filing a late declaration.",

However, the Court of Cassation found that the right of pre-emption had properly been ruled to be exercisable at any time and against anyone in possession of the property (reiterating that the authorities had not exercised their right of pre-emption until they had been certain that the painting had been purchased on behalf of the applicant). Moreover, it pointed out that the argument concerning the reference in section 61 to section 32 (which, inter alia, provided for a two-month time-limit) was irrelevant as section 32 contained procedural provisions that also applied to State pre- emptions that were not subject to any time-limit, such as the rule that the State acquired title to property when the pre-emption order was made or the rule that the provisions of a sale agreement did not bind the State.",

It was therefore difficult to see how the public interest would be better served by exhibiting the painting in a public museum than a private one, particularly as the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice was, the applicant argued, capable of looking after works of art equally as well – if not better than – the Italian State, given that the latter had been a victim of a number of thefts including moreover that of the painting in question, which had been stolen from the Modern and Contemporary Art Gallery in Rome. Furthermore, since 1984 the authorities had been corresponding directly with Mr Beyeler, who had satisfied all the requirements made of him; that, in the applicant's submission, proved that the safekeeping of the painting – which was not in any way threatened – had not necessitated the exercise of the right of pre-emption. Moreover, the Ministry had previously waived its right of pre-emption in 1977, for lack of sufficient funds, and, in 1978, had refused a request to export the painting. That refusal had, the applicant maintained, prevented him from exhibiting the painting in a museum which he had been wanting to open for many years near Basle."

The applicant submitted that it could not be considered to be in the public interest for a State to possess a work by a foreign painter who had no connection whatsoever with that State and had never lived there, which was the case of Van Gogh with regard to Italy. To conclude otherwise would have unacceptable consequences for a great many private museums and collections. As was the case with regard to the prohibition on exports of cultural property, the public interest should not be assessed from a purely nationalistic and egotistical standpoint, thereby disregarding another – no less worthy – interest, that of the free international movement of works of art and of international cultural exchanges, particularly in Europe. The Italian authorities had, the applicant alleged, through administrative manipulation, appropriated a work of art belonging to the cultural heritage of another country and thereby breached the principle in a democratic society that the rule of law should prevail over arbitrary acts by the authorities."

As long as the time-limit for exercising the right of pre-emption did not start running, the sale agreement in question could not transfer title to the applicant, so that when the right of pre-emption was exercised it did not affect a right which the purchaser had acquired, but merely thwarted his expectation of completing the purchase."

In that connection the Government emphasised the fact that it was in the public interest for the State to control transfers of works of art which were important for the national artistic heritage and added that in order to do so the State had to be fully informed of the nature of such transfers. The Government also maintained that the painting, which had been brought into Italy in 1910, was part of Italy's artistic heritage for the purposes of Article 4 of the Unesco Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (see paragraph 73 above)."

Such was also the case regarding the declaration of 2 December 1983, which gave the impression that Mr Pierangeli, who was associated with the proposed purchase of the painting, was holding himself out as still having rights in rem over it."

That situation, which arose as a result of the nullity of the sale and the suspension of the two-month time-limit, did indeed amount to a penalty, but was the only means available to the State to compel individuals to submit a declaration in conformity with the statutory requirements. Furthermore, allowing the State to maintain its right to exercise a right of pre-emption was intended to prevent transgressors from obtaining an unfair advantage over persons who complied with the law. It was not true, the Government submitted, that in such a situation the individual remained subject to the State's power of pre-emption indefinitely for, having regard to the conclusions reached by the Constitutional Court, a late declaration by the vendor and purchaser could put an end to such uncertainty and start the two-month time-limit running; however, the applicant had failed to rectify the situation in that way.

It should be noted that the applicant invited the Ministry as early as 2 December 1983, when Mr Pierangeli and the applicant informed it that the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice was intending to purchase the painting, to indicate whether it wished to exercise its right of pre-emption (ibid.)."

                "119. However, after receiving in 1983 the information missing from the declaration made in 1977, that is, the identity of the end purchaser, the Italian authorities waited until 1988 before giving serious consideration to the question of ownership of the painting and deciding to exercise their right of pre-emption. During that time the authorities' attitude towards the applicant oscillated between ambivalence and assent and they often treated him de facto as the legitimate title-holder under the 1977 sale. Furthermore, the considerable latitude left to the authorities under the applicable provisions, as interpreted by the domestic courts, and the above-mentioned lack of clarity in the law made the situation even more uncertain, to the applicant's detriment. That situation allowed the authorities in 1988 to justify exercising the right of pre-emption much later than both the allegedly invalid sale in 1977 and the time (at the end of 1983) when they became aware that the applicant was the true title-holder under the original sale. As the Court of Cassation noted in its order of 11 November 1993, if the authorities could exercise their right of pre-emption at any time the seller's rights would always be restricted, thus creating continual uncertainty as to the legal position with regard to the work (see paragraph 56 above)."

The Court considers that the Government have failed to give a convincing explanation as to why the Italian authorities had not acted at the beginning of 1984 in the same manner as they acted in 1988, regard being had in particular to the fact that, under section 61(2) of Law no. 1089 of 1939 (see paragraph 69 above), they could have intervened at any time from the end of 1983 onwards and in respect of anyone “in possession” of the property (and thus without needing first to determine who the owner of the painting was). That is, moreover, apparent from the judgment of the Court of Cassation of 16 November 1995 (see paragraph 63 above). Thus, taking punitive action in 1988 on the ground that the applicant had made an incomplete declaration, a fact of which the authorities had become aware almost five years earlier, hardly seems justified. In that connection it should be stressed that where an issue in the general interest is at stake it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time, in an appropriate manner and with utmost consistency."

Indeed, the interpretative nature of the norm was evident since it had confirmed one of the possible meanings of the original 1992 text, which had also been upheld in some jurisprudence. The impugned law had been reasonable because it aimed to achieve recognition of an equal and homogenous treatment of all pensioners under the current integrative regimes.

According to the applicants, its sole purpose was to thwart the consolidated interpretative orientation which had been adopted by the domestic courts (including the highest court – the Court of Cassation in its ultimate formation, sitting as a full court), namely that the relevant provisions of the 1992 law did not apply to persons who had retired by 13 December 1990. Following the enactment of Law no. 243/04 the domestic courts were bound to find against the applicants. Thus, the State had influenced the result of proceedings, defining their merit and rendering further hearings useless, violating the independence of the judiciary and interfering in the administration of justice. Indeed, the introduction of the 1997 law only confirmed that the 1992 law had not abolished harmonisation regarding long-standing pensioners. Otherwise there would have been no need to enact such law. Neither would there have been need to intervene again in 2004. The State had felt the need to introduce the 2004 legislation only because the courts had adopted a unanimous orientation in favour of the applicants and persons in their position.

Thus, the general public had not benefited in any way, it was solely the two private banks which had benefited since they were able to recover or save the sums which the domestic judges had deemed to be due to pensioners such as the applicants. Moreover, this law only affected pensioners from the two mentioned banks and thus was consciously directed to affect these specific disputes.

Nor does it guarantee, as such, any right to a pension of a particular amount (see, for example, Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, § 39, ECHR 2004-IX; Domalewski v. Poland (dec.), no. 34610/97, ECHR 1999-V; and Janković v. Croatia (dec.), no. 43440/98, ECHR 2000-X). However, a “claim” concerning a pension can constitute a “ possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 where it has a sufficient basis in national law, for example where it is confirmed by a final court judgment (see Pravednaya v.

The three rules are not, however, “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule” (see, among other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 37, Series A no. 98; Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 55, ECHR 1999-II; and Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 98, ECHR 2000 ‑ I)."

Moreover, any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions can only be justified if it serves a legitimate public (or general) interest. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Terazzi S.r.l. v. Italy, no. 27265/95, § 85, 17 October 2002, and Wieczorek v. Poland, no. 18176/05, § 59, 8 December 2009). Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 also requires that any interference be reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised (see Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, §§ 81-94, ECHR 2005-VI).

Italy, nos. 46286/09, 52851/08, 53727/08, 54486/08 and 56001/08, § 60, 31 May 2011). It finds no reason to deem otherwise in the present case. Reiterating that, because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”, the Court accepts that the enactment of Law no. 243/04 pursued the public interest (harmonising the pension system by treating equally all pensioners)."

In considering whether the interference imposed an excessive individual burden on the applicants, the Court has regard to the particular context in which the issue arises in the present case, namely that of a social security scheme. Such schemes are an expression of a society’s solidarity with its vulnerable members (see, mutatis mutandis, Goudswaard-Van der Lans v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 75255/01, ECHR 2005-XI). Nevertheless, the Court notes that Law no. 243/04 did not affect the applicants’ basic pension, and according to the laws in force their pension was still to be augmented over the years according to a perequazione legale. Accordingly, the applicants only lost the more favourable augmentation according to a perequazione aziendale. Thus, the Court considers that the applicants were obliged to endure a reasonable and commensurate reduction, rather than the total deprivation of their entitlements (see, conversely, Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above § 45)."

Moreover, this reduction only had the effect of equalizing a state of affairs and avoiding unjustified advantages (resulting from the Banco di Napoli employees having previously had more favourable treatment) for the applicants and other persons in their position. Against this background, bearing in mind the State’s wide margin of appreciation in regulating the pension system and the fact that the applicants endured commensurate reductions, the Court considers that the applicants were not made to bear an individual and excessive burden."

The 1922 Rent Act ( Mietengesetz ) which, subject to numerous amendments, remained in force until 1981, provided for the freezing of rents at the 1914 level (section 2). The landlord was entitled to levy extra charges in respect of current costs of administration, taxes, and special equipment ( Betriebskosten, sections 4 and 5). On the conclusion of a new lease he could ask for an increase not exceeding a maximum amount laid down in the law ( Neuvermietungszuschlag, section 16 of the pre-1967 version).",
                "The landlord was obliged to use the income from rent for the normal maintenance costs of the building but he was not required to carry out any improvements (section 6), which, however, could be undertaken with the agreement of the tenants concerned subject to a supplement to the rent to be paid by them (section 5, first sentence). If the necessary maintenance costs were not covered by the rental income of the last seven years, the landlord could ask for an increase in the amount of rent ( erhöhter Hauptmietzins ) to be fixed by the court for a period not exceeding ten years. In that case the landlord was required to use the entire additional rental income during that period for the necessary maintenance measures (section 7)."

                "28. The 1922 Rent Act further provided for a considerable number of restrictions on the landlord ’ s right to terminate a lease (sections 19 to 23). In principle, leases could be terminated only for important reasons (section 19(1)). The Act specified what was to be regarded as an important reason (section 19(2)) and in practice the grounds upon which a lease could be terminated were interpreted in a restrictive manner. The lease did not terminate when the tenant died. The Act provided for a right of succession ( Eintrittsrecht ) of near relatives (spouse, children and adoptive children, brothers and sisters) and other persons who had lived in the household of the tenant (section 19(2)11). When the landlord or near relatives wished to use the apartment in question the contract could only be terminated if there existed an \"urgent need\" (which in practice was interpreted as meaning a \"genuine emergency\"), and if adequate alternative accommodation was made available to the tenant (section 19(2)6).",
                "However, the above restrictions, in particular the restrictions on the claimable amount of rent, were not of general application. No rent restrictions applied to apartments in buildings constructed after 1917 or to certain other apartments including apartments built after the entry into force of the 1922 Rent Act (section 1). A split housing market was therefore created which privileged the owners of newly constructed houses or apartments whose rents were subject only to the general provisions of the Civil Code ( Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch ) concerning the law of contracts.",

This freeze was maintained by Austrian legislation introduced in 1954 ( Zinsstoppgesetz ). In respect of leases in force on 30 June 1954 the freely negotiated rent resulting from an earlier agreement could no longer be increased unless this was authorised by a judicial decision taken by analogous application of the relevant provisions of the 1922 Rent Act concerning rent increases. However, no restrictions applied to new agreements in respect of apartments which did not come within the scope of the 1922 Rent Act, i.e. principally apartments in new houses."

In 1967, an amendment to the 1922 Rent Act ( Mietrechtsänderungsgesetz ) brought about an extensive relaxation of controls in respect of apartments which came within the scope of this Act. As from 1 January 1968 rent restrictions were continued only for earlier leases which remained in force, including leases continued on the basis of the right of succession of a person other than the original tenant. Here the rent freeze continued to operate on the basis of the conversion of each Crown of the 1914 rent into ATS 1 for apartments and into ATS 2 (ATS 3 as from 1 January 1969) for business premises. However, the parties could fix a higher rent by agreement once the lease had lasted more than six months. New leases were no longer subjected to any restrictions on the amount of rent even in respect of apartments which had previously been subject to rent control, provided that these apartments were re-let within six months of the entry into force of the new legislation, or six months after vacation by the previous tenant (section 16(1), new version). The landlord was obliged to use at least half of his additional rent income for maintenance purposes (section 16(2)).",
                "The easing of rent controls led to relatively high rents even for newly let apartments in old houses. The continued rent-freeze in relation to existing leases encouraged a tendency towards the perpetuation of old leases, and a corresponding scarcity of vacant apartments in this category which had repercussions on the free market for new leases. The relatively high rents which could be obtained for newly let apartments in old houses were further boosted by the existence of high rents in the market for newly constructed apartments, which were exempted from the system of rent controls even before 1968. In 1981 a landlord could obtain on the free market up to thirty times the rent frozen at the 1914 level."

While the existing leases in respect of these apartments remained unaffected (even if they were based on a free agreement concluded after 1968), new leases could be concluded as from 1 August 1974 only on the basis of a statutory square metre rent of ATS 4 per month (section 16(3) of the Rent Act as amended in 1974). As this amount was regarded as insufficient by many landlords, they preferred to leave vacant apartments in this category unoccupied, a fact which put an additional strain on the housing market and tended to lead to higher rents for the remaining categories of apartments.",

At the same time, it regarded the fundamental aim of the transitional provisions as being to achieve the gradual and smoothest possible adjustment of existing leases to the new rules. In this connection, it was recognised that this adjustment would be at once the most problematic and at the same time the most urgent part of the transitional arrangements. ...",
                "Undeniably this constitutes an interference with existing leases. Indeed this was the legislature ’ s declared intention.",
                "In this connection it must not be overlooked that the obligation to pay rent for an apartment constitutes a continuing obligation and that in general such obligations are not entirely immune to certain adjustments and changes. ...",
                "Existing legal rights are not covered by the general protection afforded under the Constitution ( VfSlg [ Erkenntnisse und Beschlüsse des Verfassungsgerichtshofes ] 7423/1974: ‘ There is no provision in the Federal Constitution which in principle prevents ordinary legislation from interfering with lawfully acquired rights ’ ). The new provisions are entirely consistent with the legislative policy of bringing existing leases into line with the general system of the reform of the rent legislation and are intended to keep the hiatus between the old and new systems to the minimum. Section 44(2) and (3) of the Rent Act provide an appropriate mechanism for this adjustment. They also enable the landlord to receive 50% more rent than he could charge if the tenant gave notice and he had to re-let the apartment. These provisions are intended merely to prevent the sitting tenant from paying an ‘ unduly high rent ’ in relation to what is considered the reasonable square metre rent, if he is unable or unwilling to terminate the lease and rent another apartment. As the tenant can terminate the lease at any time, the right to obtain the fully agreed rent is in fact limited to the effective duration of the lease. When drafting the transitional provisions in section 44(2) and (3) of the Rent Act, the legislature was guided by the existing rules in Article 934 of the Civil Code, which were already in force when the existing leases were entered into, and by the ideas underlying the Consumer Protection Act ..., and, accordingly, allowed rent to be reduced to one and half times the amount of the newly established reasonable rent .... This power to take the initiative vested in the tenant must not be regarded in isolation but must be seen in the whole context of the new legislation. In granting it, the legislature has neither acted arbitrarily nor exceeded its powers. It has remained within the bounds of the freedom to form legislative policy which, in case of doubt, it must be assumed to have. To place too many limits on this freedom would lead to inflexibility with regard to legal situations and hamper innovations even where necessary.",
                "The possibility available to tenants of applying for a reduction in rent under section 44(2) and (3) of the Rent Act is clearly disadvantageous to landlords who have concluded an agreement on the amount of rent to be paid by the tenant under existing legislation and now find that their confidence in the law has been misplaced. It should however be recognised that this is counterbalanced by a series of provisions as a result of which rent is no longer frozen at the 1914 level (e.g. section 12(3) or section 46(2) of the Rent Act). In addition the possibility of charging maintenance contributions under section 45 of the Rent Act is a measure which facilitates the adjustment of existing leases.",
                "Of course the new system may bring more disadvantages for some landlords and more advantages for others. However, at all events, it is merely a restriction on the right of property ( Eigentumsbeschränkung ) since the rent for a sitting tenant may still exceed the amount chargeable under the new legislation by 50%. The legislature may authorise an expropriation only if such a measure serves the public good and the general interest (see, inter alia, VfSlg 8326/1978; 8083/1977; 7321/1974). Article 5 of the Basic Law provides that an expropriation may be effected only if it is justified in the general interest (see, inter alia, VfSlg 8212/1977; 7238/1973). Although the first sentence of Article 5 of the Basic Law does indeed apply to restrictions on the right of property, the legislature can lay down such restrictions without fear of acting in breach of the Constitution, provided that they do not threaten the very substance of the fundamental right to the inviolability of property or otherwise violate a constitutional principle binding on the legislature ( VfSlg 9189/1981; 8981/1980 etc). But this is not the case of the transitional provisions contained in section 44(2) and (3) of the act which were required by the public interest and for the common good, because they fit into the balanced structure designed to cater for the adjustment of the old system to the new one and are part of the necessary harmonisation leading to the desired objective. Under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention on Human Rights, restrictions on the right of property must be in accordance with the general interest. In its decision of 16 December 1983 (G 46/82-15), the Constitutional Court confirmed the principle laid down in previous decisions that restrictions on the right of property which take account of these principles are not unconstitutional.\" ( Österreichische Immobilien-Zeitung 1983, No. 18, pp. 331-333)",

The re-introduction, in 1974, of legislation regulating the letting of lower quality apartments did not have the desired effects and accentuated the tendency towards apartments being kept vacant. This gave rise to an urgent need to effect an overall reform of the law and to develop a new system for fixing rents.

The difference of 20% is justified by the fact that construction costs have generally been amortised as regards apartments covered by section 16(2). The consecutive 25% abatements in the rent for apartments in classes B, C and D take account of the lower standard and consequently the lower maintenance costs of those apartments and the lower quality of life for the tenants occupying them. These statutory basic rents, including those laid down for class D apartments, are intended to cover the cost of maintaining the apartment at its existing standard.",

In addition, in order to permit the financing of the various maintenance and improvement works, sections 18 and 45 (ibid.) provide for compulsory contributions from the tenants by means of an increase in rent, while section 20 (ibid.) empowers landlords, subject to certain conditions, to charge 20 % of the total of the expenses incurred in carrying out such works.

They stayed for several years on an unofficial site in St Albans. They travelled for some years in the Watford area. They were on the waiting list for a permanent site but were never offered a place. They were constantly moved from place to place by the police and representatives of local authorities. Their children's education was constantly interrupted because they had to move about."

Due to harassment while she led a travelling life, which was detrimental to the health of the family and the education of the children, the applicant bought a piece of land in 1985 with the intention of living on it in a mobile home. The land is within the area of Three Rivers District Council in Hertfordshire where there is no official Gypsy site. The applicant alleges that a County Council official had told her in 1984 when she was encamped on the roadside that if she bought land she would be allowed to live on it. The Government state that there is no record of such a promise being made and that it would be unlikely that such a promise would be made, since it would be for the District Council, not the County Council, to decide any application. The land was also subject to a 1961 discontinuance order requiring the site not to be used for the stationing of three caravans."

He dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the Council as the land was in the Metropolitan Green Belt and he considered that the national and local planning policies should override the needs of the appellant. Since there was no official Gypsy site in the Three Rivers district the family was given fifteen months to move from their land, the Council having stated that a suitable location was being sought for them and that they would be able to move to a new official site within a year."

The applicant applied for planning permission for a bungalow, as it had been stated at the public inquiry that this would be a more appropriate use of the land than a mobile home. Planning permission was refused and the Council's decision was upheld at a further local inquiry. The family remained on the site and the Council served summonses on the applicant and her husband for failure to comply with an enforcement notice. On 18 August 1989 they were both fined 100 pounds sterling (GBP), with costs of GBP 50 in the Magistrates' Court. On 23 February 1990 they were again fined, this time GBP 500 each, with costs of GBP 50. To avoid further court action, the family returned to a nomadic life and were constantly moved from place to place by Council officials. The applicant's eldest daughter had started a hairdressing course at a college of further education and the second daughter was about to start studying at college for a diploma in forestry. Both of these courses had to be abandoned and the two younger children could no longer attend school."

The applicant appealed against them and there was a planning inquiry on 2 November 1993."

                "“15. Local policies in the Hertfordshire County Structure Plan Review of 1986, as revised by the Approved Alterations of 1991 and the Three Rivers District Plan of 1982, reaffirm that Sarratt and the surrounding countryside lie within the Metropolitan Green Belt ... The Structure Plan contains policies also on Landscape Conservation and Gypsy sites. The District Plan shows that the site lies outside the core of the village, but within an Agricultural Priority Area and also, within an Area of Great Landscape Value, now, by virtue of the Structure Plan, termed a Landscape Conservation Area.",
                "19. The appeal site is a deep plot of some 0.77 ha on the frontage of Dawes Lane which leads from Sarratt, a village in the Metropolitan Green Belt; past the site to the west are a few dwellings, a nursery and the Chess Valley. ...",
                "24. From the evidence before me and from my inspection of the site and the surrounding area it is clear to me that the principal issues in these matters are, first, whether the developments for which permissions are sought would be appropriate within the Green Belt and, second, whether there are any very special circumstances in your client's cases which would outweigh the general strong presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt.",
                "25. Structure Plan policies presume against planning permission in the Green Belt, except in very strong circumstances, for the construction of new buildings, including residential caravans, or certain other specified categories of development. Para. 13 of Planning Policy Guidance 2 – Green Belts – states that, inside a Green Belt, approval should not be given, except in very special circumstances, for other than certain categories of appropriate developments. The previous paragraph emphasises the national presumption against inappropriate development within Green Belts.",
                "26. The latest national guidance, in Circular 1/94, on Gypsy Sites and Planning states in the introduction that a main intention of the document is to withdraw the previous guidance indicating that it may be necessary to accept the establishment of gypsy sites in protected areas, including Green Belt sites. Paragraph 13 goes on to say that gypsy sites are not regarded as being amongst those uses of land which are normally appropriate in Green Belts.",
                "27. None of [the applicant's] projects fall within the categories identified as exempt from national or local assumptions against inappropriate development in Green Belts. ...",
                "28. I hold the very firm conviction that none of the developments referred to in these notices could properly and reasonably be regarded as appropriate in the terms of strong national guidance or long established local policies which all seek to protect the value of the Green Belt designation of the area.",
                "29. This site is in a part of the Metropolitan Green Belt, near to a motorway and particularly vulnerable to development pressure. In my judgment the local and national worthwhile policies that seek to protect the Green Belt would undoubtedly be frustrated for a main purpose of Green Belts is to protect the surrounding countryside from further encroachment.",
                "30. As for alternative accommodation for [the applicant], I was referred to the statutory duty of the County Council to provide a site for [the applicant], who is a gypsy resident in the area, to place her caravan; 23 years after statutory requirement to provide better living conditions for gypsies there were not sufficient sites in the County. The Council would save public money by letting [the applicant] remain here and not put another caravan on the roadside; there had never been an official gypsy caravan site in the District, which, in consequence, had not acquired the benefit of a statutorily designated area.",
                "31. [The applicant] also said that the County Council were under a Direction from the Secretary of State for the Environment, under section 9 of the Caravan Sites Act of 1968 to provide further accommodations for gypsies in the County, but the County Council were not able to confirm progress to establish a 15 pitch gypsy caravan site at Langlebury Lane, Langlebury. ...",
                "33. I note that the Council did not refute [the applicant's] comment on caravan site provision in the area, but I do not accept her argument as of sufficient weight to overturn, in the absence of very special circumstances, the cogent planning argument against inappropriate development in the Green Belt here.",
                "35. Your client said that the site had been tidied; rubbish, undergrowth and some neglected buildings had been removed; a building had been renovated. ... The caravans are set further back on the site and partly screened by the previously erected large brick building; moreover they were considerably less conspicuous than the previous mobile home which was stationed close to Dawes Lane. ... As for the caravans, your client said that there were few places from which they are likely to be seen by very many members of the public, apart from drivers on Dawes Lane whose attention was likely to be on traffic conditions.",
                "36. I attach more weight to the fact that this site lies in an attractive setting of mainly sporadic dwellings in extensive grounds and in a designated Landscape Conservation Area. To the north-west is the built-up area of the village and to the south-west attractive open countryside in the Chess Valley; it was agreed that the area is popular for recreational walking and riding.",
                "37. I do not consider that the arguments put forward by [the applicant] would justify allowing residential development of this site. I find no reason to differ from the conclusions of my predecessors who considered that it would be wrong to grant permission for this site in a part of the Metropolitan Green Belt which is particularly vulnerable to development pressure. Whatever the conditions attached to specific grants of permission, stationing a residential caravan here would detract significantly from the quiet rural character and appearance of the site. As well as the caravan itself and the external signs of occupation there would be the activities associated with a family on the site and the comings and goings inevitable with the residential occupation.",
                "40. There is another factor which reinforces, to my mind, rejection of [the applicant's} appeals. Whilst the local planning authority has to consider every application on its merits at the time, these projects, if allowed, would be very likely to encourage similar schemes. The Council would undoubtedly find it more difficult to refuse such other schemes, with this site as a precedent, and those additional developments would cause significant harm to interests of acknowledged importance, which I consider to be unacceptable.",
                "43. At the inquiry in 1987, following enforcement action, the Council told that Inspector that a suitable location for a gypsy caravan site was being sought; [the applicant] would be able to move to the new site within a year. ...",
                "45. It appears that little progress has been made since the appeal in 1987. Paragraphs 30 and 31 above indicate that the information given in 1987 to the Inspector about the provision of gypsy caravan sites in the County was optimistic; estimates among Council officers apparently varied between 1 year and 5 years.",
                "46. I note the Council's statement that [the applicant] had not shown interest in a pitch on a Council caravan site but, to my mind, other factors militate against their argument. First, it is not unreasonable for [the applicant] to wait the outcome of these appeals; second, [the applicant] might not unreasonably have declined to make an application for a caravan pitch site provided by the Council, for, as agreed at this inquiry, she has no prospect of obtaining one. ...",
                "47. ... As I believe [the applicant] to have no better prospect now of obtaining another pitch than in 1987, I shall in the exceptional circumstances of this case, vary the notice, as before, to specify a period of 15 months for compliance with it.”"

With immaterial exceptions, the Secretary of State must, if either the appellant or the authority so desire, give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of State. It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence (see Bryan v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-A, p. 11, § 21). There is a further appeal to the High Court on the ground that the Secretary of State's decision was not within the powers conferred by the 1990 Act, or that the relevant requirements of the 1990 Act were not complied with (section 288)."

It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational ( R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind [1991] Appeal Cases 696, 764 H-765 D). The High Court will also grant a remedy if the inspector's decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors; or made for an improper purpose, in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument.

Compliance with this guidance was essential in fulfilling the Government's objective that Gypsies should seek to provide their own accommodation, applying for planning permission like everyone else.

Furthermore, in reaching their decisions the planning inspectors were constrained by laws and policies applying to land development, which placed, for example, particular weight on the protection of Green Belt areas. The interest of Gypsies in residing on their land was not seen as a useful or indispensable land-use feature and therefore automatically carried much less weight in the domestic balancing exercise.

The Government pointed out that local planning authorities were encouraged to adopt a sympathetic approach to any question of enforcement action under Circular 18/94 (see paragraphs 47-48 above) and that large numbers of caravans on unauthorised sites were tolerated (see the statistics cited in paragraph 53 above).

They pointed out that the applicant took up residence on her land, which was in an Agricultural Priority Area and an Area of Great Landscape Value within the Green Belt, without obtaining, or even applying for the prior planning permission necessary to render that occupation lawful. When she did apply for planning permission, the applicant had the opportunity of presenting the arguments in her favour at hearings before two inspectors, who gave her personal circumstances careful consideration. However, both inspectors found that her occupation of her land was detrimental to the rural character of the site situated in the Green Belt and that this outweighed her interests. The applicant could not rely on Article 8 as giving her preference as to her place of residence greater weight than the general interest.

Because planning inspectors visit the site, hear the arguments on all sides and allow the examination of witnesses, they are better placed than the Court to weigh the arguments. Hence, as the Court observed in Buckley ( judgment cited above, p. 1292, § 75 in fine ), “[ i ]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation”, although it remains open to the Court to conclude that there has been a manifest error of appreciation by the national authorities. In these circumstances, the procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has, when fixing the regulatory framework, remained within its margin of appreciation. In particular, the Court must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8 (see Buckley, cited above, pp. 1292-93, § 76)."

This would be tantamount to imposing on the United Kingdom, as on all the other Contracting States, an obligation by virtue of Article 8 to make available to the Gypsy community an adequate number of suitably equipped sites. The Court is not convinced, despite the undoubted evolution that has taken place in both international law, as evidenced by the framework convention, and domestic legislations in regard to protection of minorities, that Article 8 can be interpreted as implying for States such a far-reaching positive obligation of general social policy (see paragraphs 93-94 above)."

When considering whether a requirement that the individual leave his or her home is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, it is highly relevant whether or not the home was established unlawfully. If the home was lawfully established, this factor would self-evidently be something which would weigh against the legitimacy of requiring the individual to move. Conversely, if the establishment of the home in a particular place was unlawful, the position of the individual objecting to an order to move is less strong.

The decision of the court to declare the relevant administrative procedures and land sale contracts of 1994-97 unlawful was taken in accordance with the Restitution Act and the well-established practice of the Supreme Court and of the Constitutional Court of Lithuania.

The Court observes that although the Law on Restitution II did not explicitly intend to declare an earlier sale of the State ’ s land as invalid, there already existed the established practice of the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 13 and 3 3 above).

To that end, the legislation should make it possible to take into account the particular circumstances of each case, so that individuals who have acquired their possessions in good faith are not made to bear the burden of responsibility, which is rightfully that of the State which confiscated those possessions. In other words, the risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State, and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Gladysheva v.

As to the “the classification of remedies” rule relied on by the Government, the Court notes that right from its first appeal the applicant company's claim was based on a Community norm that was perfectly clear, precise and directly applicable. That right did not disappear with the Conseil d'Etat 's judgment of 1986 and, consequently, survived during the second set of proceedings. Further, the Court reiterates that the fact that the Conseil d'Etat relied on a long-standing principle cannot by itself justify a failure to comply with the present requirements of European law (see, mutatis mutandis, Delcourt v. Belgium, judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, p. 19, § 36). It points out in that connection that the Convention is a living instrument that must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions and the notions currently prevailing in democratic States (see, among other authorities, Burghartz v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 280-B, p. 29, § 28). The procedural rule regarding the “classification of proceedings” cannot therefore cause a substantive right created by the Sixth Directive to disappear."

                "Under the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 5 thereof, the French State is required to take all appropriate measures to ensure fulfilment of its obligations under the Treaty. These include an obligation to nullify all the illegal consequences of a violation of Community law either directly or, in default, by providing effective reparation for the resulting damage. It follows that the fact that a taxpayer which alleges that it has been taxed on the basis of a statutory provision that is incompatible with the objectives of a Community directive has first referred the issue of taxation to the tax court, which refused to accept that such incompatibility could serve as a cause of action, cannot by itself render inadmissible a claim made by the taxpayer on the basis of the obligations arising under the aforementioned Treaty for reparation for the damage it has sustained as a result of a failure to transpose the objectives of the directive into domestic law.",

Although the Ninth Directive of 26 June 1978, which was notified to the French State on 30 June 1978, granted France an extension of time – until 1 January 1979 – in which to transpose the provisions of the Sixth Directive, it is construed by the Court of Justice of the European Economic Communities as having no retroactive effect. Thus, the provisions of Article 256 of the General Tax Code as worded prior to 1 January 1979 requiring payment of value-added tax on insurance broking activities of the type carried on by the Jacques Dangeville company were for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978 incompatible with the objectives set by the Sixth Directive. Accordingly, contrary to the Administrative Court 's decision, the applicant company's claim that the State is liable for the situation that has thus arisen and should be ordered to make good the loss it has sustained as a result of the illegal situation brought about by its being required to pay value-added tax for the above-mentioned period is well-founded.",

Thus, the damage for which the company is entitled to claim reparation is equal to the amount of the value-added tax it paid for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978 and comes to FRF 129,845.86.”"

The claim by S.A. Jacques Dangeville which the Administrative Court of Appeal examined in the impugned judgment was for payment of 'compensation' in an amount equal to the amount of value-added tax that had thus been paid, by way of reparation for the 'damage' which that tax liability had caused the company to sustain, on the ground that that damage was attributable to the French State's delay in transposing the objectives of the Directive into domestic law. It follows that, as submitted by the Minister of the Budget, the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the fact that the company '[had] first referred the issue of taxation to the tax court' did not render inadmissible a claim for reparation in which the only alleged damage was the damage resulting from the payment of the tax.

Thus, before 30 June 1978 it was unable to afford the French authorities a defence for their failure to enact provisions complying with the objectives of the Sixth Directive on time.",

Accordingly, it is to that extent necessary to rule that those provisions of Articles 256 and 261-4-1 o were inapplicable for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978. It follows that the submission by the S.A. Revert et Badelon firm, which carries on an activity as insurance brokers, that there was no basis in law for the demand for it to pay value-added tax on its business dealings during the period from 1 April to 30 June 1978 is well-founded.",

Subsequently, the applicant company was rightly charged value-added tax for the period from 1 July to 31 December 1978 on the basis of the provisions of Articles 256 and 261-4-1 o of the General Tax Code that remained applicable.",

The Court has thus acknowledged, in the interests of legal certainty which protects both the taxpayer and the authority concerned, that the setting of reasonable limitation periods for bringing proceedings is compatible with Community law. Such periods cannot be regarded as rendering virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Community law, even if the expiry of those periods necessarily entails the dismissal, in whole or in part, of the action brought (see, in particular, Case 33/76 Rewe v. Landwirtschaftskammer Saarland [1976] ECR 1989, paragraph 5, Case 45/76 Comet v. Produktschap voor Siergewassen [1976] ECR 2043, paragraphs 17 and 18, and Case 261/95 Palmisani v. Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale [1997] ECR I-0000, paragraph 28) ... The reply to the seventh question must therefore be that Community law, as it now stands, does not prevent a Member State which has not properly transposed the Directive from resisting actions for the repayment of charges levied in breach thereof by relying on a limitation period under national law which runs from the date on which the charges in question became payable, provided that such a period is not less favourable for actions based on Community law than for actions based on national law and does not render virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Community law.”",

Postponement of the date of entry into force of a measure of general application, although the date initially specified has already passed, is in itself liable to undermine that principle.

Article 56 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community dated 25 March 1957, which does not contain any provision empowering bodies of the European Communities to make regulations on public-policy grounds that are directly applicable in the member States, provides that the coordination of provisions laid down by law or regulation 'providing for special treatment for foreign nationals on grounds of public policy, public security or public health' shall be assured by directives issued by the Council on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the Assembly. It is clear from Article 189 of the Treaty of 25 March 1957 that while such directives are binding upon each member State 'as to the result to be achieved' and while in order to achieve the prescribed results the national authorities are required to adapt the legislation and regulations of the member States to comply with the directives addressed to them, it is solely for those authorities to determine the form implementation of the directives will take and to decide, subject to supervision by the domestic courts, how to give effect to the directives in domestic law. Thus, regardless of any instructions they may contain for the member States, directives cannot be pleaded in aid of appeals by nationals of those States against individual administrative acts. It follows that Mr Cohn- Bendit's submission to the Paris Administrative Court in support of his application for an order quashing the Minister of the Interior's decision of 2 February 1976, on the ground that it contravened the provisions of the Directive issued on 25 February 1964 by the Council of the European Communities with a view to coordinating, in accordance with the conditions laid down by Article 56 of the Treaty of Rome, the special measures taken to control the movement and residence of aliens on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, is unfounded. Accordingly, in the absence of any contention that the regulatory measures taken by the French Government in order to comply with the directives issued by the Council of the European Communities are unlawful, the decision to be taken on Mr Cohn- Bendit's appeal cannot under any circumstances turn upon the interpretation of the Directive of 25 February 1964. It follows, without there being any need to examine the grounds of the appeal, that the Minister of the Interior's submission is well-founded, namely the Paris Administrative Court erred in its impugned judgment of 21 December 1977 in referring to the Court of Justice of the European Communities the issues concerning the interpretation of that Directive and staying the proceedings pending the Court of Justice's decision ...”"

Article 5-1 of the Directive of the Council of the European Communities dated 19 December 1972, which was issued with a view to implementing those provisions with regard to manufactured tobacco and the provisions of Article 30 of the Treaty, which prohibits quantitative restrictions and all measures having equivalent effect, provides: 'Manufacturers and importers shall be free to determine the maximum retail selling price for each of their products. This provision may not, however, hinder implementation of the national systems of legislation regarding the control of price levels or the observance of imposed prices.' As the Court of Justice of the European Communities ruled in finding infringements in its judgments of 21 June 1983 and 13 July 1988, the only provisions whose application is reserved by Article 5-1 of the Directive are provisions of national legislation of a general nature that are intended to curb increases in prices. The aforementioned provisions of section 6 of the Law of 24 May 1976 confer on the government a special power to fix the price of tobacco imported from member States of the European Community, independently of the application of the national legislation regarding the control of price levels. They thus enable the government to fix the sale price of imported tobacco in conditions that were not contemplated by Article 5-1 of the Directive of 19 December 1972 and are incompatible with the objectives set out in that Directive. It follows from this that Article 10 of the decree of 31 December 1976 referred to above, which was issued on the basis of section 6 of the Law of 24 May 1976, which must be regarded as inapplicable, is itself devoid of statutory basis.

Consequently, French courts will refuse to apply French law if it is contrary to European law. In other words, they carry out a form of verification of the compatibility of the statute with Community law that is very similar to a review of constitutionality. Basically, the reasoning of the Court of Cassation extends the principle established by Article 55 of the Constitution that international treaties take precedence over statutes. The Court of Cassation relies on two series of arguments: firstly, implicit in the initial treaties is a move towards abandonment of sovereignty by the States and the creation of genuine supra-sovereignty in favour of the Community bodies. Secondly, since the national courts are responsible for applying the provisions emanating from that supra-sovereignty directly, they cannot give precedence to domestic law as, in this system, it is necessarily infra-sovereign (Court of Cassation, Société des cafés Jacques Vabre, 24 May 1975 ...).",

It has shown itself to be 'essentially a national jurisdiction, which is persuaded of the excellence of the national system and has resolved to act as the guardian of national legality' (C.-A.

Firstly, it has proscribed all verification of the compatibility of legislation with Community law: according to a Government Commissioner, the administrative courts 'may not criticise or disregard a statute, even on the ground that it violates international law or, more particularly, Community law'. Secondly, on a more specific point, the Conseil d'Etat has chosen not to follow the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities that has blurred the distinction between regulations and directives... The Conseil d'Etat affirms, on the contrary, [that] 'regardless of any instructions they may contain' [directives] cannot be pleaded in aid of an application for review of an individual act. Directives do, however, impose an obligation on the national authorities to adapt their legislation and regulations so as to comply with the directive (see Cohn- Bendit, cited above).

It also had a legitimate expectation of recovering its debt. From 1 January to 30 June 1978 the French value-added tax (VAT) legislation had contravened Community law as set out in Article 13-B-a of the Sixth Directive of 17 May 1977. The applicant company pointed out that the administrative circular of 2 January 1986 had been issued before the Conseil d'Etat 's judgment of 19 March 1986 dismissing its appeal. It had therefore been on the basis of that administrative circular that its second appeal, alleging both fault on the part of the State for failing to transpose the Sixth Directive into domestic law and strict State liability for failing to maintain equality between public burdens, had been lodged.",

In addition, the administrative courts did accept jurisdiction to verify the compatibility of international and French norms, as the new precedent laid down in 1996 in S.A. Revert et Badelon did no more than to apply a line of authorities that dated back to 1989 to tax proceedings ( Conseil d'Etat, 20 October 1989, Nicolo, Recueil 190). The Conseil d'Etat had in several earlier decisions held that the State's responsibility was engaged in the event of a violation of Community law, in particular, if it was at fault for allowing an illegal situation to develop through the incompatibility of a domestic measure with a community directive (Judicial Assembly of the Conseil d'Etat, 28 February 1992, Arizona Tobacco Products and S.A.

It followed that the judgment of the Administrative Court of Appeal was not an isolated authority and, indeed, it was only overturned by the Conseil d'Etat on procedural grounds based on the “classification of proceedings” rule ( principe de la distinction des contentieux ).",

                "Lastly, since the implementation of the administrative circular of 1986 had created a difference in treatment between taxpayers of the same category, it afforded at minimum a basis on which the applicant company could lay claim to its debt by a second application for compensation (see National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII).

There were two primary reasons why the applicant company's new appeal could not succeed. Firstly, its action had been brought on the basis that the tax authorities had been at fault in imposing the tax, whereas the existence of any such fault was necessarily excluded by the Conseil d'Etat 's ruling in its judgment on the first appeal that the tax in issue had been lawfully levied. As regards the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal's judgment of 1 July 1992 allowing the applicant company's appeal, the Government argued that it was not in line with the case-law at the time the second appeal was lodged. Secondly, the Government referred to the “classification of remedies” rule ( règle de la distinction des voies de recours ), which, as the Conseil d'Etat had held in its judgment of 30 October 1996, precluded the applicant company from successfully bringing an action in tort after failing in its tax appeal."

As regards compliance with the lawfulness requirement, the Government said in particular that the claim had been dismissed on the basis of established jurisprudential principles applicable to both private and public law. In ruling that the applicant company's claim was estopped per rem judicatam as a result of its first judgment of 1986, the Conseil d'Etat had applied the “classification of remedies” rule, which prevented a party from bringing an action under the general law of tort for a remedy it had been refused under a special procedure. The justification for the rule lay in the need to ensure compliance with special rules applicable to contentious proceedings, or at least to prevent their being circumvented in a way that rendered them meaningless. Without such a rule, there was a risk of identical situations been treated differently and of a direct breach of the res judicata rule.

Industriministeriet [1997] ECR I-6783), the CJEC now accepted that, subject to certain conditions, it was for the domestic legal system of each member State to lay down the detailed procedural rules for actions seeking the recovery of sums wrongly paid. The “classification of remedies” rule was not, therefore, at variance with the CJEC's case-law.",

With regard to the judgments of the Conseil d'Etat, the Court notes that the Government's case is based on the application of an established jurisprudential principle, namely the “classification of remedies” or “classification of proceedings” rule. The rule prevents a claim being brought under the general law of tort for a remedy that has previously been refused in a special form of action. According to the Government, the Conseil d'Etat had merely applied that rule when it held that the first judgment of 1986 gave rise to an estoppel by record.",
                "With regard to the argument concerning the application of the “classification of remedies” rule, the Court need only refer to its preceding observations (see paragraph 47 above) and sees no reason to adopt a different approach when assessing the “general interest”. Furthermore, in the circumstances of the present case the Conseil d'Etat 's particularly strict interpretation of that procedural rule deprived the applicant company of the sole domestic procedure that was capable of affording it a sufficient remedy to ensure compliance with the provisions of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Miragall Escolano and Others v. Spain, nos. 38366/97, 38688/97, 40777/98, 40843/98, 41015/98, 41400/98, 41446/98, 41484/98, 41487/98 and 41509/98, § 38, ECHR 2000-I).",
                "The Court can discern no other reason that could serve to justify on general-interest grounds the Conseil d'Etat 's refusal to give effect to a directly applicable provision of Community law. As to the CJEC's Fantask judgment cited by the Government (see paragraph 54 above), the Court fails to see why it should offer any justification either, since it deals with time-limits for appeals and reliance on limitation periods under national law to resist actions for repayment of charges when they become payable, and not, as in the instant case, a refusal to take the right to reimbursement itself into account (see paragraph 36 above)."

In any event, the Court notes that the interference resulted not from any legislative intervention, but on the contrary from the legislature's failure to bring the domestic law into line with a Community directive, such that the relevant administrative courts were forced to rule on that issue. The Court can but note that charging VAT on the activities of insurance brokers for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978 contravened Article 13-B-a of the Sixth Directive of the Council of European Communities of 17 May 1977. The French authorities sought to render French law compliant by issuing the administrative circular of 2 January 1986. In its judgment of 19 March 1986, the Conseil d'Etat likewise failed to have due regard to the effects of the incompatibility of French law with Community law, notwithstanding the applicant company's failure to draw its attention to that point. The Court further notes that the Conseil d'Etat 's case-law regarding verification of the conformity of national law with international law has substantially evolved since 1989 (see paragraphs 39-40 above) and that the applicant company successfully appealed to the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 21-22 above).",
                "It further notes that the domestic authorities appear to have had difficulty in comprehending Community law, a fact that is, incidentally, confirmed by the Conseil d'Etat 's reference in its S.A. Revert et Badelon decision to “... [the] failure [of the French authorities] to enact provisions that were consistent with the objectives of the Sixth Directive on time”. Thus, the administrative circular bringing French law into line with the Sixth Directive was not issued until 2 January 1986, that is to say more than seven years after the Ninth Directive was notified to the French State (see paragraph 11 above), and in any event concerned only those taxpayers who had refused to the pay the VAT concerned. It is true that the Government have explained that by not referring to the case of taxpayers who had already paid the VAT, the administrative circular left open the possibility of a court action for reimbursement. However, the Conseil d'Etat did not share that view, as it dismissed the applicant company's first appeal more than two and a half months after the administrative circular was issued. Lastly, the Court notes that the Court of Cassation – the highest ranking judicial court – has for its part already accepted that it has jurisdiction to verify whether a domestic norm is consistent with international law (see paragraph 41 above). In the Court's view, the applicant company cannot be required to suffer the consequences of the difficulties that were encountered in assimilating Community law or of the divergences between the various national authorities."

Nor was the interference justified by the 1996 judgment, as the Conseil d'Etat had dismissed the applicant company's second appeal merely on the grounds that it was inadmissible, without ruling on the merits. The applicant company submitted that no estoppel by record had arisen, since there had been no identity of subject matter between its actions for restitution of the VAT and in tort: the former was based on the failure to transpose the Sixth Directive within the prescribed period, while the latter concerned the application of invalid statutory provisions.",

Revert et Badelon. It therefore contended that it had been a victim of the difficulties caused by the Conseil d'Etat 's case-law, which it said constituted an “individual and excessive burden” such that “the fair balance which should [have been] struck between the protection of the right of property and the requirements of the general interest [had been] upset” (see Hentrich v.

Firstly, the fact that the applicant company had restricted its action to a tax appeal had not deprived it of the possibility of asserting its rights. Secondly, to have made an exception would have meant unreasonably undermining the principle of legal certainty. Lastly, the Government noted that, since the applicant company had shown that the “classification of remedies” principle was relative in its effects, in particular owing to the requirement for identity of subject matter, it could have taken that factor into account when preparing its second appeal and based its claim not on the VAT paid, an issue that had been dealt with in 1986, but on the commercial and financial damage actually sustained. Thus, the inadmissibility of the applicant company's appeal was the result of its choice of cause of action and had by no means been inevitable.",
                "The administrative circular was based on an objective difference in the situation of the companies concerned. Furthermore, it had not placed exempted companies in a radically different situation from those that were not: companies such as the applicant company that had been charged VAT could deduct the VAT they had paid and pass it on to their customers, notably by increasing the prices they invoiced for their services. While it was true that the exempted companies had the benefit of the unpaid VAT, the corollary of that was that they could not pass it on to their customers. The complaint was therefore in any event manifestly ill-founded."

The applicant company submitted that by adopting the administrative circular abandoning proceedings against companies that had not paid the VAT, the authorities had been guilty of discrimination by giving those who had defaulted on their tax an advantage over law-abiding taxpayers; that discrimination had been compounded by the authorities' failure to take action to refund the sums which the law-abiding taxpayers had paid in error.",
                "It pointed out that in National & Provincial Building Society, the Court held that there had been no violation after noting that the applicant building societies had failed to take proceedings challenging the regulations in issue and were accordingly not in the same situation as that of the Woolwich Building Society. It noted that although in Fredin v. Sweden the Court had found no violation of Article 14, on the ground that different classes of complainants could be created (judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 192), it had ruled that a distinction made to the detriment of persons whose situations were similar was discriminatory (see Darby v. Sweden, judgment of 23 October 1990, Series A no. 187). In the instant case, the applicant company said that it was in an identical situation to all those companies carrying on business as insurance brokers who had not paid VAT for 1978 by the time the administrative circular was issued on 2 January 1986. The difference in treatment was directly attributable to the administrative circular, which excluded from its ambit only those businesses that had paid VAT voluntarily. While it was true that the latter were entitled to request a refund of the VAT, the Conseil d'Etat had dismissed the applicant company's claim for such a refund. In practice, an application for judicial review of the administrative circular, which as a regulatory circular was in any event not amenable to such review, would have had no effect.",
                "The applicant company argued that the administrative circular did not pursue a legitimate aim and that the means used were not reasonably proportionate to the aim pursued. If the purpose of the administrative circular had been to transpose the Sixth Directive of 1977 into domestic law, there was no justification for the difference in treatment between the companies concerned by the Sixth Directive. Those companies that had voluntarily paid the VAT, even though it had been levied unlawfully, had not received any benefit in exchange.",
                "Lastly, the applicant company contended that it had received less favourable treatment than S.A. Revert et Badelon. Both companies had paid the same tax, made an initial claim for a refund, appealed to the administrative court and, following the dismissal of their claims, lodged almost simultaneous appeals to the Conseil d'Etat in 1982. The Conseil d'Etat had dismissed the applicant company's appeal in 1986, whereas S.A. Revert et Badelon's appeal papers had been lost and consideration of the appeal consequently delayed until it was set down for hearing at the same session as the applicant company's second appeal. The Conseil d'Etat reached different decisions in the two cases, notwithstanding the fact that the legal position of the two companies was identical, the sole difference being that S.A. Revert et Badelon's case file had been mislaid by the Conseil d'Etat for several years. The appeal by S.A. Revert et Badelon was not heard until ten years after the applicant company's and it benefited from favourable developments in the case-law."

                "65. The Government considered that neither the decisions of the Conseil d'Etat nor the administrative circular adopted on 2 January 1986 by the tax authorities amounted to discrimination. The decisions in the applicant company's case and in S.A. Revert et Badelon did not concern the same issue of law or appellants in identical situations. The European Court of Human Rights had held that there could be no discrimination unless the difference in treatment concerned persons in identical situations (see Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, and Johnston and Others v. Ireland, judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112). The Government noted that the appeals lodged concurrently with the applicant company's first appeal had likewise been dismissed. Nonetheless, the Government accepted that the 1986 decisions of the Conseil d'Etat on the applicant company's appeal and its decision on Revert et Badelon's appeal were at variance. The reason for the difference was that the Conseil d'Etat, which in this instance had identical arguments before it, decided in the second case – which, ten years after the first, raised the same question of law – to depart from its previous case-law. Changes in the case-law, which by definition entailed a conflict between decisions delivered before and after the change, could not be regarded as violating Article 14. For them to be regarded otherwise would be contrary to the Court's traditional interpretation of the provisions of Article 14 (see Case relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium (merits), judgment of 23 July 1968, Series A no. 6).",
                "The Government said that the indisputable effect of the administrative circular of 2 January 1986 was to put the applicant company in an ostensibly less favourable position than that of the companies referred to in the circular. As the “ Belgian linguistic ” case showed, the Court took into consideration the extent of the difference in treatment and whether it was proportionate to the situation of the persons concerned. The States thus enjoyed a margin of appreciation that varied according to the circumstances, the domain and the background (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98). In the instant case the administrative circular had been issued because of the primacy of the Community norm, in accordance with an undertaking given to the Commission of the Communities. The circular was therefore in the public interest and satisfied an existing legal obligation, but without depriving the companies concerned of their prospects of recovering the tax in the pending legal proceedings. Furthermore, the difference in treatment was based on an objective difference in the situation of the companies concerned. Some of the companies had decided not to seek a refund of the tax, while others had made an application to the courts for a refund which, in view of the genuine doubt as to the validity of the tax liability, the authorities had, as in the instant case, quite legitimately left for the courts to decide in the proceedings that were pending at that stage. Lastly, the authorities had logically enough, in view of the high degree of uncertainty over their outcome, chosen not to issue proceedings against those companies that had simply refrained from paying the tax. The Government noted that the Court had recognised that it was legitimate for public authorities to treat companies differently, depending on whether or not the company concerned had chosen to bring proceedings (see National & Provincial Building Society, cited above).",
                "Lastly, the Government argued that the difference in treatment had to be put into perspective, since companies which, like the applicant company, had paid the VAT had enjoyed an exemption from employment tax and had been able to pass on all or part of the VAT to their customers, unlike the companies that had not paid the VAT."

Secondly, the applicant company has produced witness statements that show that, owing to the nature of its activity, it could not pass on the VAT to its customers (see also, on this point, paragraphs 22 and 69 above).

                "The Government pointed out that the claim filed by the applicant under Law no. 112/1995 had resulted in the decision of 24 March 1998 ordering part of the house at issue to be returned to the applicant and awarding him compensation for the part not returned. That compensation was sufficient to debar the applicant from continuing to claim to be the victim of a violation (if any) of his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. Although the proceedings were still pending as the applicant had appealed to the courts against the refusal to make full restitution, the Government submitted that it was not open to the courts to determine the case in a manner less favourable to the applicant than the decision of 24 March 1998."

He also emphasised that it had never been his wish to give up the property in question in return for compensation and that in any event the amount of the proposed compensation was derisory in view of the value of the house. The fact that he had been awarded such compensation could not, therefore, deprive him of his status as a victim, a status which he had had and still possessed."

                "50. It is the settled case-law of the Court that the word “victim” in the context of Article 34 of the Convention denotes the person directly affected by the act or omission in issue, the existence of a violation of the Convention being conceivable even in the absence of prejudice; prejudice is relevant only in the context of Article 41. Consequently, a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a “victim” unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see, among other authorities, the Lüdi v. Switzerland judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 18, § 34).",

                "As to the complaint concerning the applicant’s right of property, the application for restitution made after the Supreme Court of Justice’s judgment has not yet been finally determined. Although the decisions already delivered in the course of those proceedings – which are not in themselves the subject of complaint before the Court – tend somewhat to ameliorate the applicant’s position by returning part of the house in question to him and compensating him for the part not returned, and although it is not impossible that the applicant’s claim to have the whole house returned to him may eventually succeed, the fact remains that the basis of those proceedings was precisely the situation created by the Supreme Court of Justice’s judgment, namely the acceptance that the house had become State property again. As a result, those proceedings cannot in any event entirely efface the consequences of the Supreme Court of Justice’s judgment for the applicant’s enjoyment of his right of property, since if the house is returned to him this will be done under different legal provisions from those underlying the complaint now before the Court.",
                "The Court observes, moreover, that the applicant’s complaints do not only concern the Supreme Court of Justice’s interference with his right of property but also relate to an alleged violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention caused by the same judgment. The applicant may unquestionably claim to be a victim owing to the quashing of a judicial decision which was in his favour – a decision which had become final – and to the ruling that the courts had no jurisdiction to entertain actions for recovery of possession such as the one he had brought. It remained impossible to bring actions for recovery of possession before the courts for several years.",
                "Even if, as a result of new rules and the Supreme Court of Justice’s change of position, that legal avenue is now available in such circumstances, the Court considers that it would be onerous to require the applicant to bring the same action for a second time, particularly as, in view of the contradictory decisions emanating from the Romanian courts, the outcome of a new action for recovery of possession remains uncertain, regard being had to the principle of res judicata.",

Although that remedy had existed before the Commission declared the application admissible, it had become effective only after the entry into force of Law no. 112/1995 (as interpreted by government decision no. 11/1997) and Law no. 213/1998 on public property and after the Supreme Court of Justice had departed from its own previous decisions on 28 September 1998."

Italy judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 13-14, § 27).

He also argued that the Supreme Court of Justice’s dictum that he was not the owner of the property at issue was in contradiction with the ground on which it had allowed the application to quash the earlier decisions, namely that the courts had no jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the case."

                "94. Applying this principle to the instant case, the Court considers that the taking of control of the applicant credit union ’ s business by the receiver could in itself be regarded as falling within that margin of appreciation, as it was not established by the applicant credit union that the responsible State authorities had lacked a reasonable suspicion that its financial situation required them to impose receivership. However, on the facts of the present case, in which the applicant credit union was denied access to its business documents (see paragraph 90) and was unable subsequently to challenge that denial before a court, this aspect of the imposition of the receivership under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 remains subject to the Court ’ s review for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Once the State was in full control of the applicant credit union ’ s business, thus substantially reducing the threat constituting the reason for placing it in receivership, the Court, having regard to the fact that the Government did not put forward any arguments to justify the denial in question, sees no reason which would dispense the State from affording the applicant credit union a reasonable opportunity to have access its business documents or to contest the denial before a court."

This conclusion makes it unnecessary to ascertain whether the other requirements of that provision have been complied with (see Iatridis, cited above, § 62). The Court thus expresses no opinion on the question whether the statutory requirements for the imposition of receivership were met in the instant case or on the issue of whether the impairment struck a fair balance between the applicant credit union ’ s rights and the demands of the general interest of the community."

On 11 January 2000 the Office for the Supervision of Credit Unions ( Úřad pro dohled nad družstevními záložnami ) (“the OSCU ”) placed the applicant credit union in receivership ( nucená správa ) for a period of six months under section 28(3)(c) of the Act, on the ground that it had contravened the legislation in question, having engaged in activities outside its remit without authorisation. A receiver ( nucený správce ) was appointed to replace the applicant credit union ’ s decision-making bodies. The OSCU was acting under section 27(1) of the Act read in conjunction with section 26(2) of the Banks Act ( zákon o bankách )."

Referring to an audit of the applicant credit union ’ s activities, the OSCU noted that the applicant credit union had on 6 May 1999 concluded three contracts with S7, a limited liability company, under the terms of which the latter had assigned to the applicant credit union receivables due to it from two debtor companies, amounting to CZK 126,235,132 (EUR 3,366,582 [2] ) in total, for an agreed price of CZK 14,431,000 (EUR 384,862 ). The OSCU ruled that the applicant credit union had thereby purchased the receivables of a third party by effectively covering the latter ’ s debt. It qualified the transaction as a loan to a third party. Since section 3 of the Act prohibited credit unions from providing loans to non-members, the OSCU concluded that the applicant credit union had acted in flagrant breach of the Act."

The OSCU ruled that these transactions were also illegal, as section 1(6) read in conjunction with section 3 of the Act did not allow credit unions to acquire securities other than public bonds ( dluhopisy ), municipal bonds ( komunální obligace ) or mortgage bonds ( hypoteční zástavní listy )."

The share of the applicant credit union had thus amounted to only 3.07%. It followed that the receivership order could not be justified by concerns about the stability of the credit union industry as such.

Shareholders had the right to take part in the management of the credit union and in the composition of its statutory and supervisory bodies and therefore had the means to influence the credit union ’ s activities and its financial results, whereas the customers of banks, at whom the provisions on receivership in the Banks Act were primarily directed, did not."

It had considered itself able to honour its outstanding debts in respect of shareholders ’ terminated deposits. The applicant credit union ’ s current accounts had amounted to CZK 31,500,000 (EUR 840,078 ) and its funds available within two months had represented CZK 45,000,000 (EUR 1, 200,111 ).

It therefore amounted to control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Given the serious crisis in the credit union sector at the relevant time and the large - scale, illegal deficiencies and irregularities in the management of the applicant credit union, consisting mainly of providing loans and dealing in securities contrary to the Act, and the instability of the vast majority of credit unions at the material time, the Government further asserted that the impairment of the applicant credit union ’ s rights had been proportionate to the legitimate aim of stabilising the relevant financial market, the system of insurance of deposits and the protection of depositors ’ interests. They maintained that for the above - mentioned reasons the receivership order had had to be issued immediately and hence without giving the applicant credit union an opportunity to remedy its financial situation.

They referred to other breaches of the Act and of the capital adequacy, liquidity and solvency requirements found in the impugned decisions of the OSCU. The Government finally asserted that the poor financial situation of the applicant credit union had been caused by the unprofessional and illegal conduct of its management, some of whose members had been prosecuted for these acts. Therefore, for the reasons outlined above, the State had had to replace the management with a receiver."

Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, cited above, with further reference to Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 58, ECHR 1999-II)."

The requirement of lawfulness, within the meaning of the Convention, presupposes, among other things, that domestic law must provide a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 84, ECHR 2000-XI). Furthermore, the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measures affecting fundamental rights be, in certain cases, subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent body competent to review the reasons for the measures and the relevant evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, Al- Nashif v. Bulgaria, no. 50963/99, § 123, 20 June 2002). It is true that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 contains no explicit procedural requirements and the absence of judicial review does not amount, in itself, to a violation of that provision (see Fredin v. Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 192, § 50 ). Nevertheless, it implies that any interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must be accompanied by procedural guarantees affording to the individual or entity concerned a reasonable opportunity of presenting their case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by this provision. In ascertaining whether this condition has been satisfied, a comprehensive view must be taken of the applicable judicial and administrative procedures (see Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, § 45, ECHR 2002-IV with further references )."

Turning to the specific facts of the case, the Court observes that the receiver, exercising the powers of the statutory organ of the applicant credit union during the receivership, was in full control of all of its business and accountancy documents showing its overall financial situation. Whilst exercising those powers he was the sole person entitled to grant access to those documents. He was nevertheless not obliged to do so under the law then in force. According to the applicant credit union, he denied its supervisory board access to the documents in question. The Government did not dispute that allegation."
            ],
            [
                "91. The Court notes that the financial situation of a given entity is one of the decisive factors in the decision to impose receivership. Accordingly, it plays a central role in any subsequent review of such a decision and is often determinative of its outcome. Therefore, it is indispensable, in the Court ’ s view, for any entity intending to contest a decision to place it in receivership to have access to all of its documents and other materials which may be of assistance in substantiating and establishing its appeal against such a decision. Business and accountancy documents fall within that category. It is true that the right to such access is not an absolute one, as there may be competing interest at stake. However, any limitation must not impair the very essence of that right. Otherwise the right to appeal decisions on receivership would be somewhat illusory, as an appellant would not have any reasonable opportunity of contesting those rulings and adducing evidence in support of its allegations. This is particularly so in proceedings where the decision whether to grant access to business and accountancy documents rests with a receiver, an employee of a regulatory authority who is appointed under the decision imposing receivership. In such cases, whether or not an entity has a reasonable opportunity of challenging the receivership to which it is made subject is determined by a receiver appointed, removed from office and employed by the State authority whose decision the entity intends to contest. In this situation, the executive branch of the State can frustrate any reasonable attempt to contest the imposition of receivership by means of a decision denying access to indispensable documents, which is not amenable to review. Taking into account the gravity of a decision to impose receivership and its consequences for an entity operating on the financial market, such denials must be, in the Court ’ s view, subject to judicial scrutiny by an independent tribunal and not just by an employee of the executive branch of the State. Applying these principles in the instant case, the Court finds that none of the above - mentioned requirements regarding the denial of access to the applicant credit union ’ s documents was met in respect of the review of the decision of 11 January 2000 imposing the receivership. It follows that the applicant credit union was deprived of the procedural guarantees affording it a reasonable opportunity of presenting its case to the responsible authorities with a view to effectively challenging the decision to place it in receivership."

The Court notes that the applicant credit union did not allege that the denial of access continued when it challenged the decisions of 12 July 2000 and 12 July 2001 extending the receivership. However, the only legal avenue by which the applicant credit union could dispute the receivership had ceased to exist by that time, as its supervisory board lost its standing to appeal with the entry into force of the amendment to the Act on 1 May 2000. The Court ’ s conclusion with regard to the decision adopted on 11 January 2000 therefore also applies mutatis mutandis to those two decisions."

Poland ( dec .), no. 30417/96, § 85, ECHR 2002-X (extracts)) and that in certain situations – especially in the context of a credit union crisis such as the one facing the Czech Republic at the relevant time – there may be a paramount need for the State to act in order to avoid irreparable harm to a credit union, its depositors and other creditors, or credit unions and the financial system as a whole. Nevertheless, if such margin were limitless, the rights embodied in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 would become illusory. Therefore, it has to be construed so as to guarantee to individuals that the essence of their rights is protected."

            [
                "94. Applying this principle to the instant case, the Court considers that the taking of control of the applicant credit union ’ s business by the receiver could in itself be regarded as falling within that margin of appreciation, as it was not established by the applicant credit union that the responsible State authorities had lacked a reasonable suspicion that its financial situation required them to impose receivership. However, on the facts of the present case, in which the applicant credit union was denied access to its business documents (see paragraph 90) and was unable subsequently to challenge that denial before a court, this aspect of the imposition of the receivership under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 remains subject to the Court ’ s review for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Once the State was in full control of the applicant credit union ’ s business, thus substantially reducing the threat constituting the reason for placing it in receivership, the Court, having regard to the fact that the Government did not put forward any arguments to justify the denial in question, sees no reason which would dispense the State from affording the applicant credit union a reasonable opportunity to have access its business documents or to contest the denial before a court."

                "95. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the interference with the applicant credit union ’ s possessions was not surrounded by sufficient guarantees against arbitrariness and was thus not lawful within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, H.L. v. the United Kingdom, no. 45508/99, § 124, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX). This conclusion makes it unnecessary to ascertain whether the other requirements of that provision have been complied with (see Iatridis, cited above, § 62). The Court thus expresses no opinion on the question whether the statutory requirements for the imposition of receivership were met in the instant case or on the issue of whether the impairment struck a fair balance between the applicant credit union ’ s rights and the demands of the general interest of the community."

The Court reiterates that for the determination of civil rights and obligations by a tribunal to satisfy Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the tribunal in question must have jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before it (see Terra Woningen B.V. v. the Netherlands, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, § 52; Chevrol v. France [GC], no. 49636/99, § 77, ECHR 2003-III; and I.D. v. Bulgaria, no. 43578/98, § 45, 28 April 2005). It is to be therefore examined whether the imposition of receivership by the OSCU was subject to direct review by a court with full jurisdiction (see British ‑ American Tobacco Company Ltd v. the Netherlands, judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 331, §§ 84-87, and I.D., cited above, § 53). In doing so, the Court should confine itself as far as possible to examining the question raised by the case before it. Accordingly, it should only decide whether, in the circumstances of the case, the relevant national authorities had jurisdiction required by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention ( Fischer v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, § 33). The Court recalls in this regard that the lack of full jurisdiction by a court might be found, in the particular circumstances of a given case, to be compatible with Article 6 of the Convention. In assessing the sufficiency of a judicial review available to an applicant, it is necessary to have regard to matters such as the subject-matter of the decision appealed against, the manner in which that decision was arrived at and the content of the dispute, including the desired and actual grounds of appeal (see Bryan v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335 ‑ A, § 45)."

The gathering of evidence and its assessment, i.e. establishing the facts of the case, was thus exclusively reserved for the OSCU. The audit was made accessible to applicant credit union on 10 January 2000, thus triggering the five-day limit under Section 17 of the State Control Act for the latter to contest it by raising objections. Pursuant to Section 18 thereof the objections raised by the applicant credit union were dealt with by an employee of the OSCU. His/her decision may have been contested before the head of the OSCU within 15 days of its service on the applicant credit union. Application of the Code of Administrative Procedure in that procedure was expressly excluded by Section 26 of the Act, however. There was no other administrative remedy against the finding of the audit. Whilst it is true that the decision imposing the receivership based on the aforementioned finding could, and indeed was, appealed before the Ministry of Finance, the audit, i.e. the finding as to the facts, was not reviewed as the Ministry found that it had been taken by the OSCU under the State Control Act and the former was therefore bound by it. The facts as assessed by the OSCU were not reviewable in administrative proceedings by any other administrative authority.",

Hence, the OSCU was an authority subordinated to and dependent on the Ministry, which forms part of the executive branch and cannot therefore be deemed to be an independent and impartial tribunal conforming to the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.",

It further notes that the application of that legislation by administrative courts was found by the Constitutional Court in 2001 incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention, as, in that court ’ s view, administrative courts were not empowered to quash unlawful decisions but merely those which were illegal. The Court further notes that the newly adopted Code of Administrative Court Procedure, providing for full scrutiny of the law and the facts, entered into force on 1 January 2003.

They asserted that the administrative courts also occasionally reviewed factual aspects of a given case. The examination of the applicant union ’ s case by the High Court prior to delivery of the judgment of 21 June 2002, consisting in detailed scrutiny of the objections raised by the applicant union against the decision of the OSCU imposing the first receivership order, proved that such a practice by the national courts was possible.

Austria, judgment of 21 September 1993, Series A no. 268 ‑ A, § 31-32 and Fischer v. Austria, cited above, § 34 ). By way of contrast, the Court found violations of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in other cases where the domestic courts had considered themselves bound by the prior findings of administrative bodies which were decisive for the outcome of the cases before them, without examining the relevant issues independently (see Obermeier v. Austria, judgment of 28 June 1990, Series A no. 179, pp. 22-23, §§ 69-70; Terra Woningen B.V., cited above, pp. 2122-23, §§ 52-55; I.D., cited above, §§ 46 and 50-55; and Capital Bank AD v.

The Court found a violation of the right to access to a court where the applicant could not challenge before a court an assessment of facts in a decision adopted by an administrative authority acting within its discretionary power (see Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ IV, § 74).

Firstly, the applicant credit union contested the legal assessment of the OSCU declaring the transactions entered into by the applicant credit union contrary to the Act. Secondly, it was asserted in the appeal that the OSCU, deciding entirely within its discretion provided for by the Act, imposed on the applicant credit union a disproportionate measure when opting for receivership, although other less strict measures were available under the Act. According to the applicant credit union, that decision was partly due to an erroneous assessment of the facts, namely of its economic standings, by the OSCU.",

Admitting that receivership was the strictest measure available under the Act, it held that that legislation reserved for the OSCU acting within its discretionary power the decision as to what measure to adopt in case of breach of the Act ’ s provisions. Instead of ruling on the question of proportionality of the receivership, it only confined itself to the verification whether the OSCU did not act beyond its discretionary power as reserved by the Act when imposing the receivership.

Moreover, the national courts had found that the actions of the administrative authorities had been unlawful and breached her legitimate expectations; she had also obtained compensation of LTL 2,000 (approximately EUR 600 ) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. In this connection the courts, inter alia, noted that the violation of the applicant ’ s rights had been serious, through no fault of her own, and that the authorities had taken no action to remedy the situation as soon as possible.

France, 25 June 1996, § 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, and Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, § 44, ECHR 1999-VI)."

However, the courts held that the plot had been attributed to her unlawfully, therefore she had no legal grounds to a full satisfaction of her claim for pecuniary damage (see paragraph 19 above). In that connection the Court reiterates that although a party can no longer claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention only where the national authorities have acknowledged a violation and their decision also constitutes appropriate and sufficient redress (see Holzinger v.

Greece, no. 62503/00, § 23, 11 December 2003). In that connection the Court observes that almost three years had passed since the decision of the Supreme Court in the applicant ’ s case before she was granted the new plot of land (see paragraph 20 above). Even though it can be accepted that the award of a new plot of the same size compensated the applicant for the loss of LTL 76,000, that measure seemingly being not timely raises an issue of compliance with Article 1 of the Protocol No. 1 to the Convention."

In these circumstances, and having regard to the State ’ s margin of appreciation, the Court accepts that the deprivation of property experienced by the applicant served not only the interests of the original owners of the land in question, but also the general interests of society as a whole (see Bečvář and Bečvářová v. the Czech Republic, no. 58358/00, § 67, 14 December 2004, and Padalevičius, cited above, § 65 )."

To that end, the legislation should make it possible to take into account the particular circumstances of each case, so that individuals who have acquired their possessions in good faith are not made to bear the burden of responsibility, which is rightfully that of the State which has confiscated those possessions."

Thus, the unlawful act of selling the property to the applicant is attributable to the authorities of the present State, and not that of the Soviet regime (see, mutatis mutandis, Gashi v.

The procedures for the sale of the land were conducted by official bodies exercising the authority of the State (see paragraphs 6-7 above ) and the land purchase agreement was signed between the applicant and the Kaunas Region Administration under the standard conditions. The Court considers that the applicant had very limited opportunities, if any, to influence the terms of the contract or the purchase price, as this was within the State ’ s exclusive competence (see, mutatis mutandis, Gladysheva v.

The underlying public interest in such cases is to restore justice and respect for the rule of law (see Mohylová, cited above, and Velikovi and Others, cited above, § 201)."

Basic banks had separate legal personality, but were integrated into the organisational structure of one of the nine associated banks. As a rule, basic banks were founded and controlled by socially owned companies based in the same territorial unit (that is, in one of the Republics – Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia – or Autonomous Provinces – Kosovo and Vojvodina – of the SFRY). Socially owned companies were the flagship of the Yugoslav model of self-management: neither private nor State-owned, they were a collective property controlled by their employees, based on a communist vision of industrial relations (the phenomenon and the current status of such companies in Serbia, where they continue to exist, has been described in R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, §§ 71-76 and 97, 15 January 2008). Two or more basic banks could form an associated bank.

In response, the SFRY introduced a system for “redepositing” foreign currency, allowing banks to transfer citizens’ foreign-currency deposits to the NBY, which assumed the currency risk (section 51 of the Foreign-Currency Transactions Act 1977 [9] ). Although the system was legally optional, in practice the banks did not have another option as they were not allowed to maintain foreign-currency accounts with foreign banks, which were necessary to make payments abroad, nor were they allowed to grant foreign-currency loans. Virtually all foreign currency was therefore redeposited with the NBY according to one of the following two methods: either the “accounting” or “pro forma” method, or the method of actual transfer of foreign currency to foreign accounts of the NBY. The accounting method was used far more often, as it enabled commercial banks to shift currency risks to the NBY without having to pay fees to foreign banks (see Kovačić and Others v. Slovenia [GC], nos. 44574/98, 45133/98 and 48316/99, § 36, 3 October 2008; see also decision AP 164/04 of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 1 April 2006, § 53). According to an internal report of the NBY of September 1988 [10], by 30 June 1988 an equivalent of approximately USD 9 billion had been redeposited with the NBY, of which only around USD 1.4 billion (that is, slightly above 15%) had been physically transferred to the NBY’s many foreign accounts. It would appear that the funds in the NBY’s foreign accounts have recently been divided among the successor States (see paragraph 65 below)."

Pursuant to a series of agreements (between Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo and Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana, the National Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the National Bank of Slovenia), Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo was to transfer every month to the National Bank of Slovenia, for the account of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana, any difference between the foreign currency deposited and the foreign currency withdrawn. Some of those funds were transferred back to Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo at the request of that bank in order to meet its liquidity needs (during periods when more foreign currency was withdrawn than deposited). Indeed, in the period from 1984 to 1991, DEM 244,665,082 was transferred to Ljubljana and DEM 41,469,528 (that is, less than 17%) back to Sarajevo. The funds which had not been transferred back to Sarajevo were redeposited with the NBY according to one of the two methods described in paragraph 17 above: the “accounting” or “pro forma” method (in which case there is no proof that the funds actually left Ljubljana), or the method of actual transfer of foreign currency to foreign accounts of the NBY. Regardless of the redepositing method used, all those funds were recorded as a claim of Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo against the NBY."

On 1 January 1990 Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo, mentioned above, thus became a branch (without legal personality) of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana; the latter assumed the former’s rights, assets and liabilities.

For example, as of December 1990, when the amendment to section 71 of the Foreign-Currency Transactions Act 1985 came into force, savers could withdraw their savings only to pay for imported goods or services for their own or their close relatives’ needs, to purchase foreign-currency bonds, to make testamentary gifts for scientific or humanitarian purposes, or to pay for life insurance with a local insurance company. In addition, section 3 of the SFRY government’s decision of April 1991 [12], which was in force until February 1992, and section 17(c) of the NBY’s decision of January 1991 [13], which the Constitutional Court of the SFRY declared unconstitutional in April 1992, limited the amount that savers could withdraw or use for the above purposes to DEM 500 per transaction, but not more than DEM 1,000 per month (see paragraph 53 below).",

Slovenia thus undertook to repay original deposits and interest accrued by 31 December 1990 at the original rate, as well as interest accrued from 1 January 1991 until 31 December 1992 at an annual rate of 6% (section 2 of the Old Foreign-Currency Savings Act 1993). As regards the period thereafter, the interest rate depended on whether a depositor had opted for government bonds or cash. The depositors were entitled to obtain either government bonds, which were to be amortised by 2003 in twenty biannual instalments and earned interest at an annual rate of 5%, or cash from the banks in which they had money, together with interest at the market rate plus 0.25% in ten biannual instalments.

Though the Tribunal does not conclude that Article 19 in connection with paragraph II of Annex I absolutely obligates either side to reach an agreement, it is of the opinion that the terms of these provisions require the parties to negotiate, bargain, and in good faith attempt to reach a result acceptable to both parties and thus bring an end to this long drawn out controversy ...",

This is true, even though the dispute extends not only to the amount of the claims but to their existence as well. The principle of settlement is not thereby affected. Article 19 does not necessarily require that the parties resolve the various legal questions on which they have disagreed. For example, it does not contemplate that both sides are expected to see eye to eye on certain points separating them, such as whether the disputed claims legally exist or not, or whether they are government or private claims. As to these points, the parties, in effect, have agreed to disagree but, notwithstanding their contentions with regard to them, they did commit themselves to pursue negotiations as far as possible with a view to concluding an agreement on a settlement.",

As enunciated by the International Court of Justice, it confirms and gives substance to the ordinary meaning of ‘negotiation’. To be meaningful, negotiations have to be entered into with a view to arriving at an agreement. Though, as we have pointed out, an agreement to negotiate does not necessarily imply an obligation to reach an agreement, it does imply that serious efforts towards that end will be made.”"

                "“The Court notes that the meaning of negotiations for the purposes of dispute settlement, or the obligation to negotiate, has been clarified through the jurisprudence of the Court and that of its predecessor, as well as arbitral awards. As the Permanent Court of International Justice already stated in 1931 in the case concerning Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland, the obligation to negotiate is first of all ‘not only to enter into negotiations, but also to pursue them as far as possible, with a view to concluding agreements’. No doubt this does not imply ‘an obligation to reach an agreement’ ( Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland, Advisory Opinion, 1931, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 42, p. 116; see also Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 68, para. 150), or that lengthy negotiations must be pursued of necessity ( Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 13). However, States must conduct themselves so that the ‘negotiations are meaningful’. This requirement is not satisfied, for example, where either of the parties ‘insists upon its own position without contemplating any modification of it’ ( North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany/Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany/Netherlands), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 47, para. 85; see also Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 67, para. 146) or where they obstruct negotiations, for example, by interrupting communications or causing delays in an unjustified manner or disregarding the procedures agreed upon ( Lake Lanoux Arbitration (Spain/France) (1957), Reports of International Arbitral Awards (RIAA), Vol. XII, p. 307). Negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement also imply that the parties should pay reasonable regard to the interests of the other ( Fisheries Jurisdiction (United Kingdom v. Iceland), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 33, para. 78). As for the proof required for finding of the existence of bad faith (a circumstance which would justify either Party in claiming to be discharged from performance), ‘something more must appear than the failure of particular negotiations’ (Arbitration on the Tacna-Arica Question (Chile/Peru) (1925), RIAA, Vol. II, p. 930). It could be provided by circumstantial evidence but should be supported ‘not by disputable inferences but by clear and convincing evidence which compels such a conclusion’ (ibid.). ”",

It further took into account the obligation of successor States under international law to settle together all aspects of succession by agreement (see paragraphs 36 and 58 of the admissibility decision). As to the issue of compatibility ratione materiae, the Chamber found it established on the evidence that there was no reason to doubt that the applicants did indeed have “old” foreign-currency savings in the amounts indicated by them. It also held that the applicants’ claims had survived the dissolution of the SFRY for a number of reasons (see paragraphs 52-55 of the admissibility decision).

The applicants and the banks under consideration had entered into civil-law contracts which entitled the applicants to withdraw their savings at any time, either from one of the branches or directly from the headquarters (pursuant to Yugoslav civil law, banks were liable for the debts of their branches). Admittedly, all foreign-currency deposits had been guaranteed by the SFRY, but the guarantee had never been activated as the banks under consideration had remained solvent until the dissolution of the SFRY. Liability had thus not shifted from the banks to the SFRY. Accordingly, the question at stake regarding the applicants’ savings was not a succession issue. They were of the opinion that the Slovenian and Serbian Governments should be held responsible for the debts of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana and Investbanka respectively, since they were responsible for those banks’ inability to service their debts. Notably, the Slovenian government had, by virtue of law, transferred most of the assets of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana to a new bank (see paragraph 49 above); the Serbian government had written off the debts of State-owned companies to Investbanka in order to be able to privatise them and gain millions in profit."

Sweden, 23 September 1982, § 61, Series A no. 52; Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 55, ECHR 1999-II; Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, § 44, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; Broniowski v.

                "99. Turning to the present case, it is to be observed that as a result of different measures adopted at national level the applicants have not been able to use their savings for more than twenty years. While, initially at least, the freezing of the bank accounts could be viewed as intended to control the use of their possessions in the sense of the third rule, it may be questioned whether the fact that their deposits remained unavailable for such a long period did not amount to a “deprivation” in the sense of the second rule. However, bearing in mind the findings in paragraphs 77 to 81 above that the legislation of the respondent States did not extinguish the applicants’ claims or otherwise deprive them of legal validity, as well as those States’ acceptance in principle that deposit holders such as the applicants should also be able to dispose of their savings, it cannot be said that the applicants have been formally deprived of their savings. For the same reasons, the Court does not find that the subject matter could be regarded as clearly amounting to de facto expropriation. Against this background, and in view of the complexity of the legal and factual issues involved in this case, the Court considers that the alleged violation of the right of property cannot be classified as falling into a precise category (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 106, ECHR 2000 ‑ I, and Zolotas v. Greece (no. 2), no. 66610/09, § 47, ECHR 2013).

However, by virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, each Contracting Party “shall secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”. The discharge of this general duty may entail positive obligations inherent in ensuring the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, those positive obligations may require the State to take the measures necessary to protect the right of property (see Broniowski, cited above, § 143, with further references, and Likvidējamā p/s Selga and Vasiļevska v.

The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. Whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty of the State or in terms of an interference by a public authority which needs to be justified, the criteria to be applied do not differ in substance. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. It also holds true that the aims mentioned in that provision may be of some relevance in assessing whether a balance between the demands of the public interest involved and the applicant’s fundamental right of property has been struck. In both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention (see Broniowski, cited above, § 144, with further references)."

                "102. In the present case, the applicants complained of their inability to withdraw their savings from their accounts with the banks in question. Their deposits had become unavailable owing to such factors as the lack of funds in the relevant banks, the imposition by law of a freezing of the accounts and the failure by national authorities to take measures with a view to enabling deposit holders in the applicants’ situation to dispose of their savings. This state of affairs may well be examined in terms of an interference with the effective exercise of the right protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 or in terms of a failure to secure the exercise of that right (see Zolotas, cited above, §§ 40, 47 and 53, where the Court found that the measure complained of constituted an interference and also found that the respondent State had certain positive obligations). Having regard to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court considers it unnecessary to categorise its examination of the case strictly as being under the head of positive or negative obligations of the respondent States. The Court will determine whether the conduct of the respondent States – regardless of whether that conduct may be characterised as an interference or as a failure to act, or a combination of both – was justifiable in view of the principles of lawfulness, legitimate aim and “fair balance” (see Broniowski, cited above, § 146).",

The second sentence of the first paragraph authorises a deprivation of possessions “subject to the conditions provided for by law” and the second paragraph recognises that States have the right to control the use of property by enforcing “laws”. Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. The principle of lawfulness also presupposes that the applicable provisions of domestic law are sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application (ibid., § 147, with further references)."

Similarly, in cases involving a positive duty, there must be a legitimate justification for the State’s inaction. The principle of a “fair balance” inherent in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 itself presupposes the existence of a general interest of the community. Moreover, it should be reiterated that the various rules incorporated in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are not distinct, in the sense of being unconnected, and that the second and third rules are concerned only with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. One of the effects of this is that the existence of a public interest required under the second sentence, or the general interest referred to in the second paragraph, are corollaries of the principle set forth in the first sentence, so that an interference with the exercise of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 must also pursue an aim in the public interest (see Beyeler, cited above, § 111)."

Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures to be applied in the sphere of the exercise of the right of property. Since the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies is wide, the Court will respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is in the public interest, unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Broniowski, cited above, § 149, with further references). The Court has already held that this logic applies necessarily to such fundamental changes as the dissolution of a State followed by a war, phenomena which inevitably involve the enactment of large-scale economic and social legislation (see Suljagić, cited above, § 42)."

According to the Serbian Government, the aim was to protect the liquidity of the State funds in the light of the difficult economic situation and financial collapse the country was going through (see paragraph 91 above). The other respondent States did not comment on this issue. However, the Court is prepared to accept that following the dissolution of the SFRY and the subsequent armed conflicts, the respondent States had to take measures to protect their respective banking systems and national economies in general. In view of the overall size of the “old” foreign-currency savings, it is clear that none of the successor States was able to allow the uncontrolled withdrawal of such savings. The Court will thus proceed to examine the key issue, namely whether a “fair balance” has been struck between the general interest and the applicants’ rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

In other words, in each case involving an alleged violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court must ascertain whether by reason of the State’s action or inaction the person concerned had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden. In assessing compliance with that requirement, the Court must make an overall examination of the various interests in issue, bearing in mind that the Convention is intended to safeguard rights that are “practical and effective”. In that context, it should be stressed that uncertainty – be it legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities – is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State’s conduct.

Furthermore, pursuant to the SFRY civil law and the companies register, all branches of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana and Investbanka had been acting on behalf and for the account of the parent banks at the time of the dissolution of the SFRY. Therefore, the Chamber concluded that Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana and Investbanka had remained liable for the “old” foreign-currency savings in all their branches until the dissolution of the SFRY (see Ališić and Others v.

The domestic law and practice set out in paragraphs 44, 45, 49 and 51 above undoubtedly confirm that.

Nevertheless, domestic courts, both in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Slovenia, held that the impugned wartime entry in the companies register had always been unlawful (see paragraphs 30-35 and 51 above). It was thus deleted from the register. The Court sees no reason to disagree with the domestic courts in this regard. Indeed, the Court has held on many occasions that it is primarily for domestic courts to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic law so that the role of the Court is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Waite and Kennedy v.

In this regard, the Court reiterates that a State may be responsible for debts of a State-owned company, even if the company is a separate legal entity, provided that it does not enjoy sufficient institutional and operational independence from the State to absolve the latter from its responsibility under the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Mykhaylenky and Others v.

The key criteria used in the above-mentioned cases to determine whether the State was indeed responsible for such debts were as follows: the company’s legal status (under public or private law); the nature of its activity (a public function or an ordinary commercial business); the context of its operation (such as a monopoly or heavily regulated business); its institutional independence (the extent of State ownership); and its operational independence (the extent of State supervision and control)."

It is moreover crucial that by virtue of an amendment to the 1991 Constitutional Act, Slovenia transferred most of that bank’s assets to a new bank, to the detriment of the bank and its stakeholders (ibid.). The State thus disposed of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana’s assets as it saw fit (compare Khachatryan, cited above, § 51). The Grand Chamber therefore agrees with and endorses the Chamber’s finding that there are sufficient grounds to deem Slovenia responsible for Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana’s debt to Ms Ališić and Mr Sadžak.

The Court considers the present case to be special for the following reasons. Firstly, when the applicants deposited their money, the SFRY still existed and the branches in question were not foreign branches. Moreover, Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana was State-owned even before its rehabilitation. Indeed, both that bank and Investbanka have always been either State-owned or socially-owned. The present case is thus evidently different from a standard case of rehabilitation of an insolvent private bank. The EFTA Court’s judgment on which the Slovenian Government relied is of little relevance in the present case as it concerned the rehabilitation of a failed private bank in the particular legal framework applicable to Iceland.

                "131. The Court has held on many occasions that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. Although the scope of the Contracting States’ obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint, the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law. The “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the “authority” referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Furthermore, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 157, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI)."

However, the Slovenian Government have failed to demonstrate that at least one such judgment has been enforced. There is therefore no evidence to date that this remedy was capable of providing the applicants with appropriate and sufficient redress."

The Court has taken note of the Slovenian Government’s argument that there was no obligation to provide a domestic remedy in the present case, in so far as Article 13 did not require a remedy whereby the laws of a Contracting State could be challenged before a national authority as being themselves contrary to the Convention. While that interpretation of Article 13 is correct (see Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 32555/96, § 137, ECHR 2005 ‑ X; Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 27996/06 and 34836/06, § 60, ECHR 2009; and Paksas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 34932/04, § 114, ECHR 2011), the present applicants did not in fact complain of the domestic legislation of the respondent States or indeed about any single decision or measure.

Such measures must also be taken as regards other persons in the applicants’ position, notably by solving the problems that have led to the Court’s findings (see Lukenda v. Slovenia, no. 23032/02, § 94, ECHR 2005 ‑ X). This obligation has been emphasised by the Committee of Ministers in the supervision of the execution of the Court’s judgments (ResDH(97)336, IntResDH(99)434, IntResDH(2001)65 and ResDH(2006)1)."

In order to facilitate effective implementation of its judgments, the Court may adopt a pilot-judgment procedure allowing it to clearly identify structural problems underlying the breaches and to indicate measures to be applied by the respondent States to remedy them (see Resolution Res(2004)3 of the Committee of Ministers on judgments revealing an underlying systemic problem of 12 May 2004; Rule 61 of the Rules of Court; and Broniowski, cited above, §§ 189-94). The aim of that procedure is to facilitate the speediest and most effective resolution of a dysfunction affecting the protection of the Convention rights in question in the national legal order (see Wolkenberg and Others v. Poland (dec.), no. 50003/99, § 34, 4 December 2007). While the respondent State’s action should primarily be aimed at resolving such a dysfunction and at introducing, if necessary, effective remedies for the violations in issue, it may also include ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements. The Court may decide to adjourn the examination of similar cases, thus giving the respondent States a chance to settle them in such various ways (see, for example, Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, § 127, ECHR 2009).

These substances are generated, inter alia, by the biological and chemical decomposition of waste. The risks of explosion and fire are mainly due to the large proportion of methane in the biogas. The risk of an explosion occurs when the level of CH 4 in the air is between 5% and 15%. If the level rises above 15%, methane will catch fire but will not explode."

The Chamber’s assessment, characterised by its failure to test the criteria of “immediacy” and “reality” in relation to the danger posed by the municipal rubbish tip, had not been sufficient to justify the finding of a violation, which had been based on the consideration that the authorities should have taken preventive measures or intervened immediately and appropriately.",

In this connection, the Government disputed any allegation that the mayors in question had been granted impunity. They argued that the fact that Article 230 of the Criminal Code had been the only provision applied in the mayors’ case had been due to the “specific nature of the offence defined in that Article”, which applied solely to public officials, and that the trial court had imposed the statutory minimum penalty because there were other presumed co-principals who had not been indicted."

Seeing that this policy effectively established an amnesty for breaches of town-planning regulations, including the unlawful occupation of public property, it must have created uncertainty as to the extent of the discretion enjoyed by the administrative authorities responsible for applying the measures prescribed by law, which could not therefore have been regarded as foreseeable by the public."

In the specific circumstances of this case, neither the criminal-law process nor the administrative-law action had complied with the procedural obligations under Article 2 or proved capable of affording appropriate redress for the applicant’s complaints. In the first place, the criminal proceedings were conducted in such a way that the focus was shifted from the all-important life-endangering aspect of the case to a determination of whether or not the mayors could be held liable for “negligence in the performance of their duties”. Secondly, the compensation awarded to the applicant by the administrative court did not at all correspond to the applicant’s real loss.

Likewise, it did not fall to the Court in Strasbourg to question the verdict reached by a domestic court on the basis of the material before that court, unless it intended to go so far as to substitute what it considered to be a proper verdict. The Government observed that neither the Convention nor its case-law compelled the authorities to secure the conviction of a defendant. The Chamber’s suggestion that the verdict handed down against the mayors was tantamount to granting them almost total impunity had ignored both this point and the national authorities’ discretion to classify criminal charges in the light of the circumstances of a particular case, including situations like the one obtaining in the present case, where the applicant had never complained that the mayors were guilty of unlawful killing through negligence."

He had in fact capitalised on his new dwelling, firstly by renting it out for 48.46 United States dollars (USD) per month, compared with the USD 17.50 which he was paying back to the authorities, and then by agreeing to sell it for 20,000 German marks, a price which was far in excess of the house’s value when it was first allocated to him (TRL 125,000,000). The Government further contended that, contrary to the Chamber’s finding, the compensation claim had been determined within a reasonable time, and certainly within a much shorter time-frame than, for example, in Calvelli and Ciglio (cited above), where the Court had found that the period of six years and three months taken to determine a civil claim for death by negligence could not be said to raise an issue under Article 2.

However, it is to be observed that those cases, arising out of the conflict in south-east Turkey in the 1990s, were characterised by the absence of any such investigations into the applicants’ complaints that a close relative had been unlawfully killed by members of the security forces or had died in suspicious circumstances.",

In other words, there was a close procedural and practical relationship between the criminal investigation and the remedies available to those applicants in the legal system as a whole (see, for example, Salman v.

The Grand Chamber observes, as the Chamber did, that the applicant undoubtedly suffered loss as a result of the violations found and that there is a clear causal link between those violations and the pecuniary damage alleged, which may include compensation for loss of sources of income (see Salman, cited above, § 137, and Z and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 119). However, none of the applicant’s claims under this head has been duly documented. The alleged damage includes components which cannot be calculated precisely or are based on such limited evidence that any assessment will inevitably involve a degree of speculation (see, among other authorities, Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden (Article 50), judgment of 18 December 1984, Series A no. 88, pp. 14-15, § 32, and Akdivar and Others v. Turkey (Article 50), judgment of 1 April 1998, Reports 1998-II, p. 718, § 19).",

Öztürk, had had to spend TRL 550,000,000 on the burial of his wife and four children. The Government contested the evidential value of that information but did not adduce any other evidence to clarify the matter.",

            [
                "169. As to the alleged loss resulting from the destruction of the applicant’s dwelling, the Court observes at the outset that, in the absence of any substantiation, the sum claimed would appear excessive. In this connection, it considers that the economic interest which the subsidised housing acquired by the applicant may have represented should be taken into account in the assessment of damage (see paragraph 156 above), although this task is complicated both by the constant fluctuation in the rates of exchange and inflation in Turkey and by the transactions carried out by the applicant in relation to his flat (see paragraph 30 above).",
                "The Chamber’s assessment was based on the assumption that the value of the applicant’s dwelling that was destroyed amounted to 50% of the cost of decent housing offered at the time by Istanbul City Council in the Çobançeşme area. The Grand Chamber notes in this connection that, according to a list drawn up on 20 March 2001 by the city council, the council was offering housing in the Çobançeşme area for approximately TRL 10,400,000,000, which on that date was equivalent to EUR 11,800.",
                "That information apart, the Court observes, again on the basis of its own – inevitably approximate – calculations, that on 13 November 1993, when the contract for the sale of the flat to the applicant was signed, the agreed price of TRL 125,000,000 was equivalent to approximately EUR 8,500, a quarter of which (EUR 2,125) was paid immediately. The remainder (equivalent to EUR 6,375) was to be paid in 120 monthly instalments of TRL 732,844. On 13 November 1993 the monthly instalments were equivalent to approximately EUR 53. However, on 24 March 1998, the date on which the applicant promised to sell his flat to E.B., the instalments corresponded to only EUR 3. According to calculations on the basis of the exchange rates in force between 13 November 1993 and 24 March 1998, the average value of the instalments was EUR 15. As there is no reason to believe that the applicant continued to pay the instalments after 24 March 1998, it can be presumed that by that date he must have paid, in addition to the down payment, the equivalent of approximately EUR 780 in monthly instalments towards the purchase of the flat, making a total of approximately EUR 3,000, which is significantly lower than the initial value of the flat.",
                "It should also be borne in mind that from at least February 1995 onwards, if not well before that date, the flat in question had been let to a certain H.Ö. for a monthly rent of TRL 2,000,000 (approximately EUR 41). In the thirty ‑ seven months during which the flat was leased, ending on 24 March 1998 when the undertaking to sell it was signed, the applicant must therefore have received a minimum of approximately EUR 1,500 in rent, whereas during the same period he had had to pay only EUR 550 in monthly instalments.",
                "Furthermore, on signing the undertaking to sell the flat, the applicant received 20,000 German marks from E.B.; that sum, equivalent at the time to EUR 10,226, is significantly higher than any amount the applicant would ultimately have had to spend on the purchase of his flat.",
                "In the light of the foregoing, assuming that the market value of the applicant’s slum dwelling may be estimated according to the criterion adopted by the Chamber and that he must have spent a certain amount on accommodation while his flat was being let out, there is still no reason for the Court to conclude that those circumstances resulted in a loss greater than the profit the applicant seems to have made from the transactions relating to his flat.",

In making that award, however, the court refused to take into account any electrical appliances allegedly owned by the applicant, on the ground that his dwelling did not have electricity (see paragraph 40 above). Furthermore, the compensation awarded has never been paid to the applicant. The Court refers to its conclusions on these particular points (see paragraphs 152, 153 and 156 above) and considers that the outcome of the administrative proceedings cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 41 of the Convention.",

The Court agrees that having regard to their limited scope, which only targeted a number of serving Tüpraş officials, the criminal proceedings at issue had from the beginning been inadequate to establish the full extent of the negligence ( potentially ) involved at different levels of the State apparatus over many years in connection with the explosion at issue. That said, the Court also notes that the applicant has not explained how the shortcomings in those criminal proceedings prevented him from asserting his property rights by other means, such as before the civil or administrative courts, which could, in theory, establish the liability of any authorities or entities in connection with the explosion (as the Batman Civil Court did in respect of Tüpraş, see paragraph 44 above), and provide appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages (see, mutatis mutandis, Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 112). The Court stresses in this respect that under Article 20 § 1 of the Turkish Code of Administrative Procedure, administrative courts, once seized of a certain matter, have the obligation to carry out all necessary research and collect all pertinent documents of their own motion, including by way of obtaining expert reports, in order to determine the responsibility of a State authority in a given case."

                "( i ) There were several oil pipelines, oil storage facilities and petrol stations in the area apart from the Tüpraş Refinery, the largest being the ANT facilities. The oil pipeline between ANT and Tüpraş, which had been used since 1972 to transfer F-46 military oil, had been inoperative since 1992, and a report prepared in 2002 attested that the pipeline had been empty at the time. However, the studies conducted on the pipeline after the explosion showed not only that there had been F-57 military oil in the pipeline, which had not been supplied by Tüpraş, but also that the pipeline had been damaged.",
                "( ii ) According to its modus operandi, the ownership of both oil pipelines and the product supplied by Tüpraş belonged to the purchaser, and Tüpraş was not accountable for any damage or loss arising from a damaged pipeline.",
                "( iii ) The wells drilled around the Tüpraş storage tanks had not revealed any oil leaks, which ruled out the possibility that the leak had originated from the refinery.",
                "( iv ) The petroleum extracted from the various wells drilled in Toptancılar Sitesi had been analysed in the ODTÜ laboratory, and the results of the analysis showed that the sample product was not amongst those produced at the Tüpraş Batman Refinery.",
                "( v ) Petroleum production consisted of only 5.95 % of the total production of the Tüpraş Refinery, and the remaining capacity was mainly devoted to the production of diesel fuel, asphalt, fuel-oil, solvents, residual oil and naphtha. In these circumstances, it was illogical to claim that the leak allegedly originating from the Tüpraş Refinery consisted only of the 5.95 % of its production, and that none of the remaining products, which made up the bulk of its production, had leaked.",

They also claimed that the analysis conducted at the ODTÜ laboratory was not decisive, as the laboratory had checked the samples obtained from the wells only against the current products of the Tüpraş Refinery. That analysis did not necessarily take into account the changes over time in the refinery ’ s production or the changes sustained by the products underground, considering that the leak had been ongoing for a long time."

                "( i ) The studies carried out so far were inadequate to determine the source of the leak. For instance, although wells had been drilled outside the surrounding walls of the Tüpraş Refinery, which had revealed a significant amount of petroleum above groundwater, no drilling had been carried out on the other side of the walls. Without drilling wells in the appropriate key locations, it would not be possible to determine whether the leak had originated from a damaged pipeline or from the refinery.",
                "( ii ) Various construction works and excavations carried out in the Toptancılar Sitesi area over the years had revealed the presence of petroleum under the ground long before the explosion. Therefore, the fact that there was an oil leak had been known for many years, including, most probably, by the State authorities, although it was not possible to pinpoint when the leak had started.",
                "( iii ) The suspected corporations should normally have the technical means and manpower to detect any leaks originating from their facilities and take the necessary precautions. However, where leaks arose from breaches of pipelines or other equipment by malicious individuals for the purposes of theft, then these institutions could not be expected to uncover such incidents by their own efforts alone.

The applicant ’ s claim that he had brought the action subsequent to the establishment of the tortfeasor as Tüpraş in a case brought earlier by other property owners could not stop the running of the time-limit from the date of the explosion.

The Joint Civil Chambers stressed in both cases that it fell on the respondent to prove that the relevant knowledge had been acquired before the date alleged by the claimant. It is also evident from the reasoning in both cases that the failure of the claimant to take the necessary steps to uncover the identity of the actual tortfeasor could not be used against him in the calculation of the time-limit, as the one-year time ‑ limit would only start running from the date on which the claimant actually learned who the real tortfeasor was.",

Relying on a number of older books and articles by legal scholars and practitioners, this article claimed that a person would only be deemed to have attained the requisite “knowledge” of the identity of the tortfeasor if he or she had acquired exact and certain information that was sufficient to bring a legal action; mere suspicions and guesses as to the identity of the tortfeasor were not deemed to constitute “knowledge” for the purposes of Article 60 § 1 of the former Code of Obligations.

The applicant stressed in this connection that although the report issued by the technical commission on 14 June 2004 had indicated that the leak had probably originated from Tüpraş, that report had been deemed unsatisfactory, and the Prime Minister ’ s Office had therefore established new commissions to investigate the source and circumstances of the leak (see paragraphs 18 and 22 above).

Moreover, according to information obtained from the Municipality of Batman, the decision of the Local Environment Board of the Batman governor ’ s office dated 17 August 2005 regarding the withholding of business or occupation permits in the “red zone” (see paragraph 21 above) was still in force, since an underground clean-up operation was yet to be carried out at the site of the explosion.

Numerous commissions were, therefore, established and studies were conducted by experts in the field in order to shed light on the circumstances of the explosion and determine who was responsible for it. Those experts acknowledged that the explosion of 3 May 2004 had been a highly complex phenomenon, and the technical limitations encountered prevented rapid progress in establishing the circumstances surrounding it, including the identity of the entity responsible. They also stated that it ultimately fell on a court of law to determine, with certainty, responsibility for the explosion. Even the expert reports obtained subsequently during the criminal proceedings indicated that there was no sufficient evidence to determine conclusively that Tüpraş was responsible for the incident (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). Moreover, the expert report dated 3 March 2006, that ultimately determined the responsibility of Tüpraş for the incident, had been based on highly technical considerations which a layman could not be expected to make (see paragraph 43 above).

Turkey ( dec. ), no. 3952/11, § 44, 2 May 2017; and Teker v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 2272/11, § 58, 20 June 2017). The Court notes that in the view of the 4th Chamber of the Court of Cassation, the time-limit at issue had started running on the date of the explosion. However, having regard to the nature of the explosion, the uncertainty of the cause of the damage, the complexity of the matter, as well as the various reports on the issue, the Court finds it difficult to follow the reasoning of the Court of Cassation. In the Court ’ s opinion, the Court of Cassation ’ s interpretation and application of the relevant time ‑ limit rule, whereby the applicant was required to institute proceedings at a moment when he could not realistically have sufficient knowledge of the cause of the damage or the identity of those responsible, seems very formalistic, bearing particularly in mind the possible practical and financial implications of such requirement for the applicant. The Court stresses in this connection that contrary to the arguments of the Court of Cassation and the Government (see paragraphs 53 and 89 above), the victims who initiated compensation proceedings within one year of the explosion did not bring those actions against Tüpraş alone, but against both possible tortfeasors (see paragraph 42 above)."

The nature and the scope of the positive obligations vary depending on the circumstances. However, as a general rule, the State must ensure that property rights are sufficiently protected by law and that adequate remedies are provided whereby the victim of an interference can seek to vindicate his rights, including, where appropriate, by claiming damages in respect of any loss sustained ( see Blumberga v. Latvia, no. 70930/01, § 67, 14 October 2008 ). The measures which the State can be required to take in such a context can therefore be preventive or remedial ( see Kotov v.

The Court considers at the outset that the operation of the Tüpraş Refinery in Batman undoubtedly fell under the category of dangerous industrial activities, particularly given its proximity to commercial and residential areas. The Court has already stated, in the context of Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention, that the positive obligations resulting from dangerous industrial activities require the State to regulate such activities and put adequate safeguards in place to protect the right to life and physical integrity against dangers that may arise from such activities (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 89-90, and Brincat and Others v. Malta, nos. 60908/11 and 4 others, §§ 79-85 and 102-116, 24 July 2014). The Court considers that the principles developed in this respect under Articles 2 and 8 apply equally under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, where property damage results, inadvertently, from a dangerous activity. It has accordingly held that in a situation where lives and property were lost as a result of a dangerous activity occurring under the responsibility of the public authorities, the scope of measures required for the protection of dwellings was indistinguishable from the scope of those to be taken in order to protect the lives of the residents ( see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 106-108 and 134-136; Budayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 15339/02 and 4 others, § 173, ECHR 2008 (extracts); and Kolyadenko and Others v. Russia, nos. 17423/05 and 5 others, § 216, 28 February 2012)."

In such cases, an official criminal investigation becomes indispensable given that public authorities are often the only entities to have sufficient relevant knowledge to identify and establish the complex phenomena that might have caused an incident (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 140)."

Turkey, 24 April 1998, § 96, Reports 1998 ‑ II, or where the infringement is of a criminal nature, such as in the case of Blumberga v. Latvia, no. 70930/01, § 67, 14 October 2008). Even taking into account the complexity of the circumstances at issue, the Court does not consider that the stringent procedural requirements originally developed for use in cases involving the use of lethal force, and applied exceptionally to the very special circumstances as those arising in cases such as Öneryıldız despite the non ‑ intentional nature of the deaths at issue (see, for instance, Oruk v. Turkey, no. 33647/04, §§ 50 and 65, 4 February 2014, and Sinim v.

They established that the explosion had resulted from an underground oil leak and also found, albeit without certainty, that the leak appeared to have originated from the Tüpraş Refinery. Based on the findings of those commissions, the Batman public prosecutor ’ s office initiated an investigation, of its own motion, into the liability of a number of serving Tüpraş executives for the incident.

That said, the Court also notes that the applicant has not explained how the shortcomings in those criminal proceedings prevented him from asserting his property rights by other means, such as before the civil or administrative courts, which could, in theory, establish the liability of any authorities or entities in connection with the explosion (as the Batman Civil Court did in respect of Tüpraş, see paragraph 44 above), and provide appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages (see, mutatis mutandis, Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 112). The Court stresses in this respect that under Article 20 § 1 of the Turkish Code of Administrative Procedure, administrative courts, once seized of a certain matter, have the obligation to carry out all necessary research and collect all pertinent documents of their own motion, including by way of obtaining expert reports, in order to determine the responsibility of a State authority in a given case."

Once the entity at issue was declared bankrupt, the bailiffs had to refer the writs of execution to the liquidation commission for the relevant company. That did not mean that the enforcement proceedings were to be terminated. The liquidation commission in the present case had been set up by a resolution of the Zaporizhzhia Regional Arbitration Court on 20 August 1997 (see paragraph 9 above). However, it had not existed in reality for almost four years, so it had been impossible to appeal against its actions or inactivity (see paragraphs 17 and 35 above). He maintained that there had been a delay on the part of the bailiffs and the domestic courts in failing to oversee effectively the procedure for liquidating the IBF and in paying compensation for its debts. He had complained of this delay to the domestic courts, which had acknowledged it but had made no reparation for the infringement of his rights. He further claimed that, notwithstanding the fact that it was not his duty to supervise the liquidation commission ’ s work, he had nevertheless tried to complain to it about the failure to enforce the judgments of 24 February 1998. However, he had received no response to his complaints from the de facto chairman of the liquidation commission, and the Regional Commercial Court had not examined his complaints on the merits."

It was not enforceable. He also submitted that it was unnecessary to complain to the domestic courts about the bailiffs as it was in any event an obligation and a particular task of the State bailiffs to enforce final judgments without undue delay. This obligation was prescribed by law and they should therefore have used all available and possible legal means to comply with their duty of enforcing judgments."

Ukraine, no. 67534/01, § 27, 27 July 2004 ). In particular, the Court has found that the applicant does not have to exhaust domestic remedies if the debtor is a State body and the enforcement is impeded by lack of appropriate legislative measures or where a State assumes liability for the debts of a State-owned legal entity (see Romashov, cited above, § 31). In the instant case the debtor is not a State entity; however, the applicant ’ s complaints about non-enforcement relate to the alleged inactivity of the domestic authorities in enforcing the judgment and not to the inactivity of the debtor company."

It observes that enforcement of the judgment at issue was within the jurisdiction of the Bailiffs ’ Service until the liquidation commission for the IBF was formed and the writs of execution were transmitted to it ( on 27 June 2002 ). It would therefore be inconceivable to suggest that the applicant should have instituted additional proceedings in the Zaporizhzhia Regional Commercial Court seeking enforcement of a judgment with regard to an entity that did not yet have any jurisdiction over the enforcement proceedings and did not exist de facto (see paragraphs 17 and 35 above). As to the possibility of lodging complaints against the liquidation commission after 27 June 2002, the Court considers that, from the refusals of the Zaporizhzhia Regional Commercial Court to consider the applicant ’ s complaints (see paragraphs 44-46 above), it ensues that this remedy, in the circumstances of the instant case, did not offer reasonable prospects of success to the applicant and was ineffective. Moreover, the liquidation commission ceased to exist on 23 July 2002 with the adoption of the friendly settlement between the parties to the bankruptcy proceedings. However, notwithstanding these considerations and taking into account the fact that the State cannot be held liable for the acts or omissions of the liquidation commission, the Court considers that this part of the application should be dismissed as being incompatible ratione personae.",

Accordingly, the applicant is still entitled to recover the principal amount of the judgment debt in the domestic proceedings. The Court recalls that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.

                "90. The Court does not see any reason to disagree with the parties on the above points. It reiterates that a pecuniary claim supported by a final judicial decision (often referred to in its case-law as “a judgment debt”) has always been regarded by the Court as a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/00, § 40, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v. Greece, 9 December 1994, § 59, Series A no. 301-B). Indeed, where the debtor is a private person or company, the pecuniary claim, even supported by a court judgment, is less certain, because its enforceability largely depends on the solvency of the debtor. As the Court has repeatedly held, “when the debtor is a private actor, ... the State is not, as a general rule, directly liable for debts of private actors and its obligations are limited to providing the necessary assistance to the creditor in the enforcement of the respective court awards, for example, through a bailiff service or bankruptcy procedures” (see, for example, Shestakov v. Russia (dec.), no. 48757/99, 18 June 2002; Krivonogova v. Russia (dec.), no. 74694/01, 1 April 2004; and Kesyan v. Russia, no. 36496/02, 19 October 2006; see also Scollo v. Italy, 28 September 1995, Series A no. 315-C, § 44, and Fuklev v. Ukraine, no. 71186/01, § 84, 7 June 2005). Nonetheless, such pecuniary claims may also be characterised as “possessions”. In the case at hand the bank’s assets before their distribution by the liquidator were sufficient to meet at least a substantial proportion of the applicant’s claims. Therefore, the 1995 court award was at least partly recoverable. The applicant was a creditor of the first class and the bank’s obligations towards him should have been honoured accordingly. However, the money collected was distributed by the liquidator mostly amongst the “privileged” creditors, in breach of the law. As a result of that unlawful action, a significant part of the original award was lost for the applicant. Such was the conclusion of the Chamber (see paragraph 53 of the judgment), to which both parties fully subscribed, and the Grand Chamber does not see any reason to depart from that conclusion. It follows that the applicant has been deprived of his possessions by an unlawful act of the liquidator.",

The structure of the State and the functions of its organs are not, in general, governed by international law. It is a matter for each State to decide how its administration is to be structured and which functions are to be assumed by government. But while the State remains free to determine its internal structure and functions through its own law and practice, international law has a distinct role. For example, the conduct of certain institutions performing public functions and exercising public powers (e.g. the police) is attributed to the State even if those institutions are regarded in internal law as autonomous and independent of the executive government.”"

In their written reply the Government argued that the impugned distribution of the insolvent bank’s funds took place in 1996, that is, before the date of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Russia (5 May 1998). The fact that this deprivation had enduring effects did not produce a continuing situation. The Government distinguished the present case from that of Sovtransavto Holding v. Ukraine (no. 48553/99, §§ 54 et seq., ECHR 2002 ‑ VII), where the Court established that the loss of control of a company was a protracted process, creating a continuing situation. In the present case the applicant’s complaint concerned a single act of distribution of the bank’s assets on 13 March 1996. No new bank assets were discovered after that date. The subsequent decisions of the commercial courts (taken after 5 May 1998) did not violate the applicant’s rights. When the Russian courts ordered that the violation of the applicant’s rights be redressed, it was too late, since by that time the debtor no longer had any assets. Thus there were objective reasons for the failure to enforce the 1998 judgment. In support of this argument the Government referred to the cases of Blečić v. Croatia ([GC], no. 59532/00, § 79, ECHR 2006 ‑ III) and Kopecký v. Slovakia ([GC], no. 44912/98, § 38, ECHR 2004-IX). They concluded that the Court did not have jurisdiction to examine the case."

The creditors’ body’s decision ordering distribution of assets was taken on 13 March 1996. However, it was not until 6 April 1998 that the applicant received RUB 140 of the RUB 17,983 owed to him. If this date was correct, then a period of more than two years elapsed between the decision ordering distribution of funds and its implementation. In the absence of any clear evidence as to the time scale of the distribution process, it was impossible to exclude the possibility that the distribution process was concluded after 5 May 1998, when the Convention entered into force in respect of Russia."

There was no evidential basis for the Government’s assertion that from 12 November 1998 onwards the bank had no assets. There was no information on developments in the insolvency procedure from August 1998 until its closure in June 1999. Therefore, prior to the formal closure of the liquidation procedure on 17 June 1999 it remained theoretically possible for the applicant to receive the monies due to him. That being the case, the Government’s assertion that the distribution of funds represented the final interference with the applicant’s rights was unsustainable."

The applicant considered that the failure of the State to enforce a binding legal judgment of 26 August 1998 formed part of the multi-stage “continuing situation” of interference with his rights. Although the domestic court did not specify the means by which the liquidator should have provided the applicant with redress, it had been open to the liquidator to either recover the money from those to whom it had been unlawfully distributed or to employ any other means within his discretion. Those possibilities were not in any way precluded by the debtor’s lack of funds. In fact, the continued absence of assets was caused precisely by the liquidator’s unlawful actions and his failure to comply with the terms of the court order to rectify the situation (assuming that the bank indeed had no assets)."

Finally, in the applicant’s opinion, the domestic judgments of 1999 should be regarded as yet another stage in that “continuing situation”, despite the fact that they were annulled by way of supervisory review in 2001. The interference with the applicant’s possessions took the form of a four-stage incremental process which was comprised of (a) the liquidator’s unlawful distribution; (b) the failure of the domestic authorities to enforce the judgment of 26 August 1998; (c) the refusal of the commercial courts (in the light of this failure to enforce) to hear the applicant’s claim against the liquidator personally; and (d) the decision by the Regional Commercial Court to close the insolvency procedure."

The Convention entered into force in respect of Russia on 5 May 1998. The Court agrees with the Government that the distribution of the bank’s assets was an instantaneous act, and, as such, falls outside the Court’s jurisdiction ratione temporis. That being said, the Court observes that after 5 May 1998 the applicant was involved in two sets of judicial proceedings concerning wrongful distribution of the bank’s assets and the liquidator’s personal liability. The question is whether the Court has jurisdiction to examine facts related to those proceedings."

                "69. The Government, referring to Blečić and Kopecký, both cited above, argued that the proceedings of 1998 and 1999 should not be dissociated from the original act of interference, namely the wrongful distribution of the banks’ assets. However, in the Court’s opinion, the present case must be distinguished from Blečić and Kopecký, for the following reasons. As acknowledged by the Government, under Russian law the applicant was entitled to claim damages from the liquidator for the latter’s wrongful acts. Legally speaking, the applicant had a valid tort claim at the time when the Convention entered into force in respect of Russia. It became sufficiently established even later, with the final judgment of 12 November 1998, when the courts recognised that the liquidator had acted unlawfully and ordered him to provide the applicant with redress. The Court observes that in Plechanow v. Poland (no. 22279/04, §§ 76 et seq., 7 July 2009) it dismissed the Government’s objection ratione temporis and distinguished between the original confiscation of property and the compensation proceedings. In Broniowski v. Poland ((dec.) [GC] no. 31443/96, §§ 74 et seq., ECHR 2002 ‑ X) the Grand Chamber drew a similar distinction. It held that “the applicant did not complain of being deprived of the original property” in the 1940s, but rather complained about the “alleged failure to satisfy an entitlement to a compensatory measure which was vested in him under Polish law on the date of the Protocol’s entry in force”. The Court will follow this line of reasoning in the present case. As in Broniowski, the applicant, when the Convention entered into force in respect of Russia, had a defendable tort claim which outlived the original tort. Thus, the central question is why the applicant’s attempt to restore his rights failed, first in 1998 and then in 1999, that is, after the entry into force of the Convention. The Court concludes that it has temporal jurisdiction to examine whether the applicant’s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention were properly secured in the proceedings of 1998 and 1999.",

The Chamber noted that “the annulment [of the 1999 judgments in 2001, by way of supervisory review,] was pronounced in the case after the respondent Government had been given notice of the application and [that] they used this to raise an objection on grounds of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies”. The Chamber did not accept that such an objection might be validly derived from the supervisory review proceedings of 2001. The Chamber then shifted the focus to the 1998 proceedings, which had ended with the judgment of 12 November 1998. In the Chamber’s opinion, in 1998 the applicant had availed himself of his right to contest the liquidator’s unlawful actions. The 1998 judgments were given within the subject-matter jurisdiction of the commercial courts; as a result, it was immaterial whether or not the applicant’s claim against the liquidator in person had been brought in the proper court – the applicant had exhausted remedies by introducing the first complaint with the commercial court, and those proceedings ended on 12 November 1998."

As to the merits, the Chamber held that the amount awarded by the Russian courts in 1995 (hereinafter “the 1995 award”) could be described as the applicant’s “possessions” under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. By distributing the assets to the “privileged” creditors before all of the other first-class creditors, the liquidator had acted unlawfully, and, as a result, the applicant did not receive what he would otherwise have received. There had therefore been an unlawful interference by the liquidator with the applicant’s right to the enjoyment of his possessions."

The Chamber referred to the fact that the liquidator was appointed by the court according to certain eligibility criteria, that he was supervised by the court, and that he acted in the interests of all creditors of the company. The Chamber also referred to “the nature of his duties”, which “pertained to public authority”. The Chamber held that the liquidator was “expected to achieve a ‘fair balance’ between the demands of the general interest and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights”. Since the interference with the applicant’s rights was made by a public authority, and was unlawful, it was contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",

They relied on the case of Katsyuk v. Ukraine (no. 58928/00, § 39, 5 April 2005), which suggested that, despite the fact that the liquidator was appointed by the court, he was not a “public official” and his actions could not be directly attributed to the State.

The Government compared the status of liquidator in Russia and in Ukraine and concluded that in both countries the liquidator was not a public authority, as was rightly held by the Court in the Ukrainian context in the case of Katsyuk, cited above. Thus, the liquidator was a professional employed by the creditors’ body. His candidature was approved by the commercial court, but the court’s task was limited to verifying whether the liquidator met the statutory qualification requirements. The initiative in appointing the liquidator belonged to the creditors’ body, it submitted the liquidator’s candidature to the court and supervised his work."

For example, it approved transactions involving the insolvent company’s assets, fixed the price of sale of its property and approved friendly settlements with debtors. The courts were not even mentioned by the law as a party to the insolvency procedure – they only ensured the formal lawfulness of the liquidator’s actions.

Although his activity might have been of some public importance, he did not exercise any official powers and accepted the appointment in order to make a profit. He did not have a legal monopoly but operated in a sector open to competition, and was unable to issue orders or regulations binding on third parties, or to impose sanctions or exercise other governmental functions. His actions could be challenged in civil proceedings, rather than by means of an administrative complaint. The Government described the liquidator’s duties and powers in the insolvency procedure. His mission was to ensure the fair distribution of an insolvent company’s assets among the creditors, within a very narrow framework established by the relevant legislation. In sum, the liquidator enjoyed significant operational and institutional autonomy from the State and was completely independent financially from the authorities. The Government concluded that the liquidator acted as a businessman rather than a State official. That position was reinforced in the 2002 Insolvency Act, which provided for the creation of a self-governing non-governmental organisation of professional liquidators.",

However, it had fulfilled its positive obligations by establishing an appropriate legal framework for insolvency procedures. Thus, special legislation (the 1992 and 1998 Acts) had been enacted in order to protect the interests of creditors. The legislation provided for the distribution of the assets of an insolvent company on a pari passu basis. Those Acts (sections 31 and 21 respectively) guaranteed the right of the creditor to complain to the court about actions or omissions on the part of the liquidator. The liquidator was personally accountable for his acts to the creditors. The 2002 Act went even further by requiring mandatory professional insurance for liquidators. The Government referred to the practice in several other member States where the liquidator was personally liable vis-à-vis the creditors of an insolvent company."

                "79. In so far as the specific circumstances of the present case are concerned, the Government argued as follows. First, the applicant had been successful in challenging the liquidator’s action: in 1998 the commercial courts held that those actions had been unlawful and ordered the liquidator to restore the applicant’s rights within one month. However, as a result of the unlawful actions of the liquidator and the creditors’ body, all of the bank’s assets had been lost, and, as a result, it was impossible to enforce the court order of 1998. The State could not be held responsible for non-enforcement of a judgment if it was caused by factors outside the State’s control."

The existence of that remedy derived from sections 31 and 21 of the 1992 and 1998 Acts respectively. The possibility of claiming damages from the liquidator was also confirmed by the Constitutional Court. The applicant used that legal avenue by filing a new complaint with the commercial courts, which examined and dismissed it mainly on the ground that the liquidation procedure was still pending. Indeed, it would have been unjust to award the applicant any damages when there was still a possibility (however vague) of obtaining the money from the bank itself. Had the courts satisfied the applicant’s claims, he would have been in a position to recover the same amount twice, and that would be tantamount to unjust enrichment."

This was confirmed by the Supreme Commercial Court’s judgment of 17 April 2001, rendered by way of supervisory review. However, even after that judgment the applicant did not lodge a claim against the liquidator with the proper court.

The liquidator under Russian law was not an insolvency practitioner but rather a person who met certain qualification requirements, not necessarily linked to that particular sphere. Thus, a civil servant was eligible to perform the duties of liquidator. Furthermore, although the creditors were entitled to propose their candidates, the power to appoint the liquidator belonged solely to the court. The courts supervised the activities of the liquidator and the course of the insolvency procedure in general. The liquidator in Russia (unlike his counterpart in Ukraine) had a right to challenge before the court an unlawful decision of the creditors’ body. In Russia the liquidator was remunerated by the court, on the basis of the amount defined by the creditors’ body and from the funds collected during the liquidation process. The liquidator’s actions could be challenged before the courts, and the courts were entitled to give directions to the liquidator and order the payment of compensation to creditors. Ukrainian courts had no such powers vis-à-vis liquidators. In sum, the liquidator in Russia was appointed by the court, paid by the court, and supervised by the court. In such circumstances he should have been regarded as a governmental official, and the Government’s responsibility for his action should have been engaged.",

Even assuming that the liquidator was a private person, the applicant considered that, in view of the nature of his duties, the State must have been responsible for his actions, at least in an indirect manner. The applicant relied upon the Court’s findings in Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom (25 March 1993, Series A no. 247 ‑ C), where the actions of employees in an independent school were found to be the responsibility of the State. The Court concluded in that case that “the State [could] not absolve itself from responsibility by delegating its obligations to private bodies or individuals”. A similar approach was adopted in the context of the position of advocates in the case of Van der Mussele v. Belgium (23 November 1983, Series A no. 70), and with regard to the status of the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation in Woś v. Poland, (no. 22860/02, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII) and of the Romanian Union of Lawyers in the case of Buzescu v. Romania (no. 61302/00, 24 May 2005). The applicant concluded that, in view of the Court’s case-law, the actions of the liquidator in the present case engaged the responsibility of the State. Even if the liquidator was not a government official, the Russian State retained a positive obligation under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to protect the applicant, as one of the bank’s creditors, from unlawful actions by the liquidator. The nature and scope of such an obligation would consist (at the very least) in ensuring that the liquidator’s actions were compliant with domestic law. The obligation would also extend to remedying any misconduct by the liquidator. In the present circumstances, the appropriate remedy would have entailed the payment of compensation to the applicant as provided for by domestic law, and the enforcement of such award. The applicant in the present case took every opportunity to challenge both the unlawful distribution of the assets by the liquidator and the failure to enforce the decision of the commercial courts. The domestic courts confirmed the liquidator’s unlawful distribution of the assets in 1998 and during further proceedings in 1999, but in spite of those rulings, the insolvency procedure was closed on 17 June 1999 on the grounds of insufficient funds."

Thus, the courts held that the matter had already been considered by the courts of general jurisdiction, which made it impossible for the commercial court to consider the same matter. Further, the courts held that the applicant’s additional claim to compensation for non-pecuniary damage in respect of mental distress and loss of time were unsubstantiated, since the Insolvency Act did not cover claims for damage incurred during the insolvency procedure. The courts also held that it was impossible to repay the applicant the original award, on account of the bank’s lack of assets, but that this would subsequently be possible if and when additional assets became available. The applicant’s additional claims for compensation for mental distress and loss of time were dismissed on the merits, whereas his claim in respect of the award by the courts of general jurisdiction was dismissed on procedural grounds."

The domestic courts considered the applicant’s complaints on the merits; this supported the applicant’s submission that he had used an appropriate remedy in this situation. As to the Government’s reference to the Constitutional Court judgment of 12 March 2001, the applicant noted that, according to the Constitutional Court, a creditor had a right to appeal to the court of general jurisdiction “if the commercial court refused to examine a complaint on the grounds that it [did] not have jurisdiction”. However, in the current case the commercial courts did not refuse to consider the applicant’s complaints on the ground of a lack of jurisdiction. The 2001 judgment of the Constitutional Court opened the possibility of seeking a remedy in the courts of general jurisdiction but did not exclude the creditors’ right to challenge the liquidator’s decisions before the commercial courts. Only in 2001 was the “jurisdictional” ground raised under the “supervisory review” procedure, and all the previous decisions of the commercial courts (of 4 February, 31 March and 9 June 1999) were annulled. That procedure itself raised serious issues regarding the principle of legal certainty, as held by the Court on numerous occasions."

The applicant acknowledged that in theory he could also have sought a remedy in the courts of general jurisdiction against the liquidator’s unprofessional conduct in discharging his duties; however, the annulment of the enforceable judgments issued by the commercial courts made the “general jurisdiction” remedy illusory. For that reason, he did not seek to use the latter remedy, and could not be required to do so. Moreover, as the Chamber had noted, the applicant used the courts of general jurisdiction for his initial complaint to the courts, prior to the opening of the insolvency procedure, but the award of compensation to him (by the decisions of 20 February 1995 and 5 April 1996) was never enforced."

First, the Government acknowledged that the 1995 court award had amounted to the applicant’s “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Secondly, the Government agreed with the applicant that the liquidator had acted unlawfully in that the assets of the bank, which should normally have been distributed evenly amongst the first-class creditors, had been used for full reimbursement of certain “privileged” creditors. Thirdly, the Government agreed that, as a result of such distribution of funds, other first-class creditors of the bank, the applicant included, had received much less than they could legitimately have expected to receive, given the bank’s financial situation."

            [
                "90. The Court does not see any reason to disagree with the parties on the above points. It reiterates that a pecuniary claim supported by a final judicial decision (often referred to in its case-law as “a judgment debt”) has always been regarded by the Court as a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/00, § 40, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v. Greece, 9 December 1994, § 59, Series A no. 301-B). Indeed, where the debtor is a private person or company, the pecuniary claim, even supported by a court judgment, is less certain, because its enforceability largely depends on the solvency of the debtor. As the Court has repeatedly held, “when the debtor is a private actor, ... the State is not, as a general rule, directly liable for debts of private actors and its obligations are limited to providing the necessary assistance to the creditor in the enforcement of the respective court awards, for example, through a bailiff service or bankruptcy procedures” (see, for example, Shestakov v. Russia (dec.), no. 48757/99, 18 June 2002; Krivonogova v. Russia (dec.), no. 74694/01, 1 April 2004; and Kesyan v. Russia, no. 36496/02, 19 October 2006; see also Scollo v. Italy, 28 September 1995, Series A no. 315-C, § 44, and Fuklev v. Ukraine, no. 71186/01, § 84, 7 June 2005). Nonetheless, such pecuniary claims may also be characterised as “possessions”. In the case at hand the bank’s assets before their distribution by the liquidator were sufficient to meet at least a substantial proportion of the applicant’s claims. Therefore, the 1995 court award was at least partly recoverable. The applicant was a creditor of the first class and the bank’s obligations towards him should have been honoured accordingly. However, the money collected was distributed by the liquidator mostly amongst the “privileged” creditors, in breach of the law. As a result of that unlawful action, a significant part of the original award was lost for the applicant. Such was the conclusion of the Chamber (see paragraph 53 of the judgment), to which both parties fully subscribed, and the Grand Chamber does not see any reason to depart from that conclusion. It follows that the applicant has been deprived of his possessions by an unlawful act of the liquidator.",

In order to determine whether any given legal person other than a territorial authority falls within that category, account must be taken of its legal status and, where appropriate, the rights that status gives it, the nature of the activity it carries out and the context in which it is carried out, and the degree of its independence from the political authorities.”"

As far as the entity Radio France was concerned, the Court noted that although it had been entrusted with public-service missions and depended to a considerable extent on the State for its financing, the legislature had devised a framework which was plainly designed to guarantee its editorial independence and institutional autonomy. In this respect, there was little difference between Radio France and the companies operating “private” radio stations, which were themselves also subject to various legal and regulatory constraints. The Court thus concluded that Radio France was a non-governmental organisation for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention. Similarly, the Court found that the applicant company in Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines v. Turkey (no. 40998/98, § 79, ECHR 2007 ‑ ...) was a non-governmental organisation, despite the fact that it was wholly owned by the Iranian State and that a majority of the members of the board of directors were appointed by the State.

Ukraine (no. 4773/02, §§ 54-56, 11 October 2005), the Court examined the status of the liquidation committee and concluded that its prolonged failure to enforce a court judgment “was due to the State’s failure to establish an effective system of enforcement of court judgments given against the company undergoing bankruptcy proceedings” (see also Pokutnaya v. Russia (dec.), no. 26856/04, 3 July 2008). The Court, however, did not deal with the question whether the liquidation committee was a “public authority”. It focussed rather on the State’s non-compliance with its positive obligations in this sphere. Nor did the Court examine this issue in cases where it had to decide whether Article 6 was applicable to disputes arising from liquidation procedures (see, for example, Werner v. Poland, no. 26760/95, § 34, 15 November 2001; see also Ismeta Bačić v. Croatia, no. 43595/06, § 27, 19 June 2008) or in cases where the Court examined the length of bankruptcy proceedings (see Luordo v. Italy, no. 32190/96, §§ 67-71, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX)."

He was chosen on an open market amongst other professionals competing for the same job. He worked for a fee, which was fixed freely and paid by the creditors’ body. To the extent that the State was involved in the insolvency proceedings it acted as a creditor and not as a “public authority”."

As such, this validation did not entail any State responsibility for the way in which the liquidator would discharge his duties.",

While the Chamber strongly relied on the domestic court’s control over the lawfulness of the liquidator’s actions, the Grand Chamber notes that the scope of such control was very limited and had only retrospective effects, for the courts did not have to verify whether the liquidator’s decisions were justified from an economic or business point of view. The courts were not empowered to give instructions to the liquidator on how to manage the bankrupt company – this fell within his discretionary powers. The courts only controlled the compliance of his actions with the procedural and substantive rules of the domestic insolvency legislation. Their role was limited to serving as the forum for settling disputes between the creditors of the insolvent company, its debtors and the liquidator. To this extent they played the same role as in any other private dispute."

The relations between the liquidator and the creditors (including the State) were regulated by civil law, which provided for personal liability of liquidators vis-à-vis the creditors. The liquidator did not receive any public funding. The 1992 Act did not contain any specific provision on compensation for a liquidator’s unlawful actions. This gap was filled by the 1998 Act, which established that creditors were entitled to seek compensation from the liquidator in respect of any damage caused by the latter’s unlawful actions. The liquidator could be held criminally responsible for offences such as fraud or embezzlement, but not for criminal offences which could only be committed by public officials. Finally, under the law of tort there was no State responsibility for the liquidator’s acts, whereas he was liable before the creditors."

While it is clear that the insolvency legislation at the time sought to achieve a fair balance between all competing interests involved in insolvency cases, inter alia by introducing various orders of priority between the creditors and establishing fair liquidation procedures, the Grand Chamber considers that the liquidator himself was not obliged to perform that balancing exercise. In the Grand Chamber’s opinion, his task was much more similar to that of any other private businessman appointed by his clients, in this case the creditors, to best serve their – and ultimately his own – interests. As such, the mere fact that his services might also have been socially useful does not turn him into a public official acting in the public interest."

Most importantly, the liquidator had very limited powers: he was indeed empowered to manage the property of the company in question, but had no coercive or regulatory power in respect of third parties. There was no formal delegation of powers by any governmental authority (and, as a result, no public funding). Unlike a bailiff, the liquidator was unable to seize property, obtain information, impose fines, or take other similar decisions binding third parties. His powers were limited to the operational control and management of the insolvent company’s property."

The liquidator is the key person in the liquidation process and, in this capacity, he may be called upon to pay the creditors, whose claims, as in the present case, have been established by a court order. His functions therefore bear some similarity to those of a court bailiff, who is undoubtedly a public authority. Indeed, in most European countries public authorities are involved in the enforcement proceedings and help successful claimants to recover court awards by employing court bailiffs, policemen or other similar officials. The Court has held on numerous occasions that Articles 6 § 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention provide for a positive obligation on the State to assist private persons in the enforcement of court judgments against other private persons (see Fuklev v. Ukraine, cited above, §§ 84 and 91; Scollo v. Italy, cited above, § 44; Fociac v. Romania, no. 2577/02, § 70, 3 February 2005; and Kesyan v. Russia, cited above, §§ 79 and 80, 19 October 2006). However, those similarities would not appear decisive in the light of the significant differences between the functions of bailiff and those of a liquidator. Firstly, whereas bailiffs have to execute court orders, liquidators deal with several kinds of claims, including those which have not been made enforceable by a court. Secondly and most importantly, unlike liquidators, bailiffs are entrusted with coercive powers, in addition to being appointed, paid and closely supervised by a competent State authority. Thus, in the context of insolvency procedures the respondent State left the management of the insolvent company in the hands of its creditors and of liquidators appointed by them, whereas in the context of enforcement proceedings it chose to operate through its own officials and to bear direct responsibility for their actions."

                "107. It would appear that the liquidator, at the relevant time, enjoyed a considerable amount of operational and institutional independence, as State authorities did not have the power to give instructions to him and therefore could not directly interfere with the liquidation process as such. The State’s involvement in the liquidation procedure resulted only from its role in establishing the legislative framework for such procedures, in defining the functions and the powers of the creditors’ body and of the liquidator, and in overseeing observance of the rules. It follows that the liquidator did not act as a State agent. Consequently, the respondent State cannot be held directly responsible for his wrongful acts in the present case. The fact that a court was entitled to review the lawfulness of the liquidator’s actions does not alter this analysis."

Turkey ([GC], no. 48939/99, § 134, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII), which concerned the destruction of the applicant’s property as a result of a gas explosion, the Court held that the genuine, effective exercise of the right protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 did not depend merely on the State’s duty not to interfere, but might require positive measures of protection, particularly where there was a direct link between the measures an applicant might legitimately expect from the authorities and his effective enjoyment of his possessions. Even in horizontal relations there might be public interest considerations involved, which may impose some obligations on the State. In Broniowski v. Poland ([GC], no. 31443/96, § 143, ECHR 2004-V), for instance, the Court held that positive obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 might require the State to take the measures necessary to protect property rights."

The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. Whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty of the State or in terms of an interference by a public authority which needs to be justified, the criteria to be applied do not differ in substance. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. It is also true that the aims mentioned in that provision may be of some relevance in assessing whether a balance between the demands of the public interest involved and the applicant’s fundamental property rights has been struck. In both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, §§ 98 et seq., ECHR 2003-VIII, and the Grand Chamber judgment in Broniowski, cited above, § 144)."

Thus, in the case of Öneryıldız (cited above), the loss of the applicant’s possessions resulted from obvious negligence of the authorities in the face of a very dangerous situation. By contrast, where the case concerns ordinary economic relations between private parties such positive obligations are much more limited. Thus, the Court has stressed on many occasions that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention cannot be interpreted as imposing any general obligation on the Contracting States to cover the debts of private entities (see, mutatis mutandis, Shestakov, cited above, and Scollo, cited above, § 44; and see in particular the Court’s reasoning in Anokhin v.

Thus, in a case belonging to the latter category the Court held that States were under an obligation to afford judicial procedures that offered the necessary procedural guarantees and therefore enabled the domestic courts and tribunals to adjudicate effectively and fairly any disputes between private persons ( Sovtransavto Holding, cited above, § 96; see also Anheuser-Busch Inc. v. Portugal [GC], no. 73049/01, § 83, ECHR 2007 ‑ I, and Freitag v. Germany, no. 71440/01, § 54, 19 July 2007)."

The Court, however, reiterates that States cannot be held directly responsible for the debts of private companies or the faults committed by their managers (or by insolvency liquidators, as in the case at hand). In the present case, by depositing his money with a private bank the applicant assumed certain risks, including those related to mismanagement and even fraud.

Moreover, they occurred in an area where the State’s negligence in combating malfunctioning and fraud could have devastating effects on the State’s economy, thereby affecting a large number of individual property rights. Under these circumstances, the Court considers that it is part of the States’ duties under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 at least to set up a minimum legislative framework including a proper forum allowing persons who find themselves in a position such as the applicant’s to assert their rights effectively and have them enforced. Indeed, by failing to do so a State would seriously fall short of its obligation to protect the rule of law and prevent arbitrariness.

In the final judgment of 12 November 1998 the Federal Commercial Court for the North Caucasus satisfied his claims and ordered the liquidator to provide redress. However, this judgment was not enforced since the distribution of money to the “privileged” creditors had left the bank with virtually no assets and no new assets were discovered.

The Court observes that, prior to 1998, there was no specific legal norm establishing a liquidator’s personal liability for mismanagement, or any constant case-law to that effect. The situation has changed since then, with the 1998 Insolvency Act providing in section 21(3) that creditors are entitled to seek compensation from the liquidator in respect of any damage that the latter may have caused to them by an action or omission in breach of the law. The Court, however, is prepared to accept the Government’s argument that section 21 of the 1998 Act did not introduce the liquidator’s personal liability into Russian law but simply confirmed its existence.

However, in 2001 the Supreme Commercial Court annulled the results of the 1999 proceedings on the ground that since the applicant had sought compensation from the liquidator in person (and not from the liquidator acting as manager of the bank), his claims ought to have been examined by the courts of general jurisdiction.

What is more, the commercial courts at three instances considered that they had jurisdiction to hear the case. Only in 2001 was the “jurisdictional” ground raised under the supervisory review procedure, following the communication of the case by the Court to the Russian Government, with the result that all previous decisions by the commercial courts (of 4 February, 31 March and 9 June 1999) were quashed."

However, after completion of the liquidation procedure the applicant was indeed entitled to bring further proceedings and seek due compensation. In sum, the Government suggested that the applicant had only been precluded temporarily from recovering damages from the liquidator, for as long as the liquidation procedure was ongoing.

Essentially, from 17 June 1999, the date when the liquidation of the bank was approved by the commercial court, the applicant had the possibility of proceeding against the liquidator in tort proceedings alleging negligence and breach of duty in the discharge of his official functions. However, the applicant did not use such a remedy, for reasons which remain unknown.

Hence, there was a rationale in the court’s refusal to deal with the applicant’s claims against the liquidator, while the liquidation procedure itself was still pending. Even if, in the circumstances of the case, the possibility of recovering the original bank award was remote, the general rule applied by the court in the judgment of 9 June 1999 cannot be dismissed as having no reasonable justification."

Instead, it must confine itself, as far as possible, to examining the issues raised by the case before it (see, mutatis mutandis, among many others, Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, § 83, ECHR 2010).

Since the right to a hearing within a reasonable time is a right guaranteed by the Constitution (see paragraph 50 above) and decisions adopted in the context of the proceedings instituted by requests under section 27 of the Courts Act (length-of-proceedings decisions) necessarily entail determination of that right, it would appear that those dissatisfied by such decisions are entitled to lodge constitutional complaints against them relying on section 62 of the Constitutional Court Act, regardless of whether or not that possibility was referred to also in section 28 of the Courts Act (compare the text of what used to be paragraph 3 of section 28 of the Courts Act before the entry into force of 2009 Amendments and the amended text of what became paragraph 5 of the same section, in paragraphs 53-54 above).

In such circumstances, the fact that the decision of 6 June 2012 had been adopted is not of such importance that its non-communication to the Court, though regrettable, could be regarded as an abuse of the right of application.

Georgia ((dec.), no. 5667/02, 2 May 2006) where the applicant complained of non-enforcement of a judgment in his favour but concealed the fact that the judgment in question had been enforced in part more than a year before he had lodged his application, and in full before it had been communicated to the respondent Government.

The same period was taken into account by the Supreme Court in its decision of 18 May 2012 (see paragraph 41 above).

Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, §§ 65-107, ECHR 2006-V, or Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, §§ 178-213, ECHR 2006-V)."

Accordingly, the execution of a judicial decision cannot be prevented, invalidated or unduly delayed (see, among other authorities, Hornsby v. Greece, judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports 1997-II, pp. 510-11, § 40; Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/00, § 34, ECHR 2002-III; and Jasiūnienė v. Lithuania, no. 41510/98, § 27, 6 March 2003).

Serbia, no. 14011/07, § 62, 14 April 2009).

In particular, the Court notes that on 11 July 2012 the enforcement court had informed the Croatian Pension Fund that the writ of execution of 18 February 2003 had become final and ordered it to commence garnishment of 10% of the debtor ’ s pension to which, on 21 September 2012, the Fund replied that it could not do so because 1/3, that is, allegedly, the statutory maximum, of the debtor ’ s pension was already being garnished pursuant to another writ of execution obtained by the applicant (see paragraphs 33-35 above). However, the Court notes that the relevant enforcement legislation in force at the time allowed for garnishment of more than 1/3 of one ’ s income if the claim sought to be enforced concerned statutory (child) maintenance (see paragraphs 57-59 above). Therefore, it would appear that by garnishing a larger portion of the debtor ’ s pension the enforcement could have been completed earlier than 12 November 2014."

For that reason the tribunals had to assume that he could only have been dismissed without justification if the order had manifestly been given without proper authority. In the particular case, the order was capable of being based on Rule 11A of the Industrial Property Rules ( Reglement Industriële Eigendom ), a provision introduced in 1957, according to which duties incumbent on the Patent Office but not assigned specifically to any Division were to be carried out by the President, who was empowered to delegate them to ordinary members of the Patent Office. The Central Appeals Tribunal quoted the explanatory memorandum to the Order of 1957 introducing the above Rule 11A, from which it appeared that the competent Minister had assumed that members of the Patent Office were subordinate to the President except in relation to decisions relating to patent applications. With regard to such decisions they could act only in accordance with their own convictions (see the judgment of the Central Appeals Tribunal of 17 February 1971, no. 1970/B 12, unpublished).",

In that case the plaintiff, against whom an injunction had been issued in earlier summary proceedings restraining it from infringing a patent owned by the defendant, asked for a declaration that this injunction applied only to the period between the issuing of the injunction and the date on which the plaintiff had requested the Patent Office to grant a compulsory licence under the patent. The defendant pleaded that the proceedings relating to compulsory licences were not binding on it as the Patent Office, in deciding on compulsory licences (which in the defendant's view amounted to the determination of civil rights and obligations as understood by Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention), was not an \"independent and impartial tribunal\". The President of the Regional Court declined to give a ruling on this issue. Even if its assumption were correct, the defendant could, after the grant of the compulsory licence, address itself to the civil courts, which would then decide whether the compulsory licence had been properly granted. The defendant's objection to the arrangement for the grant of a compulsory licence could therefore in no way warrant the conclusion that such a licence should never be granted to the plaintiff, which had been the thinking underlying the defence plea.",

The court was asked to declare the decision of the Appeals Division unlawful, one of the reasons given being that the Patent Office allegedly did not meet the standards of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. The Government has stated before this Court that they did not raise any objection as to the admissibility of these allegations but, on the contrary, put forward defences on the merits of the question.

In contrast to the views expressed by legal writers, it was the Supreme Court's established case ‑ law that this time-limit was absolute and, therefore, also binding in a case like the present one where the debtor had not been capable of participating in the proceedings and had not been represented. Consequently, the sale of the applicant's apartment had become final and it was no longer possible to claim the nullity of the proceedings.

Such individuals could not be treated like persons with legal capacity, who were able to defend their interests in underlying civil proceedings and could later appeal against a decision granting enforcement. In the present case, the interests of the applicant in declaring the sale of her apartment null and void had to prevail over the interests of the purchaser and the creditors. On the one hand, the applicant had become homeless, having lost her apartment, which had been sold far below its market price in order to satisfy relatively minor claims.

Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 139, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII). The Court notes that the appointment of a guardian under domestic law prevents a person lacking legal capacity from validly entering into contracts or conducting proceedings. Thus it serves, inter alia, to protect the person concerned from disposing of his or her rights or assets to their own disadvantage. In Convention proceedings the need for a person lacking legal capacity to be represented by a guardian is less obvious. In certain circumstances it may therefore be justified to allow a person lacking legal capacity under domestic law to conduct Convention proceedings in his or her own right. Indeed, under Article 34 of the Convention the Court may receive applications from any person claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto.

The Government argued that it was not sufficiently clear whether the apartment which had been subject to judicial sale had actually been the applicant's “home” within the meaning of Article 8. Referring to the applicant's submissions in respect of just satisfaction, they argued that she had apparently intended to let the apartment."

The judicial sale brought about a change of ownership but not a change in her living situation at that point. This was only the case once eviction proceedings were carried out in which, however, legal protection was available."

The applicant's subsequent eviction served to protect the purchaser's rights."

As regards the procedural guarantees implied in Article 8, they observed that all documents relating to the enforcement proceedings had been served on the applicant, who had failed to react. There had been no indication for the judge that the applicant lacked legal capacity. That had not become apparent at the time of her eviction either, but had only been discovered some five months after the judicial sale. The rules of Austrian law, which contained a strict 14-day time-limit for challenging a judicial sale of real estate with the consequence that the decision could not be reviewed even if it turned out that the person concerned had lacked legal capacity, were nevertheless proportionate. They were not only justified to protect the bona fide purchaser but also served to protect the interests of debtors or creditors in general, as property would not achieve normal or close-to-market prices at judicial sales if the law permitted the sale to be challenged without a time-limit. More generally, the absolute time-limit served the interests of the efficient administration of justice and of preserving legal certainty."

It appears that the courts considered it to be the applicant's residence, as it was at that address that the decision authorising the judicial sale and the summons informing the applicant of the date of the auction were served in June and October 1999, respectively. Moreover, it is not in dispute that following the judicial sale which took place in November 1999 the applicant was evicted from the apartment, in February 2000. Consequently, the Court sees no reason to doubt that the apartment subject to the judicial sale was at the material time the applicant's “home” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention."

In the present case the interference was in accordance with the law, being based on the relevant provisions of the Enforcement Act, and served the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others: the proceedings as a whole served the interests of the creditors to obtain payment of their claims.

The Court reiterates that an interference will be considered “necessary in a democratic society ” for a legitimate aim if it answers a “pressing social need” and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. While it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of necessity, the final evaluation as to whether the reasons cited for the interference are relevant and sufficient remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention (see Connors v. the United Kingdom, no. 66746/01, § 81, 27 May 2004, and Buckley, cited above, § 74 )."

In this regard, a margin of appreciation must, inevitably, be left to the national authorities, who by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The margin will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual's effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights. Where general social and economic policy considerations have arisen in the context of Article 8, the scope of the margin of appreciation depends on the context of the case, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the applicant ( see Connors, cited above, § 82 with further references)."

Switzerland, no. 31827/96, § 63, ECHR 2001 ‑ III ). It is therefore not called upon to review the legislation at issue in the abstract, namely the relevant provisions of the Enforcement Act on the judicial sale of property, but will examine the specific circumstances of the applicant's case.

While this may be in the interest of efficient enforcement proceedings, the Court has doubts as to whether the debtor's interests are adequately taken into account where such a payment order, moreover for a comparatively minor sum, can be the basis for the judicial sale of a debtor's “home” within the meaning of Article 8. While the Court does not have to examine this system in the abstract, it notes that in the circumstances of the present case it was particularly detrimental to the applicant. It appears from the expert opinion provided in the guardianship proceedings that by the time the judicial sale of her apartment took place she had lacked legal capacity for years. As a result she had not been in a position either to object to the payment order underlying the decision authorising the judicial sale or to make use of the remedies available to the debtor under the Enforcement Act (see paragraph 28 above )."

It is true, as the Government pointed out, that the courts were not and could not have been aware of the applicant's lack of legal capacity when conducting the proceedings at issue. However, the Court attaches weight to the fact that once the applicant's lack of legal capacity had been established and a guardian had been appointed for her, she was left without any means of obtaining a review of her case due to the absolute nature of the time-limit for appealing against a judicial sale laid down in section 187 § 1 of the Enforcement Act."

The Court notes the Supreme Court's and the Government's arguments that the said time-limit served to protect the bona fide purchaser and the general interests of an efficient administration of justice and of preserving legal certainty. Nevertheless, persons who lack legal capacity are particularly vulnerable and States may thus have a positive obligation under Article 8 to provide them with specific protection by the law (see, mutatis mutandis, Connors, cited above § 84). While generally there may be good reasons for having an absolute time-limit for lodging an appeal against a judicial sale of real estate, specific justification would be required where a person lacking legal capacity is concerned. The Court notes that the Supreme Court has not given any such justification and has not carried out any weighing of the conflicting interests at stake, namely the interests of the bona fide purchaser on the one hand and the debtor lacking legal capacity on the other hand."

Turning to the Government's argument that the absolute time-limit served the general interest of preserving legal certainty, the Court reiterates its established case-law in the context of Article 6 § 1. It has repeatedly stated that one of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, among other things, that where the courts have finally determined an issue their ruling should not be called into question (see, among many others, Brumărescu v. Romania, judgment of 28 October 1999, Reports 1999-VII, § 61 ). Nevertheless, the Court has held that departures from that principle may be justified when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, § 52, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX). The Court has not considered Article 6 § 1 to have been violated where the quashing of a final and enforceable decision was aimed at correcting a fundamental defect (see, for instance, Protsenko v. Russia, no. 13151/04, §§ 30-34, 31 July 2008 )."

The Court notes that the complaint under Article 13 arises out of the same facts as those it examined when dealing with the objection of non-exhaustion and the complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. However, there is a difference in the nature of the interests protected by Article 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1: the former affords a procedural safeguard, namely the “right to an effective remedy”, whereas the procedural requirement inherent in the latter is ancillary to the wider purpose of ensuring respect for the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. Having regard to the difference in purpose of the safeguards afforded by the two Articles, the Court judges it appropriate in the instant case to examine the same set of facts under both Articles (see, mutatis mutandis, the McMichael v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 February 1995, Series A no. 307-B, p. 57, § 91)."

It was settled case-law that without such an application the most that could be achieved by lodging an objection against an eviction order was to have that order quashed; the court simply looked at whether the conditions for issuing the order had been satisfied and did not deal with issues of ownership, use or possession. Moreover, a judicial decision returning the land to the applicant would be enforceable against the State, since section 8 of Law no. 2097/1952 (introducing State immunity from execution) applied only to monetary claims.",

The court found in his favour, holding that the conditions for issuing such an order had not been satisfied. The Minister of Finance, however, refused to give approval for the cinema to be returned to him. In the light of the Minister’s stance, an action under Articles 987 and 989 of the Civil Code – assuming it had succeeded – would in all probability not have led to a different outcome from that of the application to have the eviction order quashed. The applicant cannot therefore be criticised for not having made use of a legal remedy which would have been directed to essentially the same end and which moreover would not have had a better prospect of success (see, mutatis mutandis, the Miailhe v. France (no. 1) judgment of 25 February 1993, Series A no. 256 ‑ C, p. 87, § 27).",

In the instant case, however, compensation would not have been an alternative to the measures which the Greek legal system should have afforded the applicant to overcome the fact that he was unable to regain possession of the cinema despite a court decision quashing the eviction order. Furthermore, the various proceedings pending in the Athens Court of First Instance are decisive only in respect of an award of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Hornsby v. Greece judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports 1997-II, p. 509, § 37).",

The applicant stated that in 1978 he had taken a lease of an open-air cinema from K.N., who had acted as the owner of it, and that he had held the leased property until 1985 without any challenge by the State. The Minister of Agriculture’s decision in 1953 (see paragraph 8 above) had merely determined the boundary line between that part of the “Karras estate” classified as forest and the urban part, which belonged to K.N. It was clear from the plans that the site of the cinema fell within the latter part – that is to say, squarely within the urban area and a long distance from the tract of land which had been transferred to the Police Cooperative and dealt with in judgment no. 4910/1977. Although the ownership of the cinema was still a matter of dispute between the State and those who had leased the land to the applicant, namely K.N.’s heirs, the State had always treated the heirs as the true owners by levying inheritance tax on the land from them, from the very beginning and right up to the present day; moreover, the permit for the cinema to be built had referred to K.N. as the owner of the land. In its judgment of 21 June 1977 the Court of Appeal had determined only the ownership of the land transferred to the Police Cooperative, not that of the land in question, which was quite separate and a long distance from the other tract of land. In 1978 there had therefore been no reason for the applicant to have the slightest doubt that K.N.’s heirs owned the land."

                "53. The Government submitted that the administrative eviction order had merely deprived the applicant of the right to use and possess the land in issue and had not prevented him from carrying on his business. The applicant had had four years to find an alternative site for his business, which had consequently suffered no harm on account of the enforcement of the eviction order. Furthermore, a lessee’s right to use a leased property is limited in scope and in duration (since the lease can be terminated at any time by either party) and is relative (since it cannot be relied on against a third party with an overriding right over the leased property, such as a property right in rem ). Hence the lease had never given the applicant a sufficiently well-founded property right enforceable against the State. Any doubt which might have remained as to the State’s ownership of the land claimed by K.N.’s heirs had been dispelled by the Court of Appeal’s judgment (no. 4910/1977) of 21 June 1977 (see paragraph 13 above), in which it had been held that the whole area in dispute belonged to the State; the applicant could have learned of that by consulting the mortgage registers. The Court of First Instance judgment of 23 October 1989 had not established that the applicant had any right over the land in issue, since the proceedings had been concerned only with the formal validity of the eviction order and not with the property rights the parties might have over the land. Besides, the applicant could have sought redress from the lessors in the form of damages for leasing him land that he was unable to use owing to a legal defect. Lastly and most importantly, it had been open to the applicant, who still owned the cinema equipment, to set up his business elsewhere."

It is not for the Court, in deciding this case, to take the place of the national courts and determine whether the land in question belonged to the State or whether the lease between K.N.’s heirs and the applicant was void under Greek law. It will confine itself to observing that, before the applicant was evicted, he had operated the cinema for eleven years under a formally valid lease without any interference by the authorities, as a result of which he had built up a clientele that constituted an asset (see the Van Marle and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 June 1986, Series A no. 101, p. 13, § 41); in this connection, the Court takes into account the role played in local cultural life by open-air cinemas in Greece and to the fact that the clientele of such a cinema is made up mainly of local residents."

The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule.",

The Court reiterates that the first and most important requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful: the second sentence of the first paragraph authorises a deprivation of possessions only “subject to the conditions provided for by law” and the second paragraph recognises that the States have the right to control the use of property by enforcing “laws”. Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see the Amuur v. France judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 850-51, § 50) and entails a duty on the part of the State or other public authority to comply with judicial orders or decisions against it (see, mutatis mutandis, the Hornsby judgment cited above, p. 511, § 41). It follows that the issue of whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights (see the Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, p. 26, § 69) becomes relevant only once it has been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary."

Further and more especially, the Athens Court of First Instance in its judgment of 23 October 1989 had not ordered the eviction of the Town Council from the cinema and the applicant’s reinstatement (see paragraph 19 above). No such reinstatement order could have been made unless the applicant had expressly applied for one, separately from his application to have the eviction order quashed; the Government submitted that there was a large body of case-law to this effect and produced a judgment of the Athens Court of Appeal (no. 6802/1989) in which it had been held that an application for reinstatement could be lodged independently of other proceedings and was not subject to the time-limits for challenging eviction orders."

If the application was brought against Ilioupolis Town Council, it would be of no practical effect, since the decision would be binding only on the Council and there would be nothing to prevent the State from transferring the cinema to another public body; and even if he brought the application against the State itself, he would have no recourse in the event of a further refusal by the Minister."

Moreover, that court held that although “neither the report on the administrative inquiry of 2 April 1990, nor opinion no. 508/1991 of the full State Legal Council, nor the recommendation of the governing board of the State Lands Authority of 31 July 1995, [had] binding force or [was] enforceable, that [did] not mean that Ilioupolis Town Council … was entitled to disobey the law and to await enforcement proceedings like a private individual who deliberately refuses to assume his statutory or contractual obligations”.",

The applicant’s eviction on 17 March 1989 certainly had a legal basis in domestic law, namely the administrative eviction order issued on 9 February 1989 by a State-controlled body, the Lands Department of the Attica prefecture, the cinema having in the meantime been assigned to Ilioupolis Town Council by the State Lands Authority. However, on 23 October 1989 the Athens Court of First Instance heard the case under summary procedure and quashed the eviction order on the grounds that the conditions for issuing it had not been satisfied. No appeal lay against that decision. From that moment on, the applicant’s eviction thus ceased to have any legal basis and Ilioupolis Town Council became an unlawful occupier and should have returned the cinema to the applicant, as was indeed recommended by all the bodies from whom the Minister of Finance sought an opinion, namely the Ministry of Finance, the State Legal Council and the State Lands Authority (see paragraphs 20, 21 and 25 above). More specifically, the last-named body proposed that the Minister should revoke the assignment of the cinema to the Town Council, restore the use of it to Mr Iatridis and reinstate him in the property he had leased.

Having regard to the difference in purpose of the safeguards afforded by the two Articles, the Court judges it appropriate in the instant case to examine the same set of facts under both Articles (see, mutatis mutandis, the McMichael v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 February 1995, Series A no. 307-B, p. 57, § 91)."

In this regard, a margin of appreciation must, inevitably, be left to the national authorities, who by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The margin will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual’s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights (see, for example, Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 21, § 52; Gillow v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 24 November 1986, Series A, no. 104, § 55). On the other hand, in spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, there is authority that the margin of appreciation is wide, as in the planning context where the Court has found that “[i]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation ( Buckley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 26 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1292, § 75 in fine ). The Court has also stated that in spheres such as housing, which play a central role in the welfare and economic policies of modern societies, it will respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Mellacher and Others v. Austria, judgment of 19 December 1989, Series A no. 169, p. 27, § 45, Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, ECHR 1999-V, § 49 ). It may be noted however that this was in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, not Article 8 which concerns rights of central importance to the individual’s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community (see, mutatis mutandis, Gillow v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 55; Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, ECHR 2002-III; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, no. 28957/95, § 90, ECHR 2002-VI). Where general social and economic policy considerations have arisen in the context of Article 8 itself, the scope of the margin of appreciation depends on the context of the case, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the applicant ( Hatton and others v. the United Kingdom, [GC] no. 36022/97, ECHR 2003-..., §§ 103 and 123)."

Those already established on sites like Thistlebrook would, of course, enjoy full 1983 security of tenure. But local authorities in the position of the council would need to start de novo to discharge their duty under section 6 of the Act of 1968. Many existing designations under section 12 would have to be revoked or would perhaps be automatically invalidated... For the future, local authorities establishing new sites providing accommodation for gypsies would have to be vigilant to prevent their residence acquiring any degree of permanency.

With Part I of the 1968 Act, and with the 1975 and 1983 Acts, Parliament sought to address specific problems of commercial exploitation experienced by occupiers of private sites. There has never been any evidence to suggest that such problems extend to local authority Gypsy sites, and accordingly those legislative provisions that are directed at those problems have not been extended to such sites. The problems faced by Gypsies were wholly different, relating primarily to the acute shortage of sites available to meet their particular accommodation needs. The said problems were addressed by Part II of the 1968 Act, and supplemented by the departmental guidance circulars issued to local authorities. By 1994, the scheme of part II of the 1968 Act was found to have served its purpose as far as it could reasonably be expected to do. There was now a substantial and valuable supply of Gypsy caravan sites provided and operated by local authorities. The emphasis of Government policy has now changed to one of encouraging Gypsies themselves to add to that existing supply. Nevertheless existing local authority supply remains an essential component of the Government’s strategy of securing an adequate level of accommodation for Gypsies. The policy of the 1994 Act is to maintain and safeguard that distinct source of supply.",

In general, the key difference between such sites has been the greater flexibility, which is usually available on local authority Gypsy sites, in order to accommodate the nomadic lifestyle of occupiers. This may allow Gypsies to remain on a site on a short-term basis, or to retain a site for 12 months of the year, while paying a reduced rent as a retainer during the few months of the year while they may be travelling in search of seasonal work. Other local authority sites and private sites, in general, are aimed at longer-term residential occupiers, without the need for such flexibility because they are not pursuing a nomadic lifestyle.",

Nevertheless, there are of course a number of Gypsies who occupy sites on a long-term basis, and other mobile home residents who do not consider themselves to be Gypsies, but who prefer to occupy private sites on a more short-term basis. The aim of the separate statutory frameworks is to ensure diversity of provision to meet the varying needs of different individuals and families; it is not to classify or categorise individuals or families. Accordingly, Gypsies seeking to settle on a more permanent site may occupy private or local authority (non-Gypsy) sites and benefit from the scheme put in place by Part I of the 1968 Act and the 1983 Act. This diversity of public and private site provision reflects that which is available in housing generally.",
                "28. The separate statutory framework allows for flexibility in meeting the accommodation needs of Gypsies. It appears that the Defendant is effectively arguing in these proceedings in favour of a single statutory framework applicable to all caravan sites, including local authority Gypsy sites. In my view, such a single statutory framework would be detrimental to the interests of Gypsies throughout the country. If the security of tenure provisions of that framework applied equally to local authority Gypsy sites, it would undermine the flexibility that such sites provide in catering for the varied lifestyles of Gypsies. Some may move from site to site on a regular basis, while others may be more permanently based on a site, possibly travelling for a few months each year to take on seasonal work. If each Gypsy were able to rely on security of tenure then every site, whatever its designation, could potentially become a permanent site with no scope to accommodate short-term occupiers. Furthermore, if there were no longer a distinction in the statutory framework allowing flexibility for the provision of Gypsy sites, then there would be nothing to prevent any person residing in a mobile home seeking to occupy a Gypsy site, whether or not they pursue a nomadic lifestyle. Inevitably, fewer sites, if any, could be made available specifically for Gypsies pursing a nomadic lifestyle.",
                "32. Experience suggests that local authorities would face difficulties in managing sites if eviction were subject to broad discretionary powers of the courts to suspend or attach conditions to orders. There is a balance to be struck between the latter and the merits of flexibility (already mentioned) that such sites offer in catering for the varying accommodation needs of Gypsies. To this (and in favour of the existing position) must be added the fact that in reaching decisions about evictions local authorities, as responsible bodies, need to take into account the range of obligations and considerations outlined in paragraph 29 above. These amount to significant safeguards against unscrupulous or unjustified evictions. Furthermore local authority decisions in relation to eviction are open to challenge by way of judicial review.’ ”"

It is true that occupiers of exempted sites do not have the benefit of the safeguards applicable to introductory tenants. In practice, however, they are able to bring judicial review proceedings where the circumstances justify them, and I do not think that the absence of those safeguards substantially prejudices persons such as the Defendant. Moreover, any such safeguards would detract from the flexibility that Parliament has decided is appropriate for exempted sites. ...",

The judge summarised the statements of both Mr Gahagan and Dr Kenrick concerning the differing patterns of life chosen by gypsies: Mr Gahagan emphasised the flexibility necessary to cope with those who move on a regular basis or were permanently based on one site but possibly travelling several months a year while Dr Kenrick stated that position had substantially moved on from the time of the 1968 Act when it was anticipated that 20% of families travelled, that local authorities even encouraged families to become permanent residents by allowing them to leave for periods and pay half rent and that for the small minority that travelled all year round there were the existing small number of transit sites.

                "“32. It is plain from the passages of the October 2002 Report that I have cited that it is now accepted that there is a substantial majority that no longer travels for any material period, albeit that there is a substantial minority that does travel. No figures have been produced, and, as Dr Kenrick himself has pointed out, no statistics as to turnover yet exist, but the varied passages from the Report which I have cited in paragraph 30(vi) show that it is accepted that some thinking must now be done. Nevertheless when asked by me whether the Secretary of State wanted an adjournment to consider the position further, Mr Mould clearly stated that no such adjournment was sought, and that his case remains that, rethink though there plainly is going to be, the Secretary of State still accepts the onus of showing that the present legislation can still be justified. This is not a case, as adumbrated in Seymour-Smith and Hooper, where the Government now accepts that the position can no longer be justified but asserts an entitlement to a period to correct discriminatory effects before a declaration is made... but rather a situation where the Government is still in the process of monitoring the position and, until it reaches a conclusion, asserts that the present position can be justified.",
                "33. If this were simply a matter of concluding that there is now a substantial majority of gypsies who are no longer nomadic, whose position can be immediately safeguarded by some new legislation of the kind discussed in general terms in paragraph 31 above, I would not feel inhibited either by the well-established principles of allowing deference and/or a margin of appreciation to Government or Parliament... nor in particular by the principle enunciated by the Court in Mellacher ... whereby the ‘possible existence of alternative solutions does not in itself render the contested legislation unjustified’. However I am satisfied that the position is not so straightforward. There is, in my judgment, quite apart from any simple question of giving security of tenure to those in council caravan sites, a necessary, indeed, crucial, concomitant question to be considered and resolved, before it can be concluded that the present position is unjustified. I conclude that there is a very difficult question of how to define gypsies, to whom security of tenure in such sites is to be given (if it is). If security of tenure is to be given to all long-term caravan occupiers on council sites, as they are on private sites, then how, if at all, is there to be any differentiation between gypsy/traveller occupiers and any other occupiers who wish to place a mobile home on a local authority site, with security of tenure? And if there is to be no such differentiation, then the last state of gypsies whose cultural heritage or spiritual and cultural state of mind is nomadism or travelling may be worse than the first. At present that actual or potential nomadism (‘a substantial nomadic habit of life’) is the justification both for the lack of security of tenure and also for the special arrangements for local authority sites catering especially for them, i.e. within section 24 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960. Dr Kenrick himself refers obliquely to the problem, in paragraph 53 of his witness statement: “ The residents of council sites do not have to retain their Gypsy status (by travelling for an economic purpose...) in order to retain their pitches. ” ...",
                "35. I am satisfied that ... the absence of security of tenure for all gypsy/travellers on all local authority sites, is still appropriate and justified. I have no doubt that the Government will give further thought to the position, as indicated in the October 2002 Report, will obtain the necessary further statistics and will, pursuant to its own declared intention to give protection to gypsies and their way of life, continue monitoring the present position. Meanwhile, the safeguard of judicial review remains, and, although there is some discussion in the Report (pp. 246-7) about the present lack of security of tenure, eviction of residential gypsy occupiers on local authority caravan sites is not flagged up as a present problem...”",

The more settled people become, the more important tenure seems likely to be to them as long-term residents begin to improve and develop their plots, build sheds of their own, and so on. Some may acquire mobile homes rather than caravans which would be difficult to move and re-site. It is generally thought hard to find space on an official site – particularly on a good one as there aren’t many sites and a lot of them are thought to be full.

On the contrary there were many examples of enforcement action being taken against gypsies’ occupation of their own land. Nor were there any temporary stopping places with basic facilities as envisaged in Government circulars such as 18/94.

The applicant denied that he was advocating a single statutory framework for all sites, arguing that a particular need for flexibility in gypsy provision could be reflected in grounds available for possession (for example, unmaintained caravans, absence exceeding a particular period), but not by ignoring the need to prove disputed facts. Different regimes should not necessitate that gypsies on local authority sites lose the benefit of court protection to test, for example, an alleged breach of licence.

In those circumstances, it was not the case that these sites were needed, or used, for the minority of gypsies who followed a substantially nomadic lifestyle and it was appropriate to bring site provision more closely within mainstream housing as a form of specially adapted housing for gypsies. It would be possible to safeguard the interests of the persons of nomadic habit by designating certain pitches for “transit” while at the same time conferring security of tenure on the majority of the residents of local authority gypsy sites.

He considered that his case could be distinguished from Chapman v. the United Kingdom, ([GC] no. 27138/95, ECHR 2001-I, § 92), relied on by the Government, as that concerned a local planning decision grounded in local knowledge and understanding of local conditions whereas his case concerned assessment of a general policy at national level."

The applicant had agreed to occupy the plot on the terms that neither he, his family nor guests would cause a nuisance and he had been warned by the Council that he was in breach. In the circumstances, the Council was entitled to revoke the licence. Similar terms would have applied to a secure housing tenant. Though the licence did not require the Council to give the applicant the opportunity to challenge the allegations of nuisance made against him, it was a public authority obliged to act lawfully, reasonably, fairly and for the proper purposes for which its powers were conferred. Its decisions were therefore amenable to judicial review and the applicant, who was legally represented, was able to challenge the decision in judicial review proceedings where the High Court found no evidence to doubt the reasonableness and procedural fairness of the Council’s decision. The Council had also taken into account the needs of the applicant and his family in the decision-making process. If there had been no proper basis for the eviction or the applicant had mounted a substantial factual challenge to the asserted justification, the domestic courts would have been able, through their scrutiny, to provide a remedy against arbitrary action. There was however no substantial dispute as to the primary facts as the applicant did not appear to deny that his sons and guests were causing a nuisance. This procedure therefore provided the applicant with a series of important safeguards. In addition to the remedy of judicial review, occupiers had, since 2000, a right of action under the Human Rights Act 1998, pursuant to which the courts can consider directly claims of violation of the Convention (see, for example, Somerset County Council v. Isaacs, paragraphs 47-50 above)."

While they accepted that the statutory protection from eviction which the applicant enjoyed in respect of the plot was more limited than if his caravan had been on a site other than one provided by a local authority for gypsy accommodation, the Government emphasised that statutory regulation of housing was a matter of some complexity and within the area in which courts should defer to the decision of the democratically elected legislature. A wide margin of appreciation applied equally to this situation as it did in the planning context (see Chapman v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 92). They argued that the limited degree of protection was justified with regard to the differing aims of the statutory schemes concerned. Regarding the provision for gypsies, it had to be recalled that the 1968 Act had sought to remedy the grave shortage of sites for gypsies who led a nomadic lifestyle by placing a duty on local authorities to provide such sites. By 1994, the Act was found to have served its purpose as far as it could reasonably be expected to, with local authority sites providing the largest contribution to the overall accommodation needs of gypsies. Policy then changed its emphasis to encouraging gypsies to promote their own sites via the planning process. The authorities were keeping the situation under review, as seen in the independent reports issued in October 2002 and July 2003, which did not reveal that the exemption posed any problems in practice in the operation of local authority gypsy sites. It was apparent in the latter report that local authorities used their powers of eviction sparingly and as a sanction of last resort. It remained however an important management tool."

Notwithstanding shifts in gypsy habits, the existing local authority supply of sites remained an essential component of the Government’s strategy of ensuring an adequate level of provision for gypsies and the policy of the legislation was to maintain and safeguard that distinct supply. Thus the special regime of tenure applicable to local authority gypsy sites reflected the need to ensure that local authorities were able to operate their gypsy sites in a flexible way that met the special accommodation needs of gypsies consistent with their nomadic lifestyle. To require local authorities to justify in court their management decisions in relation to individual occupiers would add significantly to their administrative burden, increasing costs and licence fees and would reduce the flexibility intended by the framework. The domestic courts examining the cases of Isaacs and Smith concluded, in light of the evidence submitted, that there remained objective justification for current legislative arrangements on local authority gypsy sites (see paragraphs 47-53 above). The issues raised in the recent reports were now the subject of a thorough Government review of policy, which would include the existing regime of tenure on local authority gypsy sites and examine all the competing interests. It was not the case that the reports established that this regime was currently unjustifiable or that there was a readily identifiable and workable alternative regime of greater security of tenure that would overcome the applicant’s complaints in this case."

The Government further explained that the policy and object of the mobile homes legislation was to remedy a different problem, namely, the inequality of bargaining power between the mobile home owner and the site owner, in which area there was a deficiency of supply over demand which the private sites, run as businesses, were in a position to exploit, by for example compelling a resident to buy his mobile home from the site owner and then evicting him and forcing him to sell the home back at a significant undervalue. The 1983 Act was designed specifically to remedy such abuses by giving residents of such sites stronger security of tenure. On the other hand, the regime applicable to local authority gypsy sites enabled disruptive occupiers to be dealt with quickly, preventing damage to the site and forestalling the tendency of the other occupiers to leave to avoid the problem. There was the practical advantage that this avoided the need to produce witnesses, there being a reported reluctance for other occupiers to get involved or “inform” on rule-breakers."

In this regard, a margin of appreciation must, inevitably, be left to the national authorities, who by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The margin will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual’s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights (see, for example, Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 21, § 52; Gillow v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 24 November 1986, Series A, no. 104, § 55). On the other hand, in spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, there is authority that the margin of appreciation is wide, as in the planning context where the Court has found that “[i]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation ( Buckley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 26 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1292, § 75 in fine ). The Court has also stated that in spheres such as housing, which play a central role in the welfare and economic policies of modern societies, it will respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Mellacher and Others v. Austria, judgment of 19 December 1989, Series A no. 169, p. 27, § 45, Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, ECHR 1999-V, § 49 ). It may be noted however that this was in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, not Article 8 which concerns rights of central importance to the individual’s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community (see, mutatis mutandis, Gillow v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 55; Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, ECHR 2002-III; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, no. 28957/95, § 90, ECHR 2002-VI). Where general social and economic policy considerations have arisen in the context of Article 8 itself, the scope of the margin of appreciation depends on the context of the case, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the applicant ( Hatton and others v. the United Kingdom, [GC] no. 36022/97, ECHR 2003-..., §§ 103 and 123)."

The applicant and his family were evicted from the site where they had lived, with a short absence, for some fourteen to fifteen years, with consequent difficulties in finding a lawful alternative location for their caravans, in coping with health problems and young children and in ensuring continuation in the children’s education. The family was, in effect, rendered homeless, with the adverse consequences on security and well-being which that entails. The Council, and the Government in these proceedings, took the view that the eviction was justified by a breach of the licence conditions, the applicant being responsible for causing nuisance on the site. The applicant contested that he was at fault. It is not for the Court however to assess in retrospect whose version of events was correct as the Council in evicting the applicant relied instead on the power to give 28 days notice to obtain summary possession without proving any breach of licence. While it was variously alleged by Council officers that the applicant’s licence conditions had been breached due to the unruly conduct of persons on his pitch and contended by the applicant that any problems arose from adult visitors from off the site over whom he had no control, the respective merits of the arguments were not examined in the County Court proceedings, which were only concerned with the fulfilment of the formal conditions for the eviction. The central issue in this case is therefore whether, in the circumstances, the legal framework applicable to the occupation of pitches on local authority gypsy sites provided the applicant with sufficient procedural protection of his rights."

The serious interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 8 requires, in the Court’s opinion, particularly weighty reasons of public interest by way of justification and the margin of appreciation to be afforded to the national authorities must be regarded as correspondingly narrowed. The Court would also observe that this case is not concerned with matters of general planning or economic policy but with the much narrower issue of the policy of procedural protection for a particular category of persons. The present case may also be distinguished from the Chapman case (cited above), in which there was a wide margin of appreciation, as in that case, it was undisputed that the applicant had breached planning law in taking up occupation of land within the Green Belt in her caravans and claimed, in effect, special exemption from the rules applying to everyone else. In the present case, the applicant was lawfully on the site and claims that the procedural guarantees available to other mobile home sites, including privately run gypsy sites, and to local authority housing, should equally apply to the occupation of that site by himself and his family."

Government policy sought to cater for the special needs of gypsies who live a nomadic lifestyle and this, they emphasised, required flexibility in the management of local authority sites. They argued, secondly, that the power to evict summarily was a vital management tool in coping with anti-social behaviour as without speedily removing troublemakers the other gypsy families would tend to abandon the site rather than assisting the local authority by “informing” on others and giving evidence in formal court procedures. As a subsidiary argument, they submitted that the additional costs of court procedures could increase the fees applicable to gypsy sites and thus act to the overall detriment of the gypsy population as a whole."

            [
                "88. As regards the nomadism argument, the Court notes that it no longer appears to be the case that local authority gypsy sites cater for a transient population. The October 2002 report (see paragraphs 55-63 above) indicates, as has been apparent from the series of cases brought to Strasbourg over the last two decades, that a substantial majority of gypsies no longer travel for any material period. Most local authority sites are residential in character. On 86% the residents have been in occupation for three years or more and there is a very low turnover of vacancies. Of an estimated 5,000 pitches, only 300 are allocated as transit pitches. It is not apparent that it can be realistically claimed that the majority of local authority sites have to provide, or aim to provide, a regular turnover of vacancies to accommodate gypsies who are travelling round or through the area. The Court is not persuaded therefore that the claimed flexibility is related in any substantial way to catering for an unspecified minority of gypsies who remain ‘nomadic’ and for whom a minimum of transit pitches have to be made available. It appears that there are in fact specific sites designated as “transit” sites and that these are distinguished from the vast majority of other local authority gypsy sites. The material before the Court certainly does not indicate that eviction by summary procedure is used as a means of maintaining a turnover of vacant pitches or of preventing families from becoming long-term occupants."
            ],
            [
                "89. As regards the use of summary eviction as a tool in controlling anti-social behaviour, the Court would note that the 2003 report indicates that it is in fact only rarely used – on 5% of sites – and that some local authorities considered that the licence status of gypsies made them second-class citizens and would prefer to regularise their position to bring them into line with other forms of social housing (see paragraphs 64-66). The mere fact that anti-social behaviour occurs on local authority gypsy sites cannot, in itself, justify a summary power of eviction, since such problems also occur on local authority housing estates and other mobile home sites and in those cases the authorities make use of a different range of powers and may only proceed to evict subject to independent court review of the justification for the measure. Notwithstanding the assertion that gypsy attitudes to authority would make court proceedings impractical, it may be noted that security of tenure protection covers privately run gypsy sites to which the same considerations would appear also to apply. Consequently the Court is not persuaded there is any particular feature about local authority gypsy sites which would render their management unworkable if they were required to establish reasons for evicting long-standing occupants. Nor does it find any indication that the gypsies would lose the advantage of low financial costs attaching to local authority sites. According to the submissions of the applicant, which were not contested by the Government, local authority gypsy sites do not benefit from particularly low licence fees and in his case he had to pay double the rate of a local authority housing tenancy."

Nor does the gypsy population gain any benefit from the special regime through any corresponding duty on the local authority to ensure that there is a sufficient provision for them (see P. v. the United Kingdom, no. 14751/89, decision on admissibility of 12 December 1990, Decisions and Reports 67, p. 264, concerning the regime applicable before the repeal of section 6 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 and paragraphs 35-36 above). The October 2002 report noted that 70% of local authorities did not have any written gypsy/traveller accommodation policy and commented that this reflected the lack of a specific duty on local authorities to consider their needs (paragraph 58 above). Since the 1994 Act came into force, there has been only a small net increase in the number of local authority pitches. The case of Chapman, together with the four other applications by gypsies decided by the Grand Chamber ( Beard v. the United Kingdom, no. 24882/94, Coster v. the United Kingdom no. 24876/94, Jane Smith v. the United Kingdom, no. 25154/94, and Lee v. the United Kingdom, no. 25289/94, judgments of 18 January 2001), also demonstrate that there are no special allowances made for gypsies in the planning criteria applied by local authorities to applications for permission to station of caravans on private sites."

The Government have pointed out that the domestic courts, since the entry into force of the Human Rights Act 1998, have examined the Convention issues in similar cases and found no violations of Articles 14 or 8. The Court notes that the High Court has reviewed the lack of security of tenure of gypsies on local authority sites in a number of cases. There is force in the Government’s argument that some weight should be attached to the views of national judges who are in principle better placed than an international one to assess the requirements of the society because of their direct and continuous links with that society. However, in Isaacs, the judge commented that he was not over-impressed by the vagueness of ‘experience’ relied on by the Government in justifying the necessity of the regime (see paragraph 50 above), while in Smith, the judge implied that he would have no difficulty in concluding that there were a substantial majority of gypsies who were no longer nomadic whose position could immediately be safeguarded by some new legislation (paragraph 53 above). The Court would observe that the domestic courts stopped short of finding any breach of the provisions of the Convention, having regard inter alia to the perceived existence of safeguards that diminished the impact on the individual gypsy’s rights and to a judicial reluctance to trespass on the legislative function in seeking to resolve the complex issues to which no straightforward answer was possible. The domestic courts’ position cannot therefore be analysed as providing strong support for the justification of continuing the current regime."

                "92. The existence of other procedural safeguards is however a crucial consideration in this Court’s assessment of the proportionality of the interference. The Government have relied on the possibility for the applicant to apply for judicial review and to obtain a scrutiny by the courts of the lawfulness and reasonableness of the Council’s decisions. It would also be possible to challenge the Council for any failure to take into account in its decision-making relevant matters such as duties towards children (see paragraph 42 above). The Court would recall that the applicant sought permission to apply for judicial review and that permission was refused. In the applicant’s case, his principal objection was based not on any lack of compliance by the Council with its duties or on any failure to act lawfully but on the fact that he and the members of the family living with him on the plot were not responsible for any nuisance and could not be held responsible for the nuisance caused by others who visited the site. Whether or not he would have succeeded in that argument, a factual dispute clearly existed between the parties. Nonetheless, the local authority was not required to establish any substantive justification for evicting him and on this point judicial review could not provide any opportunity for an examination of the facts in dispute between the parties. Indeed, the Government drew the Court’s attention to the Court of Appeal’s decision in Smart, where it was held that to entitle persons housed under homelessness provisions, without security of tenure, to have a court decide on the facts of their cases as to the proportionality of their evictions would convert their occupation into a form of secure tenure and in effect undermine the statutory scheme (paragraph 54 above). While therefore the existence of judicial review may provide a valuable safeguard against abuse or oppressive conduct by local authorities in some areas, the Court does not consider that it can be regarded as assisting the applicant, or other gypsies, in circumstances where the local authority terminates licences in accordance with the applicable law."

The complexity of the situation has, if anything, been enhanced by the apparent shift in habit in the gypsy population which remains nomadic in spirit if not in actual or constant practice. The authorities are being required to give special consideration to a sector of the population which is no longer easy to define in terms of the nomadism which is the raison d’être of that special treatment."

However, even allowing for the margin of appreciation which is to be afforded to the State in such circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that the necessity for a statutory scheme which permitted the summary eviction of the applicant and his family has been sufficiently demonstrated by the Government. The power to evict without the burden of giving reasons liable to be examined as to their merits by an independent tribunal has not been convincingly shown to respond to any specific goal or to provide any specific benefit to members of the gypsy community. The references to “flexibility” or “administrative burden” have not been supported by any concrete indications of the difficulties that the regime is thereby intended to avoid (see, mutatis mutandis, Larkos v. Cyprus, [GC], no. 29515/95, ECHR 1999-I, where in finding a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 concerning the difference in security of tenure provisions applying between tenants of public and private housing, the Court did not find that the difference in treatment could be justified by the argument that giving the applicant the right to remain indefinitely in a State-owned dwelling would fetter the authorities’ duty to administer State-owned property in accordance with constitutional and legal requirements). It would rather appear that the situation in England as it has developed, for which the authorities must take some responsibility, places considerable obstacles in the way of gypsies pursuing an actively nomadic lifestyle while at the same time excluding from procedural protection those who decide to take up a more settled lifestyle."

The judgment did not require the authorities to give him ownership of a particular flat, but rather obliged them to issue him with an occupancy voucher in respect of any flat satisfying the court-defined criteria. On the basis of the voucher, a so-called “social tenancy agreement” would have been signed between the competent authority and the applicant, acting as the principal tenant on behalf of himself and the members of his family ( see paragraph 2 0 above ).

In any event, the Court observes that the applicant did not complain about any unlawful act on the part of a bailiff but, rather, about the fact that the judgment was not enforced. Even if the applicant had brought a complaint against the bailiff and obtained a decision confirming that the decision to terminate the enforcement proceedings had been unlawful in domestic terms, such an action would only have produced repetitive results, namely a writ of execution enabling the bailiffs to proceed with the enforcement of the judgment of 26 September 1994 ( see Yavorivskaya v.

In fact, the pursuit of this “remedy” would have required the applicant either to purchase a flat at considerable personal expense, albeit with borrowed money, or to wait his turn indefinitely on the housing list. This could not have improved the situation of the applicant, who had already obtained an enforceable judgment as a result of successful litigation, by the terms of which a State authority was to grant him a flat without additional charges or undue delay. Furthermore, the decision to grant a loan or place a person on the waiting list depended on the discretionary powers vested in the Courts Administration Department.

However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 (see Burdov v.

Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 100, ECHR 2000 ‑ I, and Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ II )."

The right to live in a particular property not owned by the applicant does not as such constitute a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see H.F. v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 54797/00, 9 December 2003; Kovalenok v. Latvia (dec.), no. 54264/00, 15 February 2001, and J.L.S. v. Spain (dec.), no. 41917/98, 27 April 1999)."

However, pecuniary assets, such as debts, by virtue of which the applicant can claim to have at least a “legitimate expectation” of obtaining effective enjoyment of a particular pecuniary asset may also fall within the notion of “possessions” contained in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v.

The judgment did not require the authorities to give him ownership of a particular flat, but rather obliged them to issue him with an occupancy voucher in respect of any flat satisfying the court-defined criteria. On the basis of the voucher, a so-called “social tenancy agreement” would have been signed between the competent authority and the applicant, acting as the principal tenant on behalf of himself and the members of his family ( see paragraph 2 0 above ). Under the terms of a “social tenancy agreement”, as established in the RSFSR Housing Code and the applicable regulations, the applicant would have had a right to possess and make use of the flat and, under certain conditions, to privatise it in accordance with the Privatisation of State Housing Act."

                "80. In the modern, democratic State, many individuals are, for all or part of their lives, completely dependent for survival on social-security and welfare benefits. Many national legal systems recognise that such individuals require a degree of certainty and security, and provide for benefits to be paid – subject to the fulfilment of the conditions of eligibility – as of right (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 51). The principles which apply generally in cases under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are equally relevant when it comes to social and welfare benefits (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 54). The Court has previously addressed the issue of legitimate expectation in the context of social benefits on a number of occasions (see, for example, Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, § 44, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX, and Klein v. Austria, no. 57028/00, § 45, 3 March 2011."
            ],
            [
                "81. In those legal systems where the national legislation requires mandatory contributions of employees to the social-security system, the legislation normally provides that those who have made adequate contributions and satisfied the statutory requirements of disability will receive some form of long-term disability benefit, on grounds of the principles of social solidarity and equivalency, for the period of the disability persisting or until the age of retirement. Such insurance schemes, which are typically mandatory, provide such protection, that is, the availability of benefits, for the entire period of insurance and on every occasion when the conditions of the insurance are satisfied. The relevant legal conditions are however subject to evolution. In this connection, it may be reiterated that in Gaygusuz v. Austria (16 September 1996, § 41, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV) the Court found that the right to emergency assistance – a social benefit linked to the payment of contributions to the unemployment insurance fund – was, in so far as provided for in the applicable legislation, a pecuniary right for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In Klein (cited above, § 43) it was noted that entitlement to a social benefit – in that instance, a pension payable from a lawyers’ pension scheme – was linked to the payment of contributions, and, when such contributions had been made, an award could not be denied to the person concerned. Contributions to a pension fund may thus, in certain circumstances and according to the domestic law, create a property right (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 39; Apostolakis v. Greece, no. 39574/07, §§ 28 and 35, 22 October 2009; Bellet, Huertas and Vialatte v. France (dec.), nos. 40832/98, 40833/98 and 40906/98, 27 April 1999; Skórkiewicz v. Poland (dec.), no. 39860/98, 1 June 1999; and Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, § 41, 15 September 2009)."
            ],

                "82. The Court has also held that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 imposes no restriction on the Contracting States’ freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social-security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme (see Sukhanov and Ilchenko v. Ukraine, nos. 68385/10 and 71378/10, §§ 35-39, 26 June 2014; Kolesnyk v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 57116/10, §§ 83, 89 and 91, 3 June 2014; and Fakas v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 4519/11, §§ 34, 37-43, 48, 3 June 2014). If, however, a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a welfare benefit – whether conditional or not on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation must be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 54)."

In certain circumstances the making of compulsory contributions, for example to a pension fund or a social insurance scheme, may create a property right protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 even before the contributor fulfils all the conditions to actually receive the pension or other benefit. This is the case when there is a direct link between the level of contributions and the benefits awarded (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 43). The payment of contributions to a pension fund may in certain circumstances create a property right in a portion of such a fund and a modification of the pension rights under such a system could therefore in principle raise an issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1; even if it is assumed that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 guarantees to persons who have paid contributions to a special insurance system the right to derive benefit from the system, it cannot be interpreted as entitling that person to a pension of a particular amount (see Müller v. Austria, no. 5849/72, Commission’s report of 1 October 1975, DR 3, p. 25, § 30, quoted in T. v. Sweden, no. 10671/83, Commission decision of 4 March 1985, DR 42, p. 229, at p. 232)."

Poland, no. 38886/05, § 71, 28 April 2009) where the conditions had changed before the applicant became eligible for a specific benefit (see Richardson, cited above, § 17). Where the suspension or diminution of a pension was not due to any changes in the applicant’s own circumstances, but to changes in the law or its implementation, this may result in an interference with the rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Grudić, cited above, § 77)."

Poland, no. 38459/03, §§ 78 and 82, 2 October 2012). In another case it considered that the failure to fulfil a condition (namely the requirement of affiliation to a professional association), which under national law was a sufficient reason for forfeiture of a pension claim, did not lead to the conclusion that the applicant had no possession within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Klein, cited above, § 46). Nor was the Court prevented from finding that an applicant, whose application for disabled adults allowance had been rejected on the grounds of his non-fulfilment of a statutory nationality condition, had a pecuniary right for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Koua Poirrez v. France, no. 40892/98, §§ 37-42, ECHR 2003-X). By contrast, in yet a further case, the mere fact that the public authorities had tolerated the cumulating of two pensions and, where it was permitted, reimbursement of the contributions for one of them, did not give rise to a right protected by the Protocol (see Bellet, Huertas and Vialatte, cited above)."

The Government added that, had the law not been amended, she would once again have become eligible when her health impairment was again assessed as exceeding the relevant threshold in 2012.

The Convention did not guarantee any property rights independently from the domestic law of sovereign States.

This was also indicated by the fact that her 67% loss of working capacity under the pre-2008 system would have been equivalent to 54% health impairment under the new methodology; however, it had been assessed at 40% in 2009, which thus indicated a certain improvement in her health. The regular statutory reviews foreseen by the expert opinions prior to the withdrawal of the disability pension suggested only that the applicant’s ailments were susceptible to evolution, whereas the periodic reviews subsequent to that withdrawal had been requested by the applicant, rather than ordered by the authorities, and could therefore not be interpreted as proof of any subsisting legitimate expectation."

The Government further asserted that ex post facto legislation was typical of any social-security system, because of the lengthy and continuing nature of the social-security relationship between an insured person and the State. Applications for such benefits were normally not adjudicated on the basis of the law as in force at the beginning of the insurance relationship but rather under the law as it stood when the request was decided upon. Amendments enacted in the meanwhile to social-security laws might thus inevitably impose an individual burden on the insured. Any ex post facto legislation could only be validly disputed if the new law concerned those already in receipt of a benefit at the time of the entry into force of the retroactive law; however, this was not the case here."

To dispense the applicant from making the necessary contributions would be unfair and discriminatory towards those in a comparable situation who had diligently contributed to the social-security scheme. With regard to the actual aggregate of contributions made by the applicant, the Government submitted that this was a necessary but not a sufficient precondition, which was not capable of substituting for a valid national legal basis."

The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose. However, the rules are not “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 37, Series A no. 98; and Sargsyan v.

Further, no “legitimate expectation” can be said to arise where there is a dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law and the applicant’s submissions are subsequently rejected by the national courts (see Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 50, ECHR 2004-IX).

In applications concerning claims other than those relating to existing possessions, the idea behind this requirement has also been formulated in various other ways throughout the Court’s case-law. By way of example, in a number of cases the Court examined, respectively, whether the applicants had “a claim which was sufficiently established to be enforceable” (see Gratzinger and Gratzingerova, cited above, § 74); whether they demonstrated the existence of “an assertable right under domestic law to a welfare benefit” (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.)

It took the view that “where the proprietary interest is in the nature of a claim it may be regarded as an “asset” only where it has a sufficient basis in national law, for example where there is settled case-law of the domestic courts confirming it” (see Kopecký, cited above, § 52)."

Ireland, 29 November 1991, § 51, Series A no. 222; and Stretch v. the United Kingdom, no. 44277/98, § 35, 24 June 2003). In this line of cases, the “legitimate expectation” was thus based on a reasonably justified reliance on a legal act which had a sound legal basis and which bore on property rights (see Kopecký, cited above, § 47). Respect for such reliance follows from one aspect of the rule of law, which is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention and which implies, inter alia, that there must be a measure of legal protection in domestic law against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see, as a recent authority, Karácsony and Others v.

                "80. In the modern, democratic State, many individuals are, for all or part of their lives, completely dependent for survival on social-security and welfare benefits. Many national legal systems recognise that such individuals require a degree of certainty and security, and provide for benefits to be paid – subject to the fulfilment of the conditions of eligibility – as of right (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 51). The principles which apply generally in cases under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are equally relevant when it comes to social and welfare benefits (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 54). The Court has previously addressed the issue of legitimate expectation in the context of social benefits on a number of occasions (see, for example, Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, § 44, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX, and Klein v. Austria, no. 57028/00, § 45, 3 March 2011."

                "81. In those legal systems where the national legislation requires mandatory contributions of employees to the social-security system, the legislation normally provides that those who have made adequate contributions and satisfied the statutory requirements of disability will receive some form of long-term disability benefit, on grounds of the principles of social solidarity and equivalency, for the period of the disability persisting or until the age of retirement. Such insurance schemes, which are typically mandatory, provide such protection, that is, the availability of benefits, for the entire period of insurance and on every occasion when the conditions of the insurance are satisfied. The relevant legal conditions are however subject to evolution. In this connection, it may be reiterated that in Gaygusuz v. Austria (16 September 1996, § 41, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV) the Court found that the right to emergency assistance – a social benefit linked to the payment of contributions to the unemployment insurance fund – was, in so far as provided for in the applicable legislation, a pecuniary right for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In Klein (cited above, § 43) it was noted that entitlement to a social benefit – in that instance, a pension payable from a lawyers’ pension scheme – was linked to the payment of contributions, and, when such contributions had been made, an award could not be denied to the person concerned. Contributions to a pension fund may thus, in certain circumstances and according to the domestic law, create a property right (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 39; Apostolakis v. Greece, no. 39574/07, §§ 28 and 35, 22 October 2009; Bellet, Huertas and Vialatte v. France (dec.), nos. 40832/98, 40833/98 and 40906/98, 27 April 1999; Skórkiewicz v.

The Court has also held that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 imposes no restriction on the Contracting States’ freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social-security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme (see Sukhanov and Ilchenko v. Ukraine, nos. 68385/10 and 71378/10, §§ 35-39, 26 June 2014; Kolesnyk v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 57116/10, §§ 83, 89 and 91, 3 June 2014; and Fakas v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 4519/11, §§ 34, 37-43, 48, 3 June 2014). If, however, a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a welfare benefit – whether conditional or not on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation must be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 54)."

The payment of contributions to a pension fund may in certain circumstances create a property right in a portion of such a fund and a modification of the pension rights under such a system could therefore in principle raise an issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1; even if it is assumed that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 guarantees to persons who have paid contributions to a special insurance system the right to derive benefit from the system, it cannot be interpreted as entitling that person to a pension of a particular amount (see Müller v.

Poland, no. 38459/03, §§ 78 and 82, 2 October 2012). In another case it considered that the failure to fulfil a condition (namely the requirement of affiliation to a professional association), which under national law was a sufficient reason for forfeiture of a pension claim, did not lead to the conclusion that the applicant had no possession within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Klein, cited above, § 46).

The decision granting her a disability pension in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Act and which formed the basis of her original entitlement could thus be regarded as representing an “existing possession” (see Kopecký, § 35(c)). Further, it seems undeniable that throughout the said period, she could, on the basis of the said “legal act”, entertain a “legitimate expectation” (ibid., § 47) of continuing to receive disability benefits should her disability persist to the requisite degree, there being no dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law (ibid., § 50)."

The change in the law effectively imposed on a certain category of insured persons, including the applicant, a condition whose advent had not been foreseeable during the relevant potential contributory period and which they could not possibly satisfy once the new legislation entered into force – a combination of elements which is ultimately difficult to reconcile with the rule of law. The Court points out at this juncture that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are “practical and effective” rather than theoretical and illusory (see Perdigão v. Portugal [GC], no. 24768/06, § 68, 16 November 2010). To hold that although a person has contributed to an insurance scheme and has satisfied its contributory requirement, he or she could be totally deprived of the legitimate expectation of eventual benefits would sit uncomfortably with this principle."

Co-operating with the authorities at all times, and actively and continuously pursuing her disability claim, she underwent several periodic reassessments of her condition in the years 2011 and 2012; further such assessments were scheduled for November 2012, April and September 2014 and March 2015."

Furthermore, whilst approving the withdrawal of the applicant’s disability pension as of 1 February 2010, the Labour Court expressly confirmed that a new medical assessment could take place in 2012 and drew her attention to the possibility of making a renewed application should her health deteriorate (see paragraph 16 above)."

It was undisputed that this disability level would have qualified the applicant for a disability benefit in February 2012 had it not been for the new retroactive contribution requirement, which was not met by her. In the meantime, on 13 December 2011, she had been recommended for rehabilitation and for the accompanying allowance – a type of benefit closely related to disability pension (see paragraph 17 above) and introduced to take the place of the disability pension for individuals capable of being rehabilitated. However, the authorities did not implement this recommendation. Had they done so, the applicant might have been in receipt of a benefit on 31 December 2011, which would have altered her situation under the new law."

On the contrary, the measures taken by the authorities and the judgment of 1 April 2011 in particular indicate that the authorities acted in full recognition of the applicant’s insured status, and therefore the applicant could have relied in a reasonably justified manner on the applicable legislation and had a legitimate expectation of receiving a disability benefit should the statutory conditions be satisfied.

The Court cannot accept the suggestion made by the applicant that her pension entitlements, based as they were on contributions to the general fund from which all social insurance benefits are paid, should remain unaltered once they had been granted, regardless of any changes in her condition. There is no authority in its case-law for so categorical a statement; in actual fact, the Court has accepted the possibility of reductions in social security entitlements in certain circumstances (see, as a recent authority, Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 45, with further case-law references; see also Hoogendijk v. the Netherlands, (dec.), no. 58641/00, 6 January 2005). In particular, the Court has noted the significance which the passage of time can have for the legal existence and character of social insurance benefits (see, mutatis mutandis, Goudswaard-Van der Lans, cited above). This applies both to amendments to legislation which may be adopted in response to societal changes and evolving views on the categories of persons who need social assistance, and also to the evolution of individual situations.

The Supreme Court found that, despite the fact that it was contained in the Ordinance, the prohibition should be regarded as being of a statutory nature.

The Supreme Court, in a number of decisions given following cassation appeals against judgments of various appellate courts, examined whether the provisions of that Ordinance prohibited the Social Insurance Authority from divesting individuals of disability pensions they had been receiving for longer than ten years. Furthermore, the domestic courts, some of them assuming that such a prohibition existed, were not in agreement as to its nature, namely whether it was substantive or merely procedural. Importantly, it was unclear whether the entry into force of the Act of 13 October 1998 affected the applicability of the Ordinance to the situation of persons who had acquired rights to a disability pension prior to the Act's entry into force on 1 January 1999. It was only in 2005, after the applicant's case had already been decided, that the Supreme Court ultimately adopted a resolution designed to clarify the case-law and resolve the discrepancies which had arisen in the interpretation of whether the right to a disability pension was revocable or not."

However, where an individual has an assertable right under domestic law to a contributory social insurance pension, such a benefit should be regarded as a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, ECHR 2005 ‑ X ).

Poland, no. 38886/05, § 71, 28 April 2009 ). An important consideration in the assessment of such interference under this provision is whether the applicant's right to derive benefits from the social insurance scheme in question has been infringed in a manner resulting in the impairment of the essence of his pension rights (see Domalewski v. Poland (dec.), no. 34610/97, ECHR 1999-V)."

Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Terazzi S.r.l. v. Italy, no. 27265/95, § 85, 17 October 2002, and Elia S.r.l. v. Italy, no. 37710/97, § 77, ECHR 2001-IX). The notion of “public interest” is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws concerning social insurance benefits will commonly involve consideration of economic and social issues. The Court finds it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one and will respect the legislature's judgment as to what is “in the public interest” unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see, mutatis mutandis, The former King of Greece and Others v.

These difficulties were acknowledged by the Supreme Court which ultimately, in 2005, issued a resolution designed to eliminate these divergences. In this respect, however, the Court reiterates that divergences in case-law are an inherent consequence of any judicial system which is based on a network of trial and appeal courts with authority over the area of their territorial jurisdiction, and that the role of a supreme court is precisely to resolve conflicts between decisions of the courts below (see Zielinski and Pradal and Gonzalez and Others v.

The Court's approach to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 should reflect the reality of the way in which welfare provision is currently organised within the member States of the Council of Europe. It is clear that within those States, and within most individual States, there exists a wide range of social security benefits designed to confer entitlements which arise as of right. Benefits are funded in a large variety of ways: some are paid for by contributions to a specific fund; some depend on a claimant's contribution record; many are paid for out of general taxation on the basis of a statutorily defined status. In the modern, democratic State, many individuals are, for all or part of their lives, completely dependent for survival on social security and welfare benefits. Many domestic legal systems recognise that such individuals require a degree of certainty and security, and provide for benefits to be paid – subject to the fulfilment of the conditions of eligibility – as of right (see Stec and Others, cited above)."

The Court observes that the basic level of social insurance benefits in Poland, including disability pensions, is paid from a single fund financed by various compulsory contributions from employees and employers and managed by the Social Insurance Authority. It is based on the principle of solidarity and operates on a pay-as-you-go basis. Individual entitlement to a disability pension has been based, both before 1998 and since, on the statutory provisions specifying the particular conditions which must be met by claimants. The decisions of the Social Insurance Authority must comply with the applicable statutes."

It is in the nature of things that various conditions which initially make it impossible for persons afflicted with them to work can evolve over time, leading to either deterioration or improvement of the person's health. The Court cannot accept the suggestion made by the applicant that her pension entitlements, based as they were on contributions to the general fund from which all social insurance benefits are paid, should remain unaltered once they had been granted, regardless of any changes in her condition. There is no authority in its case-law for so categorical a statement; in actual fact, the Court has accepted the possibility of reductions in social security entitlements in certain circumstances (see, as a recent authority, Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 45, with further case-law references; see also Hoogendijk v. the Netherlands, (dec.), no. 58641/00, 6 January 2005). In particular, the Court has noted the significance which the passage of time can have for the legal existence and character of social insurance benefits (see, mutatis mutandis, Goudswaard-Van der Lans, cited above). This applies both to amendments to legislation which may be adopted in response to societal changes and evolving views on the categories of persons who need social assistance, and also to the evolution of individual situations. The Court considers that it is permissible for States to take measures to reassess the medical condition of persons receiving disability pensions with a view to establishing whether they continue to be unfit to work, provided that such reassessment is in conformity with the law and attended by sufficient procedural guarantees.",

Moreover, it would have been unfair on persons contributing to the Social Insurance system, in particular those denied benefits as they did not meet the relevant requirements.

The reduction or the discontinuance of a pension may therefore constitute an interference with peaceful enjoyment of possessions that needs to be justified (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 40; Rasmussen v. Poland, no. 38886/05, § 71, 28 April 2009; and Wieczorek, cited above, § 57)."

The rule is based on the assumption that the domestic system provides an effective remedy in respect of the alleged breach. The burden of proof is on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time; that is to say, that the remedy was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant’s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Mirazović v.

Both of these Opinions stated, inter alia, that the pension system in Serbia was based on the concept of “ongoing financing”. This meant that since the Serbian authorities have been unable to collect any pension insurance contributions in Kosovo as of 1999, persons who had already been granted SPDIF pensions in Kosovo also could not continue receiving them. The Court therefore considers that no administrative remedy within the competence of the SPDIF at various levels, be it an appeal or a request for the re-opening of proceedings, or, indeed, any other remedy addressed to the said ministries, could be deemed effective in the specific circumstances of the present case.

They did so by adopting Opinions to this effect (see paragraph 29 above). Serbia, however, never adopted legislation aimed at discriminating against any particular ethnic group. The Government further provided the Court with an indicative list of 32 persons of non-Serbian ethnic origin who continued receiving the SPDIF pension in question.

It is strange that they waited for almost four years following the suspension to do so. The applicants also never sought any other social assistance until the resolution of their case. The Government provided a copy of the certificate issued by the Novi Pazar Social Care Centre to this effect. There were likewise serious abuse issues concerning the submission of false information as regards the residence of numerous pensioners, particularly those claiming to be residents of Novi Pazar.

Latvia [GC], no. 55707/00, § 77, 18 February 2009, and, more recently, Stummer v. Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, § 82, 7 July 2011). Thus, that provision does not guarantee the right to acquire property (see, among other authorities, Van der Mussele v. Belgium, 23 November 1983, § 48, Series A no. 70; Slivenko v. Latvia (dec.)

Nor does it guarantee, as such, any right to a pension of a particular amount (see, among other authorities, Müller v. Austria, no. 5849/72, Commission’s report of 1 October 1975, Decisions and Reports (DR) 3, p. 25; T. v. Sweden, no. 10671/83, Commission decision of 4 March 1985, DR 42, p. 229; Janković v.

However, where a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a pension – whether or not conditional on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation has to be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 64, ECHR 2010 ‑ ...). The reduction or the discontinuance of a pension may therefore constitute an interference with peaceful enjoyment of possessions that needs to be justified (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 40; Rasmussen v. Poland, no. 38886/05, § 71, 28 April 2009; and Wieczorek, cited above, § 57)."

The first and most important requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful (see The Former King of Greece and Others v.

According to the Court’s case ‑ law, the national authorities, because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the Convention system, it is thus for those authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. Moreover, the notion of “public interest” is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws concerning pensions or welfare benefits involves consideration of various economic and social issues. The Court accepts that in the area of social legislation including in the area of pensions States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation, which in the interests of social justice and economic well-being may legitimately lead them to adjust, cap or even reduce the amount of pensions normally payable to the qualifying population. However, any such measures must be implemented in a non-discriminatory manner and comply with the requirements of proportionality. Therefore, the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in the choice of policies should be a wide one, and its judgment as to what is “in the public interest” should be respected unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see, for example, Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], cited above, § 61; Andrejeva v.

Of course, the issue of whether a fair balance has indeed been struck becomes relevant only if and when it has been established that the interference in question has satisfied the aforementioned requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary (see Iatridis v.

According to these Opinions, for which there is no evidence that they have ever been published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, since the Serbian authorities have been unable to collect any pension insurance contributions in Kosovo as of 1999, persons who had already been granted SPDIF pensions in Kosovo also could not expect, for the time being, to continue receiving them.

France [GC], no. 11810/03, § 81, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX; Draon v. France [GC], no. 1513/03, § 73, 6 October 2005; and Kuznetsova v. Russia, no. 67579/01, § 50, 7 June 2007). It finds no reason to deem otherwise in the present case. It further accepts that the enactment of Law no. 296/2006 pursued the public interest (such as providing a harmonised pension calculation, aiming at a balanced and sustainable welfare system).",
                "In considering whether the interference imposed an excessive individual burden on the first applicant, the Court has regard to the particular context in which the issue arises in the present case, namely that of a social security scheme. Such schemes are an expression of a society ’ s solidarity with its vulnerable members (see, mutatis mutandis, Goudswaard-Van der Lans v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 75255/01, ECHR 2005-XI).",
                "The Court notes that Law no. 296/2006 provided that the pensionable remuneration relative to the working period abroad was to be calculated by multiplying the amount of contributions transferred by a hundred and dividing the result by the contribution rates for the invalidity, old-age and survivors ’ insurance scheme, as applicable during the relevant contributory period. As a consequence, according to the first applicant, between the years 1996 when he started receiving his pension and 2009, he received a monthly pension of EUR 873 as opposed to EUR 1,372 which he would have obtained had his proceedings not been interfered with and had he been successful, and for the year 2010 he received a pension of EUR 1,178 instead of EUR 1,900. On the basis of these calculations the Court observes that the first applicant lost considerably less than half of his pension. Thus, the Court considers that the applicant was obliged to endure a reasonable and commensurate reduction, rather than the total deprivation of his entitlements (see, conversely, Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above § 45).",
                "In consequence, the applicant ’ s right to derive benefits from the social insurance scheme in question has not been infringed in a manner resulting in the impairment of the essence of his pension rights. In this respect the Court notes that the applicant had in fact paid lower contributions in Switzerland than he would have paid in Italy, and thus he had had the opportunity to enjoy more substantial earnings at the time. Moreover, this reduction only had the effect of equalizing a state of affairs and avoiding unjustified advantages (resulting from the decision to retire in Italy) for the applicant and other persons in his position. Against this background, bearing in mind the State ’ s wide margin of appreciation in regulating the pension system and the fact that the applicant only lost a partial amount of pension, the Court considers that the applicant was not made to bear an individual and excessive burden.",
                "It follows that, even assuming the provision was applicable, there has not been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.”"
            ],
            [
                "59. The Court observes that the deprivation of the entirety of a pension is likely to breach the said provision (see, for example, Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, and Apostolakis v. Greece, no. 39574/07, 22 October 2009 ) and that, conversely, minimal reductions to a pension or related benefits are likely not to do so (see, for example, among many other authorities, Valkov and Others, cited above; Arras and Others v. Italy, no. 17972/07, 14 February 2012; Poulain v. France (dec.), no. 52273/08, 8 February 2011; Lenz v. Germany (dec.), no. 40862/98, ECHR 2001 ‑ X; and Janković, cited above). However, the fair balance test cannot be based solely on the amount or percentage of the reduction suffered, in the abstract. In all of these cases, and other similar ones, the Court endeavours to assess all the relevant elements of the case against a specific background (see, as other examples, amongst others, Kuna v. Germany (dec.), no. 52449/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ V (extracts) concerning the reduction of the applicant ’ s pension rights under an additional pension scheme, and Da Conceiçao Mateus and Santos Januario v. Portugal (dec.), nos. 62235/12 and 57725/12 concerning the impact of the reduction of some subsidies on the applicants ’ financial situation and living conditions). In proceeding in this way the Court has found that even reductions of 65%, as substantial as that may be, did not in the specific circumstances of the case upset the said fair balance in the very exceptional context of a punishment of a convicted and dismissed policeman (see Banfield v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 6223/04, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI concerning the forfeiture of part of the applicant ’ s pension after his dismissal from the police force after a conviction )."

A change in method of calculating pensions from the contributory one to the remuneration-based one (“ retributivo ”) was not to the detriment of the financial sustainability of the system. Thus, the changes brought about by the impugned Law sought to bring the relationship between pensionable remuneration and contributions into line with the system in force in Italy during the same period of time. The Law provided that remuneration received abroad (used as a basis for pension calculations) was to be adjusted by applying the same percentage ratios used for pension contributions paid in Italy during the same period. Thus, the norm made explicit what had been in the original interpretative provisions. Consequently, there had been no breach of the principle of legal certainty. Nor was the norm discriminatory since the acquired and more favourable rights of earlier pensioners were, by then, unassailable. Furthermore, the Law did not discriminate against people who had worked abroad, because it simply ensured an overall balance in the welfare system, and avoided a situation where people who had contributed relatively little to a foreign pension scheme were entitled to the same pension as those who had paid the much higher Italian contributions. The contested Law did not provide for any ex post facto reductions, as it merely imposed an interpretation which could already have been inferred from the original provisions. Lastly, this system still allowed for a sufficient and satisfactory pension, adequate for the lifestyle of a worker.

While it was in principle bound by the Maggio judgment ( the principles on which it was based being also constitutionally recognised principles ), the Constitutional Court had to lend itself to a balancing exercise. It considered that other, opposing interests which were also constitutionally protected and which related to the matter in issue prevailed in the circumstances of the case. It followed that there existed compelling general interest reasons justifying a retroactive application of the law. Indeed the effects of the new law were such as to avoid a welfare system which privileged some and was disadvantageous to others, guaranteeing respect for the principles of equality and solidarity, which because of their founding nature, occupied a privileged position when weighed against other constitutional rights. The impugned law was inspired by the principles of equality and proportionality and took into account the fact that contributions paid in Switzerland were four times lower than those paid in Italy. It thus applied a direct recalculation which allowed pensions to be dispensed in proportion to the contributions paid, thus levelling out any inequalities and rendering the welfare system more sustainable for the benefit of all its users. Even the ECHR had upheld this reasoning in the Maggio case in relation to the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, although it did not find it to be sufficient to avoid a violation of Article 6. However, unlike the Court, which is bound to examine complaints separately, the Constitutional Court had to take a global approach and evaluate a case on the basis of all the relevant constitutional guarantees. The claim of unconstitutionality was therefore unfounded. Indeed to conclude otherwise would not only have consequences on the pension system but would also go against the spirit of the Court ’ s judgment in Maggio, which rejected the applicant ’ s claims for a pension based on the previous calculation method.",

While three parameters for calculating pensions existed, none referred to the ratio of contributions paid at the relevant time. Moreover, even the general principles of law provided that the calculations had to be based on the laws of the recipient insurance scheme and on the same criteria as if the applicant had always been registered with the INPS ( that is, on the basis of the salaries received)."

The norm was retroactive, excluding people whose proceedings had come to an end, but not those whose proceedings were still pending; and it had not been based on any compelling general interest reasons.

That law changed the pension calculation method from a contributory one to a remuneration-based one ( metodo retributivo ). It thus posed a serious problem of coherence in relation to the evaluation of periods worked in Switzerland, in so far as Swiss salaries were subject to a contribution of 8%, compared with 32% for Italian salaries. It followed that the pensions of Italian people who had worked in Switzerland were overvalued vis- à - vis both other Italian workers who had paid contributions only in Italy and also Swiss workers who had paid lower contributions but who also received smaller pensions. That is why the Government enacted Law no. 296/2006, which provided that if contributions paid abroad were transferred to the Italian system in accordance with international agreements regarding social security, the remuneration of people having worked abroad, for the period during which they worked abroad, was to be determined by multiplying their paid - up contributions by one hundred and dividing that sum by the contribution rate applicable in Italy in the relevant period.

The reason behind the enactment of the law, namely to ensure that the method of calculation used by the INPS ( and confirmed by the minority case-law ) became the prevalent interpretation of the relevant laws, was serious and reasonable because it provided for the same value to be given to periods of work whether they were served in Italy or abroad.

The Court cannot imagine in what way the aim of reinforcing a subjective and partial interpretation, favourable to a State ’ s entity as party to the proceedings, could amount to justification for legislative interference while those proceedings were pending, particularly when such an interpretation had been found to be fallacious on a majority of occasions by the domestic courts, including the Court of Cassation.",

In the present case there had been no major flaws in the legal framework of 1962, and, as acknowledged by the Government, the need for a legislative intervention only arose as a result of the State ’ s decision, in 19 82, to reform the pension system. At that stage the State itself created a disparity which it tried to amend only twenty- four years later ( and thirty- eight years after the enactment of the original legal provisions ). Indeed it does not appear that there had been any timely attempts at adjusting the system earlier, despite the fact that numerous pensioners who had worked in Switzerland were repeatedly winning their claims before the domestic courts. In this connection the Court notes that before the enactment of Law no. 296/2006 the domestic courts had repeatedly found in favour of people in the applicants ’ position, and that interpretation of the relevant legal provisions ( as confirmed by the Court of Cassation ’ s judgment of 6 March 2004 ) had become the majority case-law. It follows that, given also that in the decades during which the application of the calculation concerned had been challenged in the domestic courts there had been a majority interpretation in favour of the claimants ( save some first-instance decisions), in the present case, unlike in the above - mentioned cases, a legislative interference ( shifting the balance in favour of one of the parties ) was not foreseeable."

Indeed, even accepting that the State was attempting to adjust a situation it had not originally intended to create, it could have done so perfectly well without resorting to a retrospective application of the law. Furthermore, the fact that the State waited twenty- four years before making such an adjustment, despite the fact that numerous pensioners who had worked in Switzerland were repeatedly winning their claims before the domestic courts, also creates doubts as to whether that really was the legislator ’ s intention in 1982."

                "The Court notes that Law no. 296/2006 provided that the pensionable remuneration relative to the working period abroad was to be calculated by multiplying the amount of contributions transferred by a hundred and dividing the result by the contribution rates for the invalidity, old-age and survivors ’ insurance scheme, as applicable during the relevant contributory period. As a consequence, according to the first applicant, between the years 1996 when he started receiving his pension and 2009, he received a monthly pension of EUR 873 as opposed to EUR 1,372 which he would have obtained had his proceedings not been interfered with and had he been successful, and for the year 2010 he received a pension of EUR 1,178 instead of EUR 1,900. On the basis of these calculations the Court observes that the first applicant lost considerably less than half of his pension. Thus, the Court considers that the applicant was obliged to endure a reasonable and commensurate reduction, rather than the total deprivation of his entitlements (see, conversely, Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above § 45).",
                "In consequence, the applicant ’ s right to derive benefits from the social insurance scheme in question has not been infringed in a manner resulting in the impairment of the essence of his pension rights. In this respect the Court notes that the applicant had in fact paid lower contributions in Switzerland than he would have paid in Italy, and thus he had had the opportunity to enjoy more substantial earnings at the time. Moreover, this reduction only had the effect of equalizing a state of affairs and avoiding unjustified advantages (resulting from the decision to retire in Italy) for the applicant and other persons in his position. Against this background, bearing in mind the State ’ s wide margin of appreciation in regulating the pension system and the fact that the applicant only lost a partial amount of pension, the Court considers that the applicant was not made to bear an individual and excessive burden.",

However, the Court notes that unlike in the case of Mr Maggio, the applicants in the present case claim that they have lost more than half of what they would have received in pension. Indeed, the figures submitted by the applicants, which have not been contested by the Government and must therefore be taken to be correct, indicate that the applicants in the present case have suffered the loss of around two-thirds (about 67%) of their respective pensions."

                "58. The Court observes that in Maggio and Others, cited above, the fact that the applicant had lost considerably less than half of his pension, which therefore amounted to a reasonable and commensurate reduction, undeniably carried some weight in the finding that the provision had not been breached. Given the more substantial reduction in the present case and in view of the total contribution of the applicants, the Court must reassess the matter and scrutinise the reduction more closely in the context of the case."
            ],
            [
                "59. The Court observes that the deprivation of the entirety of a pension is likely to breach the said provision (see, for example, Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, and Apostolakis v. Greece, no. 39574/07, 22 October 2009 ) and that, conversely, minimal reductions to a pension or related benefits are likely not to do so (see, for example, among many other authorities, Valkov and Others, cited above; Arras and Others v. Italy, no. 17972/07, 14 February 2012; Poulain v. France (dec.), no. 52273/08, 8 February 2011; Lenz v. Germany (dec.), no. 40862/98, ECHR 2001 ‑ X; and Janković, cited above). However, the fair balance test cannot be based solely on the amount or percentage of the reduction suffered, in the abstract. In all of these cases, and other similar ones, the Court endeavours to assess all the relevant elements of the case against a specific background (see, as other examples, amongst others, Kuna v. Germany (dec.), no. 52449/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ V (extracts) concerning the reduction of the applicant ’ s pension rights under an additional pension scheme, and Da Conceiçao Mateus and Santos Januario v. Portugal (dec.), nos. 62235/12 and 57725/12 concerning the impact of the reduction of some subsidies on the applicants ’ financial situation and living conditions). In proceeding in this way the Court has found that even reductions of 65%, as substantial as that may be, did not in the specific circumstances of the case upset the said fair balance in the very exceptional context of a punishment of a convicted and dismissed policeman (see Banfield v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 6223/04, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI concerning the forfeiture of part of the applicant ’ s pension after his dismissal from the police force after a conviction )."

Turning to the present case and its specific circumstances, the Court considers that a reduction of two-thirds of one ’ s pension (and not solely of a benefit linked to pensions) is indisputably, in itself, a sizeable decrease which must seriously affect a person ’ s standard of living. However, their contribution in absolute terms must also be taken into consideration. This loss must be examined in the light of all the relevant factors."

            [
                "61. Of particular importance are the two factors already considered in Maggio and Others (cited above). Primarily, that the applicants paid on the one hand lower contributions, in terms of percentage, in Switzerland than they would have paid in Italy – but on the other hand had to pay, in absolute terms, contributions of a considerable amount during long contributory periods of their entire active life in Switzerland. Secondly, that the reduction was aimed at, but did not have the effect of, equalising a state of affairs and avoiding unjustified advantages (resulting from the decision to retire in Italy) for people in the applicants ’ position (see above paragraphs 42-43)."

However, the Court notes that, according to statistical data collected by the INPS for the year 2010 [2], in Italy, the average old - age pension for that year was EUR 15,015 that is EUR 1,251 monthly. From the information publicly available it also appears that the minimum pension for that year amounted to EUR 5,993, that is, EUR 461 per month. The Court further notes that according to the European Committee of Social Rights, the amount of minimum pension ( pensione minima ) in 2011 stood at EUR 6, 246.89 ( EUR 520 per month). The said Committee observed that that level of minimum pension fell below 40% of the median equivalised income (Eurostat) and thus it considered it to be inadequate (see paragraph 27 above)."

                "63. The Court observes that, in the present case, as transpires from the annexed table, the applicants receive in old-age pension monthly sums varying between EUR 714 (the lowest being Mr Rodelli) and EUR 1,820 (the highest being Mr Andreola) ( see annexed table for details about each applicant ). Indeed, save for Mr Rodelli, all the applicants receive less than the average monthly pension in Italy, and six out of eight applicants receive less than EUR 1,000 per month. The difference in sums received between the applicants reflects their job category as well as the different periods of time they spent in Switzerland and in consequence the actual contributions they paid. In that connection, the Court highlights that the present case concerns contributory benefits, and while it is true that the Court no longer makes a distinction between contributory and non-contributory benefits for the purposes of the applicability of the provision (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 53, ECHR 2005 ‑ X ), when assessing a reduction of social security payments, it is indeed of significance that such pensions were based on actual contributions paid by the applicants (transferred to the relevant disbursing authority), albeit lower than those paid by others, and that therefore they were not a gratuitous welfare aid solely funded by the tax-payer in general."

                "64. Moreover, the Court observes that the Government gave no information as to the quality of life one could expect to have on the basis of the sums received in pension by the applicants. In that light the Court cannot but find guidance in the conclusions of the European Committee of Social Rights and it therefore considers that if the sum of EUR 461 is inadequate as a minimum pension, the majority of the sums at issue, which do not exceed EUR 1,000 a month, must be considered as providing for only basic commodities. Thus, the reductions have undoubtedly affected the applicants ’ way of life and hindered its enjoyment substantially. The same can also be said of the higher pensions, despite them allowing for more comfortable living."
            ],
            [
                "65. Furthermore, in the present case the Court cannot lose sight of the fact that the applicants made a conscious decision to move back to Italy at a time when they had a legitimate expectation of receiving higher pensions, and therefore a more comfortable standard of living. However, as a result of the calculation being applied by the INPS and eventually the impugned legislative action, they not only found themselves in a more difficult financial situation but they further had to institute proceedings to recover what they deemed was due - proceedings which were frustrated by the Government ’ s actions in breach of the Convention. Through those actions, the Italian legislature deprived arbitrarily the applicants of their claims to the amount of pension which they could legitimately expect to be determined in accordance with the decided case-law of the highest courts of the land (see above paragraph 42), an element which cannot be ignored for the purpose of determining the proportionality of the impugned measure (see Maurice v. France, Draon v. France; and Kuznetsova v. Russia, all cited above, §§ 90 -91, §§ 82-83 and § 51, respectively ). Contrary to the case-law of the Italian Constitutional Court, there existed no compelling general interest reasons justifying a retrospective application of the Law no. 296/2006, which was not an authentic interpretation of the original law and was therefore unforeseeable (compare and contrast paragraphs 26 and 42 )."

The Court finds no reasons to hold otherwise in relation to people who moved to Switzerland. Furthermore, in the Maggio judgment (§ 73), the Court also held that the impugned cut-off date arising out of Law no. 296/2006 was reasonably and objectively justified given that Law no. 296/2006 was intended to level out any favourable treatment arising from the previous interpretation of the provisions in force, which had given people in the applicants ’ position an unjustified advantage, bearing in mind the needs of the social security system in Italy."

It is true that the applicant must have been aware of the system as a whole when he started his profession as a lawyer, but that argument should not be overstated. In view of the compulsory nature of the affiliation to the Chamber of Lawyers pension scheme and the compulsory contributions thereto, it was clearly intended to give to lawyers reaching the retirement age a pension which largely corresponded to the cover provided under the social security scheme. In this respect the Court considers that an old age pension scheme can hardly be compared to a damage insurance contract, as the Government suggest, because the latter is designed for providing financial compensation for damage caused by an event, such as fire, flood or accident, which is not sure to occur, whereas the former is clearly intended to provide for means of subsistence in the future during a period of life in which the capacity to earn will diminish partly or fully. One cannot, therefore, expect a lawyer to subscribe to a further pension scheme under the social security system to protect himself against the complete loss of his or her pension just in case he or she looses the right to exercise the profession. This must be considered a quite exceptional risk. It also transpires from the facts which were stated after the applicant had gone bankrupt, that the Chamber of Lawyers had had considerable difficulty dealing with a situation which also seemed unusual to them. Moreover, the subsequent amendment to the lawyers'pension scheme in 2003, which abolished the condition that a lawyer must be inscribed in the List of Lawyers at the time of reaching the retirement age in order to be granted an old-age pension, and making the payments of that pension dependent on a minimum time of contribution (see paragraph 25 above) shows that that situation was no longer considered appropriate."

According to these principles, only someone who is inscribed in the List of Lawyers of a regional Chamber of Lawyers at the time that he or she reaches the retirement age is entitled to an old- age pension; he or she must have been inscribed on the List for a period of ten or fifteen years before reaching the retirement age; the retirement age is fixed at sixty-eight years and upon reaching that age, a lawyer must renounce his or her right to exercise the profession.

The comparison with a damage insurance scheme was therefore improper and misleading because arriving at the retirement age could not be considered an incident causing damage. It was a typical feature of a pension scheme that the obligation to provide benefits to the insured person arrived when the period of contribution ended. It was not realistic to require an insured person to take out another insurance policy just in case, in the future, he or she looses the right to practice the profession. But, even if this was the case, this was no justification to forfeit pension contributions made over a considerable period. The applicant also pointed to the recent amendment to the rules on old- age or survivor pensions of lawyers, according to which being inscribed on the List of Lawyers was no longer a condition for granting a pension to the interested person. If these rules had been in force at the time of the events, the applicant would have been entitled to an old- age pension."

In the present case, the applicant was clearly excluded from the pension scheme. The lawyers'old- age pension scheme did not correspond to the “conventional” model of a social insurance scheme in Austria, but was a system of benefits sui generis. Besides having elements of a social insurance scheme, it also contained elements of a contractual and, in particular, a damage insurance scheme. This was evident from the fact that, under the lawyers'old- age pension scheme, in order for the person concerned to be granted an old-age pension, he or she must have been registered on the List of Lawyers at the time that the pension was due to be applied. This corresponded to the requirement under a damage insurance scheme of a valid contractual relationship at the time that the damage occurred.

It is true that the applicant must have been aware of the system as a whole when he started his profession as a lawyer, but that argument should not be overstated. In view of the compulsory nature of the affiliation to the Chamber of Lawyers pension scheme and the compulsory contributions thereto, it was clearly intended to give to lawyers reaching the retirement age a pension which largely corresponded to the cover provided under the social security scheme. In this respect the Court considers that an old age pension scheme can hardly be compared to a damage insurance contract, as the Government suggest, because the latter is designed for providing financial compensation for damage caused by an event, such as fire, flood or accident, which is not sure to occur, whereas the former is clearly intended to provide for means of subsistence in the future during a period of life in which the capacity to earn will diminish partly or fully. One cannot, therefore, expect a lawyer to subscribe to a further pension scheme under the social security system to protect himself against the complete loss of his or her pension just in case he or she looses the right to exercise the profession. This must be considered a quite exceptional risk. It also transpires from the facts which were stated after the applicant had gone bankrupt, that the Chamber of Lawyers had had considerable difficulty dealing with a situation which also seemed unusual to them. Moreover, the subsequent amendment to the lawyers'pension scheme in 2003, which abolished the condition that a lawyer must be inscribed in the List of Lawyers at the time of reaching the retirement age in order to be granted an old-age pension, and making the payments of that pension dependent on a minimum time of contribution (see paragraph 25 above) shows that that situation was no longer considered appropriate."

Her savings were the result of decades of hard work, and she had intended to buy a flat with the money. However, the State had not revalued the amounts on deposit to offset the effects of inflation, as it had been required to do by the Law on revaluation and protection of the savings of citizens of the Russian Federation enacted on 10 May 1995 ( Федеральный закон «О восстановлении и защите сбережений граждан Российской Федерации» – “the Savings Act”).",

The court rejected the defendants'main argument that the reimbursement scheme under the Savings Act could not be implemented in practice since no special secondary legislation had been passed. Noting that the Savings Act recognised the guaranteed deposits as the State's internal debt and that the State had not introduced the necessary rules in time to enable the debt to be repaid, the court held that the defendants were liable under the civil law."

It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see Hornsby v.

These include an obligation to nullify all the illegal consequences of a violation of Community law either directly or, in default, by providing effective reparation for the resulting damage. It follows that the fact that a taxpayer which alleges that it has been taxed on the basis of a statutory provision that is incompatible with the objectives of a Community directive has first referred the issue of taxation to the tax court, which refused to accept that such incompatibility could serve as a cause of action, cannot by itself render inadmissible a claim made by the taxpayer on the basis of the obligations arising under the aforementioned Treaty for reparation for the damage it has sustained as a result of a failure to transpose the objectives of the directive into domestic law.",

Although the Ninth Directive of 26 June 1978, which was notified to the French State on 30 June 1978, granted France an extension of time – until 1 January 1979 – in which to transpose the provisions of the Sixth Directive, it is construed by the Court of Justice of the European Economic Communities as having no retroactive effect. Thus, the provisions of Article 256 of the General Tax Code as worded prior to 1 January 1979 requiring payment of value-added tax on insurance broking activities of the type carried on by the Jacques Dangeville company were for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978 incompatible with the objectives set by the Sixth Directive. Accordingly, contrary to the Administrative Court 's decision, the applicant company's claim that the State is liable for the situation that has thus arisen and should be ordered to make good the loss it has sustained as a result of the illegal situation brought about by its being required to pay value-added tax for the above-mentioned period is well-founded.",

Thus, the damage for which the company is entitled to claim reparation is equal to the amount of the value-added tax it paid for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978 and comes to FRF 129,845.86.”"

Jacques Dangeville which the Administrative Court of Appeal examined in the impugned judgment was for payment of 'compensation' in an amount equal to the amount of value-added tax that had thus been paid, by way of reparation for the 'damage' which that tax liability had caused the company to sustain, on the ground that that damage was attributable to the French State's delay in transposing the objectives of the Directive into domestic law. It follows that, as submitted by the Minister of the Budget, the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the fact that the company '[had] first referred the issue of taxation to the tax court' did not render inadmissible a claim for reparation in which the only alleged damage was the damage resulting from the payment of the tax.

Thus, before 30 June 1978 it was unable to afford the French authorities a defence for their failure to enact provisions complying with the objectives of the Sixth Directive on time.",

Accordingly, it is to that extent necessary to rule that those provisions of Articles 256 and 261-4-1 o were inapplicable for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978. It follows that the submission by the S.A. Revert et Badelon firm, which carries on an activity as insurance brokers, that there was no basis in law for the demand for it to pay value-added tax on its business dealings during the period from 1 April to 30 June 1978 is well-founded.",

Subsequently, the applicant company was rightly charged value-added tax for the period from 1 July to 31 December 1978 on the basis of the provisions of Articles 256 and 261-4-1 o of the General Tax Code that remained applicable.",

The Court has thus acknowledged, in the interests of legal certainty which protects both the taxpayer and the authority concerned, that the setting of reasonable limitation periods for bringing proceedings is compatible with Community law. Such periods cannot be regarded as rendering virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Community law, even if the expiry of those periods necessarily entails the dismissal, in whole or in part, of the action brought (see, in particular, Case 33/76 Rewe v.

Article 56 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community dated 25 March 1957, which does not contain any provision empowering bodies of the European Communities to make regulations on public-policy grounds that are directly applicable in the member States, provides that the coordination of provisions laid down by law or regulation 'providing for special treatment for foreign nationals on grounds of public policy, public security or public health' shall be assured by directives issued by the Council on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the Assembly. It is clear from Article 189 of the Treaty of 25 March 1957 that while such directives are binding upon each member State 'as to the result to be achieved' and while in order to achieve the prescribed results the national authorities are required to adapt the legislation and regulations of the member States to comply with the directives addressed to them, it is solely for those authorities to determine the form implementation of the directives will take and to decide, subject to supervision by the domestic courts, how to give effect to the directives in domestic law. Thus, regardless of any instructions they may contain for the member States, directives cannot be pleaded in aid of appeals by nationals of those States against individual administrative acts. It follows that Mr Cohn- Bendit's submission to the Paris Administrative Court in support of his application for an order quashing the Minister of the Interior's decision of 2 February 1976, on the ground that it contravened the provisions of the Directive issued on 25 February 1964 by the Council of the European Communities with a view to coordinating, in accordance with the conditions laid down by Article 56 of the Treaty of Rome, the special measures taken to control the movement and residence of aliens on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, is unfounded. Accordingly, in the absence of any contention that the regulatory measures taken by the French Government in order to comply with the directives issued by the Council of the European Communities are unlawful, the decision to be taken on Mr Cohn- Bendit's appeal cannot under any circumstances turn upon the interpretation of the Directive of 25 February 1964. It follows, without there being any need to examine the grounds of the appeal, that the Minister of the Interior's submission is well-founded, namely the Paris Administrative Court erred in its impugned judgment of 21 December 1977 in referring to the Court of Justice of the European Communities the issues concerning the interpretation of that Directive and staying the proceedings pending the Court of Justice's decision ...”"

Article 5-1 of the Directive of the Council of the European Communities dated 19 December 1972, which was issued with a view to implementing those provisions with regard to manufactured tobacco and the provisions of Article 30 of the Treaty, which prohibits quantitative restrictions and all measures having equivalent effect, provides: 'Manufacturers and importers shall be free to determine the maximum retail selling price for each of their products. This provision may not, however, hinder implementation of the national systems of legislation regarding the control of price levels or the observance of imposed prices.' As the Court of Justice of the European Communities ruled in finding infringements in its judgments of 21 June 1983 and 13 July 1988, the only provisions whose application is reserved by Article 5-1 of the Directive are provisions of national legislation of a general nature that are intended to curb increases in prices. The aforementioned provisions of section 6 of the Law of 24 May 1976 confer on the government a special power to fix the price of tobacco imported from member States of the European Community, independently of the application of the national legislation regarding the control of price levels. They thus enable the government to fix the sale price of imported tobacco in conditions that were not contemplated by Article 5-1 of the Directive of 19 December 1972 and are incompatible with the objectives set out in that Directive. It follows from this that Article 10 of the decree of 31 December 1976 referred to above, which was issued on the basis of section 6 of the Law of 24 May 1976, which must be regarded as inapplicable, is itself devoid of statutory basis.

Consequently, French courts will refuse to apply French law if it is contrary to European law. In other words, they carry out a form of verification of the compatibility of the statute with Community law that is very similar to a review of constitutionality. Basically, the reasoning of the Court of Cassation extends the principle established by Article 55 of the Constitution that international treaties take precedence over statutes. The Court of Cassation relies on two series of arguments: firstly, implicit in the initial treaties is a move towards abandonment of sovereignty by the States and the creation of genuine supra-sovereignty in favour of the Community bodies. Secondly, since the national courts are responsible for applying the provisions emanating from that supra-sovereignty directly, they cannot give precedence to domestic law as, in this system, it is necessarily infra-sovereign (Court of Cassation, Société des cafés Jacques Vabre, 24 May 1975 ...).",

It has shown itself to be 'essentially a national jurisdiction, which is persuaded of the excellence of the national system and has resolved to act as the guardian of national legality' (C.-A.

Firstly, it has proscribed all verification of the compatibility of legislation with Community law: according to a Government Commissioner, the administrative courts 'may not criticise or disregard a statute, even on the ground that it violates international law or, more particularly, Community law'. Secondly, on a more specific point, the Conseil d'Etat has chosen not to follow the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities that has blurred the distinction between regulations and directives... The Conseil d'Etat affirms, on the contrary, [that] 'regardless of any instructions they may contain' [directives] cannot be pleaded in aid of an application for review of an individual act. Directives do, however, impose an obligation on the national authorities to adapt their legislation and regulations so as to comply with the directive (see Cohn- Bendit, cited above). Consequently, nationals of member States may challenge the validity of domestic regulatory measures by reference to the Community directives which they purport to implement or which they disregard.”",

It also had a legitimate expectation of recovering its debt. From 1 January to 30 June 1978 the French value-added tax (VAT) legislation had contravened Community law as set out in Article 13-B-a of the Sixth Directive of 17 May 1977. The applicant company pointed out that the administrative circular of 2 January 1986 had been issued before the Conseil d'Etat 's judgment of 19 March 1986 dismissing its appeal.

In addition, the administrative courts did accept jurisdiction to verify the compatibility of international and French norms, as the new precedent laid down in 1996 in S.A. Revert et Badelon did no more than to apply a line of authorities that dated back to 1989 to tax proceedings ( Conseil d'Etat, 20 October 1989, Nicolo, Recueil 190). The Conseil d'Etat had in several earlier decisions held that the State's responsibility was engaged in the event of a violation of Community law, in particular, if it was at fault for allowing an illegal situation to develop through the incompatibility of a domestic measure with a community directive (Judicial Assembly of the Conseil d'Etat, 28 February 1992, Arizona Tobacco Products and S.A. Philip Morris France ). It followed that the judgment of the Administrative Court of Appeal was not an isolated authority and, indeed, it was only overturned by the Conseil d'Etat on procedural grounds based on the “classification of proceedings” rule ( principe de la distinction des contentieux ).",

                "Lastly, since the implementation of the administrative circular of 1986 had created a difference in treatment between taxpayers of the same category, it afforded at minimum a basis on which the applicant company could lay claim to its debt by a second application for compensation (see National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII).

There were two primary reasons why the applicant company's new appeal could not succeed. Firstly, its action had been brought on the basis that the tax authorities had been at fault in imposing the tax, whereas the existence of any such fault was necessarily excluded by the Conseil d'Etat 's ruling in its judgment on the first appeal that the tax in issue had been lawfully levied. As regards the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal's judgment of 1 July 1992 allowing the applicant company's appeal, the Government argued that it was not in line with the case-law at the time the second appeal was lodged. Secondly, the Government referred to the “classification of remedies” rule ( règle de la distinction des voies de recours ), which, as the Conseil d'Etat had held in its judgment of 30 October 1996, precluded the applicant company from successfully bringing an action in tort after failing in its tax appeal."

Further, the Court reiterates that the fact that the Conseil d'Etat relied on a long-standing principle cannot by itself justify a failure to comply with the present requirements of European law (see, mutatis mutandis, Delcourt v.

It is true that an interference with the exercise of claims against the State may constitute such a deprivation of possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others cited above, p. 22, § 34). However, as regards the payment of a tax, a more natural approach might be to examine the complaints from the angle of a control of the use of property in the general interest “to secure the payment of taxes”, which falls within the rule in the second paragraph of Article 1 (see Building Societies, cited above, p. 2353, § 79).",

The applicant company rejected the Government's submission that the requirement of lawfulness had been complied with, contending that it was contrary to that requirement to allow the “classification of proceedings” rule to prevail over the rule that Community directives enjoyed primacy. It submitted in particular that the “classification of proceedings” rule and the estoppel by record relied on by the Government were only relative in scope, as had being confirmed by recent decisions of the Conseil d'Etat and the CJEC. It should therefore have been allowed to assert the rights it held by virtue of a Community directive. Since it had been prevented from obtaining satisfaction from the tax courts when the first judgment was delivered in 1986, it had been obliged to issue a second set of proceedings for compensation in order to obtain satisfaction."

The Government argued that even assuming, purely for the sake of argument, that the applicant company had been deprived of a legitimate expectation by the decisions of the domestic courts, those decisions complied with the lawfulness requirement and constituted a proportionate measure taken in the public interest. As regards compliance with the lawfulness requirement, the Government said in particular that the claim had been dismissed on the basis of established jurisprudential principles applicable to both private and public law. In ruling that the applicant company's claim was estopped per rem judicatam as a result of its first judgment of 1986, the Conseil d'Etat had applied the “classification of remedies” rule, which prevented a party from bringing an action under the general law of tort for a remedy it had been refused under a special procedure. The justification for the rule lay in the need to ensure compliance with special rules applicable to contentious proceedings, or at least to prevent their being circumvented in a way that rendered them meaningless. Without such a rule, there was a risk of identical situations been treated differently and of a direct breach of the res judicata rule. Lastly, with regard to the compatibility of the “classification of remedies” rule with Community law, the Government argued that the decision of the CJEC in Emmott (C-208/90, Emmott v. Minister for Social Welfare and Attorney General [1991] ECR I-4269) was no longer good law, as, since its Fantask decision of 2 December 1997 (C-188/95, Fantask and others v. Industriministeriet [1997] ECR I-6783), the CJEC now accepted that, subject to certain conditions, it was for the domestic legal system of each member State to lay down the detailed procedural rules for actions seeking the recovery of sums wrongly paid. The “classification of remedies” rule was not, therefore, at variance with the CJEC's case-law.",

With regard to the judgments of the Conseil d'Etat, the Court notes that the Government's case is based on the application of an established jurisprudential principle, namely the “classification of remedies” or “classification of proceedings” rule. The rule prevents a claim being brought under the general law of tort for a remedy that has previously been refused in a special form of action. According to the Government, the Conseil d'Etat had merely applied that rule when it held that the first judgment of 1986 gave rise to an estoppel by record.",

Furthermore, in the circumstances of the present case the Conseil d'Etat 's particularly strict interpretation of that procedural rule deprived the applicant company of the sole domestic procedure that was capable of affording it a sufficient remedy to ensure compliance with the provisions of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Miragall Escolano and Others v. Spain, nos. 38366/97, 38688/97, 40777/98, 40843/98, 41015/98, 41400/98, 41446/98, 41484/98, 41487/98 and 41509/98, § 38, ECHR 2000-I).",

As to the CJEC's Fantask judgment cited by the Government (see paragraph 54 above), the Court fails to see why it should offer any justification either, since it deals with time-limits for appeals and reliance on limitation periods under national law to resist actions for repayment of charges when they become payable, and not, as in the instant case, a refusal to take the right to reimbursement itself into account (see paragraph 36 above)."

In any event, the Court notes that the interference resulted not from any legislative intervention, but on the contrary from the legislature's failure to bring the domestic law into line with a Community directive, such that the relevant administrative courts were forced to rule on that issue. The Court can but note that charging VAT on the activities of insurance brokers for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978 contravened Article 13-B-a of the Sixth Directive of the Council of European Communities of 17 May 1977. The French authorities sought to render French law compliant by issuing the administrative circular of 2 January 1986. In its judgment of 19 March 1986, the Conseil d'Etat likewise failed to have due regard to the effects of the incompatibility of French law with Community law, notwithstanding the applicant company's failure to draw its attention to that point. The Court further notes that the Conseil d'Etat 's case-law regarding verification of the conformity of national law with international law has substantially evolved since 1989 (see paragraphs 39-40 above) and that the applicant company successfully appealed to the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 21-22 above).",
                "It further notes that the domestic authorities appear to have had difficulty in comprehending Community law, a fact that is, incidentally, confirmed by the Conseil d'Etat 's reference in its S.A. Revert et Badelon decision to “... [the] failure [of the French authorities] to enact provisions that were consistent with the objectives of the Sixth Directive on time”. Thus, the administrative circular bringing French law into line with the Sixth Directive was not issued until 2 January 1986, that is to say more than seven years after the Ninth Directive was notified to the French State (see paragraph 11 above), and in any event concerned only those taxpayers who had refused to the pay the VAT concerned. It is true that the Government have explained that by not referring to the case of taxpayers who had already paid the VAT, the administrative circular left open the possibility of a court action for reimbursement. However, the Conseil d'Etat did not share that view, as it dismissed the applicant company's first appeal more than two and a half months after the administrative circular was issued. Lastly, the Court notes that the Court of Cassation – the highest ranking judicial court – has for its part already accepted that it has jurisdiction to verify whether a domestic norm is consistent with international law (see paragraph 41 above). In the Court's view, the applicant company cannot be required to suffer the consequences of the difficulties that were encountered in assimilating Community law or of the divergences between the various national authorities."

Nor was the interference justified by the 1996 judgment, as the Conseil d'Etat had dismissed the applicant company's second appeal merely on the grounds that it was inadmissible, without ruling on the merits. The applicant company submitted that no estoppel by record had arisen, since there had been no identity of subject matter between its actions for restitution of the VAT and in tort: the former was based on the failure to transpose the Sixth Directive within the prescribed period, while the latter concerned the application of invalid statutory provisions.",

Revert et Badelon. It therefore contended that it had been a victim of the difficulties caused by the Conseil d'Etat 's case-law, which it said constituted an “individual and excessive burden” such that “the fair balance which should [have been] struck between the protection of the right of property and the requirements of the general interest [had been] upset” (see Hentrich v.

Firstly, the fact that the applicant company had restricted its action to a tax appeal had not deprived it of the possibility of asserting its rights. Secondly, to have made an exception would have meant unreasonably undermining the principle of legal certainty. Lastly, the Government noted that, since the applicant company had shown that the “classification of remedies” principle was relative in its effects, in particular owing to the requirement for identity of subject matter, it could have taken that factor into account when preparing its second appeal and based its claim not on the VAT paid, an issue that had been dealt with in 1986, but on the commercial and financial damage actually sustained. Thus, the inadmissibility of the applicant company's appeal was the result of its choice of cause of action and had by no means been inevitable.",
                "The administrative circular was based on an objective difference in the situation of the companies concerned. Furthermore, it had not placed exempted companies in a radically different situation from those that were not: companies such as the applicant company that had been charged VAT could deduct the VAT they had paid and pass it on to their customers, notably by increasing the prices they invoiced for their services. While it was true that the exempted companies had the benefit of the unpaid VAT, the corollary of that was that they could not pass it on to their customers.

                "It pointed out that in National & Provincial Building Society, the Court held that there had been no violation after noting that the applicant building societies had failed to take proceedings challenging the regulations in issue and were accordingly not in the same situation as that of the Woolwich Building Society. It noted that although in Fredin v. Sweden the Court had found no violation of Article 14, on the ground that different classes of complainants could be created (judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 192), it had ruled that a distinction made to the detriment of persons whose situations were similar was discriminatory (see Darby v. Sweden, judgment of 23 October 1990, Series A no. 187). In the instant case, the applicant company said that it was in an identical situation to all those companies carrying on business as insurance brokers who had not paid VAT for 1978 by the time the administrative circular was issued on 2 January 1986. The difference in treatment was directly attributable to the administrative circular, which excluded from its ambit only those businesses that had paid VAT voluntarily. While it was true that the latter were entitled to request a refund of the VAT, the Conseil d'Etat had dismissed the applicant company's claim for such a refund. In practice, an application for judicial review of the administrative circular, which as a regulatory circular was in any event not amenable to such review, would have had no effect.",

If the purpose of the administrative circular had been to transpose the Sixth Directive of 1977 into domestic law, there was no justification for the difference in treatment between the companies concerned by the Sixth Directive. Those companies that had voluntarily paid the VAT, even though it had been levied unlawfully, had not received any benefit in exchange.",

Both companies had paid the same tax, made an initial claim for a refund, appealed to the administrative court and, following the dismissal of their claims, lodged almost simultaneous appeals to the Conseil d'Etat in 1982. The Conseil d'Etat had dismissed the applicant company's appeal in 1986, whereas S.A. Revert et Badelon's appeal papers had been lost and consideration of the appeal consequently delayed until it was set down for hearing at the same session as the applicant company's second appeal. The Conseil d'Etat reached different decisions in the two cases, notwithstanding the fact that the legal position of the two companies was identical, the sole difference being that S.A. Revert et Badelon's case file had been mislaid by the Conseil d'Etat for several years. The appeal by S.A. Revert et Badelon was not heard until ten years after the applicant company's and it benefited from favourable developments in the case-law."

                "65. The Government considered that neither the decisions of the Conseil d'Etat nor the administrative circular adopted on 2 January 1986 by the tax authorities amounted to discrimination. The decisions in the applicant company's case and in S.A. Revert et Badelon did not concern the same issue of law or appellants in identical situations. The European Court of Human Rights had held that there could be no discrimination unless the difference in treatment concerned persons in identical situations (see Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, and Johnston and Others v. Ireland, judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112). The Government noted that the appeals lodged concurrently with the applicant company's first appeal had likewise been dismissed. Nonetheless, the Government accepted that the 1986 decisions of the Conseil d'Etat on the applicant company's appeal and its decision on Revert et Badelon's appeal were at variance. The reason for the difference was that the Conseil d'Etat, which in this instance had identical arguments before it, decided in the second case – which, ten years after the first, raised the same question of law – to depart from its previous case-law. Changes in the case-law, which by definition entailed a conflict between decisions delivered before and after the change, could not be regarded as violating Article 14. For them to be regarded otherwise would be contrary to the Court's traditional interpretation of the provisions of Article 14 (see Case relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium (merits), judgment of 23 July 1968, Series A no. 6).",
                "The Government said that the indisputable effect of the administrative circular of 2 January 1986 was to put the applicant company in an ostensibly less favourable position than that of the companies referred to in the circular. As the “ Belgian linguistic ” case showed, the Court took into consideration the extent of the difference in treatment and whether it was proportionate to the situation of the persons concerned. The States thus enjoyed a margin of appreciation that varied according to the circumstances, the domain and the background (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98). In the instant case the administrative circular had been issued because of the primacy of the Community norm, in accordance with an undertaking given to the Commission of the Communities. The circular was therefore in the public interest and satisfied an existing legal obligation, but without depriving the companies concerned of their prospects of recovering the tax in the pending legal proceedings. Furthermore, the difference in treatment was based on an objective difference in the situation of the companies concerned. Some of the companies had decided not to seek a refund of the tax, while others had made an application to the courts for a refund which, in view of the genuine doubt as to the validity of the tax liability, the authorities had, as in the instant case, quite legitimately left for the courts to decide in the proceedings that were pending at that stage. Lastly, the authorities had logically enough, in view of the high degree of uncertainty over their outcome, chosen not to issue proceedings against those companies that had simply refrained from paying the tax. The Government noted that the Court had recognised that it was legitimate for public authorities to treat companies differently, depending on whether or not the company concerned had chosen to bring proceedings (see National & Provincial Building Society, cited above).",
                "Lastly, the Government argued that the difference in treatment had to be put into perspective, since companies which, like the applicant company, had paid the VAT had enjoyed an exemption from employment tax and had been able to pass on all or part of the VAT to their customers, unlike the companies that had not paid the VAT."

It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 (see the Hornsby v.

It does not accept the Government's contention that the applicants should have lodged appeals with both the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court on the same grounds. Even if they had done so, they – and indeed the Constitutional Court – would have been unaware before the Supreme Court's decision whether leave to appeal on points of law would be granted. There was thus a risk of two different decisions being delivered in the same case, with the potential for legal uncertainty which that created. For this reason, the Court considers that the start of the sixty-day period for lodging the constitutional appeal should have been the date of service of the Supreme Court's decision refusing leave.

The Government accepted that the State had interfered with the applicants' right of property, but argued that the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 had been complied with. They called, firstly, for a distinction to be drawn between the notions of “restitution”, which entailed remedying an unlawful transfer or breach of property rights by restoring the original legal position with retrospective effect, and “expropriation”, which referred to the compulsory deprivation of a right of property on statutory grounds in the public interest with prospective effect in exchange for compensation."

The aim of that Act was to “provide owners of agricultural and forestry land some redress for certain breaches of their rights of property between 1948 and 1989 and to restore so far as possible the former proprietary interests in that land”. In the Government's submission, that meant that although the restitution of agricultural land pursuant to section 8(4) of the Land Act interfered with rights of property, it pursued a legitimate aim under the Czech Constitution. They referred to the Constitutional Court 's findings that landowners' freedom of contract had been unduly restricted under the communist regime in that, in order to be able to sell their houses, landowners were obliged to transfer the adjoining agricultural and forestry land to the purchaser without consideration, on pain of nullity. Such transfers could be regarded as unlawful acts of compulsory expropriation without compensation that now required remedying; as a result, the courts were entitled to order the restitution of the land concerned. In the light of those observations, the Government submitted that the obligation imposed on the applicants to return the property they had obtained free of charge was legitimate and in the general interest.",
                "Further, since the order for rescission did not apply to the deed of sale and gift in its entirety, but only to the transfer of land without consideration, the interference was reasonably proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Lastly, since the applicants had obtained the land free of charge, they were not entitled to claim any compensation."

                "That showed that the existence of duress was relevant only under the first limb, the question of vitiated consent not being pertinent to the second. As a result, any transfer of land made without consideration under a contract for the sale of a building entitled the former owner to seek either rescission of part of the contract or financial compensation. The applicants accepted that such a solution was right and proper in cases in which the transfer had been made against the owner's will. However, they argued that it should only be used on condition that the true content of the deed was established in each case. The courts should avoid applying the rule to voluntary transfers, and seek to establish in every case whether there was evidence of consent or duress, or of a payment of compensation to the former owner, notwithstanding the contractual stipulation for the transfer to be made without consideration."

As regards the circumstances in which they had entered into the agreement with the former owner, the applicants said that at the time he wished to be released from his obligation to work for the agricultural cooperative, something he could only achieve by transferring ownership. He had thus been acting in his own interests when he agreed to transfer the land to the applicants. Under the statutory provisions applicable at the material time, the vendor was obliged to enter into a contract for the sale of the farmhouse and to transfer the adjoining agricultural land without consideration, while the purchaser was required to give an undertaking to work for the cooperative. In the instant case, the applicants had also paid the former owner 30,000 Czechoslovak korunas on top of the purchase price as compensation for the value of the land, as indeed had been confirmed by the former owner in the domestic proceedings. In 1997 he had also made a declaration stating that he had assigned his rights of property, including his rights of property in the agricultural land farmed by the cooperative, of his own free will."

Since they had performed their obligations, they considered that they had been adversely affected by the rescission of the deed of gift and that section 8(4) of the Land Act was unjust and contravened Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

The first, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph and is of a general nature, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The Court has to ensure that the last two rules are applicable before determining whether the first one has been complied with. The three rules are not, however, “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property; accordingly, they must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 55, ECHR 1999-II, and Elia S.r.l. v. Italy, no. 37710/97, § 51, ECHR 2001-IX)."

                "65. The Court notes that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 requires that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful. Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 850-51, § 50).",

As to whether the deprivation of property in issue pursued a legitimate aim, in other words whether there was a “public interest” within the meaning of the second rule set out in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court notes that because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed to appreciate what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures of deprivation of property. Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities enjoy a certain margin of appreciation (see Malama v. Greece, no. 43622/98, § 46, ECHR 2001-II).",
                "Furthermore, the notion of “public interest” is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws expropriating property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues. The Court finds it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one and will respect the legislature's judgment as to what is “in the public interest” unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation. This necessarily applies, and perhaps to a greater extent, in the event of changes to a country's political system (see, mutatis mutandis, The former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, § 87, ECHR 2000-XII)."

                "69. The Court notes that it is well-established case-law that the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 must be construed in the light of the principle laid down in the first sentence of the Article. Consequently, an interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must achieve a “fair balance” between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see, among other authorities, Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332, p. 23, § 38, and Malama, cited above, § 48). In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing how the measures are to be implemented and to ascertaining whether the consequences of implementation are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 75, ECHR 1999-III). Nevertheless, the Court cannot fail to exercise its power of review which requires it to determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicants' right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Under the Court's case-law, compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicants. A total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 only in exceptional circumstances (see The Holy Monasteries v. Greece, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-A, p. 35, § 71, and Malama, cited above, § 48)."

As it has already been established that the interference in issue satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary, the lack of compensation does not make the taking of the applicants' property eo ipso wrongful (see, mutatis mutandis, The former King of Greece and Others, cited above, § 90). It remains therefore to be examined whether in the context of a lawful expropriation the applicants had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden."

The Court considers that the legislature's decision to deal with infringements of property rights under the communist regime globally, with the occasional distinction, where necessary for analytical purposes, is reasonable. It is conscious of the legislature's concern to afford some redress for the infringements and accepts that the exceptional circumstances – the manner in which land was generally acquired at the time – justify the lack of compensation. However, it fails to comprehend why the Czech legislation precluded any possibility of re-examination of individual cases involving transfers of land in special circumstances. It considers that in a case such as the present one the courts should seek clearly to establish whether the land was transferred against the former owner's will – which, in the light of his declaration, does not appear to have been the position – and whether, in view of the consideration provided, the transfer genuinely infringed his rights of property."

                "96. Secondly, the Court cannot lose sight of the fact that the pensions cap was put in place and, more importantly, maintained at a time when the Bulgarian pension system was undergoing a comprehensive reform, as part of the country’s transition from a wholly State ‑ owned and centrally planned economy to private property and a market economy (see, mutatis mutandis, Credit Bank and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 40064/98, 30 April 2002, and Velikovi and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 43278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01 and 194/02, § 166, 15 March 2007). In view of the changes in the manner of calculating the amounts of social security contributions and retirement pensions – in particular, the introduction of a ceiling on pensionable earnings (see paragraph 54 above) – the first tier of that pension system can be regarded as moving towards a global levelling of the amount of benefits provided. It is apparent that the new pension model in Bulgaria envisages the provision of higher retirement incomes through the second ‑ and third ‑ tier pension schemes, which, unlike the first ‑ tier scheme, are funded, defined ‑ contribution schemes (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above). In that context, the cap, as well as its extensions until the end of 2009, and then the end of 2011 and of 2013 (see paragraphs 34, 38 and 39 above), can be seen as a transitional measure accompanying the overall transformation of the pension system. The Court has in the past recognised that Contracting States have a wide margin of appreciation when passing laws in the context of a change of political and economic regime (see Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, § 113, ECHR 2005 ‑ VI, with further references). It is true that the applicants, all of whom were born before 1 January 1960, are not eligible to be affiliated to the second ‑ tier scheme (see paragraph 52 above) and cannot therefore top up their pension earnings in that way. However, the Court cannot attach decisive importance to that, because that scheme is a funded, defined ‑ contribution one, with individual accounts; the amount of benefits it can provide is directly dependent on the amount and duration of the contributions of those affiliated to it. It is understandable that such a scheme should be open only to those who will be able to accumulate sufficient funds to finance their pensions."

Thus, section 47b(2), [added in 1990 and subsequently repealed], provided that the amount of one pension or the sum total of several pensions could not exceed [BGL] 500 per month. Another example is section 47(5) of the Pensions Act [as in force between 1967 and 1991].",

While the amount of the pensions of most pensioners depends on those parameters, the amount of the pensions of the persons concerned [by the cap] does not.

                "The cap set out in section 47c of the Pensions Act could be linked with the so ‑ called minimum amount of pension. Not only is that minimum, guaranteed by law, not unconstitutional, but it is recommended by some conventions of the International Labour Organisation: for instance, Article 7 of Convention No. 35 on Old ‑ Age Insurance (Industry, etc.), [1933]; Article 7 of Convention No. 38 on Invalidity Insurance (Agriculture), [1933]; Article 9 of Convention No. 39 on Survivors’ Insurance (Industry, etc.), [1933]. Those conventions allow the amount of pension to be a fixed sum, or a percentage of the remuneration taken into account for insurance purposes, or to vary with the amount of the contributions paid.",

It can be described, in financial terms, as a ‘pay ‑ as ‑ you ‑ go’ system. Such a system requires a cap on the maximum amount of pension – it serves to guarantee the minimum amount of pension and to contribute to its growth. That function shows that the impugned provision is consistent with the requirements of social justice, as laid down in the Preamble to the [Constitution].",

After that, the pension scheme continued to be based on an unfunded, pay ‑ as ‑ you ‑ go model, but the pension fund was separated from the State budget and its management was entrusted to the newly created NSSI (sections 1 ‑ 13 of the Social Security Fund Act 1995). Before March 1996, social security contributions were charged only to employers, not employees, and employers were barred from deducting those contributions from the remuneration paid to employees (Article 148 of the Labour Code 1951, as worded from its adoption in 1951 until the beginning of March 1996).

It makes provision for a multipillar pension system, with three tiers of general retirement pension. The first ‑ tier, or basic, pension scheme is mandatory, public, and defined ‑ benefit. It is based on an unfunded, pay ‑ as ‑ you ‑ go model (Articles 21 and 22 of the Code), and consists of public pension funds managed by the NSSI. The general fund’s main sources of financing are social security contributions and subsidies from the State budget (Article 21 of the Code). Contributions are charged to both employers and employees, in a specified proportion, with the exception of judges, prosecutors, investigators, civil servants, police, national security agents, and military personnel, whose contributions are fully covered by the State budget (Article 6 §§ 3 and 5 of the Code). The part of the contributions payable by employers cannot be deducted from remunerations under any form (Article 6 § 12 of the Code). The amount of the annual State subsidy to the fund is fixed in the annual State social security budget Act (Article 21 § 4 (b) of the Code). Apart from retirement pensions, the fund is used to pay out survivor’s and disability pensions, as well as certain health ‑ related benefits (Article 22 of the Code). The second ‑ tier scheme is also mandatory. It applies to all individuals born on or after 1 January 1960, and is a funded defined ‑ contribution scheme, with contributions fixed by law and going into funds consisting of individual accounts and managed by private companies subject to special regulation (Articles 120a ‑ 123i and 124 ‑ 203 of the Code). The second ‑ tier scheme is open only to individuals born on or after the above ‑ mentioned date because at the time when it started operating (1 January 2002) they were aged forty ‑ two years or less and could thus be expected to make contributions for a longer period of time and build up the funds on which the scheme relies (Средкова, К., Осигурително право, 3 издание, Сиби, 2008, стр. 216; Мръчков, В., Осигурително право, 5 издание, Сиби, 2010, стр. 380 и 389). The third ‑ tier scheme is voluntary and open to all persons above the age of sixteen. It is also a funded defined ‑ contribution scheme, with contributions going into funds consisting of individual accounts and managed by private companies subject to special regulation. However, unlike the second ‑ tier scheme, the amount of the contributions is not fixed by law but freely decided upon by the persons concerned (Articles 120a ‑ 123i, 209 ‑ 59 and 317 ‑ 43 of the Code).

It is a function of the length of service (“ осигурителен стаж ”) and the average monthly income for social security purposes (“ средномесечен осигурителен доход ”), multiplied by an individual coefficient. The coefficient is based on the ratio between the retiree’s monthly earnings and the average monthly salary (for the period before 1 January 1997) and the average monthly income for social security purposes (for the period after 1 January 1997). For the period before 1 January 1997, the calculation is based on the retiree’s monthly earnings during three consecutive years of his or her choice out of the last fifteen years of service.

Since 2002, it has been fixed in monetary terms in the annual State social security budget Act (Article 6 § 2 (1) of the Code, as worded after 1 January 2002).

For instance, OECD counties could be divided in four groups. The first comprised those (including Denmark and Ireland) in which there was little or no link between pensions and preretirement earnings. The second consisted of those (including Belgium, Iceland, and the United Kingdom) in which that link was weak. The third group (including France, Norway, Portugal, and Switzerland) lay toward the middle. The countries in the fourth group (including Austria, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden) had a very strong link between pensions and preretirement earnings.

Concerning the first limb of the Government’s objection, the Court observes that the cap on pensions currently flows directly from the express wording of paragraph 6(1) of the transitional and concluding provisions of the Social Security Code 1999; until 31 December 1999 it was based on the express wording of section 47c of the Pensions Act 1957 (see paragraphs 27, 31 and 34 above). It was not disputed that in its decisions fixing the pension of each of the applicants the NSSI, which had no discretion in the matter, applied those provisions correctly. In that regard, the present cases are no different from the two cases from 2001 and 2010 in which the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed applications for judicial review of pension ‑ capping decisions of the NSSI, holding that those decisions were lawful (see paragraphs 41 and 48 above). It follows that applications for judicial review of the NSSI’s decisions were not an effective remedy that the applicants had to use (see, mutatis mutandis, Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, § 42 in limine, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; Urbárska Obec Trenčianske Biskupice v. Slovakia, no. 74258/01, § 86, 27 November 2007; and Ognyan Asenov v.

                "73. The second limb of the objection does not stand up to examination either. In Bulgaria, there is no possibility for private persons themselves to bring proceedings before the Constitutional Court. The Court has, in line with its earlier case ‑ law on that point (see Brozicek v. Italy, 19 December 1989, § 34, Series A no. 167; Padovani v. Italy, 26 February 1993, § 20, Series A no. 257 ‑ B; Spadea and Scalabrino v. Italy, 28 September 1995, § 24, Series A no. 315 ‑ B; and Immobiliare Saffi, cited above, § 42 in fine ), already held that the possibility to request the bodies or the officials entitled to bring such proceedings to do so is not an effective remedy for the purposes of Articles 13 or 35 § 1 of the Convention, because the persons concerned cannot directly compel the institution of proceedings before the Constitutional Court, whereas under this Court’s settled case ‑ law a remedy can be considered effective only if the applicant is able to initiate the procedure directly (see Petkov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 77568/01, 178/02 and 505/02, § 82, ECHR 2009 ‑ ..., with further references). The Court reaffirmed that ruling in Nozharova v. Bulgaria ((dec.), nos. 44096/05 et al., 25 August 2009). It sees no reason to deviate from it in the present case, in which several such requests were turned down (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). The fact that in August 2010 the Supreme Administrative Court acceded to a request to refer the pensions cap to the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above) does not alter that position, because the referral was a result of the exercise of that court’s discretionary power in that respect. In any event, the Constitutional Court refused to accept the matter for examination, noting that it had already ruled on the constitutionality of the cap in 1998 and that the Supreme Administrative Court was not competent to refer to it the alleged incompatibility of statutory provisions with international treaties (see paragraph 46 above)."

Such a cap had existed under different forms ever since the adoption of the Pensions Act 1957. Pensions in Bulgaria were based on the principle of social solidarity, which required that all those who reached a certain age be provided with a pension, but also that the personal input of each individual be taken into account in fixing its amount. A pension ceiling was not a uniquely Bulgarian occurrence, but existed in a number of countries, such as Germany, without being regarded as infringing the principles of social justice or equal treatment. Moreover, it could not be overlooked that the Social Security Code 1999 had made provision for a second ‑ tier pension, based on individual contributions, in respect of persons born on or after 1 January 1960. It was also noteworthy that recently the maximum amount of pension had been increased to BGN 700."

Even if it was theoretically possible to pay the applicants the full nominal amount of their pensions, there existed a number of factors that would make that difficult to achieve in practice. The population was getting older and the ratio between pensioners and persons in active employment was deteriorating. If the authorities opted to pay the full amount of pension, even if it exceeded the cap, it could result in a shortfall of funds to pay the pensions of others who had contributed less to the funding of the pension system. That could lead to a breach of the principle of equal treatment, which guaranteed a minimum revenue for each pensioner. All the more so in the midst of a severe economic and demographic crisis. The applicants could not maintain that they had had a legitimate expectation that they would receive the full amount of their pensions after 31 December 2003, because it was impossible to predict how the legislation would evolve in the future. Legislation was a product of social developments, which were rapidly changing.

The existence of a pensions ceiling went hand in hand with the existence of a maximum income for social security purposes. It was intended to guarantee social justice, and was necessary for the sound financial management of the pension system. The Constitutional Court had made those points in its 1998 decision."

However, the 2004 draft bill for the amendment of the Social Security Code 1999, which had permanently capped the pensions of all pensioners whose rights had accrued before 31 December 2009, had not been accompanied by any explanatory notes or by any debate in Parliament. The same went for the 2009 amendments to the Code. The assertions that the pensions ceiling was tied to the minimum amount of pension, helped to maintain it, and furthered social justice were not true. Even if it could be accepted that such a cap had been warranted to help the poorest pensioners scrape through the profound social and economic changes of the 1990s, it could not be maintained forever."

The real reasons for maintaining the cap could be gleaned from a number of interviews and public statements by officials, such as the director of the NSSI and several successive ministers of Labour and Social Policy. They were the perception that the public would not tolerate very high pensions and that the pension model existing under the Pensions Act 1957 had suffered from a number of defects. Neither of those reasons was a reasonable basis for the cap. The first was based on entirely populist considerations, which were moreover out of line with modern social attitudes. It was telling that a number of domestic institutions and organisations, plus five constitutional judges, were opposed to the cap. In that connection, it was also worth noting that the authorities were not doing enough to collect the social security contributions payable by those in active employment. The second reason was also unavailing. The applicants, like everyone else, had been bound by the provisions of the Pensions Act 1957 governing the basis for calculating the amount of social security contributions and retirement pensions."

In that connection, sight should not be lost of the nature of the applicants’ employment, which had entailed higher levels of responsibility, privation, stress and risk, and hence higher remuneration.

It was in the legislature’s discretion to choose a particular social security model. Faced with demographic and financial difficulties, Bulgaria had opted to limit the maximum amount of the first ‑ tier pension. However, it had made provision for a voluntary third ‑ tier pension, and there was no indication that the applicants had tried to avail themselves of that opportunity. It was also important to point out that the cap on their pensions had been increased several times, and that those of them who had served in the armed forces had not themselves paid pension contributions and had retired under very favourable conditions. The requisite fair balance had not therefore been upset to their detriment.",

                "84. The principles which apply generally in cases under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are equally relevant when it comes to pensions (see Andrejeva v. Latvia [GC], no. 55707/00, § 77, 18 February 2009, and, more recently, Stummer v. Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, § 82, 7 July 2011). Thus, that provision does not guarantee the right to acquire property (see, among other authorities, Van der Mussele v. Belgium, 23 November 1983, § 48, Series A no. 70; Slivenko v. Latvia (dec.) [GC], no. 48321/99, § 121, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; and Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 35 (b), ECHR 2004 ‑ IX). Nor does it guarantee, as such, any right to a pension of a particular amount (see, among other authorities, Müller v. Austria, no. 5849/72, Commission’s report of 1 October 1975, Decisions and Reports (DR) 3, p. 25; T. v. Sweden, no. 10671/83, Commission decision of 4 March 1985, DR 42, p. 229; Janković v.

France (dec.), no. 52273/08, 8 February 2011; and Maggio and Others, cited above, § 55). However, where a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a pension – whether or not conditional on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation has to be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 64, ECHR 2010 ‑ ...). The reduction or the discontinuance of a pension may therefore constitute interference with possessions that needs to be justified (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 40; Rasmussen v. Poland, no. 38886/05, § 71, 28 April 2009; and Wieczorek, cited above, § 57)."

In the instant case, the applicants’ pensions were first calculated in line with the general rules of the Pensions Act 1957 and subsequently of the Social Security Code 1999 (in the cases of those applicants who retired after 1 January 2000, solely the latter). Because the amounts produced by those calculations were, in the case of each applicant, above the pensions cap set out in section 47c of the Act and later in paragraph 6(1) of the transitional and concluding provisions of the Code, their pensions were trimmed to the level allowed by the cap (see paragraphs 7, 8, 10 ‑ 15, 17 ‑ 19, 21, 27 and 31 above). The cap may thus be regarded either as a provision limiting the amount of pension after it has been calculated under the general rules, and thus amounting to an interference with a “possession” of the applicants, or as part of the overall set of statutory rules governing the manner in which the amount of pension should be calculated, and thus amounting to a rule preventing the applicants from having any “possession” in relation to the surplus."

From this vantage point, it could be argued that, regardless of the position before or after, between 1 January 2000 and 23 December 2003 the applicants could be regarded as having harboured a legitimate expectation that the cap on their pensions would come to an end on 31 December 2003, and that the legislative amendment which took that expectation away amounted in its own right to an interference with their “possessions” (see, mutatis mutandis, Maurice v.

According to the Court’s case ‑ law, the national authorities, because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the Convention system, it is thus for those authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. Moreover, the notion of “public interest” is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws concerning pensions or welfare benefits involves consideration of various economic and social issues. The margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing such policies should therefore be a wide one, and its judgment as to what is “in the public interest” should be respected unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation. However, any interference must also be reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised. In other words, a “fair balance” must be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. That balance will be lacking where the person concerned has to bear an individual and excessive burden (see Wieczorek, cited above, §§ 59 ‑ 60, with further references). In that regard, it would also be important to verify whether an applicant’s right to derive benefits from the social security scheme in question has been infringed in a manner resulting in the impairment of the essence of his pension rights (see Domalewski v. Poland (dec.), no. 34610/97, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 39 in fine; and Wieczorek, cited above, § 57 in fine ). On the other hand, it must not be overlooked that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not restrict a State’s freedom to choose the type or amount of benefits that it provides under a social security scheme (see Stec and Others, cited above § 54; Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01, § 53, ECHR 2006 ‑ VI; and Wieczorek, cited above, § 66 in limine )."

In the instant case, the applicants called into question the purpose of the cap, saying that it was not, as contended by the Government, based on considerations having to do with the financial viability of the pension system. It was rather a result of the perceptions that the public would not tolerate very high pensions and that the Pensions Act 1957 had made possible retirement on overly generous terms. The Court, for its part, notes that the cap obviously results in savings for the pension system (see the statistics quoted in paragraph 65 above). However, it does not find it necessary to determine whether those savings are indeed necessary to ensure the system’s financial viability. It observes that in upholding the cap the Constitutional Court took the view that it was based on the “requirements of social justice” (see paragraph 29 above). Even assuming that the applicants’ assertions as to the real purpose of the cap are correct, the Court does not consider that it was illegitimate for the Bulgarian legislature to have regard to social considerations, or that its judgment in that respect was manifestly without reasonable foundation. The pension systems of different countries vary in the relative emphasis that they place on redistributive vis ‑ à ‑ vis insurance elements. Comparative studies by the World Bank and the OECD show that while some Contracting States attach more importance to providing the same or very similar pension replacement rates to all workers, with a strong link between pensions and preretirement earnings, in others the accent is on pension adequacy, with little or no connection between pensions and preretirement earnings (see paragraphs 67 and 68 above). That is primarily a matter that falls to be decided by the national authorities, which have direct democratic legitimation and are better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. According to the Court’s case ‑ law, in matters of general policy, on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely, the determination of the domestic policymaker should be given special weight (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 97, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII).

On this point, the Court starts by noting that the redistributive function of the pension system can be achieved in various ways, such as putting in place progressive benefit ‑ calculation formulae, imposing ceilings on pension entitlements, or taxing high pensions. In Bulgaria, the legislature has chosen to exempt first ‑ and second ‑ tier pensions from taxation (see paragraphs 51 and 55 above), but has imposed a cap on the maximum amount of pension under the first tier. The Court is unable to find that this is in itself a disproportionate measure. It has in a number of cases accepted the possibility of reductions in social security entitlements (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 45; Hoogendijk v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 58641/00, 6 January 2005; Goudswaard ‑ Van der Lans v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 75255/01, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI; and Wieczorek, cited above, § 67). It has even countenanced pension caps similar to the one at issue (see Blanco Callejas v. Spain (dec.), no. 64100/00, 18 June 2002, and Buchheit and Meinberg v. Germany (dec.), nos. 51466/99 and 70130/01, 2 February 2006). So has the former Commission (see Beging v. Germany, no. 15376/89, decision of the Commission of 27 May 1991, unreported, and Kuhlmann v. Germany, no. 21519/93, Commission decision of 30 June 1993, unreported). The above ‑ mentioned comparative studies by the World Bank and the OECD show that ceilings on public pensions are far from being a uniquely Bulgarian phenomenon (see paragraph 66 above). In the present case, there are several factors that inform the Court’s assessment."
            ],
            [
                "95. First, the applicants’ principal argument against the cap was that, unlike modern ‑ day workers, in respect of whom there exists a ceiling on pensionable earnings (see paragraph 54 above), they were bound to pay contributions on the full amount of their relatively high salaries; they were therefore entitled to pensions commensurate with those contributions. However, that argument does not stand up to examination. In the first place, it cannot be overlooked that until 1996, contributions were payable solely by employers, who were barred from deducting them from employees’ remunerations; that continues to be the case for military personnel, civil servants, and some other categories of State employees (see paragraphs 49 and 52 above). More importantly, the argument misconceives the relationship between social security contributions and first ‑ tier pensions in Bulgaria. Unlike the second ‑ and the third ‑ tier schemes, where contributions are directly linked to the expected benefit returns (see paragraph 52 above), first ‑ tier contributions did not and still do not have an exclusive link to retirement pensions. That is due to the unfunded, pay ‑ as ‑ you ‑ go character of the first pillar of the Bulgarian pension system, both under the Pension Act 1957 and under the Social Security Code 1999 (see paragraphs 49 and 53 above). That makes it impossible to regard the payment of higher social security contributions as a sufficient ground for entitlement to matching pension benefits (see, mutatis mutandis, Carson and Others, § 84, and Müller, at p. 31, §§ 29 ‑ 30, both cited above). Indeed, in the cases of some of the applicants – and of others in a similar situation – the bulk of those contributions was paid under a different economic regime, when the pension fund was an inseparable part of the general State budget (see paragraph 49 above), and at a time when the real value of the Bulgarian lev and the general framework of the Bulgarian economy were very different from what they are today."
            ],
            [
                "96. Secondly, the Court cannot lose sight of the fact that the pensions cap was put in place and, more importantly, maintained at a time when the Bulgarian pension system was undergoing a comprehensive reform, as part of the country’s transition from a wholly State ‑ owned and centrally planned economy to private property and a market economy (see, mutatis mutandis, Credit Bank and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 40064/98, 30 April 2002, and Velikovi and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 43278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01 and 194/02, § 166, 15 March 2007). In view of the changes in the manner of calculating the amounts of social security contributions and retirement pensions – in particular, the introduction of a ceiling on pensionable earnings (see paragraph 54 above) – the first tier of that pension system can be regarded as moving towards a global levelling of the amount of benefits provided. It is apparent that the new pension model in Bulgaria envisages the provision of higher retirement incomes through the second ‑ and third ‑ tier pension schemes, which, unlike the first ‑ tier scheme, are funded, defined ‑ contribution schemes (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above). In that context, the cap, as well as its extensions until the end of 2009, and then the end of 2011 and of 2013 (see paragraphs 34, 38 and 39 above), can be seen as a transitional measure accompanying the overall transformation of the pension system. The Court has in the past recognised that Contracting States have a wide margin of appreciation when passing laws in the context of a change of political and economic regime (see Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, § 113, ECHR 2005 ‑ VI, with further references). It is true that the applicants, all of whom were born before 1 January 1960, are not eligible to be affiliated to the second ‑ tier scheme (see paragraph 52 above) and cannot therefore top up their pension earnings in that way. However, the Court cannot attach decisive importance to that, because that scheme is a funded, defined ‑ contribution one, with individual accounts; the amount of benefits it can provide is directly dependent on the amount and duration of the contributions of those affiliated to it. It is understandable that such a scheme should be open only to those who will be able to accumulate sufficient funds to finance their pensions."

Thirdly, particular emphasis needs to be placed on the fact that the applicants were obliged to endure a reasonable and commensurate reduction rather than a total loss of their pension entitlements. Indeed, they did not suffer an actual decrease in the monthly payments they received, but simply did not see the announced lifting of the pensions cap materialise – it appears that since retirement they have never received the uncapped amount of their pensions. Moreover, the cap, while sometimes – but not always – resulting in considerable reductions of the nominal amount of their monthly pensions, did not totally divest the applicants of their only means of subsistence. The applicants are, in the nature of things, the top earners among the more than two million persons in Bulgaria who are currently in receipt of a retirement pension. They can therefore hardly be regarded as being made to bear an excessive and disproportionate burden, or as having suffered an impairment of the essence of their pension rights (see, mutatis mutandis, M.V. and U ‑ M.S. v. Finland (dec.), no. 43189/98, 28 January 2003; Saarinen v. Finland (dec.), no. 69136/01, 28 January 2003; Banfield v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 6223/04, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI; Laloyaux v.

Germany (dec.), no. 71477/01, 8 September 2005). Just like other social security schemes, they are an expression of a society’s solidarity with its vulnerable members (see Goudswaard ‑ Van der Lans, and Wieczorek, § 64, both cited above), and cannot be likened to private insurance schemes (see Müller, cited above, at p. 32, § 31). Indeed, as already noted (see paragraph 92 above), the pension systems of different countries vary in the relative emphasis that they place on redistributive vis ‑ à ‑ vis insurance elements."

Initially, the maximum pension was tied to the social pension, not being able to exceed it by more than three times (see paragraph 27 above). In 2000, that ceiling was raised to four times the social pension for old age (see paragraph 31 above). In 2003, the cap was tied to the ceiling on pensionable earnings and the average estimated pension replacement rate (see paragraph 34 above). It has thus been gradually increased throughout the years, with the result that, as a general trend, considerably fewer pensioners are affected by it (see paragraphs 28, 32, 37 and 65 above)."

In any event, that exemption did not directly affect the applicants because they would not benefit from its cancellation. The different treatment accorded to persons who have held high office was justified by the nature of their duties, which were closely related to the country’s government. Only persons who had held one of a small number of very high posts were exempted from the cap; all of them had been barred by law from taking up additional employment.

That difference in treatment concerned rights protected under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and could therefore be examined under Article 14. There were no grounds to treat the applicants differently from pensioners whose pensions fell below the cap, for the same reasons as those set out in relation to the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. That differential treatment did not pursue a legitimate aim. However, even if it were to be accepted that the money saved as a result of the cap could be used to make payments to other pensioners, the effects of the measure were disproportionate. The interference with the applicants’ pension rights, which had become permanent, was quite serious, because they received only a fraction of their full pensions; at the same time, capping the pensions of only 2% of all pensioners could not have a significant effect on the pensions of others. In 2009 those arguments had led the Commission for Protection Against Discrimination to find that the cap amounted to indirect discrimination. Lastly, the applicants submitted that it was not justified to treat them differently from persons who had held high office.

However, its application does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention. The prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and its Protocols require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Article of the Convention, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide. It is necessary but also sufficient for the facts of the case to fall “within the ambit” of one or more of the Convention Articles (see Carson and Others, § 63, and Stummer, § 81, both cited above)."

The aim pursued by the legislation has been held by the Court to be a legitimate one in the public interest (see paragraph 92 above). According to the applicants, however, that is not sufficient to justify the distinction since the pensions cap has a disproportionate and serious impact on them. This amounts in substance to the same grievance, albeit seen from another angle, as that which has been examined under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Although that complaint could equally be argued in terms of indirect discrimination, the Court sees no cause for arriving at a different conclusion in relation to Article 14 of the Convention: having regard to its margin of appreciation, the Bulgarian legislature did not transgress the principle of proportionality.",

In other words, the requirement to demonstrate an analogous position does not require that the comparator groups be identical. An applicant must demonstrate that, having regard to the particular nature of his or her complaint, he or she was in a relevantly similar situation to others treated differently (see Clift v. the United Kingdom, no. 7205/07, § 66, 13 July 2010)."

It is not for an international court to make pronouncements on such matters; those are policy judgments which are in principle reserved for the national authorities, which have direct democratic legitimation and are better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others, cited above, § 97). It should be noted in that connection that both the Court and the former Commission have on a number of occasions countenanced the differences that some Contracting States draw, for pension purposes, between civil servants and private employees (see X v.
