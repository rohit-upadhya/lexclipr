                "49. The Convention is not opposed to States, in the performance of their task as guardians of the public interest, both creating or maintaining a distinction between different categories of offences for the purposes of their domestic law and drawing the dividing line, but it does not follow that the classification thus made by the States is decisive for the purposes of the Convention.",
                "By removing certain forms of conduct from the category of criminal offences under domestic law, the law-maker may be able to serve the interests of the individual (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, ibid., p. 33, § 80) as well as the needs of the proper administration of justice, in particular in so far as the judicial authorities are thereby relieved of the task of prosecuting and punishing contraventions - which are numerous but of minor importance - of road traffic rules. The Convention is not opposed to the moves towards \"decriminalisation\" which are taking place - in extremely varied forms - in the member States of the Council of Europe. The Government quite rightly insisted on this point. Nevertheless, if the Contracting States were able at their discretion, by classifying an offence as \"regulatory\" instead of criminal, to exclude the operation of the fundamental clauses of Articles 6 and 7 (art. 6, art. 7), the application of these provisions would be subordinated to their sovereign will. A latitude extending thus far might lead to results incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention."

                "53. The Court does not underestimate the cogency of this argument. The Court recognises that the legislation in question marks an important stage in the history of the reform of German criminal law and that the innovations introduced in 1968/1975 represent more than a simple change of terminology.",
                "Nonetheless, the Court would firstly note that, according to the ordinary meaning of the terms, there generally come within the ambit of the criminal law offences that make their perpetrator liable to penalties intended, inter alia, to be deterrent and usually consisting of fines and of measures depriving the person of his liberty.",
                "In addition, misconduct of the kind committed by Mr. Öztürk continues to be classified as part of the criminal law in the vast majority of the Contracting States, as it was in the Federal Republic of Germany until the entry into force of the 1968/1975 legislation; in those other States, such misconduct, being regarded as illegal and reprehensible, is punishable by criminal penalties.",
                "Moreover, the changes resulting from the 1968/1975 legislation relate essentially to procedural matters and to the range of sanctions, henceforth limited to Geldbussen. Whilst the latter penalty appears less burdensome in some respects than Geldstrafen, it has nonetheless retained a punitive character, which is the customary distinguishing feature of criminal penalties. The rule of law infringed by the applicant has, for its part, undergone no change of content. It is a rule that is directed, not towards a given group possessing a special status - in the manner, for example, of disciplinary law -, but towards all citizens in their capacity as road-users; it prescribes conduct of a certain kind and makes the resultant requirement subject to a sanction that is punitive. Indeed, the sanction - and this the Government did not contest - seeks to punish as well as to deter. It matters little whether the legal provision contravened by Mr. Öztürk is aimed at protecting the rights and interests of others or solely at meeting the demands of road traffic. These two ends are not mutually exclusive. Above all, the general character of the rule and the purpose of the penalty, being both deterrent and punitive, suffice to show that the offence in question was, in terms of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, criminal in nature.",
                "The fact that it was admittedly a minor offence hardly likely to harm the reputation of the offender does not take it outside the ambit of Article 6 (art. 6). There is in fact nothing to suggest that the criminal offence referred to in the Convention necessarily implies a certain degree of seriousness. In this connection, a number of Contracting States still draw a distinction, as did the Federal Republic at the time when the Convention was opened for the signature of the Governments, between the most serious offences (crimes), lesser offences ( délits ) and petty offences (contraventions), whilst qualifying them all as criminal offences. Furthermore, it would be contrary to the object and purpose of Article 6 (art. 6), which guarantees to \"everyone charged with a criminal offence\" the right to a court and to a fair trial, if the State were allowed to remove from the scope of this Article (art. 6) a whole category of offences merely on the ground of regarding them as petty. Nor does the Federal Republic deprive the presumed perpetrators of Ordnungswidrigkeiten of this right since it grants them the faculty - of which the applicant availed himself - of appealing to a court against the administrative decision."
            ],
            [
                "54. As the contravention committed by Mr. Öztürk was criminal for the purposes of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, there is no need to examine it also in the light of the final criterion stated above (at paragraph 50). The relative lack of seriousness of the penalty at stake (see paragraph 18 above) cannot divest an offence of its inherently criminal character."

            [
                "55. The Government further appeared to consider that the applicant did not have the status of a person \"charged with a criminal offence\" because the 1968/1975 Act does not provide for any \"Beschuldigung\" (\"charge\") and does not employ the terms \"Angeschuldigter\" (\"person charged\") or \"Angeklagter\" (\"the accused\"). On this point, the Court would simply refer back to its well-established case-law holding that \"charge\", for the purposes of Article 6 (art. 6), may in general be defined as \"the official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence\", although \"it may in some instances take the form of other measures which carry the implication of such an allegation and which likewise substantially affect the situation of the suspect\" (see, as the most recent authorities, the Foti and others judgment of 10 December 1982, Series A no. 56, p. 18, § 52, and the Corigliano judgment of the same date, Series A no. 57, p. 13, § 34). In the present case, the applicant was \"charged\" at the latest as from the beginning of April 1978 when the decision of the Heilbronn administrative authorities was communicated to him (see paragraph 11 above)."

Although legal commentators in Germany do not seem unanimous in considering that the law on \"regulatory offences\" no longer belongs in reality to criminal law, the drafting history of the 1968/1975 Act nonetheless makes it clear that the offences in question have been removed from the criminal law sphere by that Act (see Deutscher Bundestag, Drucksache V/1269 and, inter alia, the judgment of 16 July 1969 by the Constitutional Court, Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, vol. 27, pp. 18-36).",

The Government's submissions can be summarised as follows. By means of criminal law, society endeavoured to safeguard its very foundations as well as the rights and interests essential for the life of the community. The law on Ordnungswidrigkeiten, on the other hand, sought above all to maintain public order. As a general rule and in any event in the instant case, commission of a \"regulatory offence\" did not involve a degree of ethical unworthiness such as to merit for its perpetrator the moral value-judgment of reproach (Unwerturteil) that characterised penal punishment (Strafe). The difference between \"regulatory offences\" and criminal offences found expression both in procedural terms and in relation to the attendant penalties and other legal consequences.",
                "In the first place, so the Government's argument continued, in removing \"regulatory offences\" from the criminal law the German legislature had introduced a simplified procedure of prosecution and punishment conducted before administrative authorities save in the event of subsequent appeal to a court. Although general laws on criminal procedure were in principle applicable by analogy, the procedure laid down under the 1968/1975 Act was distinguishable in many respects from criminal procedure. For example, prosecution of Ordnungswidrigkeiten fell within the discretionary power of the competent authorities and the 1968/1975 Act greatly limited the possibilities of restricting the personal liberty of the individual at the stage of the preliminary investigations (see paragraphs 21, 22 and 24 above).",
                "In the second place, instead of a penal fine (Geldstrafe) and imprisonment the legislature had substituted a mere \"regulatory\" fine (Geldbusse - see paragraph 17 above). Imprisonment was not an alternative (Ersatzfreiheitsstrafe) to the latter type of fine as it was to the former and no coercive imprisonment (Erzwingungshaft) could be ordered unless the person concerned had failed to pay the sum due without having established his inability to pay (see paragraph 33 above). Furthermore, a \"regulatory offence\" was not entered in the judicial criminal records but solely, in certain circumstances, on the central traffic register (see paragraph 39 above).",
                "The reforms accomplished in 1968/1975 thus, so the Government concluded, reflected a concern to \"decriminalise\" minor offences to the benefit not only of the individual, who would no longer be answerable in criminal terms for his act and who could even avoid all court proceedings, but also of the effective functioning of the courts, henceforth relieved in principle of the task of dealing with the great majority of such offences."

                "Nonetheless, the Court would firstly note that, according to the ordinary meaning of the terms, there generally come within the ambit of the criminal law offences that make their perpetrator liable to penalties intended, inter alia, to be deterrent and usually consisting of fines and of measures depriving the person of his liberty.",
                "In addition, misconduct of the kind committed by Mr. Öztürk continues to be classified as part of the criminal law in the vast majority of the Contracting States, as it was in the Federal Republic of Germany until the entry into force of the 1968/1975 legislation; in those other States, such misconduct, being regarded as illegal and reprehensible, is punishable by criminal penalties.",
                "Moreover, the changes resulting from the 1968/1975 legislation relate essentially to procedural matters and to the range of sanctions, henceforth limited to Geldbussen. Whilst the latter penalty appears less burdensome in some respects than Geldstrafen, it has nonetheless retained a punitive character, which is the customary distinguishing feature of criminal penalties. The rule of law infringed by the applicant has, for its part, undergone no change of content. It is a rule that is directed, not towards a given group possessing a special status - in the manner, for example, of disciplinary law -, but towards all citizens in their capacity as road-users; it prescribes conduct of a certain kind and makes the resultant requirement subject to a sanction that is punitive. Indeed, the sanction - and this the Government did not contest - seeks to punish as well as to deter. It matters little whether the legal provision contravened by Mr. Öztürk is aimed at protecting the rights and interests of others or solely at meeting the demands of road traffic. These two ends are not mutually exclusive. Above all, the general character of the rule and the purpose of the penalty, being both deterrent and punitive, suffice to show that the offence in question was, in terms of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, criminal in nature.",

There is in fact nothing to suggest that the criminal offence referred to in the Convention necessarily implies a certain degree of seriousness. In this connection, a number of Contracting States still draw a distinction, as did the Federal Republic at the time when the Convention was opened for the signature of the Governments, between the most serious offences (crimes), lesser offences ( délits ) and petty offences (contraventions), whilst qualifying them all as criminal offences. Furthermore, it would be contrary to the object and purpose of Article 6 (art. 6), which guarantees to \"everyone charged with a criminal offence\" the right to a court and to a fair trial, if the State were allowed to remove from the scope of this Article (art. 6) a whole category of offences merely on the ground of regarding them as petty. Nor does the Federal Republic deprive the presumed perpetrators of Ordnungswidrigkeiten of this right since it grants them the faculty - of which the applicant availed himself - of appealing to a court against the administrative decision."

On this point, the Court would simply refer back to its well-established case-law holding that \"charge\", for the purposes of Article 6 (art. 6), may in general be defined as \"the official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence\", although \"it may in some instances take the form of other measures which carry the implication of such an allegation and which likewise substantially affect the situation of the suspect\" (see, as the most recent authorities, the Foti and others judgment of 10 December 1982, Series A no. 56, p. 18, § 52, and the Corigliano judgment of the same date, Series A no. 57, p. 13, § 34).

Moreover, defamatory libel may not only constitute an offence under the criminal law, but may also give rise to a civil claim for damages, which may include punitive damages. Furthermore, the non-criminal nature of breaches of privilege was illustrated by the fact that the Ordinance treats perjury before the House as equivalent to perjury before a court in civil and not in criminal matters.",

In the Court ’ s view, the proceedings taken against him in the present case for an act of this sort done outside the House are to be distinguished from other types of breach of privilege proceedings which may be said to be disciplinary in nature in that they relate to the internal regulation and orderly functioning of the House. Section 11(1)(k) potentially affects the whole population since it applies whether the alleged offender is a Member of the House or not and irrespective of where in Malta the publication of the defamatory libel takes place. For the offence thereby defined the Ordinance provides for the imposition of a penal sanction and not a civil claim for damages. From this point of view, therefore, the particular breach of privilege in question is akin to a criminal offence under the Press Act 1974 (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Weber judgment, Series A no. 177, p. 18 para. 33 in fine)."

Their effect was to postpone the appellant's release on licence. The awards clearly had a practical effect so far as the appellants were concerned and that practical effect was to postpone their release. But there was no question of their sentence being increased as a matter of law.

They are not adversarial and the nature of the decision is an administrative public law decision rather than one which resolves a dispute between two parties.

It is therefore important that governors do not impose punishments which are disproportionate to what is necessary, taking account of all the circumstances of the case, to achieve their aim, namely to act as a deterrent to that prisoner and others in order to ensure good order and discipline in the prison. Considerations such as the nature of the conduct involved, the impact on any victim of the conduct, the impact on the running of the prison of the conduct, the likely impact of the punishment on the prisoner, the age of the prisoner, the length of time remaining to the prisoner's release and the length of the prisoner's sentence may all be material to the proportionality of the punishment. ...",

To hold otherwise would result in wholly unnecessary delays in many cases, to the detriment of all concerned including the prisoner charged, and to a wholly unnecessary waste of time and money, contrary to public interest.

The sanction of the loss of early release was not only a necessary and effective incentive, but it was a common sanction of prison disciplinary regimes in many Council of Europe member States.

As to the changes to the prison disciplinary regime of England and Wales introduced since the Chamber's judgment, the Government argued that the Grand Chamber's judgment should not depend on whether or not England and Wales had found an adequate disciplinary response to the Chamber's judgment. In any event, they maintained their position that the imposition of additional days was an essential part of the maintenance of discipline in prisons and of the authority of the prison management. The new procedure was not as effective as the old and was regarded as “second best”. The Government provided the following reasons.",
                "In the first place, the new system involved greater delays. A governor had to examine a disciplinary charge the day after it had been laid whereas an adjudicator was required to examine a charge not later than 28 days after it had been laid. Adjournments before a governor delayed matters a number of days but those before an adjudicator involved delays of weeks, a factor compounded by the requirement for legal representation. Adjudicators had already complained to the Government that the system was unwieldy and that adjournments were frequently sought. Such delays undermined the faith in the system of victims of offending behaviour and weakened the deterrent value of the system. Delay also meant that in the days running up to early release a prisoner could regard him or herself as immune from an adjudicator's award of additional days, leading to a difference in treatment between those at the earlier and later stages of their sentences.",
                "Secondly, the system was administratively more cumbersome in that it required notification of the Lord Chancellor's Department of the need for an adjudicator and that department's identification of an adjudicator free to hear the case. Suitable facilities in prison were required for the hearing, the judge and the solicitors, and additional escorting requirements took prison officers away from their normal duties.",
                "Thirdly, the added administrative costs to the Prison Service of the new system directed funds away from other more pressing concerns. Since the number of cases to be referred to adjudicators had therefore to be significantly reduced, the new system had effectively removed the availability in many cases of the penalty of additional days.",
                "Fourthly, the added costs and reduced effectiveness of the new prison disciplinary system would increase the incentive to revert to a completely discretionary based remission system, the revocation of which had led to the Chamber's conclusion as to the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention. The Government maintained that the Chamber's judgment effectively penalised a State for structuring its remission system with a view to enhancing its incentive objective, thus undermining the legitimate policy objectives of an effective prison disciplinary system. In this connection, the Government argued that the Chamber's approach placed too much emphasis on how the State organised its disciplinary and remission systems, so that a State could avoid the application of Article 6 by cleverly reorganising those systems, a result which would be contrary to the autonomous requirements of Article 6, which are meant to have a uniform application throughout the States. The best approach would be to recognise that both discretionary and structured systems of remission and awards of additional days had the same effect in substance upon a prisoner and then to apply a common approach to all in assessing the width of the disciplinary sphere in a prison context."

It is well aware that in the prison context there are practical reasons and reasons of policy for establishing a special disciplinary regime, for example security considerations and the interests of public order, the need to deal with misconduct by inmates as expeditiously as possible, the availability of tailor-made sanctions which may not be at the disposal of the ordinary courts and the desire of the prison authorities to retain ultimate responsibility for discipline within their establishments.",

In the first place, the Court notes that the Government's central submission was that the necessity of maintaining an effective prison disciplinary regime had to weigh heavily in determining where the dividing line between the criminal and disciplinary lay. As in Campbell and Fell, the Court does not question the importance of preserving an effective system of order and control in prison. However, it does not find compelling the Government's argument that the loss by the governor of the power to award “additional days” would undermine the prison disciplinary regime in England and Wales.",

The Court considers that it has not been convincingly explained why these other sanctions would not have an impact comparable to awards of additional days in maintaining the effectiveness of the prison disciplinary system, including the authority of the prison management. In this regard, the Government did not address how a sanction with immediate application would be less effective than an award of additional days, which is not served until a prisoner's early release date (set pursuant to section 33 of the 1991 Act) and which in many cases will be therefore served some time, even years, after the adjudication hearing. Further, the Court does not consider that the Government have convincingly demonstrated significant material differences between the disciplinary needs in Scottish prisons, where use of additional days was suspended almost two years ago, and those needs in prisons in England and Wales.",
                "A new disciplinary system has been in place in prisons in England and Wales since August 2002: it retains the sanction of additional days but vests the power to make such awards in adjudicators. The fact that the Government responded to the Chamber's judgment by making certain domestic changes cannot be determinative of the contested issue of applicability still before this Court.",
                "The Government have argued, as a practical consideration against interpreting Article 6 so as to make its guarantees applicable to cases such as the present ones, that the new system is less effective than the former system, and, in particular, that it has given rise to additional administrative and financial burdens, as well as to delay in adjudication (see paragraph 79 above). In Campbell and Fell ( p. 35, § 69 – and see paragraph 83 above), the Court accepted that there might be practical reasons and reasons of policy for establishing a special prison disciplinary system, but emphasised that, in appropriate cases, there was no warrant for depriving prisoners of the safeguards of Article 6 of the Convention.

In this latter respect, the applicants reminded the Court that the offences with which they were charged were of a general character; the elements of the offences were precisely the same as those of the equivalent criminal offences; the conduct alleged could have been the subject of criminal prosecution outside the prison; the proceedings were adversarial in character; the burden and standard of proof adopted in disciplinary proceedings were the same as in a criminal court; and the penalties imposed were both punitive and preventative in nature, purpose and effect.",

Thirdly, while the Government accepted that it was relevant to consider whether the offence gave rise, at least in theory, to concurrent disciplinary and criminal liability, they pointed out that it was inevitable that there would be an overlap between offences forming part of prison disciplinary and criminal regimes, given that the objective of both was to seek to maintain reasonable and acceptable standards of behaviour. Accordingly, such an overlap was just one factor to be taken into account in the overall assessment of the nature of the charge, but such an overlap should not obscure the fact that the offences under a prison disciplinary code generally had a predominantly disciplinary character. The Chamber accorded, in the Government's opinion, far too much weight to this concurrent liability issue. In Engel itself, although the offences were considered “mixed”, the Court held that the State was in principle entitled to employ the disciplinary rather than the criminal law as the impugned acts were in contravention of “legal rule[s] governing the operation of the armed forces” ( see Engel and Others, pp. 34-35, § 82)."

Fourthly, the Government accepted that the Court's case-law provided that a charge's punitive purpose was indicative of its criminal nature and that the purpose of disciplinary sanctions under the Prison Rules was to some extent punitive. However, that was not their primary purpose. Maintaining a defined set of offences against discipline with the imposition (and, as appropriate, remitting) of sanctions was but an aspect of the successful operation of the early release system: the possibility of early release gave prisoners an incentive to behave well, but it was correspondingly necessary that a prisoner should lose early release for bad behaviour. The primary purpose of the prison disciplinary system was therefore “preventative”. Indeed, the predominant significance of the applicants'conduct was that it had a tendency to undermine the good management of the prison and the authority of prison officers. There was “no real prospect” that the first applicant would have carried out the threat against the probation officer and the assault of which the second applicant was found guilty was minor. However, it would have been inimical to the maintenance of good order in prison if they had been allowed to carry out such acts with impunity and had these acts gone unpunished."

It is also true that the extreme gravity of the offence may be indicative of its criminal nature, as indicated in Campbell and Fell (see paragraph 101 above). However, that does not conversely mean that the minor nature of an offence can, of itself, take it outside the ambit of Article 6, as there is nothing in the Convention to suggest that the criminal nature of an offence, within the meaning of the second of the Engel criteria, necessarily requires a certain degree of seriousness ( see Öztürk, cited above, pp. 20-21, § 53).

                "The Chamber found in this connection that remission of part of a prisoner's sentence was initially considered in domestic law to be a privilege which could be granted and taken away at the discretion of the authorities, and to which the prisoner had no legal entitlement. However, prior to the 1991 Act, the domestic courts had already come to reject the notion that remission was a privilege and that prisoners who had lost remission had not lost anything to which they were entitled. The courts considered that, if remission was not a legal “right”, prisoners had at least a legitimate expectation of release on the expiry of the relevant period (see paragraph 42 above). In Campbell and Fell ( pp. 37-38, § 72), the Court accepted that the practice of granting remission, as it existed at that time, was such that it created in the prisoner a legitimate expectation that he or she would recover his or her liberty before the end of the term of imprisonment and that forfeiture of remission had the effect of causing the detention to continue beyond the period corresponding to that expectation. The Court found support for that view in the judgment of Lord Justice Waller in R. v. Hull Prison Board of Visitors, ex parte St Germain and Others (cited above).",

The Court therefore considers, as did the Chamber, that the effect of the 1991 Act was to introduce more transparency into what was already inherent in the system of grants of remission. While it abandoned the term “loss of remission” in favour of “ awards of additional days”, the 1991 Act embodied in law what had already been the reality in practice. Accordingly, any right to release did not arise until the expiry of any additional days awarded under section 42 of the 1991 Act. The legal basis for detention during those additional days continued therefore to be the original conviction and sentence."

As noted by Lord Chief Justice Woolf in R. v. the Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Carroll, Al-Hasan and Greenfield (see paragraph 52 above), the award of additional days did not increase a prisoner's sentence as a matter of domestic law. The applicants'custody during the additional days awarded was thus clearly lawful under domestic law. Nevertheless, the Court does not consider that this goes to the heart of the question of the precise nature of the penalty of additional days. As recently demonstrated by the Court in Stafford v. the United Kingdom ( [GC], no. 46295/99, §§ 64 and 79, ECHR 2002 - IV), the Court's case-law indicates that it may be necessary to look beyond the appearances and the language used and concentrate on the realities of the situation. The reality of awards of additional days was that prisoners were detained in prison beyond the date on which they would otherwise have been released, as a consequence of separate disciplinary proceedings which were legally unconnected to the original conviction and sentence."

The second applicant was awarded 7 additional days'detention and this was to be his thirty-seventh offence against discipline. The awards of 40 and 7 additional days constituted the equivalent, in duration, of sentences handed down by a domestic court of approximately 11 and 2 weeks'imprisonment, respectively, given the provisions of section 33(1) of the 1991 Act (see paragraph 48 above).",

Such a situation seriously affects the confidence which the courts must inspire in a democratic society (see, mutatis mutandis, Sramek v. Austria, judgment of 22 October 1984, Series A no. 84, p. 20, § 42).

Whilst impartiality normally denotes absence of prejudice or bias, its existence or otherwise can, notably under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, be tested in various ways. A distinction can be drawn in this context between a subjective approach, that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction of a given judge in a given case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether he offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect.",
                "(a) As regards the first approach, the Court notes that the applicant is pleased to pay tribute to Mr. Van de Walle ’ s personal impartiality; it does not itself have any cause for doubt on this score and indeed personal impartiality is to be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 25, § 58).",
                "However, it is not possible to confine oneself to a purely subjective test. In this area, even appearances may be of a certain importance (see the Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, p. 17, § 31). As the Belgian Court of Cassation observed in its judgment of 21 February 1979 (see paragraph 17 above), any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts must inspire in the public in a democratic society.",
                "(b) It would be going too far to the opposite extreme to maintain that former judicial officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department were unable to sit on the bench in every case that had been examined initially by that department, even though they had never had to deal with the case themselves. So radical a solution, based on an inflexible and formalistic conception of the unity and indivisibility of the public prosecutor ’ s department, would erect a virtually impenetrable barrier between that department and the bench. It would lead to an upheaval in the judicial system of several Contracting States where transfers from one of those offices to the other are a frequent occurrence. Above all, the mere fact that a judge was once a member of the public prosecutor ’ s department is not a reason for fearing that he lacks impartiality; the Court concurs with the Government on this point.",
                "(c) The Belgian Court of Cassation, which took Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) into consideration of its own motion, adopted in this case a criterion based on the functions exercised, namely whether the judge had previously intervened \"in the case in or on the occasion of the exercise of ... functions as a judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department\". It dismissed Mr. Piersack ’ s appeal on points of law because the documents before it did not, in its view, show that there had been any such intervention on the part of Mr. Van de Walle in the capacity of senior deputy to the Brussels procureur du Roi, even in some form other than the adoption of a personal standpoint or the taking of a specific step in the process of prosecution or investigation (see paragraph 17 above).",
                "(d) Even when clarified in the manner just mentioned, a criterion of this kind does not fully meet the requirements of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). In order that the courts may inspire in the public the confidence which is indispensable, account must also be taken of questions of internal organisation. If an individual, after holding in the public prosecutor ’ s department an office whose nature is such that he may have to deal with a given matter in the course of his duties, subsequently sits in the same case as a judge, the public are entitled to fear that he does not offer sufficient guarantees of impartiality."

Van de Walle\" appearing in manuscript on the covering note of 4 February 1977 (see paragraph 10 above) showed that Mr. Van de Walle, and not some other judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department, had been dealing with the matter at the relevant time and had, accordingly, taken some part or other in the investigation of the case.

            [
                "16. In his submissions, Mr. Velu, an avocat général, retraced developments in the relevant Belgian legislation and judicial decisions, distinguishing between three periods:",
                "(a) Before 1955, although there were no written rules on the subject, the Court of Cassation had delivered eight judgments in which it had been held that a judicial officer who had acted as public prosecutor in criminal proceedings could not thereafter sit in the case as a judge and, in particular, on the assize court bench. The Court of Cassation founded this prohibition on a general and absolute principle that was said to derive from the very nature of the functions. The avocat général summarised the judgments as follows:",
                "\"It is of little moment - that the judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department intervened in the case only occasionally or by chance...;",
                "- that his intervention did not implicate one or more of the accused by name;",
                "- that his intervention did not involve a formal step in the process of investigation.",
                "It suffices that the judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department personally played some part in the conduct of the prosecution in the case in question.",
                "There is incompatibility as soon as the judicial officer, during the course of the prosecution, has personally intervened in the case in the capacity of member of the public prosecutor ’ s department.\"",
                "(b) The second period (1955-1968), during which the Court of Cassation apparently did not have occasion to rule on the problem of incompatibility between the functions of public prosecutor and the functions of judge, was marked by two new factors: the incorporation of the Convention into the Belgian domestic legal system and the developments in domestic case-law with regard to the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court.",
                "The litigant ’ s right to \"an impartial tribunal\", within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, could imply either that a judge was simply obliged to withdraw if he were at all biased as regards the case or, alternatively, that he was under the more extensive duty of withdrawing whenever there was a legitimate reason to doubt whether he offered the requisite guarantees of impartiality. The avocat général rejected the first interpretation, which he described as \"restrictive\", in favour of the second, the \"extensive\", interpretation; he relied notably on Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ( account to be taken of the object and purpose) and on the Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970 (Series A no. 11, pp. 14-15, § 25 in fine). As regards the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court, he also referred to judgments of the Belgian Court of Cassation and the Belgian Conseil d ’ État. In addition, he cited the following passage from an inaugural address of 1 September 1970 to the Court of Cassation: \"any judge whose impartiality may legitimately give rise to doubts must refrain from taking part in the decision\".",
                "(c) The third period saw the entry into force of Articles 127 and 292 of the Judicial Code (see paragraph 22 below) and the application by the Court of Cassation of the second of these Articles to cases where a decision had been given by a judge who had previously acted as a member of the public prosecutor ’ s department. According to the avocat général, the five judgments that he listed followed the same approach as those delivered in the first period and established that:",
                "( i ) notwithstanding Article 292 of the Judicial Code, the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court had retained its full force;",
                "(ii) for the purposes of that Article, the expression \"dealing with a case in the exercise of the functions of public prosecutor\" signified intervening therein in the capacity of prosecuting party;",
                "(iii) there could not be said to have been such an intervention if, in the case concerned, a judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department had simply",
                "- appeared at a hearing at which the court did no more than adopt a purely procedural measure; or",
                "- taken some step which was manifestly without effect on the conduct of the prosecution.",
                "In the light of the foregoing, the avocat général concluded that the Court of Cassation should \"set aside the judgment under appeal ... whether on the sixth ground adduced by the appellant or on the ground, to be taken into consideration by the Court of its own motion, of violation either of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention ... or of the general principle of law whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court\".",
                "The avocat général stressed that the covering note of 4 February 1977 emanated from the investigating judge, the person who quite naturally was best informed not only as to the background to the case but also as to the identity of the judicial officer or officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department who were dealing with the prosecution. And Mr. Preuveneers had added to the covering note, in manuscript, the words \"for the attention of Mr. P. Van de Walle \", thereby indicating the specific addressee for whom the note was personally intended:",
                "\"If the investigating judge marked this covering note as being for Mr. P. Van de Walle ’ s attention, it is logical to suppose that he knew that that judicial officer had personally played some part or other in the conduct of the prosecution.",
                "What other reasonable explanation can be given for such a course of action ... which surely would not have been taken unless the two officers had been in contact regarding the investigation of the case?",
                "It is of little moment that other judicial officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department intervened in the case, for example to follow up the investigating judge ’ s covering note, or that Mr. Van de Walle intervened only by chance or occasionally, or that such intervention has not been shown to have implicated the appellant or a co-accused by name or ... to have involved a formal step in the process of investigation.",
                "Finally, there would be no reasonable explanation for the handwritten words ... if Mr. Van de Walle ’ s intervention in the case had until then been limited to steps that were purely routine or ... were manifestly without effect on the conduct of the prosecution.\"",
                "Even if the Court of Cassation were not to allow the appeal on the sixth ground, which was based on Article 127 of the Judicial Code, the circumstances described above were, in the opinion of the avocat général, Mr. Velu, sufficient to give rise to legitimate doubts as to whether the President of the Assize Court had offered the guarantees of impartiality required both by Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention and by the general principle whereby cases must be impartially examined by the court.",

                "The Court of Cassation also took into consideration of its own motion Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention and the general principle of law establishing the right to the impartiality of the court. It was true that both of these norms obliged a judge to refrain from taking part in the decision if there were a legitimate reason to doubt whether he offered the guarantees of impartiality to which every accused person was entitled. However, the Court held that the documents which it could take into account did not reveal that after the public prosecutor ’ s department had received the covering note mentioned in the ground of appeal, Mr. Van de Walle, who was then a senior deputy to the Brussels procureur du Roi, had taken any decision or intervened in any manner whatsoever in the conduct of the prosecution relating to the facts in question. Admittedly, for a judge ’ s impartiality to be regarded as compromised on account of his previous intervention in the capacity of judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department, it was not essential that such intervention should have consisted of adopting a personal standpoint in the matter or taking a specific step in the process of prosecution or investigation. Nevertheless, it could not be assumed that a judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department had intervened in a case in or on the occasion of the exercise of his functions as such an officer merely because there was a covering note which had been addressed to him personally by the investigating judge but which had not been shown by any evidence to have been received by the officer or to have caused him to take even an indirect interest in the case. In this connection, the Court of Cassation noted finally that it was not the senior deputy Van de Walle who had replied to the covering note.",

As regards the covering note of 4 February 1977 (see paragraph 10 above), the investigating judge, Mr. Preuveneers, was said to have written thereon the words \"for the attention of Mr. P. Van de Walle\" solely because he knew that Mrs. del Carril was frequently on sick-leave.

Whilst impartiality normally denotes absence of prejudice or bias, its existence or otherwise can, notably under Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, be tested in various ways. A distinction can be drawn in this context between a subjective approach, that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction of a given judge in a given case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether he offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect.",
                "(a) As regards the first approach, the Court notes that the applicant is pleased to pay tribute to Mr. Van de Walle ’ s personal impartiality; it does not itself have any cause for doubt on this score and indeed personal impartiality is to be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 25, § 58).",
                "However, it is not possible to confine oneself to a purely subjective test. In this area, even appearances may be of a certain importance (see the Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, p. 17, § 31). As the Belgian Court of Cassation observed in its judgment of 21 February 1979 (see paragraph 17 above), any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts must inspire in the public in a democratic society.",
                "(b) It would be going too far to the opposite extreme to maintain that former judicial officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department were unable to sit on the bench in every case that had been examined initially by that department, even though they had never had to deal with the case themselves. So radical a solution, based on an inflexible and formalistic conception of the unity and indivisibility of the public prosecutor ’ s department, would erect a virtually impenetrable barrier between that department and the bench. It would lead to an upheaval in the judicial system of several Contracting States where transfers from one of those offices to the other are a frequent occurrence. Above all, the mere fact that a judge was once a member of the public prosecutor ’ s department is not a reason for fearing that he lacks impartiality; the Court concurs with the Government on this point.",
                "(c) The Belgian Court of Cassation, which took Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) into consideration of its own motion, adopted in this case a criterion based on the functions exercised, namely whether the judge had previously intervened \"in the case in or on the occasion of the exercise of ... functions as a judicial officer in the public prosecutor ’ s department\". It dismissed Mr. Piersack ’ s appeal on points of law because the documents before it did not, in its view, show that there had been any such intervention on the part of Mr. Van de Walle in the capacity of senior deputy to the Brussels procureur du Roi, even in some form other than the adoption of a personal standpoint or the taking of a specific step in the process of prosecution or investigation (see paragraph 17 above).",
                "(d) Even when clarified in the manner just mentioned, a criterion of this kind does not fully meet the requirements of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1). In order that the courts may inspire in the public the confidence which is indispensable, account must also be taken of questions of internal organisation. If an individual, after holding in the public prosecutor ’ s department an office whose nature is such that he may have to deal with a given matter in the course of his duties, subsequently sits in the same case as a judge, the public are entitled to fear that he does not offer sufficient guarantees of impartiality."

In that capacity, he enjoyed during the hearings and the deliberations extensive powers to which, moreover, he was led to have recourse, for example the discretionary power conferred by Article 268 of the Judicial Code and the power of deciding, with the other judges, on the guilt of the accused should the jury arrive at a verdict of guilty by no more than a simple majority (see paragraphs 13-14 and 20-21 above).",

Nonetheless, it is not in itself decisive and there are various other factors telling in favour of the opposite conclusion.",
                "To begin with, a close examination of the statutory texts shows the distinction between judicial officers in the public prosecutor ’ s department and investigating judges to be less clear-cut than initially appears. An investigating judge, like\" procureurs du Roi and their deputies\", has the status of officer of the criminal investigation police and, as such, is \"placed under the supervision of the procureur général \"; furthermore, \"an investigating judge\" may, in cases \"where the suspected offender is deemed to have been caught in the act\", \"take directly\" and in person \"any action which the procureur du Roi is empowered to take\" (see paragraph 15, second sub-paragraph, above).",
                "In addition to this, as an investigating judge he has very wide-ranging powers: he can \"take any steps which are not forbidden by law or incompatible with the standing of his office\" (see paragraph 17 above). Save as regards the warrant of arrest issued against the applicant on 5 April 1977, the Court has only limited information as to the measures taken by Mr. Pilate in the circumstances, but, to judge by the complexity of the case and the duration of the preparatory investigation, they must have been quite extensive (see paragraphs 8 and 12 above).",
                "That is not all. Under Belgian law the preparatory investigation, which is inquisitorial in nature, is secret and is not conducted in the presence of both parties; in this respect it differs from the procedure of investigation followed at the hearing before the trial court, which, in the instant case, took place on 8 and 22 June 1979 before the Oudenaarde court (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above). One can accordingly understand that an accused might feel some unease should he see on the bench of the court called upon to determine the charge against him the judge who had ordered him to be placed in detention on remand and who had interrogated him on numerous occasions during the preparatory investigation, albeit with questions dictated by a concern to ascertain the truth.",
                "Furthermore, through the various means of inquiry which he will have utilised at the investigation stage, the judge in question, unlike his colleagues, will already have acquired well before the hearing a particularly detailed knowledge of the - sometimes voluminous - file or files which he has assembled. Consequently, it is quite conceivable that he might, in the eyes of the accused, appear, firstly, to be in a position enabling him to play a crucial role in the trial court and, secondly, even to have a pre-formed opinion which is liable to weigh heavily in the balance at the moment of the decision. In addition, the criminal court (tribunal correctionnel ) may, like the court of appeal (see paragraph 19 in fine above), have to review the lawfulness of measures taken or ordered by the investigating judge. The accused may view with some alarm the prospect of the investigating judge being actively involved in this process of review.",
                "Finally, the Court notes that a judicial officer who has \"acted in the case as investigating judge\" may not, under the terms of Article 127 of the Judicial Code, preside over or participate as judge in proceedings before an assize court; nor, as the Court of Cassation has held, may he sit as an appeal-court judge (see paragraph 19 above).

Even in instances where Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is applicable, conferring powers in this manner does not in itself infringe the Convention.... Nonetheless, in such circumstances the Convention calls at least for one of the two following systems: either the jurisdictional organs themselves comply with the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), or they do not so comply but are subject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction\" - that is to say, which has the competence to furnish \"a [judicial] determination ... of the matters in dispute, both for questions of fact and for questions of law\" - \"and does provide the guarantees of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\" (Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29)",
                "In the Government ’ s submission, the principles thus stated apply equally to \"criminal charges\" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). As confirmation of this, the Government cited the Oztürk judgment of 21 February 1984 (Series A no. 73, pp. 21-22, para. 56) in addition to the above-mentioned judgments of 23 June 1981 and 10 February 1983 (Series A no. 43, pp. 23-24, para. 53, and Series A no. 58, pp. 16-17, para. 30).",
                "In the particular circumstances, the Government noted, Mr. De Cubber ’ s complaint was directed solely against the Oudenaarde court; he had no objection to make concerning the Ghent Court of Appeal, which in the present case, so they argued, constituted the \"judicial body that has full jurisdiction\", as referred to in the above-quoted case-law.",
                "On the whole of this issue, the Government cited the Blaise judgment of 4 April 1984, which the Belgian Court of Cassation had delivered in a similar case, and the concordant submissions of the public prosecutor ’ s department in that case (see paragraph 20 above)."

                "The thrust of the plea summarised above is that the proceedings before the Oudenaarde court fell outside the ambit of 1Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). At first sight, this plea contains an element of paradox. Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) concerns primarily courts of first instance; it does not require the existence of courts of further instance. It is true that its fundamental guarantees, including impartiality, must also be provided by any courts of appeal or courts of cassation which a Contracting State may have chosen to set up (see the above-mentioned Delcourt judgment, Series A no. 11, p. 14 in fine, and, as the most recent authority, the Sutter judgment of 22 February 1984, Series A no. 74, p. 13, para. 28). However, even when this is the case it does not follow that the lower courts do not have to provide the required guarantees. Such a result would be at variance with the intention underlying the creation of several levels of courts, namely to reinforce the protection afforded to litigants.",
                "Furthermore, the case-law relied on by the Government has to be viewed in its proper context. The judgments of 23 June 1981, 10 February 1983 and 21 February 1984 concerned litigation which was classified by the domestic law of the respondent State not as civil or criminal but as disciplinary (Series A no. 43, p. 9, para. 11) or administrative (Series A no. 73, pp. 10-14, paras. 17-33); these judgments related to bodies which, within the national system, were not regarded as courts of the classic kind, for the reason that they were not integrated within the standard judicial machinery of the country. The Court would not have held Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) applicable had it not been for the \"autonomy\" of the concepts of \"civil rights and obligations\" and \"criminal charge\". In the present case, on the other hand, what was involved was a trial which not only the Convention but also Belgian law classified as criminal; the Oudenaarde criminal court was neither an administrative or professional authority, nor a jurisdictional organ of a professional association (see the above-mentioned judgments, Series A no. 43, p. 23, para. 51, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29, and Series A no. 73, pp. 21-22, para. 56), but a proper court in both the formal and the substantive meaning of the term (Decisions and Reports, no. 15, p. 78, paras. 59-60, and p. 87: opinion of the Commission and decision of the Committee of Ministers on application no. 7360/76, Zand v. Austria). The reasoning adopted in the three above-mentioned judgments, to which should be added the Campbell and Fell judgment of 28 June 1984 (Series A no. 80, pp. 34-39, paras. 67-73 and 76), cannot justify reducing the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) in its traditional and natural sphere of application. A restrictive interpretation of this kind would not be consonant with the object and purpose of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see paragraph 30 in fine above)."

                "33. At the hearings, the Commission ’ s Delegate and the applicant ’ s lawyer raised a further question, concerning not the applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) but rather its application to the particular facts: had not \"the subsequent intervention\" of the Ghent Court of Appeal \"made good the wrong\" or \"purged\" the first-instance proceedings of the \"defect\" that vitiated them?",
                "The Court considers it appropriate to answer this point although the Government themselves did not raise the issue in such terms.",
                "The possibility certainly exists that a higher or the highest court might, in some circumstances, make reparation for an initial violation of one of the Convention ’ s provisions: this is precisely the reason for the existence of the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, contained in Article 26 (art. 26) (see the Guzzardi and the Van Oosterwijck judgments of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 27, para. 72, and Series A no. 40, p. 17, para. 34). Thus, the Adolf judgment of 26 March 1982 noted that the Austrian Supreme Court had \"cleared ... of any finding of guilt\" an applicant in respect of whom a District Court had not respected the principle of presumption of innocence laid down by Article 6 para. 2 (art. 6-2) (Series A no. 49, pp. 17-19, paras. 38-41).",
                "The circumstances of the present case, however, were different. The particular defect in question did not bear solely upon the conduct of the first-instance proceedings: its source being the very composition of the Oudenaarde criminal court, the defect involved matters of internal organisation and the Court of Appeal did not cure that defect since it did not quash on that ground the judgment of 29 June 1979 in its entirety.",

            ],
            [
                "34. In the further alternative, the Government pleaded that a finding by the Court of a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) would entail serious consequences for Belgian courts with \"limited staff\", especially if it were to give a judgment \"on the general question of principle\" rather than a judgment \"with reasoning limited to the very special\" facts of the case. In this connection, the Government drew attention to the following matters. From 1970 to 1984, the workload of such courts had more than doubled, whereas there had been no increase in the number of judges. At Oudenaarde and at Nivelles, for example, taking account of vacant posts (deaths, resignations, promotions) and occasional absences (holidays, illness, etc.), there were only six or seven judges permanently in attendance, all of whom were \"very busy\", if not overwhelmed with work. Accordingly, it was virtually inevitable that one of the judges had to deal in turn with different aspects of the same case. To avoid this, it would be necessary either to constitute \"special benches\" - which would be liable to occasion delays incompatible with the principle of trial \"within a reasonable time\" - or to create additional posts, an alternative that was scarcely realistic in times of budgetary stringency."

The Court recalls that the Contracting States are under the obligation to organise their legal systems \"so as to ensure compliance with the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)\" (see the Guincho judgment of 10 July 1984, Series A no. 81, p. 16, para. 38); impartiality is unquestionably one of the foremost of those requirements. The Court ’ s task is to determine whether the Contracting States have achieved the result called for by the Convention, not to indicate the particular means to be utilised."

It stands side by side with the requirement that the rules of substantive criminal law must likewise be established by law and is enshrined in the maxim “ nullum judicium sine lege ”. It imposes certain specific requirements regarding the conduct of proceedings, with a view to guaranteeing a fair trial, which entails respect for equality of arms. The principle of equality of arms requires that each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent (see, among other authorities, the De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 238, § 53). The Court further observes that the primary purpose of procedural rules is to protect the defendant against any abuse of authority and it is therefore the defence which is the most likely to suffer from omissions and lack of clarity in such rules."

Did you have instructions to do that? Did you inform yourself about the possibility of a call for tenders for the creation of such a data bank?",

I was determined to get things moving and the opinion of the Treasury inspector, L. in this case, concentrated very much on the regulations and was little concerned with financial viability. In substance, I was irked by the inflexibility and resistance to change of the Treasury inspectorate. In my private office I was advised to do things differently, namely to split the contract into three parts so that the fees would be lower than the BEF 1,250,000 threshold triggering compulsory scrutiny by the Treasury inspector. I must emphasise that, despite doing things that way, I once again submitted the subdivided project to the Treasury inspector, but the second time he gave a favourable opinion.",

Each of these contracts concerns a preliminary study to be carried out among small and medium-sized businesses in the Brussels area to determine which of them would be interested in appearing in a data bank as described in the initial project. Each of these contracts concerns one of the three above-mentioned criteria. They represent a total cost for the preliminary study of BEF 3,600,000 net of VAT, as compared with the initial project, which would have cost BEF 4,800,000 net of VAT. Did not that reduction result from the need to split the initial project into three, since there were three criteria, while at the same time making sure that none of the three contracts exceeded BEF 1,250,000 net of VAT, the threshold for intervention by the Treasury inspector?",
                "A I wish to make it clear that I once again requested the opinion of the Treasury inspectorate even though in each case the fee was below the BEF 1,250,000 threshold. I would also point out that splitting the project into three led to a significant reduction in cost amounting to 25% of the overall fees.",
                "Q Does the fact that Mr Javeau agreed to do the same work for BEF 3,600,000 not show that the initial contract accepted by the private office and the administration was overpriced?",
                "A Your point about the initial price is not wrong, but the agreement on BEF 3,600,000 was probably the result of a tripartite or quadripartite agreement between the private office, the administration, the Treasury inspectorate and “I”. That is a guess, because I can't remember the precise details of that transaction now.",
                "Q Here is the commitment slip for one of the contracts signed with “I” on 15 June 1989. This document bears the signature of Treasury inspector L., dated 30 June 1989, authorising the expenditure. Could Mr L. have opposed implementation of the contract, his opinion not having been sought, it would appear, before it was signed?",
                "A I would observe on this point that I was not obliged to submit the file to Mr L. in view of the size of the fee. But as I was working more with the administration than with the private office, the administration automatically sent the ad hoc expenditure commitment slip to the Treasury inspector for authorisation. In my opinion, Mr L. must have received the contract before it was signed.",
                "Q When these three contracts were received the administration gave them only one commitment number, which was the number of one of them (see appendices 130 and 131 of the same report). Here is another series of documents which indicate that the administrative authorities wrongly thought they were dealing with a single contract, so much so that when “I” sent them three invoices for part-payment of each of the three contracts Mr P. informed Mr Javeau that he thought “I” must have made a mistake. In fact, he requested three original copies of what he believed to be a single invoice and these copies could not bear three different numbers (see appendices 130 to 136 of the same report). So Mr L. could only have authorised expenditure in respect of one commitment slip relating to a single contract?",
                "A Yes, that's true. But it's not my fault. The paperwork was entirely a matter for the administration.",
                "Q As regards approval of expenditure by the Treasury inspectorate in respect of contracts where the fee was lower than its intervention threshold, was it still possible for the inspector to give his views on the advisability of proceeding?",
                "A It is true that from the administrative-law point of view his approval does not seem to be required for the commitment of such sums. However, as far as I am concerned, and in view of my lack of technical experience of budgetary matters, I preferred on all occasions to seek the approval of the Treasury inspector, seeing that for me this represented a guarantee of lawfulness from the Minister's budgetary adviser. Therefore, if Mr L. had formally refused to sign the commitment slip, I would not have gone ahead. You tell me that there is a contradiction between what I am telling you and the splitting of the original project refused by Mr L. My reply is that I was advised to do things that way and that I made sure that Mr L. approved the three new contracts.",

In respect of the offences committed after that date the first three-year time-limit, expiring on 1 January 1991, began to run.

This involved public authorities entering into contracts for the provision of over-priced services so that the provider of the services could transfer a portion of the sums paid to third parties in order to cover the costs of the activities in question. The practices concerned consisted in negotiating and signing contracts for various opinion polls or surveys to be conducted mainly by “I” for the “benefit” of government ministries. The prices stipulated in these contracts were too high in relation to the real cost of the surveys carried out and their likely benefits. In addition, care had been taken to avoid the competitive procedure laid down for contracts entered into by the administrative authorities, which might have prevented “I” from winning some of these contracts, and internal checks carried out by the administrative authorities, mainly by Treasury inspectors, which might have revealed the fact that some of them were over-priced.

The Court of Cassation did not grant this request."

I confirm the statements I made at the time of that interview.",

It was that [amount] which caused the unfavourable opinion, and also in part the points of divergence between the opinions of the administration and the Treasury inspectorate.",

                "M. was also the Budget Minister. We wanted to launch a much more limited project and we did a preliminary study. I do not think the solution of splitting into three was adopted to evade Treasury scrutiny. If we had followed the administrative procedures the project would not have got off the ground. My job as head of the private office was to get things moving quickly. Although we did not follow the classic procedure, the project was nevertheless subjected to Treasury scrutiny.",

Whatever the amount committed, the Treasury inspectorate had the power to supervise and give an opinion. Even though the contract was limited from the financial point of view, everything was above board.",
                "You stated in substance (p. 9540) that you were irked by the inflexibility and resistance to change of the Treasury inspectorate and that in your private office you were advised to do things differently, namely to split the contract into three parts so that the fees would be lower than the BEF 1,250,000 threshold triggering compulsory scrutiny by the Treasury inspectors, and you went on to say that despite doing things that way you had once again submitted the subdivided project to the Treasury inspector, who the second time had given a favourable opinion, and that splitting the project into three had led to a significant reduction in cost amounting to 25% of the overall fees. Do you stand by that assessment of your conduct?",
                "Yes, because the Treasury inspection procedure took some time. We wanted to work quickly and we came back to another way of doing things, which nevertheless received the Treasury inspectorate's approval, but more quickly, even though supervision was maintained. I did not have much time and I had to find a solution by using a faster procedure, namely approval of the order to pay. I knew that I had to give an account of my actions to the Minister and I insisted that the Treasury inspector sign each file, as was done even where this was not mandatory.",

These offences formed part of a system run by Camille Javeau which placed the 'I' association at the point of contact between the financial interests of scientific research and the personal interests of its directors and third parties. By the admission of Camille Javeau, this system consisted in seeking to sign contracts with the public authorities for surveys to be carried out by the 'I' association or by the [...] Institute, each of these contracts being accompanied by advantages for politicians whose power of decision-making, influence or promising future were intended to ensure the effectiveness and continuity of the system.",

But side by side with this general interest there is another public interest which is no less respectable, that of the minister's complete freedom to manage public affairs at any particular time. The House of Representatives is the judge of this latter interest, to which the former, it would seem, must give way in certain circumstances. Let us assume that the Minister of Defence has committed an indictable offence: the country is in a critical situation and he alone can properly ensure its defence.

Any judicial authority had to be subject to procedures intended to guarantee the integrity of its decisions to the persons within its jurisdiction and to safeguard the right to due process, a principle which the House of Representatives had fully understood in 1865. The fact that there was no statute governing procedure had in the present case led the Court of Cassation to establish an ad hoc procedure, making up for Parliament's failure to legislate. By laying down the applicable procedural rules itself, even by analogy, the Court of Cassation had manifestly disregarded the principle of the separation of powers as regards enactment and application of the criminal law. Even though, by a process of elimination, the procedure followed by the Court of Cassation could not be anything other than the procedure laid down for the criminal courts, this was not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of an accessible and foreseeable procedure.",
                "According to Mr Coëme, this also constituted a breach of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, in so far as that provision laid down the principle “ nullum judicium sine lege ”."

The Government submitted that it could not be inferred that the procedure before the Court of Cassation was not laid down by domestic law merely because the procedure to be followed for the trial of ministers was laid down neither by the Constitution nor by any implementing legislation. The procedure to be followed was the procedure which existed for the ordinary criminal courts, and this was perfectly foreseeable in the light of the teachings of case-law and legal theory, and also on account of the fact that the other three types of procedure – those laid down for the assize courts, juvenile courts and military courts – were obviously not applicable. The Court of Cassation had therefore not acted as an ad hoc legislature, nor had it gone beyond the bounds of a reasonable interpretation of existing law by applying the procedure of the ordinary criminal courts, while introducing a number of modifications made necessary by the constitutional requirement that it had to sit as a full court."

Italy judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 15-16, § 33). According to the case-law, the object of the term “established by law” in Article 6 of the Convention is to ensure “that the judicial organisation in a democratic society [does] not depend on the discretion of the Executive, but that it [is] regulated by law emanating from Parliament” (see Zand v. Austria, application no. 7360/76, Commission's report of 12 October 1978, Decisions and Reports (DR) 15, pp. 70 and 80).

It must also satisfy a series of other conditions, including the independence of its members and the length of their terms of office, impartiality and the existence of procedural safeguards. There is no doubt that the Court of Cassation, which in Belgian law was the only court which had jurisdiction to try Mr Coëme, was a “tribunal established by law” (see, mutatis mutandis, Prosa and Others v.

The Court notes that no legislation implementing Article 103 of the Constitution was in force when the applicants stood trial in the Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 75, 80 and 81 above). Yet Article 103 § 2 required Parliament to lay down the procedure before the Court of Cassation, and Article 139 of the Constitution of 7 February 1831 insisted on the need to do so as soon as possible. However, assisted by his counsel and his lawyers, Mr Coëme was not in total ignorance of the procedural rules which would be applied during the trial. He could not have been unaware that the procedure of the ordinary criminal courts would probably be followed, as this could have been inferred from legal theory and case-law, although this was limited to the Court of Cassation's judgment of 12 July 1865 (see paragraph 79 above). He could also have deduced this from Article 7 of the Law of 19 June 1865, even though that law had been enacted only to deal with a specific set of circumstances. The Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation apparently reached that conclusion himself and advised the representatives of some of the applicants accordingly at the interview on 3 November 1995. When the trial opened on 5 February 1996 (see paragraph 41 above) the President of the Court of Cassation himself confirmed that the procedure of the ordinary criminal courts would be followed, announcing that the case would be tried in accordance with the provisions of Article 190 of the Code of Criminal Investigation."

As a result, the parties could not ascertain in advance all the details of the procedure which would be followed. They could not foresee in what way the Court of Cassation would amend or modify the provisions governing the normal conduct of a criminal trial, as established by the Belgian parliament.",

It imposes certain specific requirements regarding the conduct of proceedings, with a view to guaranteeing a fair trial, which entails respect for equality of arms. The principle of equality of arms requires that each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent (see, among other authorities, the De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 238, § 53).

The Court of Cassation's decision on an alleged connection, which was not sufficiently reasoned, had constituted treatment derogating from ordinary law and had infringed their defence rights by depriving them, without any reasonable justification, of a series of important safeguards which would have been available to any other defendant and from which Mr Coëme, who had been tried at the same time as them, had benefited in part when his case was investigated by the House of Representatives."

Mr Coëme and Mr Javeau were standing trial as co-principals or accomplices implicated in certain offences and the other applicants for various offences committed in connection with the activities of the “I” association. Even though the judicial authorities were not obliged to join the cases, joinder in the present case was either fully justified to avoid the risk of contradictory decisions or desirable for reasons of coherence, to save having more than one trial and in short to ensure the proper administration of justice. It was a perfectly reasonable and rational decision which provided the best means of assessing and focusing on the criminal conduct of the various accused, and the applicants could not complain that the Court of Cassation's jurisdiction to try them had not been laid down by law or that it was not foreseeable."

The Court reiterates that organisation of the judicial system and jurisdiction in criminal cases cannot be left to the discretion of the judicial authorities, and notes that it was Article 103 of the Constitution which, until the 1998 reform (see paragraphs 68 and 69 above), required government ministers, exceptionally, to be tried by the Court of Cassation. However, there was no provision extending the Court of Cassation's jurisdiction to defendants other than ministers for offences connected with those for which ministers were standing trial (see, for the same reasoning applied to the contrary case, Crociani and Others v. Italy, joined applications nos. 8603/79, 8722/79, 8723/99 and 8729/79, Commission decision of 18 December 1980, DR 22, pp. 147 and 219). The need for such a provision appears all the more clearly because the issue now seems to have been settled by Article 29 § 1 of the Special Law of 25 June 1998 on the criminal responsibility of ministers, which provides: “Co-principals and accomplices implicated in an offence for which a minister is prosecuted and the perpetrators of connected offences must be prosecuted and tried at the same time as the minister” (see paragraph 69 above).",

In the present case these indications cannot justify the conclusion that the rule on connection was “established by law”, especially since the Court of Cassation, the supreme Belgian judicial authority, itself decided, not having referred the question to the Administrative Jurisdiction and Procedure Court, that summoning persons who had never held ministerial office to stand trial before it was the result of applying Article 103 of the Constitution rather than the provisions of the Code of Criminal Investigation or the Judicial Code (see paragraph 47 above)."

The express purpose of that obligation was to preserve the Administrative Jurisdiction and Procedure Court 's monopoly over interpretation of the Constitution and to avoid any risk of arbitrary assessment in this respect by the court dealing with the case concerned. The arbitrariness of the refusal to submit the preliminary questions was also evident from the flagrant contradictions in the judgments of the Court of Cassation and the submissions of its Principal Public Prosecutor, on which the Court of Cassation had based its decision.

In the Belgian system, courts were required in particular to verify whether the alleged violation of Articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution was indeed the result of a legal rule which could be submitted to the scrutiny of the Administrative Jurisdiction and Procedure Court in accordance with the Special Law of 6 January 1989. The applicants' complaints concerned the way Article 26 § 2 of the Special Law on the Administrative Jurisdiction and Procedure Court should be interpreted.

Even though it had been challenged, the Court of Cassation's decision not to refer the preliminary questions proposed was reasonable and not in any way arbitrary, so that it could not be in breach of Article 6 of the Convention.

The Court observes, firstly, that the Convention does not guarantee, as such, any right to have a case referred by a domestic court to another national or international authority for a preliminary ruling. It further refers to its case-law to the effect that the “right to a court”, of which the right of access is one aspect, is not absolute; it is subject to limitations permitted by implication, in particular where the conditions of admissibility of an appeal are concerned, since by its very nature it calls for regulation by the State, which enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in this regard (see, among other authorities, the Brualla Gómez de la Torre v. Spain judgment of 19 December 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, p. 2955, § 33). The right to have a preliminary question referred to a court cannot be absolute either, even where a particular field of law may be interpreted only by a court designated by statute and where the legislation concerned requires other courts to refer to that court, without reservation, all questions relating to that field. As the Government submitted, it is in accordance with the functioning of such a mechanism for the court to verify whether it is empowered or required to refer a preliminary question, first satisfying itself that the question must be answered before it can determine the case before it. However, it is not completely impossible that, in certain circumstances, refusal by a domestic court trying a case at final instance might infringe the principle of fair trial, as set forth in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, in particular where such refusal appears arbitrary (see Dotta v.

They observed, firstly, that on 3 November 1995 the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had held a meeting at which he informed the participants that the proceedings would be conducted according to the ordinary rules of the Code of Criminal Investigation; this was confirmed at the first hearing held by the Court of Cassation. That meant that he had previously been at least informed of the Court of Cassation's decision as to the procedure to be followed. Secondly, referring to the role traditionally played by the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, which the Court had had occasion to assess when dealing with the Delcourt, Borgers, Vermeulen and Van Orshoven cases (see the judgments in the cases of Delcourt v. Belgium, 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11; Borgers v. Belgium, 30 October 1991, Series A no. 214-B; Vermeulen v. Belgium, 20 February 1996, Reports 1996-I; and Van Orshoven v.

The Government would find it hard to prove that any measures whatsoever had been taken to establish the necessary distance between the Court of Cassation and the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office there – the prosecution in the present case. They noted on the contrary that during the trial the representatives of the Principal Public Prosecutor had taken their places in the raised part of the courtroom on the same level as the judges and used to enter and leave the hearing room in the company of the judges of the Court of Cassation. They likewise considered it symptomatic that the names of the persons composing the Court of Cassation and the representatives of its Principal Public Prosecutor were listed in the same paragraph in the hearing records (see paragraph 52 above) and that the Court's judgment reproduced the prosecution pleadings practically word for word."

That practice had ceased on the very day of the Borgers judgment (in criminal cases) and the Vermeulen judgment (in civil cases). The Government noted, firstly, that the Court of Cassation had not yet been constituted on 3 November 1995; the nineteen judges (fifteen ordinary members and four substitutes) had not been appointed until a few weeks before the first hearing on 5 February 1996. It had therefore been materially impossible for the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office to be informed of the procedure chosen by a court not yet constituted. It was, however, obvious that the procedure mentioned by the Principal Public Prosecutor was the only one possible and foreseeable. The Government also observed that the two members of the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office had not sat on the same bench as the Court of Cassation itself but had a separate seat facing the seat of the two registrars and closer to the bar of the court than to the judges' bench. Moreover, throughout the trial and the judges' deliberations, these two officers of the court had avoided all contact with the court when not in hearings. Lastly, the Court of Cassation had on several occasions given a clear sign of its independence vis-à-vis the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office. In particular, on 12 February 1996, according to Mr Javeau and Mr Stalport themselves, it had asked the Principal Advocate-General to confine his remarks to the facts of the case and not make submissions for the prosecution (see paragraph 50 above) and it had not accepted the prosecution's suggestion that the defence case should be heard before the prosecution's (see paragraph 51 above).

As for impartiality within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, there are two tests for assessing whether a tribunal is impartial: the first consists in seeking to determine the personal conviction of a particular judge in a given case and the second in ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, the Gautrin and Others v. France judgment of 20 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, pp. 1030-31, § 58). Only the second test is relevant in the instant case. In this respect, however, even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public and above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused (see, among other authorities, the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 21, § 48, and the Pullar v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, p. 794, § 38). In deciding whether there is a legitimate reason to fear that a court lacks independence or impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important but not decisive.

It would appear in fact that this information was supplied at a time when the judges who would try the case had not yet been designated and had not yet had the opportunity to consider the question which arose in that respect on account of Parliament's failure to legislate.

Lastly, the Court of Cassation had expressly taken some of the statements he had made on 16 March 1994 to constitute a confession, ruling in particular, when dealing with the offence he had been charged with: “It is apparent from the statements of Jean-Louis Stalport ... that the purpose of severing the original contract was to evade the mandatory scrutiny of the Treasury inspector.” He observed that in the John Murray case (John Murray v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports 1996-I, p. 49, § 45), the Court had held: “The right to remain silent under police questioning and the privilege against self-incrimination are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6”."

Mr Stalport, whose conviction had not been based on his statements alone, had therefore not been prevented from exercising his right to remain silent, to defend himself effectively or to request additional investigative measures, which Mr Javeau had successfully done in the Court of Cassation. In the Government's opinion, the true purpose of the principle prohibiting self-incrimination was to prevent a participant in the judicial process being obliged to tell the truth under oath and on pain of a penalty if he lied, only to have his own declarations used against him later and to be accused of an offence."

It appears from the statements referred to by the Court of Cassation that it must have based this inference on Mr Javeau's remarks, as reported in the record of his interview on 8 June 1993 (see paragraph 21 above) not on a confession allegedly to be found in the record of the interview with Mr Stalport on 16 March 1994 (see paragraph 27 above). Mr Stalport had always asserted, both at that interview and when he was questioned on 20 February 1996 (see paragraph 52 above), that the purpose of the decision to sever the initial contract had not been to evade the scrutiny of the Treasury inspector.

Yet the Court of Cassation, sitting as the court of first and last instance, had not given judgment until six and a half years later. The applicant pointed out that the offences he stood accused of, which were known to the investigating judge from the outset, were so simple and lacking in complexity that the judgment of 5 April 1996 devoted only half a page to them. In addition, few of the documents in the investigation file concerned him. This applied in particular to the court expert's report, most of which related to facts which were not included in the charges against him. The alleged complexity of the prosecution was merely the result of the authorities' determination to establish the existence of a “system” in which all the defendants were involved. Application of the connection rule was justified by the requirements of the administration of justice only where the rights of the defence were respected. Yet he could have been tried separately on the charges against him as early as 1994, if not before, and this would not have prevented the prosecution from arguing that the offences he stood accused of formed part of a system."

The applicant's complaints were essentially directed against application of the connection rule, which had been reasonable in view of Mr Hermanus's close involvement in the criminal system that had been set up. The central role of the “I” association and Mr Javeau in the system for funding political activities necessarily required all the offences to be dealt with together and therefore all the accused who had been involved in them to be tried together.",

It reiterates that in criminal matters the “reasonable time” referred to in Article 6 § 1 begins to run as soon as a person is “charged”: this may occur on a date prior to the case coming before the trial court, such as the date of arrest, the date when the person concerned was officially notified that he was to be prosecuted or the date when the preliminary investigations were opened. The term “charge”, for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, may be defined as “the official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence”, a definition that also corresponds to the test whether the situation of the suspect has been “substantially affected” (see the Hozee v. the Netherlands judgment of 22 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1100, § 43, and the Eckle v.

That circumstance and the very nature of the charges made it necessary for the persons entrusted with the investigation of the case to undertake the long task of reconstructing the offences, gathering evidence and deciding, in respect of each of the persons apparently implicated, what offences they should be charged with. All this explains the size of the file, which Mr Mazy, Mr Stalport and Mr Javeau themselves mentioned in their written submissions to the Court. In addition, the case raised thorny legal questions which, before being posed to the applicants and then to the Court of Cassation, had to be answered by the Belgian judicial authorities.

By using their discretionary power in that way they indubitably took the risk of delaying committing Mr Hermanus for trial. However, the fact that the offences with which Mr Javeau and the other accused were charged had been brought to light by the same investigation and the interdependence of the charges, noted by the Court of Cassation in its judgment of 5 April 1996 (see paragraph 55 above), might reasonably be thought to exclude severing the charges against Mr Hermanus from the rest of the investigation."

But in its judgment of 5 April 1996 the Court of Cassation had ruled that time had begun to run again and extended a limitation period which had already lapsed, this being illegal given that an initial five-year period had begun to run on 30 November 1989 in Mr Coëme's case and on 29 February 1988 in Mr Hermanus's case. In addition, it had restarted the limitation period a second time, although this was not permissible under Article 22 of the Code of Criminal Investigation, taking into consideration the date of 10 June 1992. The applicants argued on that basis that the Court of Cassation had effectively applied Article 25 of the Law of 24 December 1993 retrospectively. That had breached Article 7 of the Convention, in that determination of the period during which an offence could be punished was certainly as much a part of the concept of “penalty” as the measure imposed pursuant to the law as a punishment.

Article 7 admittedly prohibited retrospectiveness, but that prohibition concerned only charges and penalties and was not therefore applicable to procedural rules, and in particular to limitation. Following the applicants' interpretation would create a serious obstacle making it difficult for States to introduce the necessary changes to criminal procedures and to take account of the courts' excessive caseloads. In the alternative, the Government submitted that, even if Article 7 had to be considered to apply also to limitation of criminal proceedings, its only scope would be to prevent limitation becoming an issue again once prosecution had become time-barred. It was only in such a case that there would be retrospectiveness, in that the new law would have to “go back in time” from the date of its entry into force in order to be able to annul a time-bar. But nothing like that had taken place in the present case. On 31 December 1993, when the new law had come into force, the proceedings had not yet become time-barred according to the rules formerly applicable and the Court of Cassation had applied from the time of the offences in issue the new limitation period laid down by the Law of 24 December 1993. The Government noted that limitation concerned not the offences but only prosecution. It was part of the procedural rules immediately affected by a new law in all proceedings then in progress."

The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, Article 7 embodies, inter alia, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused's detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts' interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable.",
                "When speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statute law as well as case-law and implies qualitative requirements, including those of accessibility and foreseeability (see the Cantoni v. France judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, p. 1627, § 29; and the S.W. and C.R. v. the United Kingdom judgments of 22 November 1995, Series A nos. 335-B and 335-C, pp. 41-42, § 35, and pp. 68-69, § 33, respectively). The Court must therefore verify that at the time when an accused person performed the act which led to his being prosecuted and convicted there was in force a legal provision which made that act punishable, and that the punishment imposed did not exceed the limits fixed by that provision (see Murphy v. the United Kingdom, application no. 4681/70, Commission decision of 3 and 4 October 1972, Collection 43, p. 1). Since the term “penalty” is autonomous in scope, to render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “penalty” within the meaning of this provision (see the Welch v. the United Kingdom judgment of 9 February 1995, Series A no. 307-A, p. 13, § 27). While the text of the Convention is the starting-point for such an assessment, the Court may have cause to base its findings on other sources, such as the travaux préparatoires. Having regard to the aim of the Convention, which is to protect rights that are practical and effective, it may also take into consideration the need to preserve a balance between the general interest and the fundamental rights of individuals and the notions currently prevailing in democratic States (see, among other authorities, the Airey v. Ireland judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, pp. 14-15, § 26, and the Guzzardi v. Italy judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, pp. 34-35, § 95)."

In Belgian law the classification of an offence is determined not according to the penalty applicable but according to the penalty actually applied. The date of the judgment must therefore be the standpoint for determining what period must elapse before prosecution becomes time-barred. That being so, the Court of Cassation had regard to the limitation period for less serious indictable offences. Subsequently, applying the provisions of the Law of 24 December 1993 immediately, and after noting that the offences found to have been made out were not time-barred on the date of its entry into force, it held that the correct limitation period was five years from the time of the offences, which period could be extended, where the case arose, by a new five-year period counting from a measure causing time to begin to run again lawfully taken before expiry of the first five-year period (see paragraph 57 above)."

At that time, Belgium was part of French territory. When it was separated from France and attached to Holland, the jury was abolished but assize courts continued to exist. When Belgium gained independence, the institution of the jury was enshrined in the Constitution of 7 February 1831, Article 98 of which provided : “The jury shall be constituted for all serious crimes and for political and press offences.” The institution was envisaged by the framers of the Constitution as the touchstone of the authenticity of any democratic demand. The jury was seen above all as a political affirmation of the freedom won by the people, the symbol of the people ’ s sovereignty. It was instituted by the decree of 19 July 1831; membership was initially based on function ( jury capacitaire ) and subsequently, from 1869, on property ( jury censitaire ). By virtue of a Law of 21 December 1930, a new reform made the composition of the jury more democratic and representative of all social classes, the result being the twelve-member lay jury that still exists today."

It found that the questions to the jury had been formulated in such a way that it could not be ascertained why each of them had been answered in the affirmative when the applicant had denied all personal involvement in the alleged offences. The Chamber considered that such laconic answers to vague and general questions could have left the applicant with an impression of arbitrary justice lacking in transparency. Not having been given a summary of the main reasons why the Assize Court was satisfied that he was guilty, he had been unable to understand – and therefore to accept – the court ’ s decision. The Chamber found that in general, since the jury did not reach its verdict on the basis of the case file but on the evidence it had heard at the trial, it was essential, for the purpose of explaining the verdict, both to the accused and to the public at large, to highlight the considerations that had persuaded the jury of the accused ’ s guilt or innocence and to indicate the precise reasons why each of the questions had been answered in the affirmative or the negative."

In the present case, however, the questions put during the trial had not in any way addressed the substance of the case; there had been very few of them – only four of the thirty-two questions had concerned the applicant – and they had related solely to whether he was guilty of murder or attempted murder and had simply received the answer “yes”, without any further explanation."

The first two were based on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Firstly, the case-law acknowledged that reasoned court decisions formed part of the guarantees of a fair trial. It would be illogical for the standard required in this area to be lower for proceedings resulting in the most severe criminal penalties. Secondly, Article 6 § 1 forcefully emphasised the public nature of justice. The third argument was based on Article 6 § 3 (a), which acknowledged that anyone charged with a criminal offence was entitled to be informed in detail of the nature and cause of the accusations against him. The applicant contended that that right should also extend to the cause of his conviction. The problem of miscarriages of justice likewise supported the view that reasons should be given. The fact of requiring a court to state reasons for a decision meant that it had to express a coherent and rational line of reasoning purged of all emotional and subjective considerations. Lastly, the inclusion of reasons made a review by the courts of appeal and cassation possible; such a review would not have the same scope at all where no reasons were given for the decision as to guilt."

In the instant case the questions formulated at the end of the oral proceedings by the President of the Liège Assize Court in relation to the applicant ’ s guilt had been sufficiently precise to serve as an adequate basis for the court ’ s judgment.

The essential peculiarities of assize court procedure lay in three fundamental principles: the oral and uninterrupted nature of proceedings and the rule of personal conviction. Those characteristics, deriving directly from the participation of citizens in the act of judging, had in French law always militated against giving reasons for judgments delivered by assize courts. The principle that no reasons were to be given was unequivocally set forth in Article 353 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”), where it was linked to that of personal conviction, which was likewise made explicit: the jurors ’ decision was not to be dictated by legal standards or rules but by the examination, through their “conscience” and “rational faculties”, of the evidence heard in the adversarial proceedings which they had attended. The French Court of Cassation took the view that the only legally admissible “ reasoning” in the judgment of an assize court was constituted by the answers to the questions put to the jury and by the single words “yes” or “no”. There had been proposals to relax the principle of not including reasons, but the French Parliament had never adopted them."

It was the Court ’ s task to ensure that developments in domestic legislation were in accordance with the Convention, but only with the utmost caution and a heightened sense of moderation could the Court take the place of the democratic process in altering legal systems that were rooted in individual States ’ history and culture, especially after having previously held that those systems complied with the Convention. The departure from precedent by the Second Section of the Court had disrupted the normal functioning of the courts not only in Belgium but also in France.

Belgium (no. 15957/90, Commission decision of 30 March 1992, Decisions and Reports (DR) 72) the European Commission of Human Rights found that although no reasons had been given for the jury ’ s finding of guilt, the President of the Assize Court had at least put questions to the jury beforehand concerning the facts of the case and the accused had been able to challenge the questions. The Commission considered that those precise questions, some of which could be put at the request of the prosecution or the defence, formed a framework for the decision in issue and compensated sufficiently for the brevity of the jury ’ s replies. The Commission rejected the application as being manifestly ill-founded. It followed a similar approach in Zarouali v. Belgium (no. 20664/92, Commission decision of 29 June 1994, DR 78 -B ) and Planka v. Austria (no. 25852/94, Commission decision of 15 May 1996, unreported )."

In the Papon decision (cited above), the Court observed that the prosecution and the accused had been afforded the opportunity to challenge the questions put and to ask the president to put one or more additional questions to the jury. Noting that the jury had answered the 768 questions put by the President of the Assize Court, it considered that the questions formed a framework on which the decision had been based and that their precision sufficiently offset the fact that no reasons were given for the jury ’ s answers. The Court dismissed as manifestly ill-founded the complaint concerning the lack of reasoning in the Assize Court ’ s judgment."

Spain (( dec. ), no. 31548/02, 4 November 2003), the Court observed that the impugned judgment – to which a record of the jury ’ s deliberations had been attached – contained a list of the facts which the jury had held to be established in finding the applicant guilty, a legal analysis of those facts and, for sentencing purposes, a reference to the circumstances found to have had an influence on the applicant ’ s degree of responsibility in the case at hand. It therefore found that the judgment in question had contained sufficient reasons for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

                "88. In Goktepe (cited above, § 28 ), the Court found a violation of Article 6 on account of the Assize Court ’ s refusal to put distinct questions in respect of each defendant as to the existence of aggravating circumstances, thereby denying the jury the possibility of determining the applicant ’ s individual criminal responsibility. In the Court ’ s view, the fact that a court had not taken into account arguments on a vital issue with such serious consequences had to be considered incompatible with the adversarial principle, which lay at the heart of the notion of a fair trial. That conclusion was particularly compelling in the case at hand because the jurors had not been permitted to give reasons for their verdict (ibid., § 29)."

                "90. It follows from the case-law cited above that the Convention does not require jurors to give reasons for their decision and that Article 6 does not preclude a defendant from being tried by a lay jury even where reasons are not given for the verdict. Nevertheless, for the requirements of a fair trial to be satisfied, the accused, and indeed the public, must be able to understand the verdict that has been given; this is a vital safeguard against arbitrariness. As the Court has often noted, the rule of law and the avoidance of arbitrary power are principles underlying the Convention ( see, among many other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 32555/96, § 116, ECHR 2005-X ). In the judicial sphere, those principles serve to foster public confidence in an objective and transparent justice system, one of the foundations of a democratic society (see Suominen v. Finland, no. 37801/97, § 37, 1 July 2003, and Tatishvili v. Russia, no. 1509/02, § 58, ECHR 2007-I )."

                "91. In proceedings conducted before professional judges, the accused ’ s understanding of his conviction stems primarily from the reasons given in judicial decisions. In such cases, the national courts must indicate with sufficient clarity the grounds on which they base their decisions (see Hadjianastassiou v. Greece, no. 12945/87, 16 December 1992, § 33, Series A no. 252 ). Reasoned decisions also serve the purpose of demonstrating to the parties that they have been heard, thereby contributing to a more willing acceptance of the decision on their part. In addition, they oblige judges to base their reasoning on objective arguments, and also preserve the rights of the defence. However, the extent of the duty to give reasons varies according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see Ruiz Torija, cited above, § 29 ). While courts are not obliged to give a detailed answer to every argument raised (see Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands, 19 April 1994, § 61, Series A no. 288), it must be clear from the decision that the essential issues of the case have been addressed (see Boldea v. Romania, no. 19997/02, § 30, 15 February 2007 )."

In the case of assize courts sitting with a lay jury, any special procedural features must be accommodated, seeing that the jurors are usually not required – or not permitted – to give reasons for their personal convictions ( see paragraphs 85-89 above ). In these circumstances likewise, Article 6 requires an assessment of whether sufficient safeguards were in place to avoid any risk of arbitrariness and to enable the accused to understand the reasons for his conviction ( see paragraph 90 above ). Such procedural safeguards may include, for example, directions or guidance provided by the presiding judge to the jurors on the legal issues arising or the evidence adduced ( see paragraphs 43 et seq. above ), and precise, unequivocal questions put to the jury by the judge, forming a framework on which the verdict is based or sufficiently offsetting the fact that no reasons are given for the jury ’ s answers ( see Papon, cited above ). Lastly, regard must be had to any avenues of appeal open to the accused.",

In the present case, it should be noted that in his submissions before the Court the applicant complained that no reasons had been given for the guilty verdict in his case and that no appeal lay against the Assize Court ’ s decision. As has been reiterated (see paragraph 8 9 above), the absence of a reasoned verdict by a lay jury does not in itself constitute a breach of the accused ’ s right to a fair trial. Seeing that compliance with the requirements of a fair trial must be assessed on the basis of the proceedings as a whole and in the specific context of the legal system concerned, the Court ’ s task in reviewing the absence of a reasoned verdict is to determine whether, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, the proceedings afforded sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness and made it possible for the accused to understand why he was found guilty. In doing so, it must bear in mind that it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, § 54, ECHR 2008)."

With regard, firstly, to the indictment drawn up by the Principal Public Prosecutor, the CCP provides that it should indicate the nature of the offence forming the basis of the charge and any circumstances that may cause the sentence to be increased or reduced, and that it must be read out at the start of the trial (see paragraph 26 above). Admittedly, the accused may challenge the indictment by filing a statement of defence, but in practice the statement will have only limited effect since it is filed at the start of the proceedings, before the trial itself, which must serve as the basis for the jurors ’ personal conviction. The value of such a statement for a convicted defendant ’ s understanding of why the jury has reached a guilty verdict is therefore limited. In the instant case an analysis of the indictment of 12 August 2003 shows that it contained a detailed sequence of the police and judicial investigations and the many contradictory statements made by the co- accused. Although it mentioned each of the offences with which the applicant was charged, it did not indicate which items of evidence the prosecution could use against him."

                "96. Furthermore, in order to be able to reach a verdict, the jury had to answer thirty-two questions put by the President of the Assize Court. The applicant, who was appearing in court with seven co-defendants, was concerned by only four of the questions, each of which was answered by the jury in the affirmative (see paragraph 15 above). The questions, which were succinctly worded and were identical for all the defendants, did not refer to any precise and specific circumstances that could have enabled the applicant to understand why he was found guilty. In that respect the present case differs from the Papon case (cited above), in which the Assize Court referred to the jury ’ s answers to each of the 768 questions put by the court ’ s president and also to the description of the facts held to have been established and the Articles of the Criminal Code which had been applied (see paragraph 86 above)."

It follows that, even in conjunction with the indictment, the questions put in the present case did not enable the applicant to ascertain which of the items of evidence and factual circumstances discussed at the trial had ultimately caused the jury to answer the four questions concerning him in the affirmative. Thus, the applicant was unable, for example, to make a clear distinction between the co-defendants as to their involvement in the commission of the offence; to ascertain the jury ’ s perception of his precise role in relation to the other defendants; to understand why the offence had been classified as premeditated murder ( assassinat ) rather than murder ( meurtre ); to determine what factors had prompted the jury to conclude that the involvement of two of the co-defendants in the alleged acts had been limited, carrying a lesser sentence; or to discern why the aggravating factor of premeditation had been taken into account in his case as regards the attempted murder of A.C. ’ s partner. This shortcoming was all the more problematic because the case was both factually and legally complex and the trial lasted more than two months, from 17 October 2003 to 7 January 2004, during which time many witnesses and experts gave evidence."

As regards Article 352 of the CCP, which provides that if the jurors have made a substantive error, the Assize Court must stay the proceedings and adjourn the case until a later session for consideration by a new jury, that option, as recognised by the Government (see paragraph 31 above), is used only rarely."

[AZ] neither ordered [the applicant] to intervene in favour of the person offering the bribe, nor did he threaten him. He asked him orally for help in securing the discontinuation of proceedings [against the third person] ... K. Ramanauskas understood that the request was unlawful ... [and] the Regional Court was therefore correct in finding him guilty ...",
                "[The applicant] contests the lawfulness of [the model] ..., stating that the case discloses a manifest example of incitement ( kurstymas ) by the officers of the special services to accept the bribe ... [ He submits that, by law ], authorisation to simulate a criminal act cannot be given in the absence of evidence of the preparation or commission of an offence. Therefore, in his view, such a procedure cannot pursue the aim of inciting a person or persons to commit a crime. If the model were used for that purpose, it would be unlawful [and] the information thereby obtained could not be admitted in evidence ... [The] model cannot be authorised and implemented unless a person has planned or started to commit an offence, evidence of which should be submitted to a prosecutor ... It appears from the case file that [the authorities] were contacted by [VS] and [AZ] after [their initial] meetings with K. Ramanauskas, during which he had agreed in principle that he would perform the requested actions for USD 3,000 ... Accordingly, in authorising the use of the model, [the authorities] merely joined a criminal act which was already in progress.",
                "The case file contains no evidence that [VS] is an employee of the special services ... [AZ] works at the STT as a police driver ... but this does not mean that he is prohibited from acting in a private capacity. There is no evidence that [VS] and [AZ] negotiated with K. Ramanauskas on police instructions. It has, however, been established that [VS] and [AZ] handed money to him on the police ’ s orders.",
                "The court considers that provocation ( provokacija ) to commit a crime is similar but not equivalent to incitement ( kurstymas ) ... Provocation is a form of incitement consisting in encouraging a person to commit an offence ... entailing his criminal responsibility so that he can then be prosecuted on that account. While such conduct is morally reprehensible, the term ‘ provocation ’ is not used either in criminal or procedural law or in the Operational Activities Act of 22 May 1997 ... From a legal standpoint, provocation does not constitute a factor exempting from criminal responsibility a person who has thereby been induced to commit an offence ...",
                "Since the case file contains contradictory evidence as to the conduct of [VS] and [AZ] before the criminal conduct simulation model was authorised, it is difficult to establish who was the instigator ( iniciatorius ) of giving and accepting the bribe, or, in other words, who incited whom to give or accept the bribe. [VS] ... stated that, after he had contacted K. Ramanauskas to ask him to intervene in securing the discontinuation of the criminal case [against the third person ], K. Ramanauskas had been the first to say that he could settle the matter for USD 3,000. For his part, [ AZ] ... stated that K. Ramanauskas had said that the discontinuation of the case would cost USD 3,000. In his testimony K. Ramanauskas alleged that [VS] had asked him if USD 3,000 would be enough to ensure that the case was discontinued. In these circumstances, it cannot be said with any certainty who was the instigator of the bribery, nor can it be inferred that [VS] and [AZ] incited K. Ramanauskas to accept the bribe. Furthermore, there is no reason to conclude that [VS] and [AZ] provoked the offence committed by K. Ramanauskas in accepting the bribe. It can only be said unequivocally that the initiative ( iniciatyva ) to apply to K. Ramanauskas in order to have the case [against the third person ] discontinued came from [AZ].",
                "However, the court considers that the answer to the question whether a person has actually induced ( palenkė ) or otherwise incited ( sukurstė ) another to offer or accept a bribe is of no consequence as far as the legal classification of [the applicant ’ s] conduct is concerned. Incitement ( kurstymas ) to commit an offence is one of the various forms of complicity. Under the branch of criminal law dealing with complicity, incitement is a form of conspiracy. A person who commits an offence after having being incited to do so incurs the same criminal responsibility as a person who acts of his own volition ... Even assuming that K. Ramanauskas was incited by [VS] and [AZ] to accept a bribe, it must be emphasised that the incitement took the form of an offer, and not of threats or blackmail. He was therefore able to decline (and ought to have declined) the illegal offer ... It follows from the testimony of K. Ramanauskas that he understood the nature of the acts he was being asked to carry out, and accepted [the bribe] of his own free will ...",
                "At the same time it must be noted that it is a specific feature of bribery as an offence that one side is necessarily the instigator ( kurstytojas ). A State official soliciting a bribe is an instigator within the meaning of Article 284 [of the Criminal Code then in force – ‘ the CC ’ ] in that he incites ( kursto ) another to pay him a bribe, in breach of that Article. [A person] offering a bribe to a State official is necessarily an instigator within the meaning of Article 282 of the CC since, by making the offer, he incites the official to accept a bribe, that is, to commit the offence provided for in that Article ... Both the person giving and the person accepting a bribe exercise their free will ... and may therefore choose between possible forms of conduct. A person who intentionally chooses the criminal option while having the possibility of resisting the incitement rightly incurs criminal responsibility, regardless of the outside factors that may have influenced his choice ...”"

The admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and, as a rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court, for its part, must ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among other authorities, Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III; Teixeira de Castro, cited above, § 34; Sequeira v.

Russia, no. 59696/00, § 135, ECHR 2006 -XII, and, mutatis mutandis, Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, §§ 52-56, Series A no. 28 ). While the rise in organised crime requires that appropriate measures be taken, the right to a fair trial, from which the requirement of the proper administration of justice is to be inferred, nevertheless applies to all types of criminal offence, from the most straightforward to the most complex.

Nor was there any evidence to support the Government ’ s argument that the applicant was predisposed to commit offences. On the contrary, he was unknown to the police and had not been in possession of any drugs when the police officers had sought them from him; accordingly, he had only been able to supply them through an acquaintance who had obtained them from a dealer whose identity remained unknown. Although Mr Teixeira de Castro had potentially been predisposed to commit an offence, there was no objective evidence to suggest that he had initiated a criminal act before the police officers ’ intervention.

Furthermore, from that point on, the activities of A. and C. were supervised by the criminal-investigation department, the prosecution service having been informed of the operation. Finally, the authorities had good reasons for suspecting the applicant of wishing to mount a drug-trafficking operation.

In the Government ’ s submission, that sequence of events showed that VS and AZ had acted on their own private initiative without having first informed the authorities. By authorising and implementing the model, they argued, the prosecuting authorities had merely put themselves in a position to establish an offence which the applicant had already planned to commit.

It is particularly important that the authorities should assume responsibility as the initial phase of the operation, namely the acts carried out up to 27 January 1999, took place in the absence of any legal framework or judicial authorisation. Furthermore, by authorising the use of the model and exempting AZ from all criminal responsibility, the authorities legitimised the preliminary phase ex post facto and made use of its results."

Firstly, there is no evidence that the applicant had committed any offences beforehand, in particular corruption -related offences. Secondly, as is shown by the recordings of telephone calls, all the meetings between the applicant and AZ took place on the latter ’ s initiative, a fact that appears to contradict the Government ’ s argument that the authorities did not subject the applicant to any pressure or threats. On the contrary, through the contact established on the initiative of AZ and VS, the applicant seems to have been subjected to blatant prompting on their part to perform criminal acts, although there was no objective evidence – other than rumours – to suggest that he had been intending to engage in such activity."

To that end, they should have established in particular the reasons why the operation had been mounted, the extent of the police ’ s involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant had been subjected. This was especially important having regard to the fact that VS, who had originally introduced AZ to the applicant and who appears to have played a significant role in the events leading up to the giving of the bribe, was never called as a witness in the case since he could not be traced.

It was for the convicted person to prove that the first condition was satisfied, whereas the burden of proof in respect of the second lay with the “representative of the prosecution or with the court”. Accordingly, a lack of evidence as regards the second condition could only work to the defendant's advantage. The Court of Cassation accordingly held that, before declaring defendants to be “fugitives”, the authorities should not only search for them in a manner appropriate to the circumstances of the case but should also establish whether they had intentionally avoided complying with a measure ordered by the court, such as a measure entailing deprivation of liberty (see the First Section's judgment of 23 February 2005 (no. 6987) in Flordelis and Pagnanelli )."

The irregularity could concern, in particular, a breach of the rules on service of process and, more specifically, failure to observe the safeguards afforded to defendants deemed to be untraceable. If the objection was declared admissible, the court had to suspend the enforcement of the sentence. If it was allowed, the statutory period for appealing against the judgment was reopened.

If such an application was granted, the time allowed for appealing was reopened and the defendant had the opportunity to submit any arguments in support of his or her case – in person or through counsel – before a court with jurisdiction to deal with all matters of fact and law.

It was true that an application for leave to appeal out of time had to be lodged within ten days. However, such a period, which had not been peculiar to Italian law, had been sufficient to allow persons on trial to exercise their right to defend themselves, as its starting-point had been fixed as the moment at which they had had “effective knowledge of the decision” (as the Court of Cassation had held on 3 July 1990 in Rizzo ).

Evidence of this had been very easy to provide since in most cases it resulted from the actual manner in which the conviction had been served. It had been sufficient for applicants to state – without having to supply proof – the reasons why they had not been informed of the judgment in time to lodge an appeal. The fact that they might have been aware of other procedural steps, or that the reasons they gave might have resulted from their own lack of diligence, had not meant that the application should be refused. Indeed, the time allowed for appealing could be reopened even where their ignorance of the judgment had been their own fault.

In particular, the only remedies which the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and are at the same time available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Dalia v. France, 19 February 1998, § 38, Reports 1998-I). In addition, according to the “generally recognised rules of international law”, there may be special circumstances which absolve applicants from the obligation to exhaust the domestic remedies at their disposal (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, § 52, Reports 1996-VI). However, the existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile is not a valid reason for failing to exhaust domestic remedies (see Sardinas Albo v. Italy (dec.), no. 56271/00, ECHR 2004-I, and Brusco v. Italy (dec.), no. 69789/01, ECHR 2001-IX)."

However, in the particular circumstances of the instant case, in which the judgment delivered in absentia had been served on the applicant's officially assigned counsel, an application to that effect could be granted only if two conditions were satisfied: if the convicted person could establish that he had not had effective knowledge of the judgment, and if he had not deliberately refused to take cognisance of the procedural steps."

They argued that, on the contrary, it was for the prosecution to provide evidence, if any existed, from which it could be inferred that the accused had wilfully refused to take cognisance of the charges and the judgment. However, such an interpretation appears to be belied by the note from the Rome public prosecutor's office, which states: “for a court to agree to re-examine the case it has to be proved that the accused was wrongly deemed to be a 'fugitive' ” (see paragraph 18 above)."

That judgment, which does not cite any precedent on the issue, was not delivered until 25 November 2004, more than five years after the applicant was arrested in Germany (see paragraphs 17 and 24 above).

It finds it reasonable to believe that, during his detention pending extradition, the applicant was informed of the reasons why he had been deprived of his liberty, and in particular of his conviction in Italy.

There is no evidence to suggest that he had been informed of the possibility of reopening the time allowed for appealing against his conviction, which had officially become final, and of the short time available for attempting such a remedy.

Switzerland (no. 20491/92, ECHR 2001-VI) that the intention to escape trial extinguished the right of a person convicted in absentia to a new trial under the Convention. In that connection, the Government pointed out that the Court had endorsed the view of the Swiss authorities that Mr Medenica's trial in absentia had been lawful and that it had not been necessary to reopen the proceedings because his inability to appear had been his own fault and he had not provided any valid excuse for his absence. Furthermore, the presumption that a defendant had sought to evade justice was not irrebuttable. Convicted persons could always provide explanations by arguing that they had never been aware of the proceedings and consequently had not intended to abscond, or by citing a legitimate impediment. In such cases it was for the prosecution to seek to prove the contrary where appropriate, and for the judicial authorities to assess the relevance of the convicted person's explanations."

Italy (cited above), in which the Court had refused to attach any importance to the indirect knowledge which the applicants had had or might have had of the proceedings against them and of the date of their trial. Although the Court's excessive formalism and severity in the above two cases were understandable in the light of the legislation in force in Italy at the material time, they were not acceptable today."

Admittedly, a purely formal notification (as in the present case, where the relevant documents had been served on the officially appointed lawyer) could not give rise to an irrebuttable statutory presumption that the accused had been aware of the proceedings. However, a presumption to the contrary was equally unjustified. That would amount to denying that the accused might be aware of the proceedings where there was evidence that they were guilty and had absconded (for example, where criminals escaped from police officers pursuing them immediately after the offence, or where defendants produced a written statement declaring their guilt, their contempt towards the victims and their intention to remain untraceable). In the Government's submission, the mere fact that an applicant had not been notified of the conviction did not in itself constitute sufficient proof that he or she had acted in good faith; further evidence of negligence on the part of the authorities was required."

It would therefore be advisable, they argued, to take a more balanced, common sense approach consisting in assuming – at least provisionally – that the accused had absconded if such an inference was justified by the particular circumstances of the case, regard being had to logic and to ordinary experience, and seeking to substantiate this through concrete evidence. In particular, it was not contrary to the presumption of innocence to assume that persons accused of an offence had absconded where it proved impossible to ascertain their whereabouts immediately after the offence had been committed. Such an assumption was reinforced if they were subsequently found guilty on the basis of evidence adduced at the trial and did not provide any relevant explanation as to what had caused them to leave their home address. That was precisely what had happened in the applicant's case, in which the Rome Assize Court had carefully established the facts, basing its findings on statements by several eyewitnesses."

That would, however, be contrary to the purpose of all judicial proceedings – namely establishing the truth – and would mean that justice was denied or the victims were caused additional anguish. There would also be paradoxical consequences: defendants who were quicker and more skilful at escaping would be at an advantage in relation to those who were caught unawares by an initial summons. If that were so, only the accused would have the power to review the validity of their own trial, and the guilty would be in a more favourable position than the innocent. Furthermore, people who had consciously sought to evade trial could claim a right “which logic and any sense of justice suggest[ed] should not be theirs”: the right to clutter the courts' lists of cases and to inconvenience victims and witnesses at a later stage."

Since he had become untraceable, he was deemed to be a “fugitive” ( latitante ) (see paragraph 12 above). A lawyer was appointed to represent him and was notified of the various steps in the proceedings, including the applicant's conviction.

He also had the assistance of and was in contact with a lawyer of his own choosing. Lastly, the Court found that Mr Medenica's absence had been due to his own culpable conduct and agreed with the Swiss Federal Court that he had misled the American court by making equivocal and even knowingly inaccurate statements with the aim of securing a decision that would make it impossible for him to attend his trial (ibid., § 58). His position was therefore very different from that of the applicant in the instant case. In the particular circumstances of the present case the question arises whether, if official notice was not served on him, Mr Sejdovic may be regarded as having been sufficiently aware of his prosecution and the trial to be able to decide to waive his right to appear in court, or to evade justice."

Italy, cited above, § 28, and Somogyi, cited above, § 75). The Court cannot, however, rule out the possibility that certain established facts might provide an unequivocal indication that the accused is aware of the existence of the criminal proceedings against him and of the nature and the cause of the accusation and does not intend to take part in the trial or wishes to escape prosecution. This may be the case, for example, where the accused states publicly or in writing that he does not intend to respond to summonses of which he has become aware through sources other than the authorities, or succeeds in evading an attempted arrest (see, among other authorities, Iavarazzo v. Italy (dec.), no. 50489/99, 4 December 2001), or when materials are brought to the attention of the authorities which unequivocally show that he is aware of the proceedings pending against him and of the charges he faces."

The Court is therefore unable to accept this argument, which also runs counter to the presumption of innocence. The establishment of the applicant's guilt according to law was the purpose of criminal proceedings which, at the time when the applicant was deemed to be a fugitive, were at the preliminary investigation stage."

However, such a finding does not preclude the Court from taking the remedy referred to by the Government into consideration in its examination of the merits of the complaint (see, mutatis mutandis, N.C. v. Italy, cited above, §§ 42-47 and 53-58). It notes that in Italian law an objection to execution is admissible only where it is established that there has been an irregularity in the proceedings capable of rendering the judgment void, particularly with regard to the service of process on defendants who cannot be traced (see paragraphs 31 and 71 above). However, the Government themselves admitted that in the present case the summons had been served in accordance with domestic law (see paragraph 72 above).

In so far as the Government referred to the possibility for the applicant to apply for leave to appeal out of time, the Court would simply reiterate the observations it set out in connection with the preliminary objection (see paragraphs 47-56 above). It notes again that the remedy provided for in Article 175 §§ 2 and 3 of the CCP, as in force at the time of the applicant's arrest and detention pending extradition, was bound to fail and there were objective obstacles to his using it. In particular, the applicant would have encountered serious difficulties in satisfying one of the legal preconditions for the grant of leave to appeal, namely in proving that he had not deliberately refused to take cognisance of the procedural steps or sought to escape trial. The Court has also found that there might have been uncertainty as to the distribution of the burden of proof in respect of that precondition (see paragraphs 49-51 above). Doubts therefore arise as to whether the applicant's right not to have to prove that he had no intention of evading trial was respected. The applicant might have been unable to provide convincing explanations, when requested to do so by the court or challenged by the prosecution, as to why, shortly after the killing of Mr S., he had left his home without leaving a contact address and travelled to Germany. Moreover, the applicant, who could have been deemed to have had “effective knowledge of the judgment” shortly after being arrested in Germany, had only ten days to apply for leave to appeal out of time. There is no evidence to suggest that he had been informed of the possibility of reopening the time allowed for appealing against his conviction and of the short time available for attempting such a remedy. These circumstances, taken together with the difficulties that a person detained in a foreign country would have encountered in rapidly contacting a lawyer familiar with Italian law and in giving him a precise account of the facts and detailed instructions, created objective obstacles to the use by the applicant of the remedy provided for in Article 175 § 2 of the CCP (see paragraphs 53-55 above)."

In its decision of 17 June 1997 (V KX 57/97, OSNKW 1997/9 ‑ 010/82) the Supreme Court stated that cassation proceedings had a special character in that the judgment essentially became final after it had been upheld by the appellate court. Bearing in mind the special character of these proceedings, the court was of the view that at this stage the mere fact that the convicted person was granted legal aid was sufficient to ensure an effective exercise of his or her defence rights. It was the lawyer ’ s task to analyse the case and establish whether there were grounds on which to lodge a cassation appeal against the judgment of the appellate court. If the lawyer was of the opinion that there were no grounds on which to do so, there was no legal basis in the Code of Criminal Procedure that would either oblige the lawyer to prepare such an appeal against his or her better judgment, or to oblige the court to assign another lawyer to prepare such an appeal in the case."

It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of 1 December 1999. The Supreme Court observed that the court could only assign a new legal ‑ aid lawyer to the case if it were shown that the first lawyer had been negligent in his or her task of assessing whether a cassation appeal had any prospects of success. If this were not the case, a court was not obliged to assign a new legal ‑ aid lawyer to represent the convicted person and its refusal was not subject to appeal (III KZ 139/99).

In so far as the applicant could be understood as complaining about the legal ‑ aid lawyer ’ s refusal to prepare and lodge a cassation appeal on his behalf, they were of the view that any disagreements that might have arisen between the applicant and the lawyer could not be regarded as giving rise to the State ’ s liability. The lawyer had been a member of an independent and self ‑ governing professional association which adopted its own rules of conduct and disciplinary regulations.

Moreover, as he had been in detention throughout the proceedings concerned, he had experienced serious difficulties in having his defence rights protected in practice.

Accordingly, this rule requires applicants first to use the remedies provided by the national legal system, thus dispensing States from answering before the European Court for their acts. The rule is based on the assumption that the domestic system provides an effective remedy in respect of the alleged breach (see, among many other authorities, İçyer v. Turkey ( dec .), no. 18888/02, 12 January 2006). However, discretionary or extraordinary remedies need not be exhausted (see, among many other authorities, Prystavska v.

Poland ( dec .), no. 17842/02, 7 March 2006).

The manner in which Article 6 is applied to proceedings before courts of appeal depends on the special features of the proceedings involved, and account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein (see Ekbatani v. Sweden, judgment of 26 May 1988, Series A no. 134, § 27, and Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 56). Proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, despite the fact that the appellant is not given the opportunity to be heard in person by the appeal or cassation court, provided that a public hearing is held at first instance (see, among other authorities, Monnell and Morris, cited above, p. 22, § 58, as regards the issue of leave to appeal, and Sutter v.

In order to decide this question, regard must be had, among other considerations, to the specific features of the proceedings in question and to the manner in which the applicant ’ s interests were actually presented and protected before the appellate court, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it (see Belziuk v. Poland, referred to above, § 37, and Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 60, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... ). However, where an appellate court has to examine a case as to the facts and the law and make a full assessment of the issue of guilt or innocence, it cannot determine the issue without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused for the purpose of proving that he did not commit the act allegedly constituting a criminal offence (see Dondarini v. San Marino, no. 50545/99, § 27, 6 July 2004 ). The wider concept of a fair trial also includes the fundamental right that criminal proceedings should be adversarial. The latter means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party (see, among other authorities, Brandstetter v.

All the evidence gathered in the case was available to the defence. The Court notes that although the applicant was not present before the Court of Appeal, the presence of his legal-aid lawyer at that hearing was obligatory. As noted above, the lawyer attended the hearing and was given the opportunity to conduct the applicant ’ s defence. The Court also notes that while the court of appeal was empowered under domestic law to accept new evidence in certain circumstances (see paragraph 27 above ), it has not been shown or argued that the applicant ’ s lawyer requested that new evidence be admitted and examined by the appellate court."

The courts were at all times unaware that the applicant had been arrested at some point during the proceedings and subsequently detained and that effective service of the court correspondence on him was only possible at the detention centre. In this connection, the Court reiterates that in the context of criminal proceedings it is essentially the responsibility of the courts to ensure that a trial is fair ( Lala v. the Netherlands, 22 September 1994, § 34, Series A no. 297 ‑ A ). It is therefore essentially the responsibility of the State to make available to the courts effective access to information about persons deprived of their liberty at the time of the trial.

Nor was he aware of the date of the hearing before the appellate court. As a result, he could not attend the hearing before the Łódź Regional Court, as he learned about it through unofficial channels only a few days before the hearing was to be held. The Court observes that in consequence the applicant was unable to address the court of appeal either through his lawyer, personally or in writing, to submit any comments he wished to make on the observations made by the prosecution or to put forward any submissions on the matters which he regarded as relevant to the outcome of his case (compare and contrast P.O. v.

The Polish Supreme Court stressed in a previous case that it was mandatory to bring a defendant to a hearing before the appellate court, regardless of whether he or she had made a relevant request (see paragraph 29 above). In a subsequent case, the same court emphasised that the right to a fair hearing demanded that a defendant convicted by a first-instance court should be informed of his procedural rights concerning his presence before the court of appeal (see paragraph 32 above ). Ultimately, the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended so as to impose on the appellate court an unequivocal obligation to inform the defendant of his right to attend the hearing before that court (see paragraph 33 above).

                "a. Institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs",
                "41. Since 1998, when it first visited Moldova, the CPT has serious concern for the conditions of detention in the institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.",
                "The CPT notes that 32 out of 39 EDPs have been subjected to “cosmetic” repair and that 30 have been equipped with places for daily walks. Nevertheless, the 2004 visit did not allow the concern of the Committee to be alleviated. In fact, most recommendations made have not been implemented.",
                "42. Whether one refers to the police stations or EDPs visited, the material conditions are invariably subject to the same criticism as in the past. Detention cells had no access to daylight or a very limited access; artificial light – with rare exceptions – was mediocre. Nowhere did the persons obliged to spend the night in detention receive mattresses and blankets, even those detained for prolonged periods. Those who had such items could only have obtained them from their relatives...",
                "45. As for food ... in the EDPs the arrangements made were the same as those criticised in 2001 (see paragraph 57 of the report on that visit): generally three modest distributions of food per day including tea and a slice of bread in the morning, a bowl of cereal at noon and tea or warm water in the evening. Sometimes there was only one distribution of food per day. Fortunately, the rules for receiving parcels have been relaxed, which allowed detainees with relatives outside to slightly improve these meagre daily portions.",
                "47. In sum, the material conditions remain problematic in the police stations; they remain disastrous in EDPs, continuing in many aspects to amount, for the detainees, to inhuman and degrading treatment.”",

                "... - EDP of Chişinău Police Inspectorate [1]",
                "53. In its report on the 1998 visit (paragraph 56), the CPT was forced to conclude that material conditions of detention in the remand centres ( EDPs ) visited amounted in many respects to inhuman and degrading treatment and, in addition, constituted a significant risk to the health of persons detained. While recognising that it was not possible to transform the current situation in these establishments overnight, the CPT recommended a certain number of immediate palliative measures to guarantee basic conditions of detention that respect the fundamental requirements of life and human dignity.",
                "54. Unfortunately, during the 2001 visit, the delegation found barely any traces of such palliative measures, in fact quite the opposite. For example, the renovation and reconstruction of the cells of the EDP of the Department for the fight against organised crime and corruption in Chişinău (reopened in 2000), which were supposed to reflect the CPT's 1998 recommendations, turned out to have had quite the contrary effect. All the conceptual and organisational shortcomings highlighted by the CPT at the time had been faithfully reproduced: cells without access to natural light, artificial lighting of low intensity and permanently switched on, inadequate ventilation and furnishings consisting exclusively of platforms without mattresses (although certain prisoners did have their own blankets). A similar conclusion can be drawn about the new section of the Bălţi EDP set aside for administrative detainees.",
                "55. One can only regret that in their efforts to renovate these premises - which under the current economic circumstances deserve praise - the Moldovan authorities have paid no attention to the CPT recommendations. In fact, this state of affairs strongly suggests that, setting aside economic considerations, the issue of material conditions of detention in police establishments remains influenced by an outdated concept of deprivation of liberty.",
                "56. Turning to the other EDPs visited across Moldova, with very few exceptions the delegation observed the same types of disastrous and insalubrious material conditions. A detailed description is superfluous, since it has all been highlighted already in paragraphs 53 to 55 of the report on the 1998 visit.",
                "In Chişinău EDP, these conditions were exacerbated by serious overcrowding. At the time of the visit, there were 248 prisoners for 80 places, requiring nine persons to cram into a cell measuring 7 m² and between eleven and fourteen persons into cells of 10 to 15 m².",
                "57. The delegation also received numerous complaints about the quantity of food in the EDPs visited. This normally comprised tea without sugar and a slice of bread in the morning, cereal porridge at lunch time and hot water in the evening. In some establishments, food was served just once a day and was confined to a piece of bread and soup. ...",
                "... Concerning the issue of access to toilets in due time, the CPT wishes to stress that it considers that the practice according to which detainees comply with the needs of nature by using receptacles in the presence of one or several other persons, in a confined space such as the EDP cells which also serve as their living space, is in itself degrading, not only for the individual concerned but also for those forced to witness what is happening. Consequently, the CPT recommends that clear instructions be given to surveillance staff that detainees placed in cells without toilets should – if they so request – be taken out of their cell without delay during the day in order to go to the toilet.",
                "59. The CPT also recommends that steps be taken to:",
                "- reduce the overcrowding in Chişinău EDP as rapidly as possible and to comply with the official occupancy level;",
                "- supply persons in custody with clean mattresses and clean blankets;",
                "- authorise persons detained in all EDPs to receive packages from the outset of their custody and to have access to reading matter.",

In particular, the court found that the applicant and other co-accused were subjected to torture and pressure in order to confess to the offences imputed to them or to incriminate other co-accused. In finding the above, the court relied on witness testimonies to the effect that G.D. had signs of violence on his body during the court hearings. The allegations of ill-treatment were consistent with reports of German and International bodies specialised in the protection of human rights. The court relied, inter alia, on a report of the German Government concerning the Republic of Moldova, in which it was stated that the Moldovan justice system lacked independence from the Government and that ill-treatment and torture by police was a wide spread practice in Moldova.

It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects the opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards the accused as guilty. In this regard the Court emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of an offence (see Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 41, ECHR 2000 ‑ X )."

However, even assuming that the name Micu had been used as the denomination of the criminal organisation but not as the applicant's name, as suggested by the Government, the result remains the same. A statement that a criminal organisation bears one's name constitutes an implicit accusation that the initial bearer of the name (the person) is somehow involved with the gang. Otherwise there would simply be no reason for the gang to bear his name. Accordingly, Mr Gurbulea's statement was clearly a declaration of the applicant's guilt which, firstly, encouraged the public to believe him guilty and, secondly, prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority.

In carrying out the assessment of staff suspected of abusing their posts, the Institute’s experts could resort to a polygraph test (section 17(3)(a)).

In a judgment of 8 February 2005, which came into force on 18 February 2005 following its publication in the State Gazette (реш. № 1219 от 8 февруари 2005 г. по адм. д. № 4773/2004 г., ВАС, петчл. с ‑ в, обн., ДВ, бр. 16 от 18 февруари 2005 г.), a five ‑ member panel of the Supreme Administrative Court partly upheld the challenge and decided to strike out the wording “established by the [Ministry’s] Psychology Institute”. It noted, inter alia, that the Institute was directly subordinate to the Minister, and that its assessments of a person’s mental fitness for work at the Ministry were not subject to any form of review. There was therefore no guarantee that in carrying out those assessments the Institute’s experts would not commit errors, abuse their powers or deprive those concerned of their rights. That was important because if the Institute’s experts assessed a member of staff to be mentally unfit for work at the Ministry, the Minister had no discretion and was bound to dismiss him or her. Although the member of staff concerned could seek judicial review of the Minister’s order, such a challenge would be futile because the assessment, which formed the basis of the Minister’s order, was not amenable to judicial scrutiny. The court acknowledged that the employment of the Ministry’s staff touched upon national security. Nonetheless, it went on to hold that considerations relating to national security had to yield to a person’s right under Article 120 of the Constitution (see paragraph 28 above) to judicial review of all administrative decisions affecting his or her rights. The court said that the assessment of a person’s mental fitness for work at the Ministry of Internal Affairs should be amenable to “the same control for lawfulness, [namely] by several independent experts and by the court, as in the case of assessing health conditions [for the purpose of granting disability benefits]”. Therefore, in as much as it provided that the Ministry’s Psychology Institute was the only body authorised to assess mental fitness for work at the Ministry, regulation 251(1)(6) ran counter to section 2 of the 1997 Act (see paragraph 29 above) and the Health Act 2004.

He had been able to challenge the order for his dismissal, and the Supreme Administrative Court had, within the limits of its competence, ruled on that order’s lawfulness. The psychological assessment underpinning the order had not been the subject matter of the judicial review proceedings. It had not been an administrative decision and could not have itself been challenged by way of judicial review. The body which had made the assessment, the Psychology Institute of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was a specialised body whose tasks included assessing, on the basis of a range of criteria laid down in Instruction no. I ‑ 37 of 5 March 2001, the mental fitness of the Ministry’s staff. Because of that, its assessments could not be subjected to judicial scrutiny. Once the Institute had assessed a member of staff to be mentally unfit for work, the Minister had no discretion and was bound to dismiss that person. The Supreme Administrative Court had found that in the applicant’s case the procedure governing the manner in which the assessment was to be carried out had been followed, that the Institute had assessed the applicant to be mentally unfit for work, and that as a result the Minister had, by means of a reasoned decision, dismissed the applicant from his post. The Government also drew attention to this Court’s statement in Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, § 62, ECHR 2007 ‑ II) that its conclusion on the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention to proceedings concerning the employment of civil servants was without prejudice to the question as to how the various guarantees of that Article should be applied in such proceedings."

That judgment had not been applicable to the applicant’s case because it had been delivered after his dismissal and because, under a general principle of Bulgarian law, it did not have retroactive effect. Moreover, in that judgment the Supreme Administrative Court had confined itself to ruling that the Psychology Institute of the Ministry of Internal Affairs should not be the only body competent to assess the mental fitness of the Ministry’s staff. In that connection, the Government pointed out that the applicant had not sought to produce before the Supreme Administrative Court another assessment of his mental fitness for work.

In those circumstances, the legal challenge to the order was futile. The applicant pointed out that the assessment had been carried out by experts who were subordinate to the Minister of Internal Affairs, which raised doubts as to their impartiality and objectiveness. On that point, he referred to the reasons given by the Supreme Administrative Court in its judgment of 8 February 2005, and submitted that the panels deciding his case should have taken those reasons into account. The applicant went on to argue that Instruction no. I ‑ 37, which governed the manner in which the assessment was to be carried out, had not been published in the State Gazette and had therefore not entered into force at the relevant time. That meant that the order for his dismissal had been unlawful. Its unlawfulness also stemmed from the fact that the applicant had, in breach of the applicable regulations, been subjected to the psychological assessment while on sick leave.

It follows that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, under its civil limb, was applicable to the proceedings before that court (see Redka v. Ukraine, no. 17788/02, § 25, 21 June 2007; Chukhas v.

One of those guarantees, in cases concerning the determination of civil rights and obligations, is that the “tribunal” dealing with the case must have jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before it (see Terra Woningen B.V. v. the Netherlands, 17 December 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ VI, § 52; Chevrol v.

In carrying out this examination, the Court will have regard to the fact that in dismissing the applicant from his post the Minister of Internal Affairs was not exercising his discretion. Under the terms of section 253(1)(5) of the 1997 Act and regulation 251(1)(6) of the Act’s implementing regulations, as consistently construed by the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraphs 30, 31, 34 and 35 above), the Minister was bound to dismiss an officer certified by the Ministry’s Psychology Institute to be mentally unfit for work at the Ministry. Indeed, the Government confirmed this in their observations (see paragraph 46 above). The present case is not therefore concerned with the intensity with which the domestic courts should scrutinise the exercise of administrative discretion (contrast Zumtobel v.

There was nothing inherently wrong with that assessment being carried out by an expert employed by the Ministry’s Psychology Institute (see, mutatis mutandis, Stefan, cited above). Article 6 § 1 of the Convention does not bar the national courts from relying on expert opinions drawn up by specialised bodies to resolve the disputes before them when this is required by the nature of the contentious issues under consideration (see Csősz, cited above, § 34). However, the reasoning of the three ‑ member and five ‑ member panels of the Supreme Administrative Court shows that they did not simply take into account the assessment carried out by the Institute, but considered themselves bound by it and refused to scrutinise it in any way (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above, and contrast Stefan, cited above). Those rulings were fully in line with the Supreme Administrative Court’s case ‑ law predating its judgment of 8 February 2005 in which it partly struck down regulation 251(1)(6) of the implementing regulations of the 1997 Act. In that case ‑ law, that court consistently held that the Institute’s assessments were not amenable to judicial scrutiny and could not be contested through any means (see paragraph 34 above). This Court, for its part, finds that in its exclusive reliance on that assessment in the applicant’s case the Supreme Administrative Court refused independently to scrutinise a point which was crucial for the determination of the case, and thus deprived itself of jurisdiction to examine the dispute before it (see, mutatis mutandis, I.D. v.

                "25. The Court cannot accept this view. Judicial decisions always affect persons. In criminal matters, especially, accused persons do not disappear from the scene when the decision of the judges at first instance or appeal gives rise to an appeal in cassation. Although the judgment of the Court of Cassation can only confirm or quash such decision - and not reverse it or replace it - that judgment may rebound in different degrees on the position of the person concerned. He loses his status of a convicted person or, as the case may be, the benefit of his acquittal, at any rate provisionally, when a decision is set aside and the case is referred back to a trial court. A judgment in cassation sometimes has even more direct repercussions on the fate of an accused. If the highest court dismisses the appeal in cassation, the acquittal or conviction becomes final. If the Court of Cassation allows the appeal without ordering the case to be sent back, because, for example, the facts which led to the conviction do not constitute an offence known to the law (see Article 429 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the judicial decisions given thereon), then by its own sole decision it puts an end to the prosecution.",
                "Furthermore, the term\" bien-fondé \", which is found in the French text of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), refers not only to the accusation being well-founded in fact but also to its being well-founded in law. Thus, the supervision of validity which the Court of Cassation undertakes may lead it to hold that the lower courts, when examining the facts on which the charge was grounded, have acted in breach either of criminal law or of forms of procedure which are of an essential nature of are laid down on pain of nullity of the decision (see, for example, Section 17 of the Act of 4th August 1832); at least in the first of these cases the prosecution proves to be undoubtedly unfounded. Even the literal interpretation put forward by the Government cannot, therefore, produce the result that proceedings in cassation lie completely outside the scope of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",
                "Besides, the Court notes that, in fact, the English text of Article 6 (art. 6) does not contain any term equivalent to\" bien-fondé \"; it uses the much wider expression \"determination of ... any criminal charge\" ( décision sur toute accusation en matière pénale ). Thus, a criminal charge is not really \"determined\" as long as the verdict of acquittal or conviction has not become final. Criminal proceedings form an entity and must, in the ordinary way terminate in an enforceable decision. Proceedings in cassation are one special stage of the criminal proceedings and their consequences may prove decisive for the accused. It would therefore be hard to imagine that proceedings in cassation fall outside the scope of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",
                "Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention does not, it is true, compel the Contracting States to set up courts of appeal or of cassation. Nevertheless, a State which does institute such courts is required to ensure that persons amenable to the law shall enjoy before these courts the fundamental guarantees contained in Article 6 (art. 6) (see, mutatis mutandis, the judgment of 23rd July 1968 on the merits of the case \"relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium\", page 33, in fine). There would be a danger that serious consequences might ensue if the opposite view were adopted; the Principal Delegate of the Commission rightly pointed to those consequences and the Court cannot overlook them. In a democratic society within the meaning of the Convention, the right to a fair administration of justice holds such a prominent place that a restrictive interpretation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) would not correspond to the aim and the purpose of that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, the Wemhoff judgment of 27th June 1968, \"As to the Law\" paragraph 8)."

                "15. Before the Commission and the Sub-Commission, the Applicant maintained that the presence of a member of the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation at the deliberations of 21st June 1965 had violated Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. Without disputing that there is a considerable difference between the respective functions of the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation and the Procureur général ’ s department at the courts below, he stressed that in accordance with the law the former does sometimes appear as a party even though this did not happen in this case. Furthermore, the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation does, in the view of the Applicant, exercise supervision over the Procureurs généraux at the Court of Appeal (section 154 of the Act of 18th June 1869); a very strong statutory tie, therefore, links him with them, his subordinates, even if in practice the supervision in question is nowadays rather discreet. Again, the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation was, in the great majority of cases, the opponent - at any rate potential - of the convicted persons who appealed to the highest court in Belgium : the Procureur général usually submitted that their appeals should be dismissed and his opinion was nearly always adopted - as in this case - by the judges. Then the Applicant stressed that the Procureur général, after having developed his submissions at the end of the hearing in open court, also participated in its private deliberations from which the parties are excluded. This caused a violation of the rights of the defence and, particularly, of the principle of \"equality of arms\", as it was defined in the opinions given by the Commission in the Ofner, Hopfinger, Pataki and Dunshirn cases (Applications Nos. 524/59, 617/59, 596/59 and 789/60, Yearbook of the Convention, Vol. 6, pp. 696 to 706 and 730 to 732). The Applicant specified that he did not mean, however, to raise the slightest doubt as to the absolute conscientiousness with which the Court of Cassation fulfils its function or to suggest that the Procureur général ’ s department might attempt unduly to influence the court in any direction other than that of strict justice. In other words, Delcourt was not criticising persons but rather the institution which gave an advantage to the Procureur général ’ s department. Admittedly, the legislation in issue dated back for more than a century and a half and the Belgian Parliament had decided on two occasions that it did not need to amend it. The legislation, however, dated from a time of absolute monarchy and carried that stamp; furthermore, the incorporation of the Convention into the domestic law of a Contracting State necessarily \"kept bringing to light new controversial points which had not been noticed by the national legislature\".",
                "In his observations of 8th December 1967, almost two years after the lodging of the Application, Delcourt further complained that he had not been able to reply to the submissions of the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation: he had not been informed of this submission before the hearing of 21st June 1965 nor did he have the right to the last word at that hearing.",

In actual fact, this highest court in Belgium does not deal with the merits (fond) of cases (Article 95 of the Constitution and Section 17 of the Act of 4th August 1832); save in certain exceptional matters, irrelevant to this case, the Court of Cassation ’ s sole function is to decide questions of law. The Procureur général ’ s department is confined to assisting the Court in the exercise of its functions. That department does not, ordinarily, conduct prosecutions and it has not the character of a party (Article 37 of the Prince Sovereign ’ s Decree of 15th March 1815). In almost all cases it is completely independent of the Minister of Justice and has no right of direction over the Procureur général ’ s department which is attached to the courts of first instance and appeal and which is the prosecuting authority in normal cases. The participation of the Procureur général ’ s department at the deliberations of the Court of Cassation does not, therefore, conflict with the principle of \"equality of arms\", even when it is examined in the light of the precedents set by the Commission (Ofner, Hopfinger, Pataki and Dunshirn cases).",

The Government does not dispute that a member of the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation, after submitting in open court that the Applicant ’ s appeals should be refused, was present in a consultative capacity at the deliberations of 21st June 1965, but maintains that this did not involve any violation of the right guaranteed by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.",
                "That highest court in Belgium does not deal with the merits of cases (Article 95 of the Constitution and Section 17 of the Act of 4th August 1832). In spite of its judicial nature, which has been developed through a long evolution, the Court of Cassation fulfils a function which has never ceased to have some relation with the work of the legislature. Established in the interests of the law itself, the Court of Cassation judges judgments and not persons, save in certain exceptional matters which are irrelevant to the present case. It is not therefore the function of that Court to decide disputes concerning civil rights and obligations or to determine criminal charges ( décider, soit des contestations sur ses droits et obligations de caractère civil, soit du bien-fondé de toute accusation en matière pénale ) within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), as that provision has been interpreted in a series of decisions by the bodies set up to ensure the observance of the Convention.",
                "As regards the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation, it must be distinguished fundamentally from the Procureur général ’ s department attached to the courts below. As a general rule, it has not the character of a party (Article 37 of the Decree of 15th March 1815); in the very rare cases where under the relevant law the department assumes the position of a party and institutes prosecutions the Procureur général is not present at the deliberations (Article 39 of the Decree of 15th March 1815). As the Procureur général is not concerned with the question of the guilt of the accused, he is neither their adversary nor the tool of the prosecution. For example, there is nothing to prevent him from submitting to the Court that an appeal in cassation brought by the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Appeal should be dismissed or from putting forward on his own initiative grounds for setting aside a conviction; and there are statistics to show that this is often the case. The Procureur général ’ s department attached to the Court of Cassation is not, therefore, in alliance with the Procureur général ’ s department attached to the courts below; besides, the Procureur général at the Court of Cassation exercises, in practice, over that department supervision of a purely doctrinal and scientific nature without the least power of direction (Section 154 of the Act of 18th June 1869). Furthermore, the Procureur général at the Court of Cassation is entirely independent in his relations with the Minister of Justice.",
                "In short, the role of the Procureur général is of the same kind as the functions of the Court of Cassation itself: it consists, ordinarily, in no more than giving technical and objective assistance to the Court in order to ensure the observance of the law, consistency in judicial precedent and good drafting of the judgments. To sum up, the Procureur général attached to the Court of Cassation \"forms part of, and is identified with\", the Court like the judges. In these circumstances, the presence of one of the members of the Procureur général ’ s department at the deliberations did not upset the \"equality of arms\" to the detriment of the Applicant. There was some inequality in this case but it worked to the advantage of Delcourt; unlike him, the Procureur général ’ s departments attached to the lower courts whose decisions were challenged in cassation did not have an opportunity to put forward their arguments in open court on 21st June 1965 (Article 34 of the Decree of 15th March 1815); those departments did not even avail themselves of their right to reply in writing to the memorial filed by the appellant on 20th May 1965. In the Government ’ s view, the Delcourt case cannot be compared with the Pataki and Dunshirn cases; the present case is closer to the Ofner and Hopfinger cases in which the Commission and the Committee of Ministers did not find any violation of Article 6 (art. 6).",
                "For the rest, the legislation in dispute is more than a century and a half old, in which time it has never been subjected to criticism in Belgium by writers or the Bar who are, however, most attentive to everything which relates to the rights of the defence. On two occasions, Parliament decided explicitly to maintain this legislation, the first time without any change (at the time of the passing of the Act of 19th April 1949), the second time in substance and after examination of the question from the point of view of the Convention (Article 1109 of the 1967 Judicial Code). These circumstances raise something like a presumption in favour of the compatibility of the legislation in question with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1); they also show that the participation of the Procureur général ’ s department at the deliberations of the Court of Cassation does not open the door to abuse.",
                "As to Delcourt ’ s \"new\" complaints, they are inadmissible because they were not included in the original Application.

                "23. The Court recognises that it may be difficult to define exactly the field of application of paragraph 1 of Article 6 (art. 6-1). The Commission has delivered on this point a number of decisions in various particular cases - decisions which the Government invoked in its arguments but on which it is not incumbent on the Court to express an opinion in the present case. The Court, too, has had occasion to advert to certain aspects of the problem. It has ruled that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) does not apply to the procedure which regulates in Austria the examination of applications for provisional release ( Neumeister judgment of 27th June 1968, \"As to the Law\" paragraphs 22 and 23; Matznetter judgment of 10th November 1969, \"As to the Law\" paragraph 13). In another case the Court considered, but did not find it necessary to decide, the question whether cassation proceedings ought to be taken into account in appreciating the duration of a hearing for the purpose of applying the provision in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) requiring a hearing within a \"reasonable time\" (Wemhoff judgment of 27th June 1968, \"As to the Law\" paragraphs 18 and 20; see also Neumeister judgment, \"As to the Law\" paragraph 19). Now, however, the Court is called on to rule on the applicability of Article 6 (art. 6) to proceedings in cassation, though in a different context."
            ],
            [
                "24. The Government ’ s arguments are based, essentially on the words\" bien-fondé de toute accusation\" (\"in the determination of any criminal charge against him\") which delimit the scope of the application of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) in criminal cases. Article 95 of the Belgian Constitution provides that the Court of Cassation \"does not deal with the merits of the cases submitted to it\". Accordingly, in the Government ’ s view there is not, strictly speaking, a prosecution or a defence before that Court: prosecution and defence cease to exist the moment that the judges dealing with the merits give judgment in final instance, subject to the possibility of their being reborn in the event of the Court of Cassation referring a case back to a lower court after quashing the decision attacked. For the rest, the Court of Cassation does not go into the substance of the offences alleged against accused persons and judges not persons but judgments in regard to which it confines itself to supervising their validity. That Court does not therefore determine criminal charges (\" bien-fondé de toute accusation\"). This is always the position save only in certain exceptional matters which are irrelevant to the present case."
            ],
            [
                "25. The Court cannot accept this view. Judicial decisions always affect persons. In criminal matters, especially, accused persons do not disappear from the scene when the decision of the judges at first instance or appeal gives rise to an appeal in cassation. Although the judgment of the Court of Cassation can only confirm or quash such decision - and not reverse it or replace it - that judgment may rebound in different degrees on the position of the person concerned. He loses his status of a convicted person or, as the case may be, the benefit of his acquittal, at any rate provisionally, when a decision is set aside and the case is referred back to a trial court. A judgment in cassation sometimes has even more direct repercussions on the fate of an accused. If the highest court dismisses the appeal in cassation, the acquittal or conviction becomes final. If the Court of Cassation allows the appeal without ordering the case to be sent back, because, for example, the facts which led to the conviction do not constitute an offence known to the law (see Article 429 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the judicial decisions given thereon), then by its own sole decision it puts an end to the prosecution.",
                "Furthermore, the term\" bien-fondé \", which is found in the French text of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), refers not only to the accusation being well-founded in fact but also to its being well-founded in law. Thus, the supervision of validity which the Court of Cassation undertakes may lead it to hold that the lower courts, when examining the facts on which the charge was grounded, have acted in breach either of criminal law or of forms of procedure which are of an essential nature of are laid down on pain of nullity of the decision (see, for example, Section 17 of the Act of 4th August 1832); at least in the first of these cases the prosecution proves to be undoubtedly unfounded. Even the literal interpretation put forward by the Government cannot, therefore, produce the result that proceedings in cassation lie completely outside the scope of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",
                "Besides, the Court notes that, in fact, the English text of Article 6 (art. 6) does not contain any term equivalent to\" bien-fondé \"; it uses the much wider expression \"determination of ... any criminal charge\" ( décision sur toute accusation en matière pénale ). Thus, a criminal charge is not really \"determined\" as long as the verdict of acquittal or conviction has not become final. Criminal proceedings form an entity and must, in the ordinary way terminate in an enforceable decision. Proceedings in cassation are one special stage of the criminal proceedings and their consequences may prove decisive for the accused. It would therefore be hard to imagine that proceedings in cassation fall outside the scope of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",
                "Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention does not, it is true, compel the Contracting States to set up courts of appeal or of cassation. Nevertheless, a State which does institute such courts is required to ensure that persons amenable to the law shall enjoy before these courts the fundamental guarantees contained in Article 6 (art. 6) (see, mutatis mutandis, the judgment of 23rd July 1968 on the merits of the case \"relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium\", page 33, in fine). There would be a danger that serious consequences might ensue if the opposite view were adopted; the Principal Delegate of the Commission rightly pointed to those consequences and the Court cannot overlook them. In a democratic society within the meaning of the Convention, the right to a fair administration of justice holds such a prominent place that a restrictive interpretation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) would not correspond to the aim and the purpose of that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, the Wemhoff judgment of 27th June 1968, \"As to the Law\" paragraph 8)."

Thus, in order to determine whether Delcourt has been a victim of a violation of Article 6 (art. 6), it is necessary to examine what are, both in law and in practice, the functions exercised in a case of this kind by the Belgian Court of Cassation and by the Procureur général ’ s department attached to that Court.",

The Applicant complains in the first place of the fact that a member of the Procureur général ’ s department attached to the Court of Cassation, having made his submissions in open court, took part in its deliberations on 21st June 1965. It is beyond doubt that this participation was in conformity with the legislation in force in Belgium at that time; for under Article 39 of the Prince Sovereign ’ s Decree of 15th March 1815 \"in proceedings in cassation, the Procureur général (had) the right to be present, but without voting, when the Court (retired) to consider its decision\". The Court is therefore called upon to judge, in the first place, the compatibility of Article 39 of the Decree of 15th March 1815 with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention."

The Court, however, will examine the problem by reference to the whole of paragraph 1 of Article 6 (art. 6-1). The principle of equality of arms does not exhaust the contents of this paragraph; it is only one feature of the wider concept of fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal (see Neumeister judgment of 27th June 1968, \"As to the Law\" paragraph 22)."

                "29. In the present case, the two appeals to the Court of Cassation were both instituted by Delcourt; under Belgian law, the respondent party was not the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation but the Procureur général ’ s departments at whose behest the lower courts had pronounced the decisions under appeal, that is, the Procureur du Roi at Bruges and the Procureur général attached to the Court of Appeal at Ghent. The Applicant could thus claim, under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, full equality of treatment as against the Procureur général ’ s departments at those courts. In fact the undisputed information given to this Court shows that the Applicant did not suffer from any discrimination in this respect. Indeed, the Procureur général ’ s departments at the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal did not even avail themselves of their right to reply in writing to Delcourt ’ s memorial - and the relevant legislation did not even permit them to appear at the hearing before the Court of Cassation - still less be present at the deliberations.",
                "In contrast to the Procureur général ’ s department at the courts below, the Procureur général ’ s department at the Belgian Court of Cassation does not ordinarily conduct public prosecutions, nor does it bring cases before that court, nor does it either have the character of respondent and it \"cannot\", therefore, \"be considered as a party\" (Article 37 of the Decree of 15th March 1815). This situation only changes in certain exceptional matters which are irrelevant to the present case, and in those instances the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation is not present at the deliberations of the judges of the court.",
                "Yet it does not, however, necessarily follow from what precedes that Delcourt ’ s complaints are unfounded. The Court must therefore make a careful examination of the real position and functions of the Procureur général ’ s department attached to the Court of Cassation."
            ],
            [
                "30. A series of elements allows one to understand the point of view of the Applicant and the opinion of the minority of the Commission.",
                "First, the clear distinction which must be drawn, according to the Belgian Government, between the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation and the Procureur général ’ s department at the lower courts, does not always appear very evident from the legislative texts. The same names, such as Procureur général ’ s department ( ministère public), are used to designate different institutions - which easily causes confusion. Moreover, the departments attached to the courts of first instance, of appeal and of cassation seem to constitute, in certain aspects, one single corps. Thus, Section 154 of the Act of 18th June 1869 (replaced recently by Article 400 of the 1967 Judicial Code) provides that the Procureur général at the Court of Cassation \"shall exercise supervision over the Procureurs généraux attached to the courts of appeal\", and it is only an examination of the practice which reveals that this supervision does not involve any power to intervene in the conduct of given cases but merely to give general opinions on matters of doctrine.",
                "On a superficial glance at the situation, one might go so far as to wonder if the above-mentioned distinction really reflects the true position. The Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation sometimes acts as the moving party: the task, for example, falls to it sometimes to institute a prosecution or disciplinary proceedings against judges (see also Article 90 of the Constitution concerning the indictment of ministers on impeachment). Furthermore, its members are sometimes recruited from among the members of the Procureur général ’ s department at the courts below. Therefore, some litigants may quite naturally be inclined to view as an adversary a Procureur général or an Avocat général who submits that their appeals in cassation should be dismissed. They may be all the more inclined to do so when they find themselves deprived of any real debate before the highest court because the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Appeal only very rarely makes use of the right of reply – in any event restricted - which the law confers on it in proceedings in cassation. And one may imagine that such litigants can have a feeling of inequality if, after hearing a member of the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation make, in open court, final submissions unfavourable to their pleas, they see him withdraw with the judges to attend the deliberations held in the privacy of chambers.",
                "On this last point, Belgian legislation may well appear at first sight to be \"unusual\" - to recall a term used by one of the representatives of the respondent Government - and it does not seem to have any equivalent to-day in the other member States of the Council of Europe, at least in criminal cases. It may be noted, moreover, that the Avocat général at the Court of Justice of the European Communities, even though there are analogies between his functions and those of the Procureur général at the Belgian Court of Cassation, does not take part in the deliberations."

            [
                "31. The preceding considerations are of a certain importance which must not be underestimated. If one refers to the dictum \"justice must not only be done; it must also be seen to be done\" these considerations may allow doubts to arise about the satisfactory nature of the system in dispute. They do not, however, amount to proof of a violation of the right to a fair hearing. Looking behind appearances, the Court does not find the realities of the situation to be in any way in conflict with this right."

First, it is established that the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation functions wholly independently of the Minister of Justice, save in the exceptional matters which are irrelevant to this case. Thus, the Minister has no power to compel the Procureur général to make his submissions one way or the other, while he has the power to direct the institution of prosecutions by the Procureur général ’ s departments attached to the courts of first instance and appeal.",
                "Furthermore, as has already been observed, the Procureur général at the Court of Cassation exercises supervision over the officers of the Procureur général ’ s departments at the courts of first instance and appeal only in regard to matters of doctrine and does not give them injunctions or instructions. Thus, he is not entitled to instigate, or prevent the institution of, a prosecution before the lower courts or to intervene at any stage in the conduct of a case already brought before them, or to order the Procureur général ’ s department at a court of appeal to lodge or withdraw an appeal in cassation."

Nor is the Procureur général at the Court of Cassation the virtual adversary of the accused whose conviction or acquittal may lead to an appeal in cassation; nor does he become their actual adversary when he submits in open court that their arguments should not be accepted. No doubt it is equally true that the officers of the Procureur général ’ s department at the courts of first instance and appeal do not have the character of public accusers; indeed, Article 4 of Section VIII of the Decree of 16th-24th August 1790 so states expressis verbis. They also are bound to serve the public interest in all objectivity and, in particular, to ensure the observance of the laws concerned with public order; and they are to be considered parties only within the formal procedural meaning of the term. Their task, however, is in no way to be confused in criminal matters with that of the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation. Their task, in effect, is, before all else, to investigate and prosecute criminal offences in order to protect the safety of society (see, for example, Articles 22 and 271 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation, on the other hand, upholds a different interest, that which is concerned with the observance by the judges of the law and not with the establishment of the guilt or innocence of the accused.",
                "Incidentally, the Procureur général attached to the Court of Cassation exercises in civil matters functions close to those which he exercises in criminal matters. Yet no one could ever seriously suggest that he becomes the opponent of a litigant with whose case his submissions do not agree."

A close examination of the legislation in issue as it is applied in practice does not, however, disclose any such result. The Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation is, in a word, an adjunct and an adviser of the Court; it discharges a function of a quasi-judicial nature. By the opinions which it gives according to its legal conscience, it assists the Court to supervise the lawfulness of the decisions attacked and to ensure the uniformity of judicial precedent.",
                "Examination of the facts shows that these considerations are not abstract or theoretical but are indeed real and actual. The statistics cited at the hearing on 30th September 1969 are very striking on this point; they show that the Procureur général ’ s department at the Court of Cassation frequently either submits that appeals in cassation against a decision of acquittal brought by the Procureur général ’ s department at the courts of first instance or appeal should be dismissed or an appeal by a convicted person should be allowed, or even raises, ex officio, grounds which a convicted person has not relied on, has put forward out of time or has not formulated with sufficient clarity."

He further noted that in many countries there was no right of appeal against a pardon, which constituted the ultimate act of humanity.

He pointed out that the Government had not communicated to the Court the parliamentary committee's report of 26 September 2002 before the Court examined the issue of the admissibility of the applicant's complaints.

The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. There is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

In the instant case, on 25 March 2003, following a request for the reopening of the proceedings by the civil party, the General Prosecutor's Office of Georgia found that the parliamentary committee's findings in its report of 26 September 2002 did not constitute new factual or legal circumstances that could warrant reopening the applicant's case (see paragraph 89 above).",

Besides, even if an implied federal clause similar in content to that of Article 28 of the American Convention were found to exist in the European Convention (which is impossible in practice), it could not be construed as releasing the federal State from all responsibility, since it requires the federal State to “immediately take suitable measures, in accordance with its constitution ..., to the end that the [states forming part of the federation] may adopt appropriate provisions for the fulfillment of [ the] Convention”."

Indeed, for reasons of legal policy – the need to maintain equality between the States Parties and to ensure the effectiveness of the Convention – it could not be otherwise. But for the presumption, the applicability of the Convention could be selectively restricted to only parts of the territory of certain States Parties, thus rendering the notion of effective human rights protection underpinning the entire Convention meaningless while, at the same time, allowing discrimination between the States Parties, that is to say beween those which accepted the application of the Convention over the whole of their territory and those which did not."

The position in the present case is quite different: no State apart from Georgia exercised control – and therefore had jurisdiction – over the Ajarian Autonomous Republic and indeed it has not been suggested otherwise before the Court, quite the opposite (see paragraphs 132- 36 above). The present application also differs from that in Banković and Others, which was distinguishable from the two preceding cases, in that the respondent States – which were parties to the Convention and members of NATO – did not exercise “overall control” over the territory concerned.

In the instant case, the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal’s decision to convict of a separate offence in law had not altered the basis of the criminal charge, but simply constituted a different assessment of the degree to which the applicants had participated in the criminal bankruptcy offence.",
                "The Government contended that the notion of aiding and abetting, despite requiring three constitutive elements to be proved, was not really an autonomous one and was applied very flexibly by the courts. In particular, this was due to the difficulties that sometimes arose in distinguishing acts of aiding and abetting from acts committed jointly ( coaction ). The wording of former Article 60 of the Criminal Code, which had been in force at the material time, had contained deficiencies that the courts had sought to remedy through judicial interpretation in which aiding and abetting had on occasion been equated with acts committed jointly.",

Spain judgment of 24 October 1996, Reports 1996-V), especially as the offence the applicants were convicted of was among those mentioned in the order committing them for trial before the Criminal Court. The alternative verdict, which the applicants could have foreseen, had not fundamentally changed the nature of the accusation against them, involving as it did no more than a revised assessment of the degree of their participation.",

The fact that the investigating judge had not mentioned it in the committal order was not decisive for the purposes of Article 6 § 3 (a) of the Convention, as it had been referred to on at least one occasion during the course of the proceedings, and the Criminal Court and the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction in rem. Furthermore, as the additional submissions of the civil party, Chantiers Beneteau, had been lodged before the hearing of the appeal in the Court of Appeal, the applicants could easily have apprised themselves of them.

Although reference was made in the additional charges preferred on 4 and 16 December 1986 to provisions on both criminal bankruptcy and aiding and abetting criminal bankruptcy (see paragraph 22 above) – without specific reasons being stated – the Court finds that the investigation conducted by the investigating judge was clearly confined to the offence of criminal bankruptcy.

Admittedly, aiding and abetting, by its nature, is related to the substantive offence committed by the principal. Acts of accessories only become criminal by reference to offences committed by the principal, which explains the notion of “related criminality” ( emprunt de criminalité ). However, in addition to this first constituent element, aiding and abetting also requires a factual element, that is to say the commission of one of the specific acts referred to in former Article 60 of the Criminal Code, and an element of intent: the awareness by the accessory that he was assisting in the commission of the offence (see paragraph 36 above)."

The Court merely notes that it is plausible to argue that the defence would have been different from the defence to the substantive charge. On a charge of aiding and abetting, Mr Pélissier and Mr Sassi would have had to persuade the court, firstly, that they had not committed any of the statutorily defined acts of aiding and abetting and, secondly, if they were accused of specific acts of aiding and abetting, that they had been unaware that they were assisting in the commission of an offence. Further, the principle that criminal statutes must be strictly construed means that it is not possible to avoid having to make out the specific elements of aiding and abetting (see paragraph 36 above). The Court notes, too, that the notion of joint offending ( coaction ) referred to by the Government, as indeed that of joint enterprise ( complicité corespective ), concern special situations unrelated to the present case. In the instant case, the Court confines itself to noting that both the Toulon Criminal Court and the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal expressly discounted the possibility that the applicants were principals or, therefore, joint principals.

                "38. As regards the second and third criteria, the nature of the proceedings and the type and severity of the “penalty” (in the instant case the allegedly punitive award of compensation), the Court observes that, while the conditions for civil liability could in certain respects overlap, depending on the circumstances, with those for criminal liability, the civil claim was nevertheless to be determined on the basis of the principles that were proper to the civil law of tort. The outcome of the criminal proceedings was not decisive for the compensation case. The victim had a right to claim compensation regardless of whether the defendant was convicted or, as here, acquitted, and the compensation issue was to be the subject of a separate legal assessment based on criteria and evidentiary standards which in several important respects differed from those that applied to criminal liability. This is indeed borne out by the circumstances of the present case, where the compensation matter was the sole issue in the appeal before the Supreme Court, involving private parties only, which was heard in proceedings governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, with extensive new evidence being taken on that issue alone.",
                "In the view of the Court, the fact that an act that may give rise to a civil compensation claim under the law of tort is also covered by the objective constitutive elements of a criminal offence cannot, notwithstanding its gravity, provide a sufficient ground for regarding the person allegedly responsible for the act in the context of a tort case as being “charged with a criminal offence”. Nor can the fact that evidence from the criminal trial is used to determine the civil-law consequences of the act warrant such a characterisation. Otherwise, as rightly pointed out by the Government, Article 6 § 2 would give a criminal acquittal the undesirable effect of pre-empting the victim’s possibilities of claiming compensation under the civil law of tort, entailing an arbitrary and disproportionate limitation on his or her right of access to a court under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. This again could give a person who was acquitted of a criminal offence but would be considered liable according to the civil burden of proof the undue advantage of avoiding any responsibility for his or her actions. Such an extensive interpretation would not be supported either by the wording of Article 6 § 2 or any common ground in the national legal systems within the Convention community. On the contrary, in a significant number of Contracting States, an acquittal does not preclude the establishment of civil liability in relation to the same facts.",
                "Thus, the Court considers that, while exoneration from criminal liability ought to stand in the compensation proceedings, it should not preclude the establishment of civil liability to pay compensation arising out of the same facts on the basis of a less strict burden of proof (see, mutatis mutandis, X v. Austria, no. 9295/81, Commission decision of 6 October 1982, Decisions and Reports (DR) 30, p. 227, and C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11882/85, Commission decision of 7 October 1987, DR 54, p. 162). If the national decision on compensation were to contain a statement imputing criminal liability to the respondent party, this would raise an issue falling within the ambit of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention.",
                "In the present case the impugned national ruling on compensation, which appeared in a separate judgment from the acquittal, did not state, either expressly or in substance, that all the conditions were fulfilled for holding the applicant criminally liable with respect to the charges of which he had been acquitted (see paragraphs 17-19 above). The ensuing civil proceedings were not incompatible with, and did not “set aside”, that acquittal."

                "Contrary to what followed from the old Code of Criminal Procedure, it is not a condition for the examination of civil compensation claims that the accused person should have been convicted in respect of the charge. Thus, it is in principle possible to either reject or uphold a civil compensation claim, irrespective of the decision concerning criminal liability. This has its background in the fact that the injured party, who does not enjoy rights as a party in the criminal case, should not forfeit his or her compensation claim as a result of an acquittal in the criminal case. Although it will hardly be a frequent occurrence that the decision on the civil compensation claim goes in a different direction from that on criminal liability, this may happen for various reasons. Amongst others, the requirement of evidence for the criminal and the civil consequences of an action ... is different.",
                "By Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, a person who is charged with a criminal offence is to be deemed innocent until proved guilty. The presumption of innocence applies even after an acquittal (see in this connection the Sekanina case and the decision reported in Norsk Retstidende 1994, p. 721, dealing with the significance of the presumption of innocence in a case concerning the right of the accused to compensation after an acquittal).",

Even assuming that the Convention provision applies to the treatment of such claims, it has not been infringed as long as no disagreement or doubt has been expressed with regard to the decision on criminal liability. I cannot see that the arrangement under Norwegian criminal procedural law, whereby it is possible to have civil compensation claims determined after an acquittal, gives rise to any particular problems in relation to Article 6 § 2 [of the Convention]. Moreover, in the case at hand, it is above all the High Court’s decision concerning compensation which has been brought before the Supreme Court under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.”"

However, bearing in mind the burden which an allegation of reprehensible conduct might have for the defendant and the serious consequences it might have for his or her reputation, the requirement as to the strength of the evidence had to be stricter than that which applied to the test of the balance of probabilities. Nevertheless, the requirement could not be as strict as that which applied for establishing criminal liability. In a case of the kind under consideration, the test had to be whether on the balance of probabilities it was clearly probable that the alleged abuse had been committed."

In dealing with the particular facts of the appeal concerning compensation, the Supreme Court had regard to the video recording of the judicial examination of the alleged victim in the criminal proceedings before the High Court. The Supreme Court did not share the High Court’s view that the evidentiary value of the video recording was diminished by certain misgivings concerning the lack of synchronisation of sound and picture when shown to the High Court. Those shortcomings had been remedied before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court also had regard to evidence taken by it from this person, which deviated slightly from the judicial examination before the High Court. It further had regard to the statements of an expert witness and the statements of a therapist who had treated the alleged victim. Considering the evidence as a whole, Justice Gjølstad found that the evidence satisfied the standard of proof, establishing that sexual abuse had occurred and that, on the balance of probabilities, it was clear that the applicant was the abuser. Accordingly, there was a basis for awarding the victim compensation under section 3-5(1)(b) of the Damage Compensation Act. However, Justice Gjølstad emphasised that this decision was taken independently of the decision in the criminal case and that it did not undermine the acquittal. Finally, as regards the amount of compensation, she observed, inter alia, that she based her assessment on her finding that several infringements had occurred and that, even though their extent was not possible to ascertain with precision, there had been serious violations involving a certain use of force or threats, as a result of which G. had sustained damage.",

The test is normally the balance of probabilities and the burden of proof lies with the claimant. This burden may be heavier where liability may have serious consequences for the respondent’s reputation, though it will be less than for criminal liability.

The subjective constitutive elements in principle differ: normally criminal liability requires intent whereas liability to pay compensation requires gross or simple negligence. There may be exonerating circumstances – such as self-defence, necessity, provocation or ignorance – which exclude criminal liability but which do not exclude liability to pay compensation. A person of unsound mind may be exempted from criminal liability but not necessarily from civil liability to pay compensation (see Norges Offentlige Utredninger (Norwegian Official Reports) 2000:33, “ Erstatning til ofrene hvor tiltalte frifinnes for straff ” (“Compensation to victims in cases where the accused has been acquitted on the criminal charge”), a study by J.T.

The two systems also supplement one another in important respects. While criminal-law sanctions are particularly designed to deter actual and potential offenders from committing offences, those of the law of compensation are particularly designed to meet the aggrieved person’s need for economic redress (ibid. , Chapter 1, section 1.2.1).",

Relying on the Court’s interpretation of this expression, he submitted that, under domestic law, he had been formally considered to be charged until the acquittal gained legal force. Moreover, an award of compensation for non-pecuniary damage had a punitive purpose, was deliberately used to express the community’s disapproval of the act concerned and signalled that the wrong committed ought to be righted. This was apparent from the compensation award, which had undoubtedly served to weaken the applicant’s earlier acquittal."

Austria (judgment of 25 August 1993, Series A no. 266-A), in which it had attached primary weight to the degree of linkage between the criminal proceedings and the compensation case in its finding that Article 6 § 2 was applicable to the latter. The compensation claim had been pursued in the context of the accused’s acquittal. The Supreme Court had in its judgment of 5 June 1996 awarding G. compensation based itself to a significant extent on the evidence from the criminal proceedings before the High Court, thus showing that there was a connection between the two sets of proceedings.",

The Supreme Court had stated that, considered as a whole, the evidence satisfied the standard of proof for establishing that sexual abuse had occurred and that, on the balance of probabilities, it was clear that the applicant had committed acts of abuse against G. Its assessment had amounted to a finding of a criminal nature, in violation of the presumption of innocence. Only the applicable evidentiary standard had differed from that applicable to criminal liability, but the difference had been merely theoretical.

That right was not absolute but could be subject to limitations. In addition, the fact that the aggrieved party had received the assistance of the public prosecutor, backed by the entire State apparatus with regard to measures of investigation, could have adversely affected the defendant’s right to “equality of arms” in a manner incompatible with Article 6 § 1."

Austria (no. 28923/95, 10 July 2001), and to hold that Article 6 § 2 was not applicable and had not been violated. While the prosecution had acted as a defendant party in those cases, the present case had involved other types of litigants. The compensation proceedings had only involved counsel for the victim and for the applicant – two private civil parties. Moreover, there had been no link between the outcome of the criminal proceedings and the compensation case, the right of the victim to claim compensation being entirely independent of the criminal case. On essential points the legal basis and the legal issues in the civil compensation proceedings had differed from those in the criminal case. Thus, the criteria for civil and criminal liability had differed, as had the applicable evidentiary standards. Above all, the compensation case had not involved an assessment of the applicant’s criminal guilt. What was more, the appeal before the Supreme Court had been limited to the compensation case, had been governed by the Code of Civil Procedure and had comprised extensive new evidence not previously adduced at the criminal trial."

A fine – but absolutely essential – line had to be drawn between criminal and civil responsibility. The Convention principle of the presumption of innocence could not bar judicial or other authorities acting in civil matters from addressing the question whether the acquitted person had perpetrated the act that had formed the basis for the criminal charge against him. It would be unacceptable if an acquittal in a criminal case were binding upon any authority that was subsequently called upon to decide civil-law matters arising from the same set of facts. While a court would of course be bound by a finding that criminal responsibility had not been established, it should be free to establish the civil consequences flowing from the same set of facts. An acquittal could not have as a consequence a requirement that subsequent decisions in civil matters presume that the acquitted person had not perpetrated the act, if it was shown on the balance of probabilities that he or she nevertheless was the perpetrator. Such a view would indeed give rise to serious questions under the Convention itself, namely the right under Article 6 § 1 of access to a court for, inter alia, a victim claiming compensation under the civil law of tort."

            [
                "36. The Court reiterates that the concept of a “criminal charge” in Article 6 is an autonomous one. According to its established case-law, there are three criteria to be taken into account when deciding whether a person was “charged with a criminal offence” for the purposes of Article 6, namely the classification of the proceedings under national law, their essential nature and the type and severity of the penalty that the applicant risked incurring (see Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no. 41087/98, § 31, ECHR 2001-VII, and A.P., M.P. and T.P. v. Switzerland, judgment of 29 August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V, p. 1488, § 39). Moreover, the scope of Article 6 § 2 is not limited to criminal proceedings that are pending (see Allenet de Ribemont v. France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 16, § 35). In certain instances, the Court has also found the provision applicable to judicial decisions taken after the discontinuation of such proceedings (see in particular the following judgments: Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62, and Lutz, Englert and Nölkenbockhoff v. Germany, 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123), or following an acquittal (see Sekanina, Rushiti and Lamanna, cited above). Those judgments concerned proceedings relating to such matters as an accused’s obligation to bear court costs and prosecution expenses, a claim for reimbursement of his (or his heirs’) necessary costs, or compensation for detention on remand, matters which were found to constitute a consequence and the concomitant of the criminal proceedings.",
                "Accordingly, the Court will examine whether the compensation proceedings in the present case gave rise to a “criminal charge” against the applicant and, in the event that this was not the case, whether they were nevertheless linked to the criminal trial in such a way as to fall within the scope of Article 6 § 2."
            ],
            [
                "37. Turning to the first of the above-mentioned criteria, the classification of the proceedings under national law, the Court notes the applicant’s argument that, formally speaking, he remained “charged” until the acquittal gained legal force. However, this concerned only the initial criminal charges on which he was acquitted; it was of no relevance to the compensation claim. The Court notes that the latter had its legal basis in Chapter 3 of the Damage Compensation Act 1969, which sets out the general principles of the national law on torts applicable to personal injuries. It is clear from both the wording of section 3-5 and Norwegian case-law that criminal liability is not a prerequisite for liability to pay compensation. The compensation proceedings before the Supreme Court were governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and the claim was described in its judgment as being “civil”. Thus, the Court finds that the compensation claim in issue was not viewed as a “criminal charge” under the relevant national law."
            ],
            [
                "38. As regards the second and third criteria, the nature of the proceedings and the type and severity of the “penalty” (in the instant case the allegedly punitive award of compensation), the Court observes that, while the conditions for civil liability could in certain respects overlap, depending on the circumstances, with those for criminal liability, the civil claim was nevertheless to be determined on the basis of the principles that were proper to the civil law of tort. The outcome of the criminal proceedings was not decisive for the compensation case. The victim had a right to claim compensation regardless of whether the defendant was convicted or, as here, acquitted, and the compensation issue was to be the subject of a separate legal assessment based on criteria and evidentiary standards which in several important respects differed from those that applied to criminal liability. This is indeed borne out by the circumstances of the present case, where the compensation matter was the sole issue in the appeal before the Supreme Court, involving private parties only, which was heard in proceedings governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, with extensive new evidence being taken on that issue alone.",
                "In the view of the Court, the fact that an act that may give rise to a civil compensation claim under the law of tort is also covered by the objective constitutive elements of a criminal offence cannot, notwithstanding its gravity, provide a sufficient ground for regarding the person allegedly responsible for the act in the context of a tort case as being “charged with a criminal offence”. Nor can the fact that evidence from the criminal trial is used to determine the civil-law consequences of the act warrant such a characterisation. Otherwise, as rightly pointed out by the Government, Article 6 § 2 would give a criminal acquittal the undesirable effect of pre-empting the victim’s possibilities of claiming compensation under the civil law of tort, entailing an arbitrary and disproportionate limitation on his or her right of access to a court under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. This again could give a person who was acquitted of a criminal offence but would be considered liable according to the civil burden of proof the undue advantage of avoiding any responsibility for his or her actions. Such an extensive interpretation would not be supported either by the wording of Article 6 § 2 or any common ground in the national legal systems within the Convention community. On the contrary, in a significant number of Contracting States, an acquittal does not preclude the establishment of civil liability in relation to the same facts.",
                "Thus, the Court considers that, while exoneration from criminal liability ought to stand in the compensation proceedings, it should not preclude the establishment of civil liability to pay compensation arising out of the same facts on the basis of a less strict burden of proof (see, mutatis mutandis, X v. Austria, no. 9295/81, Commission decision of 6 October 1982, Decisions and Reports (DR) 30, p. 227, and C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11882/85, Commission decision of 7 October 1987, DR 54, p. 162). If the national decision on compensation were to contain a statement imputing criminal liability to the respondent party, this would raise an issue falling within the ambit of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention.",
                "In the present case the impugned national ruling on compensation, which appeared in a separate judgment from the acquittal, did not state, either expressly or in substance, that all the conditions were fulfilled for holding the applicant criminally liable with respect to the charges of which he had been acquitted (see paragraphs 17-19 above). The ensuing civil proceedings were not incompatible with, and did not “set aside”, that acquittal."

Furthermore, the purpose of establishing civil liability to pay compensation was, unlike that of establishing criminal liability, primarily to remedy the injury and suffering caused to the victim. The amount of the award – 75,000 Norwegian kroner – could be considered justified on account of the damage caused. It seems clear that neither the purpose of the award nor its size conferred on the measure the character of a criminal sanction for the purposes of Article 6 § 2."

In this particular case, the situation was reversed: despite the applicant’s acquittal it was legally feasible to award compensation.

Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuation decision in any other proceedings, the fair-trial guarantees of Article 6 § 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person’s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public.

There is also the issue of whether Dr Adams [for the applicant] may be correct in her view that fixed and dilated pupils seen by the ambulance crew was a sign of brain swelling at that time.",

Thirdly, although as we have already stated the amount of force required to cause the triad of injuries will in most cases be more than just rough handling, the evidence suggests that there will be rare cases when injuries will not correspond to the amount of force used.

Dr Barber described her as being calm and controlled at that time. The prosecution’s case at trial was that in the interval between Dr Barber leaving the house and 2.30am when [the applicant] telephoned the emergency services she must have violently and unlawfully shaken Patrick. In our judgment this history combined with the absence of findings of bruises to any part of the head, face or body; and the absence of fractures or any other sign apart from the triad of injuries, does not fit easily with the Crown’s case of an unlawful assault based on the triad of injuries, itself a hypothesis.”"

But, in this appeal the triad stands alone and in our judgment the clinical evidence points away from NAHI. Here the triad itself may be uncertain for the reasons already expressed. In any event, on our view of the evidence in these appeals, the mere presence of the triad on its own cannot automatically or necessarily lead to a diagnosis of NAHI.",

For all the reasons referred to we have concluded that it might. Accordingly the conviction is unsafe and this appeal must be allowed. The conviction will be quashed.”"

The facts of the case are far removed from the present case and the ratio decidendi of the decision does not assist in the resolution of this claim. It was simply that because the ground upon which Mullen’s conviction was quashed did not relate to the investigation or the conduct of the trial or the evidence led at it, so he was not entitled to compensation under Section 133.

In such circumstances, it is possible to say that if the facts in question had been before the jury, he would not have been convicted. The second is where there are acts or omissions in the course of the trial which should not have occurred and which so infringed his right to a fair trial that it is possible to say that he was ‘wrongly convicted’.

Lord Bingham’s observations about miscarriages of process seem to me to have no bearing on evidential miscarriage of justice cases. In evidential miscarriage of justice cases what is required is that the new or newly discovered fact must show beyond a reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage of justice.

But that proposition cannot avail this claimant. For – as the recital of the medical evidence heard by the Court of Appeal and by the trial jury demonstrates – there was powerful evidence against this claimant.

The most that could be said against the expert evidence given at this trial is that it might need adjustment in the light of new medical research and/or thinking. In any event, the medical evidence given at time of trial has not been demonstrated to be flawed, even in this limited sense. As the passages from the judgment of the CACD which I have cited show, this court’s decision went no further than to say that the differences of medical opinion needed to be resolved by a jury. Nor was this a case in which the jury was presented with a medical consensus that the triad was diagnostic of unlawful killing. The medical evidence called for the appellant accepted that it was consistent with unlawful killing but disputed that it necessarily led to that conclusion. The appeal was allowed because over the intervening years more possible force had emerged for the opinion voiced on the appellant’s behalf and now supported by Dr Squier’s evidence, which the jury had not heard and which the CACD, despite plain doubts about it, was not in a position wholly to dismiss.",

[I]t seems to me [that] the operation of the section poses very real difficulties if the broader definition [of miscarriage of justice] is adopted, for then it becomes necessary to ask in every case of conviction quashed on grounds of fresh evidence whether it satisfies the section 133 criterion of miscarriage proved beyond reasonable doubt or is merely a case of doubt raised to the extent that the conviction is unsafe.

Yet by article 14(6) it plainly requires something more than the quashing of the conviction before the right to compensation arises, namely that a miscarriage of justice be conclusively demonstrated by new or newly discovered facts. It does not seem to me that these provisions could co-exist in these terms if the consequence of article 14(2) was that nothing more could be required for compensation beyond the quashing of the conviction on the basis of new fact. ...",

In Sekanina the Commission ... expressly stated that article 6(2) ‘naturally’ does not prevent the same facts being relied upon, post acquittal on the merits, to found a civil claim against the defendant, and this must occur routinely, as also must subsequent child care cases. Yet in Orr v. Norway (no. 31283/04, 15 May 2008) the Court held that article 6(2) disabled the complainant in a rape case from recovering compensation post acquittal notwithstanding the different standard of proof attributable to the civil claim; the decision was grounded upon the manner in which the court expressed itself in dealing with the latter question.",
                "vi) The basis for the decisions in the Austrian and Norwegian cases was the closeness of the link between the decision to acquit on the merits and the decision as to compensation. In the Austrian cases the compensation decision was within the jurisdiction of the criminal court, albeit it was usually made by a differently constituted criminal court some time after the acquittal, as for example a confiscation order may be in England. Moreover, the court proceeded in part by analysing the decision of the trial jury. In the Norwegian cases the acquittal was made by a court composed of judges and jury, and the same judges went on more or less immediately to consider compensation. ...",
                "vii) By contrast, compensation in a fresh evidence case under article 14(6) and section 133 is not linked to any acquittal on the merits. Rather, it is to be paid when not only has there been a reversal of the conviction but also where the additional factor exists of a miscarriage of justice demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt, or conclusively, to have taken place.",
                "viii) It can no doubt be said ... that just as compensation for acquittal under the Norwegian scheme was described by the Court as a procedure whose object was ‘to establish whether the State had a financial obligation to compensate the burden it had created for the ... person by the proceedings it had instituted against him’ (see O v. Norway ...), so too is the scheme for compensation for miscarriage of justice under article 14(6). But that is to beg the question when the scheme in question creates such an obligation. If article 6(2) were to apply to claims under the scheme here under consideration, there would be no reason in logic or fairness to distinguish between those whose convictions are quashed on grounds of fresh evidence and those whose convictions are quashed on other grounds; each would be in the position of being able to rely on the presumption of innocence. Indeed, there would be no obvious reason for distinguishing between those who are convicted but whose convictions are quashed, and those who are acquitted at trial. But it is clear that article 14(6) does not provide for compensation to be paid except in the limited circumstances to which it refers.",

Director of Public Prosecutions [1974] AC 878] were right to reject the submission of counsel that the Court of Appeal had asked the wrong question by taking as the test the effect of the fresh evidence on their minds and not the effect that that evidence would have had on the mind of the jury ... I am not persuaded that the House laid down any incorrect principle in Stafford, so long as the Court of Appeal bears very clearly in mind that the question for its consideration is whether the conviction is safe and not whether the accused is guilty. But the test advocated by counsel in Stafford ... does have a dual virtue ... First, it reminds the Court of Appeal that it is not and should never become the primary decision-maker. Secondly, it reminds the Court of Appeal that it has an imperfect and incomplete understanding of the full processes which led the jury to convict. The Court of Appeal can make its assessment of the fresh evidence it has heard, but save in a clear case it is at a disadvantage in seeking to relate that evidence to the rest of the evidence which the jury heard. For these reasons it will usually be wise for the Court of Appeal, in a case of any difficulty, to test their own provisional view by asking whether the evidence, if given at the trial, might reasonably have affected the decision of the trial jury to convict. If it might, the conviction must be thought to be unsafe.”"

If the court concludes that the fresh evidence raises no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused it will dismiss the appeal. The primary question is for the Court itself and is not what effect the fresh evidence would have had on the mind of the jury.

Mr Mullen’s trial in England had been possible only because the British authorities had arranged his deportation from Zimbabwe in flagrant breach of local and international law. This emerged only after conviction and his appeal to the Court of Appeal, approximately seven years later, resulted in the quashing of his conviction on the ground that his deportation had involved abuse of process, namely a gross abuse of executive power. His claim for compensation under section 133, or the ex gratia scheme which existed in parallel at that time, was refused by the Secretary of State. In subsequent judicial review proceedings, the House of Lords unanimously found that section 133 did not require the payment of compensation for a miscarriage of justice in his case.

Plainly the expression includes the conviction of those who are innocent of the crime of which they have been convicted. But in ordinary parlance the expression would, I think, be extended to those who, whether guilty or not, should clearly not have been convicted at their trials. It is impossible and unnecessary to identify the manifold reasons why a defendant may be convicted when he should not have been. It may be because the evidence against him was fabricated or perjured. It may be because flawed expert evidence was relied on to secure conviction. It may be because evidence helpful to the defence was concealed or withheld. It may be because the jury was the subject of malicious interference. It may be because of judicial unfairness or misdirection. In cases of this kind, it may, or more often may not, be possible to say that a defendant is innocent, but it is possible to say that he has been wrongly convicted. The common factor in such cases is that something has gone seriously wrong in the investigation of the offence or the conduct of the trial, resulting in the conviction of someone who should not have been convicted.”"

It is a duty for all public authorities to refrain from prejudging the outcome of a trial, e.g. by abstaining from making public statements affirming the guilt of the accused. Defendants should normally not be shackled or kept in cages during trials or otherwise presented to the court in a manner indicating that they may be dangerous criminals.

Indeed, they argued that in Sekanina (cited above, § 25) the Court had found that Article 6 § 2 did not apply to such proceedings. They claimed that such an approach was consistent with the approach of the United Nations Human Rights Committee in W.J.H. v. the Netherlands (see paragraph 66 above). The refusal of compensation based on lack of eligibility could not be incompatible with Article 6 § 2; to hold otherwise would render meaningless the criteria and restrictions in Article 14 § 6 of the ICCPR and Article 3 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention."

Secondly, although the Government accepted that Article 6 § 2 had been found to apply to certain types of compensation proceedings, this was only where there was a close link with the prior criminal proceedings which had given rise to the claim. Here, by contrast, the decision on compensation was distinct and separate from the decision to quash the criminal conviction because it was generally taken by the executive and not the judiciary; it was taken pursuant to an administrative process and not in criminal proceedings; it could be based on different evidence, not considered at the trial itself; it was from a temporal aspect remote, as an application for compensation could be made up to two years after the reversal of the conviction; and it was made and provided on a confidential basis to the applicant. Although assessment of whether a miscarriage of justice had been conclusively demonstrated, as required by section 133 of the 1988 Act, involved some evaluation of the evidence that had led to the conviction in the first place, that process did not involve any infringement of the presumption of innocence and did not undermine the acquittal."

Norway, no. 30287/96, 11 February 2003; Hammern v. Austria, no. 28389/95, 21 March 2000; and Puig Panella v. Spain, no. 1483/02, 25 April 2006). Although in some cases concerning civil compensation proceedings the Court had found that Article 6 § 2 did not apply, the applicant stressed that in those cases courts were required to assess civil liability; whereas section 133 of the 1988 Act required an assessment of the basis of a person’s acquittal and what that acquittal said about criminal liability. Further, whereas in civil proceedings a balance had to be struck with the rights of third parties, no such balance was relevant here, as it was the State that was responsible for payment of compensation. In any event, the Court had found Article 6 § 2 applicable even in cases concerning civil proceedings where those proceedings resulted in the innocence of the applicant being questioned (citing Orr v. Norway, no. 31283/04, 15 May 2008)."

Croatia (no. 29889/04, § 41, 14 January 2010) to the effect that when criminal proceedings were discontinued, the presumption of innocence had to be preserved in “any other proceedings of whatever nature”.

In any case, the applicant contended that the award of compensation under section 133 of the 1988 Act was clearly closely linked to the criminal proceedings that had resulted in the conviction being quashed. It was evident from section 133 and the Supreme Court’s judgment in R (Adams) (see paragraph 63 above) that the key issue in compensation proceedings was the specific reason why the conviction was quashed, and that a decision on compensation required the decision-maker to examine the Court of Appeal judgment quashing the conviction. A refusal to compensate on the grounds identified in R (Adams) raised questions as to whether the State accepted that the person claiming compensation was genuinely innocent. This in itself was sufficient to find Article 6 § 2 applicable."

Spain, 6 December 1988, § 77, Series A no. 146, and Telfner v. Austria, no. 33501/96, § 15, 20 March 2001); legal presumptions of fact and law (see Salabiaku v.

Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuation decision in any other proceedings, the fair-trial guarantees of Article 6 § 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person’s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public. To a certain extent, the protection afforded under Article 6 § 2 in this respect may overlap with the protection afforded by Article 8 (see, for example, Zollman v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 62902/00, ECHR 2003 ‑ XII, and Taliadorou and Stylianou v.

To this extent, therefore, the presumption of innocence will remain after the conclusion of criminal proceedings in order to ensure that, as regards any charge which was not proven, the innocence of the person in question is respected.

Thus the Sekanina principle appears to seek to limit the principle established in Minelli to cases where criminal proceedings have been discontinued. The case-law shows that in the latter cases, the Minelli principle has been consistently cited as the applicable general principle (see Leutscher, § 29; Mulaj and Sallahi; Baars, §§ 26-27; the judgment in Capeau, § 22; A.L. v. Germany, § 31; Panteleyenko, § 67; and Grabchuk, § 42, all cited above).

However, if the national decision on compensation were to contain a statement imputing criminal liability to the respondent party, this would raise an issue falling within the ambit of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention (see Ringvold, cited above, § 38; Y v.

In all cases and no matter what the approach applied, the language used by the decision-maker will be of critical importance in assessing the compatibility of the decision and its reasoning with Article 6 § 2 (see, for example, Y v. Norway, cited above, §§ 43-46; O. v. Norway, cited above, §§ 39-40; Hammern, cited above, §§ 47-48; Baars, cited above, §§ 29-31; Reeves, cited above; Panteleyenko, cited above, § 70; Grabchuk, cited above, § 45; and Konstas v. Greece, no. 53466/07, § 34, 24 May 2011). Thus, in a case where the domestic court held that it was “clearly probable” that the applicant had “committed the offences ... with which he was charged”, the Court found that it had overstepped the bounds of the civil forum and had thereby cast doubt on the correctness of the acquittal (see Y v. Norway, cited above, § 46; see also Orr, cited above, § 51; and Diacenco, cited above, § 64). Similarly, where the domestic court indicated that the criminal file contained enough evidence to establish that a criminal offence had been committed, the language used was found to have violated the presumption of innocence (see Panteleyenko, cited above, § 70). In cases where the Court’s judgment expressly referred to the failure to dispel the suspicion of criminal guilt, a violation of Article 6 § 2 was established (see, for example, Sekanina, cited above, §§ 29-30, and Rushiti, cited above, §§ 30-31). However, when regard is had to the nature and context of the particular proceedings, even the use of some unfortunate language may not be decisive (see paragraph 125 above). The Court’s case-law provides some examples of instances where no violation of Article 6 § 2 has been found even though the language used by domestic authorities and courts was criticised (see Reeves, cited above, and A.L. v.

It is relevant to the overall context of the present case that the applicant’s conviction was quashed by the CACD on the ground that it was “unsafe” because new evidence might have affected the jury’s decision had it been available at trial (see paragraph 20 above). The CACD did not itself assess all the evidence, in the light of the new evidence, in order to decide whether guilt had been established beyond reasonable doubt. No retrial was ordered as the applicant had already served her sentence of imprisonment by the time her conviction was quashed (see paragraphs 21, 26 and 34 above). Pursuant to section 2(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, the quashing of the applicant’s conviction resulted in a verdict of acquittal being entered (see paragraph 45 above). However, the applicant’s acquittal was not, in the Court’s view, an acquittal “on the merits” in a true sense (compare and contrast Sekanina and Rushiti, both cited above, where the acquittal was based on the principle that any reasonable doubt should be considered in favour of the accused). In this sense, although formally an acquittal, the termination of the criminal proceedings against the applicant might be considered to share more of the features present in cases where criminal proceedings have been discontinued (see, for example, Englert, Nölkenbockhoff, Lutz, and Mulaj and Sallahi, all cited above; Roatis v.

These criteria were, put concisely, that the claimant had previously been convicted; that she had suffered punishment as a result; that an appeal had been allowed out of time; and that the ground for allowing the appeal was that a new fact showed beyond reasonable doubt that there had been a miscarriage of justice. The criteria reflect, with only minor linguistic changes, the provisions of Article 3 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention, which must be capable of being read in a manner which is compatible with Article 6 § 2. The Court is accordingly satisfied that there is nothing in these criteria themselves which calls into question the innocence of an acquitted person, and that the legislation itself did not require any assessment of the applicant’s criminal guilt."

It is clear that an acquittal in the course of an appeal within time would not give rise to any right to compensation under section 133 of the 1998 Act. Similarly, an acquittal on appeal based on inadequate jury directions or the admission of unfair evidence would not satisfy the criteria set out in section 133. It was for the domestic courts to interpret the legislation in order to give effect to the will of the legislature and in doing so they were entitled to conclude that more than an acquittal was required in order for a “miscarriage of justice” to be established, provided always that they did not call into question the applicant’s innocence. The Court is not therefore concerned with the differing interpretations given to that term by the judges in the House of Lords in R (Mullen) and, after the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the present case, by the judges in the Supreme Court in R (Adams). What the Court has to assess is whether, having regard to the nature of the task that the domestic courts were required to carry out, and in the context of the judgment quashing the applicant’s conviction (see paragraph 127 above), the language they employed was compatible with the presumption of innocence guaranteed by Article 6 § 2."

To this extent, the context of the proceedings obliged the High Court and, subsequently, the Court of Appeal to evaluate the judgment of the CACD in the light of the section 133 criteria."

Having examined the previous cases which had come before the courts on the question of section 133 compensation, he considered that it was outwith the language of section 133 to describe a case in which a jury might have reached a different conclusion as showing beyond reasonable doubt that there had been a miscarriage of justice (see paragraph 30 above). In the applicant’s case, the medical evidence heard by the CACD and the trial jury demonstrated that there was “powerful evidence” against the applicant, and it would have been for a jury to determine the issue (see paragraph 31 above). He concluded that the CACD had only decided that the new evidence, when taken with the evidence given at trial, “created the possibility” that a jury “might properly acquit” the applicant.

It later said that the decision of the CACD did “not begin to carry the implication” that there was no case for the applicant to answer, and that there was “no basis for saying” on the new evidence that there was no case to go to a jury (see paragraph 38-39 above)."

It is true that in discussing whether the facts of the applicant’s case fell within the meaning of “miscarriage of justice”, both the High Court and the Court of Appeal referred to the contrasting interpretations given to that phrase by Lord Bingham and Lord Steyn in the House of Lords in R (Mullen). As Lord Steyn had expressed the view that a miscarriage of justice would only arise where innocence had been established beyond reasonable doubt, there was necessarily some discussion of the matter of innocence and the extent to which a judgment of the CACD quashing a conviction generally demonstrates innocence. Reference was made in this regard to the Explanatory Report to Protocol 7 to the Convention, which explains that the intention of Article 3 of that Protocol was to oblige States to provide compensation only where there was an acknowledgment that the person concerned was “clearly innocent” (see paragraph 72 above). It is wholly understandable that when seeking to identify the meaning of an ambiguous legislative notion such as “miscarriage of justice” that has its origins in provisions figuring in international instruments – in the event, Article 14 § 6 of the ICCPR and Article 3 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention – national judges should refer to the international case-law on those provisions and to their drafting history setting out the understanding of their drafters. However, the Explanatory Report itself provides that, although intended to facilitate the understanding of the provisions contained in the Protocol, it does not constitute an authoritative interpretation of the text (see paragraph 71 above). Its references to the need to demonstrate innocence must now be considered to have been overtaken by the Court’s intervening case-law on Article 6 § 2. But what is important above all is that the judgments of the High Court and the Court of Appeal did not require the applicant to satisfy Lord Steyn’s test of demonstrating her innocence. The High Court in particular emphasised that the facts of R (Mullen) were far removed from those of the applicant’s case and that the ratio decidendi of the decision in R (Mullen) did not assist in the resolution of her case (see paragraph 27 above)."

In assessing whether a “miscarriage of justice” had arisen, the courts did not comment on whether, on the basis of the evidence as it stood at the appeal, the applicant should be, or would likely be, acquitted or convicted. Equally, they did not comment on whether the evidence was indicative of the applicant’s guilt or innocence. They merely acknowledged the conclusions of the CACD, which itself was addressing the historical question whether, had the new evidence been available prior to or during the trial, there would nonetheless have been a case for the applicant to answer.

In this respect, the Court emphasises that pursuant to the law of criminal procedure in England, it is for a jury in a criminal trial on indictment to assess the prosecution evidence and to determine the guilt of the accused. The CACD’s role in the applicant’s case was to decide whether the conviction was “unsafe”, within the meaning of section 2(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (see paragraph 43 above); and not to substitute itself for the jury in deciding whether, on the basis of the evidence now available, the applicant’s guilt had been established beyond reasonable doubt. The decision not to order a retrial in the applicant’s case spared her the stress and anxiety of undergoing another criminal trial. She did not argue that there ought to have been a retrial. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal referred extensively to the judgment of the CACD to determine whether a miscarriage of justice had arisen and did not seek to reach any autonomous conclusions on the outcome of the case.

In the Court ’ s view, in the particular circumstances the absence of a written translation of the indictment neither prevented him from defending himself nor denied him a fair trial.

Despite the protestations voiced in his letters of 21 April and 4 May 1981 to the presiding judge of the trial court (see paragraph 32 above), it is clear that, as a result of the oral explanations given to him, Mr Kamasinski sufficiently understood the judgment and its reasoning to be able to lodge, with the assistance of Dr Schwank, his newly-appointed defence counsel, an appeal against sentence and an extensive plea of nullity challenging many aspects of the trial and the judgment (see paragraphs 34, 35 and 39 above). Consequently, no breach of Article 6 § 3 (e) (art. 6-3-e) has been substantiated in this respect."

During the proceedings at first instance he had been denied the rights guaranteed to the defence by Article 6 §§ 2 and 3 (art. 6-2, art. 6-3) of the Convention. In addition, he had not received a fair trial in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) and he had been the victim of discrimination in breach of Article 14 (art. 14), notably because of differential treatment between German-speaking and non-German-speaking defendants. The nullity proceedings had been unfair because he had not had the opportunity of commenting on the evidence obtained by the Supreme Court in its inquiry. There had been discrimination in the appeal proceedings since, unlike an accused at liberty and the \"civil parties\" in his own case, he had not been allowed to attend the public hearing before the Supreme Court. Contrary to Article 13 (art. 13), he had not had available to him under Austrian law an effective remedy to redress alleged violations of Article 6 (art. 6)."

Following the trial Dr Steidl was himself replaced by Dr Schwank shortly after asking the Bar Association to be discharged from his duties as defence counsel (see paragraph 33 above).",

                "\"The Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective ....

It follows from the independence of the legal profession from the State that the conduct of the defence is essentially a matter between the defendant and his counsel, whether counsel be appointed under a legal aid scheme or be privately financed. The Court agrees with the Commission that the competent national authorities are required under Article 6 § 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) to intervene only if a failure by legal aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or sufficiently brought to their attention in some other way."

Thus, he visited Mr Kamasinski in prison on nine occasions, he lodged a complaint against the decision to remand in custody and he filed written and telephone motions for the attendance of witnesses (see paragraphs 14, 17 and 18 above).

This request cannot be regarded as tantamount to notifying the trial court that there were grounds to intervene as regards his legal representation. In contrast, after the trial and his conviction Mr Kamasinski made a written request on 6 April 1981 for the appointment of a new lawyer on the ground that he did \"not get along with Dr Steidl\". This post-trial request was repeated in, inter alia, letters of 21 April and 4 May 1981 to the presiding judge, where Mr Kamasinski alleged that Dr Steidl had not correctly defended him (see paragraphs 31 and 32 above).",

Although the presiding judge did not reply directly to Mr Kamasinski ’ s pre-trial letters, the Court has no reason to doubt that he did discuss them with Dr Steidl (see paragraph 19 in fine above).

Whilst this provision does not specify that the relevant information should be given in writing or translated in written form for a foreign defendant, it does point to the need for special attention to be paid to the notification of the \"accusation\" to the defendant.

The other lawyers, who had been retained by the applicant's family, found it impossible to contact him while he was in police custody. Moreover, in view of the unusual circumstances of his arrest, the applicant was the principal source of direct information on events in Nairobi that would have been relevant, at that point in the proceedings, for the purposes of challenging the lawfulness of his arrest.",

Lastly, solely with regard to the length of time the applicant was held in police custody, the Court takes into account the seriousness of the charges against him and the fact that the period spent in police custody did not exceed that permitted by the domestic legislation.

In that connection, they observed firstly that the applicant had been convicted under Article 125 of the Criminal Code, the aim of which was to protect the democratic values of the Republic. The Criminal Divisions of the Turkish Court of Cassation, sitting in plenary session, had held that the PKK was an organisation that resorted to force and acts of violence with a view to bringing about the secession of part of Turkish territory to form a Kurdish State with a political regime based on Marxist-Leninist ideology. The acts of violence perpetrated by the PKK and acknowledged by the applicant at his trial had involved some 6,036 armed attacks on civilians, 8,257 armed confrontations with the security forces, 3,071 bomb attacks, 388 armed robberies and 1,046 kidnappings. Those acts came within the list of terrorist acts set out in Articles 1 and 2 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. The Government noted that the applicant had admitted before the courts that he had played a role in the creation and organisation of the PKK and in the planning and perpetration of acts of violence committed by members of that organisation."

They said that the applicant had been provided with every facility for the preparation of his defence: he had been able to consult the lawyers of his choice during both the preliminary investigation and the trial and, with the exception of the first visit, the only restrictions to which his lawyers'visits had been subject were those set out in the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The 17,000 -page case file had, in fact, been compiled from the case files in seven sets of criminal proceedings that had already been instituted in various national security courts several years before the applicant's arrest, and the applicant was already familiar with the papers. In any event, very few new documents had been added to the case file. The Government asserted that the National Security Court had communicated all the relevant documents to the applicant and allowed him to study the case file and any annexes he wished to see under the supervision of two officials. It had also informed the applicant that it would provide him with a copy of any document he thought might assist him with his defence.

The Court reiterates that Article 6 may also be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with it ( see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, p. 13, § 36). The manner in which Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) are applied during the investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings and the facts of the case. Article 6 will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer from the initial stages of police interrogation. However, this right, which is not explicitly set out in the Convention, may be subject to restrictions for good cause. The question, in each case, is whether the restriction, in the light of the entirety of the proceedings, has deprived the accused of a fair hearing ( see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports 1996-I, pp. 54-55, § 63).",

If a lawyer were unable to confer with his client and receive confidential instructions from him without such surveillance, his assistance would lose much of its usefulness, whereas the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective ( see S. v. Switzerland, judgment of 28 November 1991, Series A no. 220, pp. 15- 16, § 48). The importance to the rights of the defence of ensuring confidentiality in meetings between the accused and his lawyers has been affirmed in various international instruments, including European instruments (see Brennan v. the United Kingdom, no. 39846/98, §§ 38-40, ECHR 2001-X). However, as stated above ... restrictions may be imposed on an accused's access to his lawyer if good cause exists. The relevant issue is whether, in the light of the proceedings taken as a whole, the restriction has deprived the accused of a fair hearing.",
                "... In the present case, the Court accepts ... that the applicant and his lawyers were unable to consult out of the hearing of the authorities at any stage. It considers that the inevitable consequence of that restriction, which was imposed during both the preliminary investigation and the trial, was to prevent the applicant from conversing openly with his lawyers and asking them questions that might prove important to the preparation of his defence. The rights of the defence were thus significantly affected.",
                "... The Court observes in that connection that the applicant had already made statements by the time he conferred with his lawyers and made further statements at hearings before the National Security Court after consulting them. If his defence to the serious charges he was required to answer was to be effective, it was essential that those statements be consistent. Accordingly, the Court considers that it was necessary for the applicant to be able to speak with his lawyers out of the hearing of third parties.",
                "... As to the Government's contention that the supervision of the meetings between the applicant and his lawyers was necessary to ensure the applicant's security, the Court observes that the lawyers had been retained by the applicant himself and that there was no reason to suspect that they threatened their client's life. They were not permitted to see the applicant until they had undergone a series of searches. Mere visual surveillance by the prison officials, accompanied by other measures, would have sufficed to ensure the applicant's security.”",

It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court's task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial ( see Quaranta v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 May 1991, Series A no. 205, p. 16, § 30). In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to'guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective'and that assigning a counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused ( see Artico v. Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 15- 16, § 33). The Court also points out that the manner in which Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) are to be applied during the preliminary investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings involved and on the circumstances of the case; in order to determine whether the aim of Article 6 – a fair trial – has been achieved, regard must be had to the entirety of the domestic proceedings conducted in the case ( see Imbrioscia, cited above, pp. 13- 14, § 38).",

The Court further notes that the presentation of those highly complex charges generated an exceptionally voluminous case file ... It considers that in order to prepare his defence to those charges the applicant required skilled legal assistance equal to the complex nature of the case. It finds that the special circumstances of the case did not justify restricting the applicant to a rhythm of two one-hour meetings per week with his lawyers in order to prepare for a trial of that magnitude.",

With respect to the Government's argument that visits took place in accordance with the frequency and departure times of the ferries between the island of İmralı and the coast, the Court considers that, while the Government's decision to hold the applicant in an island prison far from the coast is understandable in view of the exceptional security considerations in the case, restricting visits to two one-hour visits a week is less easily justified. It notes that the Government have not explained why the authorities did not permit the lawyers to visit their client more often or why they failed to provide more adequate means of transport, thereby increasing the length of each individual visit, when such measures were called for as part of the'diligence'the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner ( see Colozza [ v.

As to the Government's argument that the applicant's lawyers organised press conferences after each visit and acted as spokespersons for the PKK, the Court holds that any such conduct on their part could not justify the restrictions in issue, since restrictions cannot be placed on the rights of the defence for reasons that are not directly related to the trial.

It should so far as possible be interpreted in harmony with other rules of public international law of which it forms part (see, mutatis mutandis, Al-Adsani v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97, § 55, ECHR 2001-XI, and Loizidou v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2231, § 43). It must, however, confine its primary attention to the issues of interpretation and application of the provisions of the Convention that arise in the present case.",
                "... It is recalled that the Court accepted in Soering that an established practice within the member States could give rise to an amendment of the Convention. In that case the Court accepted that subsequent practice in national penal policy, in the form of a generalised abolition of capital punishment, could be taken as establishing the agreement of the Contracting States to abrogate the exception provided for under Article 2 § 1 and hence remove a textual limit on the scope for evolutive interpretation of Article 3 ( ibid., pp. 40-41, § 103). It was found, however, that Protocol No. 6 showed that the intention of the States was to adopt the normal method of amendment of the text in order to introduce a new obligation to abolish capital punishment in time of peace and to do so by an optional instrument allowing each State to choose the moment when to undertake such an engagement. The Court accordingly concluded that Article 3 could not be interpreted as generally prohibiting the death penalty (ibid., pp. 40-41, §§ 103-04).",
                "... The applicant takes issue with the Court's approach in Soering. His principal submission was that the reasoning is flawed since Protocol No. 6 represents merely one yardstick by which the practice of the States may be measured and that the evidence shows that all member States of the Council of Europe have, either de facto or de jure, effected total abolition of the death penalty for all crimes and in all circumstances. He contended that as a matter of legal theory there was no reason why the States should not be capable of abolishing the death penalty both by abrogating the right to rely on the second sentence of Article 2 § 1 through their practice and by formal recognition of that process in the ratification of Protocol No. 6.",
                "... The Court reiterates that the Convention is a living instrument which must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions and that the increasingly high standard being required in the area of the protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspondingly and inevitably requires greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fundamental values of democratic societies (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 101, ECHR 1999-V).",

It reiterates that in assessing whether a given treatment or punishment is to be regarded as inhuman or degrading for the purposes of Article 3 it cannot but be influenced by the developments and commonly accepted standards in the penal policy of the member States of the Council of Europe in this field (see Soering, cited above, p. 40, § 102). Moreover, the concepts of inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment have evolved considerably since the Convention came into force in 195 3 and indeed since the Court's judgment in Soering in 1989.",
                "... Equally the Court observes that the legal position as regards the death penalty has undergone a considerable evolution since Soering was decided. The de facto abolition noted in that case in respect of twenty-two Contracting States in 1989 has developed into a de jure abolition in forty-three of the forty-four Contracting States and a moratorium in the remaining State that has not yet abolished the penalty, namely Russia. This almost complete abandonment of the death penalty in times of peace in Europe is reflected in the fact that all the Contracting States have signed Protocol No. 6 and forty-one States have ratified it, that is to say, all except Turkey, Armenia and Russia [ [1] ]. It is further reflected in the policy of the Council of Europe, which requires that new member States undertake to abolish capital punishment as a condition of their admission into the organisation. As a result of these developments the territories encompassed by the member States of the Council of Europe have become a zone free of capital punishment.",

Such a marked development could now be taken as signalling the agreement of the Contracting States to abrogate, or at the very least to modify, the second sentence of Article 2 § 1, particularly when regard is had to the fact that all Contracting States have now signed Protocol No. 6 and that it has been ratified by forty-one States. It may be questioned whether it is necessary to await ratification of Protocol No. 6 by the three remaining States before concluding that the death penalty exception in Article 2 § 1 has been significantly modified. Against such a consistent background, it can be said that capital punishment in peacetime has come to be regarded as an unacceptable ... form of punishment that is no longer permissible under Article 2.”"

At the date of this judgment, three member States have not signed this Protocol and sixteen have yet to ratify it. However, this final step towards complete abolition of the death penalty – that is to say both in times of peace and in times of war – can be seen as confirmation of the abolitionist trend in the practice of the Contracting States.

                "“ ... Since the right to life in Article 2 of the Convention ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions of the Convention – one from which there can be no derogation in peacetime under Article 15 – and enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe, its provisions must be strictly construed (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, § 147), a fortiori the second sentence of Article 2 § 1.",
                "... Even if the death penalty were still permissible under Article 2, the Court considers that an arbitrary deprivation of life pursuant to capital punishment is prohibited. This flows from the requirement that'[e] veryone's right to life shall be protected by law'. An arbitrary act cannot be lawful under the Convention ( see Bozano, cited above, p. 23, § 54, and pp. 25-26, § 59).",
                "... It also follows from the requirement in Article 2 § 1 that the deprivation of life be pursuant to the'execution of a sentence of a court', that the'court'which imposes the penalty be an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of the Court's case-law ( see Incal, cited above; Çıraklar, cited above; Findlay v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports 1997-I; and Hauschildt v. Denmark, judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154), and that the most rigorous standards of fairness be observed in the criminal proceedings both at first instance and on appeal. Since the execution of the death penalty is irreversible, it can only be through the application of such standards that an arbitrary and unlawful taking of life can be avoided (see, in this connection, Article 5 of ECOSOC Resolution 1984/50 and the decisions of the United Nations Human Rights Committee ...; also Advisory Opinion OC-16/99 of 1 October 1999 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on'The right to information on consular assistance in the framework of the guarantee of due process of law', §§ 135 ‑ 36, and Hilaire, Constantine and Benjamin et al. v. Trinidad and Tobago, § 148 ...). Lastly, the requirement in Article 2 § 1 that the penalty be'provided by law'means not only that there must exist a basis for the penalty in domestic law but that the requirement of the quality of the law be fully respected, namely that the legal basis be'accessible'and'foreseeable'as those terms are understood in the case-law of the Court (see Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 56, ECHR 2000-II, and Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 52, ECHR 2000-V).",

The applicant was not questioned by the security forces when he was blindfolded. The Court accepts the Government's explanation that the purpose of that precaution was not to humiliate or debase the applicant but to ensure that the transfer proceeded smoothly and it acknowledges that, in view of the applicant's character and the reaction to his arrest, considerable care and proper precautions were necessary if the operation was to be a success.",

Reactions to his arrest and differences of opinion that have come to light within his own movement show that his life is genuinely at risk.

It is also air-conditioned, has washing and toilet facilities and a window overlooking an inner courtyard. The applicant appears to be under medical supervision that is both strict and regular.

He does, however, communicate with the outside world by letter. He sees a doctor every day and his lawyers and members of his family once a week (his lawyers were allowed to see him twice a week during the trial).

This made it impossible to study documents, and detainees had to speak quite loudly to be heard. As a result, other detainees, and the warder walking along the line of booths, could hear conversations between the applicant and his lawyer.

No other furniture can be seen on the photographs. The flushing system for the toilet consisted of a water tap above it. Apparently, this was the only source of water, so the applicant had to drink and wash himself from that very same tap above the toilet. The platform on which the applicant had to sleep adjoined the toilet area and was separated from it by a low partition, which was only slightly above the level of the platform.

IZ 77/7 in Moscow, where he was detained until his departure to the “ colony-settlement ” on 23 July 2005. In his original submissions and observations the applicant did not develop any specific complaints under Article 3 of the Convention concerning that remand prison.

As follows from the parties'submissions, the detainees were transported in prison vans measuring 11. 3 square metres for thirty-six detainees or 8.9 square metres for twenty-five detainees. On the basis of these figures it is difficult to establish exactly how much floor space each detainee had; as follows from the plans of the prison vans provided by the Government, albeit not to scale, part of the floor space (about one - third) was taken up by one or two single-occupancy cells and the compartment for the guards. It appears that in the shared cells the detainees had between 0.2 and 0.3 square metres of floor space per person."

Russia, ( no. 42239/02, § 28, 31 July 2008 ) the authority in charge of remand centres in Moscow described the conditions of transportation in 2002 - 2003 as follows:",
                "“ ... The Department of Execution of Sentences controls the [resolution of] problems relating to the existing breaches by the convoy regiment (late return from the courts, overcrowded prison vans, use of unauthorised routes). On many occasions in 2002 the established breaches of the procedure for transport of prisoners were brought to the attention of the command of the convoy regiment ... The assembly premises are indeed overcrowded if there are many defendants going to the courts ... up to 150 persons, whereas the assembly premises are designed ... to accommodate 75 to 80 persons.”",

Even assuming that the number of detainees in the prison van did not exceed twenty-five or thirty-six (depending on the model), this does not in itself refute the applicant's allegation that he was transported in “cramped conditions” (see the Court's findings in Starokadomskiy, cited above, § 55). The Court observes in this connection that the CPT has considered individual compartments measuring 0.4, 0.5 or even 0.8 square metres to be unsuitable for transporting a person, no matter how short the duration (see CPT/ Inf (2004) 36 [Azerbaijan], § 152; CPT/ Inf (2004) 12 [Luxembourg], § 19; CPT/ Inf (2002) 23 [Ukraine], § 129; CPT/ Inf (2001) 22 [Lithuania], § 118; CPT/ Inf (98) 13 [Poland], § 68). In addition, the height of the compartments (1.6 or 1.64 metres ) was clearly not sufficient for a man of normal stature to enter or stand up without hunching, which required the detainees to remain in a seated position at all times while inside the van."

However, it is difficult to believe that the average journey time was as short as indicated by the Government. First of all, the Government admitted that on some occasions the prison van used a longer route. Further, it is unclear how many stops the prison van usually made between remand prison no. IZ 77/1 and the final destination. The Court recalls that in the Starokadomskiy case, which concerned the same remand prison and the same period of time, the Government admitted that the applicant had been transported by a route which included other courts and remand centres ( ibid., § 52). Further, the applicant in that case was woken up at 6 a.m. The vans normally left the remand centre between 9 and 10.40 a.m. and returned before 6.30 p.m. ( ibid., § 26). As follows from the Government's submissions in the present case, the applicant was woken up at about the same time and arrived at the courthouse at 10 a.m. (on twenty-four occasions), at 11 a.m. (on fifty-four occasions), or even later. The Court notes that the Government did not produce any logbooks for the transfers. In their absence it is difficult to establish the average duration of the journeys to the courthouse. However, it is clear that, with all the intermediate stops and “alternative routes ” the average travel time was significantly longer than that indicated by the Government (see also the reply from the Ministry of Justice concerning the delays in transporting the detainees, cited in paragraph 59 above)."

It is unclear what that evasive formula meant; in the absence of further clarifications from the Government the Court concludes that the detainees did not receive proper hot meals in the courthouses, but dry food only."

In Russia detention orders are issued by the first ‑ instance court at the request of the prosecution and are subject to appeal. It is the “speediness” of the review of the appeal which is at the heart of the applicant's complaint under Article 5 § 4. The question whether a person's right to a “speedy review” of his applications for release has been respected will be determined in the light of the circumstances of each case; in complex cases the examination of an application for release may take more time than in simple ones. In Baranowski v. Poland (no. 28358/95, ECHR 2000-III), it took the domestic courts five months to examine an application for release. In that case the Government showed that the domestic court had commenced the examination of the first application for release as early as the day after it had been submitted and that, subsequently, it had on five occasions adjourned the examination of the relevant applications because evidence had to be taken from three experts. However, despite these arguments, the Court found a violation of Article 5 § 4. In Samy v. the Netherlands ( ( dec .), no. 36499/97, 4 December 2001), concerning the detention of aliens for the purposes of expulsion, the Court found that a period of twenty-five days was compatible with Article 5 § 4. By contrast, in Rehbock v. Slovenia (no. 29462/95, § 85, ECHR 2000-XII) the Court found that the application for release had been examined twenty-three days after it had been lodged with the first-instance court, and that that was not a “speedy” examination as required by Article 5 § 4. A delay of seventeen days has also been declared incompatible with this provision (see Kadem v. Malta, no. 55263/00, § 43, 9 January 2003). In Lebedev v. Russia (no. 4493/04, § § 98 et seq., 25 October 2007 ) the Court held that delays of forty and sixty-seven days constituted a breach of Article 5 § 4 as far as the appeal proceedings were concerned."

Indeed, the Supreme Court had to analyse various legal arguments submitted by the defence, which concerned the form and substance of the detention order of 1 December 2003. However, that is a normal task of any appellate court in such cases. The decision of the Supreme Court in the case at hand was fully based on the case file, no new evidence being produced by the parties or examined by the court; the decision was not very complicated and did not go beyond the examination of the issue of detention.

In other words, given the purpose of the detention proceedings, and the circumstances in which the courts have to take decisions, the procedural guarantees under Article 5 § 4 need not be the same as under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention ( see, for example, Wassink v. the Netherlands, 27 September 1990, § 33, Series A no. 185 ‑ A ).

Thus, provided that a public hearing has been held at first instance, a less strict standard applies to the appellate level, at which the absence of such a hearing may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue (see, for instance, Helmers v. Sweden, 29 October 1991, § 36, Series A no. 212-A; Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 58, Series A no. 115; and Fredin v.

He considered that his physical absence as such from the courtroom prevented him from presenting his case in an adequate manner and on an equal footing with the opposite party. However, the Court does not share the applicant's view. The Court reiterates that “ the physical presence of an accused in the courtroom is highly desirable, but it is not an end in itself: it rather serves the greater goal of securing the fairness of the proceedings, taken as a whole” ( see Golubev v.

It is unclear how easy it was for the applicant to speak to his lawyers on the spot, that is, during the actual hearings.

Complaints were then forwarded to the governor of the remand prison, who decided on them. However, those routine visits were not recorded. Therefore, the Government were unable to say who had spoken to the applicant on 24, 30 December 2003 and 5 January 2004, and on what matter. As to the reasons for the applicant's transfer to another cell on 30 December 2003, the Government claimed that it had been due to the fact that the applicant was a former official of a law-enforcement agency, and, in addition, suffered from certain chronic diseases."

Turkey, 16 September 1996, Reports 1996-IV, § 105; Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, § 105; and Kurt v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, § 159).

Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, § 130, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV ). In previous cases the Court has had regard to the vulnerable position of applicant villagers and the reality that in south-east Turkey complaints against the authorities might well give rise to a legitimate fear of reprisals, and found that the questioning of applicants about their applications to the Commission amounted to a form of illicit and unacceptable pressure, which hindered the exercise of the right of individual petition, in breach of former Article 34 of the Convention (ibid.). Even an informal “interview” of the applicant, let alone his or her formal questioning in respect of the Strasbourg proceedings, may be regarded as a form of intimidation (see, by contrast, Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia [GC], no. 60654/00, § § 117 et seq, , ECHR 2007 ‑ II )."

The Court cannot exclude that the authorities approached the applicant in connection with the subject matter of his complaints before the Court. However, not every inquiry by the authorities about an application pending before the Court can be regarded as “intimidation”. The Court emphasises that Article 34 does not prevent the State from taking measures in order to improve the applicant's situation or even from solving the problem which is at the heart of the Strasbourg proceedings. As a result of the contacts between the applicant and the prison officials (if any) he was transferred to another cell on 30 December 2003, where conditions were somewhat better. In such circumstances the Court concludes that the actions of the authorities cannot be described as “ improper ”.

Certainly the primary purpose of Article 6 (art. 6) as far as criminal matters are concerned is to ensure a fair trial by a \"tribunal\" competent to determine \"any criminal charge\", but it does not follow that the Article (art. 6) has no application to pre-trial proceedings. The \"reasonable time\" mentioned in paragraph 1 (art. 6-1), for instance, begins to run from the moment a \"charge\" comes into being, within the autonomous, substantive meaning to be given to that term (see, for example, the Wemhoff v. Germany judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 7, pp. 26-27, para. 19, and the Messina v. Italy judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no. 257-H, p. 103, para. 25); the Court has occasionally even found that a reasonable time has been exceeded in a case that ended with a discharge (see the Maj v. Italy judgment of 19 February 1991, Series A no. 196-D, p. 43, paras. 13-15) or at the investigation stage (see the Viezzer v. Italy judgment of 19 February 1991, Series A no. 196-B, p. 21, paras. 15-17). Other requirements of Article 6 (art. 6) - especially of paragraph 3 (art. 6-3) - may also be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with them (see, inter alia, the following judgments: Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 38-39, para. 91; Luedicke, Belkacem and Koç v.

In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to \"guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective\" and that assigning a counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused (see the Artico judgment previously cited, Series A no. 37, p. 16, para. 33).",

Certainly the primary purpose of Article 6 (art. 6) as far as criminal matters are concerned is to ensure a fair trial by a \"tribunal\" competent to determine \"any criminal charge\", but it does not follow that the Article (art. 6) has no application to pre-trial proceedings. The \"reasonable time\" mentioned in paragraph 1 (art. 6-1), for instance, begins to run from the moment a \"charge\" comes into being, within the autonomous, substantive meaning to be given to that term (see, for example, the Wemhoff v. Germany judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 7, pp. 26-27, para. 19, and the Messina v. Italy judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no. 257-H, p. 103, para. 25); the Court has occasionally even found that a reasonable time has been exceeded in a case that ended with a discharge (see the Maj v. Italy judgment of 19 February 1991, Series A no. 196-D, p. 43, paras. 13-15) or at the investigation stage (see the Viezzer v.

Other requirements of Article 6 (art. 6) - especially of paragraph 3 (art. 6-3) - may also be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with them (see, inter alia, the following judgments: Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 38-39, para. 91; Luedicke, Belkacem and Koç v.

In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to \"guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective\" and that assigning a counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused (see the Artico judgment previously cited, Series A no. 37, p. 16, para. 33).",

                "The defence submissions do not allege any breach of the rules governing the procedure followed during the judicial investigation or at the trial, but it is argued in them that under the provisions of the Customs Code relied on by the prosecution a person in possession of the goods is deemed responsible for customs evasion, and all those who come within specified categories are deemed to have an interest in customs evasion, in both cases regardless of their good faith or their intention, such that these provisions provide for a presumption of guilt which makes them incompatible with the provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and of the International Covenant, which provide that ‘ everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ’ and that ‘ everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law ’.",
                "It was pointed out that the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has held that the presumption of innocence is one of the ingredients of a fair trial and that applying provisions which remove the burden of proof from the prosecution puts the defendant at a disadvantage, negates the equality of arms to his detriment, and, ultimately, deprives him of a fair trial.",
                "But while it is true that the customs authorities do not have to prove bad faith on the part of the person in possession of the smuggled goods or of the person having an interest in customs evasion, they must establish the physical fact of possession and show that the defendant in some way took part, as a person having an interest, in an offence of smuggling or of undeclared importation or that he belongs to one of the categories of those who are deemed to have a direct interest in customs evasion.",
                "It is the special nature of customs offences, which are complete as soon as the smuggled goods cross the border, that compels the legislature to define them as offences which are made out as soon as the physical acts which disclose their existence have been evidenced on French territory.",
                "The special nature of these offences does not, however, deprive the offender of any possibility of raising a defence, seeing that the law provides that a person in possession can exonerate himself by proving force majeure and that an interest in customs evasion cannot be imputed to anyone who has acted from necessity or as a result of an unavoidable mistake.",
                "It appears from the evidence in the file that Pham, who was remanded in custody on 7 January 1984 and released under judicial supervision on 6 March 1984 and was acquitted by the court below, was consistently presumed innocent and had every possibility of putting forward the grounds allowed him by the law in order to exonerate himself.",
                "That being so, there is no incompatibility in this case between the impugned provisions and the principles laid down in the conventions relied on, seeing that the customs authorities are prosecuting Pham for an offence of unlawfully importing strictly prohibited goods, namely 2,835 grams of heroin base or almost pure heroin, a commodity whose importation is strictly prohibited on account of its harmfulness to public health and of the damage its consumption causes both to the users ’ physical health and to the social order.",
                "In the face of a scourge affecting young people more particularly and which is spreading alarmingly, the impugned provisions of the Customs Code, which were applied in conformity with the rules laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure, can be seen as the response made within the constitutional framework and the limits of a European State ’ s sovereignty to offences that are particularly serious and call for appropriate special punishment.",

Study of the file was also ordered in the cases of those convicted by a criminal court of first instance or appeal who were not in custody but whose sentence was above a certain level, the level apparently having varied over time.",
                "In all cases, if the Chairman indicated that he was unable to appoint a colleague, he qualified this by saying that he would have the file studied by one of his colleagues if his attention was drawn to a point of law that could be submitted for review by the Court of Cassation. Study of the file was in fact ordered fairly generously once counsel before a court of trial or of appeal had drawn the attention of the Chairman of the Bar to a specific point.",
                "It is to be noted that such precautions were necessary, not only because of the small size of the Conseil d ’ État and Court of Cassation Bar but also because appeals to the Court of Cassation in criminal cases (except in respect of judgments in associated civil-party proceedings) have a suspensive effect. It was important that the hearing of appeals that could not be sustained should not be systematically delayed on the ground that the file was being officially studied (or that counsel had been officially assigned to it).",
                "It must not be overlooked that when a file is allocated to counsel, he is given a deadline. Moreover, when pleadings are produced, the Court of Cassation is obliged to give a reasoned judgment, after the case has been examined by a reporting judge; whereas when an appeal is not supported in that way, the case is automatically entered in a list known as the ‘ formal list ’ because the Court of Cassation essentially considers only whether the impugned judgment is free from any formal defect; in actual fact, it also satisfies itself that the statutory maximum sentence has not been exceeded.",
                "In 1985 the Chairman of the Conseil d ’ État and Court of Cassation Bar who had then been elected became concerned about the increasing number of applications made to him for official assignment of counsel and the number of official appointments he had to make for study of files in accordance with the foregoing criteria; the number of such appointments had indeed increased from 110 in 1975 to 200 in 1985.",
                "He felt it his duty, on his own initiative, to make a slight alteration if not to the actual criteria, at least to the letter previously sent to those applying for an official assignment of counsel or to lawyers applying for it on their behalf. In these replies he ceased to mention automatically that counsel would be officially instructed to study the file if a point of law was brought to his attention; and he also changed the criterion for an official appointment, in respect of applicants who were not in custody, to a two-year prison sentence (instead, apparently, of one year previously).",

The Court reiterates that the admissibility of evidence is primarily governed by the rules of domestic law, and that, as a rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them. The task of the Convention organs is to ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (ibid., p. 10, § 26). All evidence must normally be produced in the presence of the accused at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. However, the use in evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him either when he was making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Saïdi v. France, judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 56, § 43, and A.M. v. Italy, no. 37019/97, § 25, ECHR 1999-IX).

Therefore, the Court accepts that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that such measures can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence (see Baegen v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1995, Series A no. 327-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 44, § 77). In securing the rights of the defence, the judicial authorities may be required to take measures which counterbalance the handicaps under which the defence labours (see Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, p. 471, § 72, and P.S. v. Germany, no. 33900/96, § 23, 20 December 2001)."

Nor can it be said that the applicant was denied his rights under Article 6 § 3 (d) on the ground that he was unable to examine or have examined the evidence given by M. during the trial and appeal proceedings. Having regard to the special features of criminal proceedings concerning sexual offences (see paragraph 47 above), this provision cannot be interpreted as requiring in all cases that questions be put directly by the accused or his or her defence counsel, through cross-examination or by other means. The Court notes that the videotape of the first police interview was shown during the trial and appeal hearings and that the record of the second interview was read out before the District Court and the audiotape of that interview was played back before the Court of Appeal. In the circumstances of the case, these measures must be considered sufficient to have enabled the applicant to challenge M.'s statements and his credibility in the course of the criminal proceedings. Indeed, that challenge resulted in the Court of Appeal reducing the applicant's sentence because it considered that part of the charges against him had not been proved."

The Court of Appeal has had further regard to the following circumstances. The general impression of the video-recording is that [M.] has talked about something he has indeed experienced and that it has been embarrassing and painful for him to give this information. This may explain his unwillingness to go into detail about specific incidents. [M.] has not shown any tendency to exaggerate his statements and has corrected the interrogator on several occasions. Furthermore, in some respects his statements can be said to contain more personal observations, for example, 'Of course, I did not want to touch his but sometimes I did it without gloves' and 'First I asked if I would get any (refers to pastilles). He did not have any and then I did it voluntarily but I do not know why'. It should further be noted that no information has come to hand which could reasonably explain why [M.] would make untrue statements about events which he obviously considers to be shameful. Also of importance is the information given by [M.'s] mother and teacher which describes how [M.'s] personality has changed since the alleged injustice. The fact that it was a long time before [M.] spoke about what he experienced is easily explained by the feelings of guilt he has had and by the fact that thinking about the incidents is distasteful to him. [M.'s] accounts do not contain any improbable elements, neither is the information given by him contradicted by other statements. In view of what has now been said, the Court of Appeal finds that [M.] is credible and that his statements should form the basis for the Court of Appeal's assessment of whether [the applicant] has behaved towards him in the manner indicated by the public prosecutor in his statement on the charges.”",

The suspect and his defence counsel are always entitled to attend an interview which takes place following a request made by the suspect himself. This right, however, does not manifest itself until a person has been informed of the suspicions against him in accordance with Chapter 23, section 18, of the Code. As far as other interviews are concerned, counsel for the defence may attend if his attendance will not harm the investigation. It is for the person who heads the preliminary investigation – a police officer or a public prosecutor – to decide who may attend a specific interview during the preliminary investigation.

In the case in question, published in Nytt juridiskt arkiv ((NJA) 1992, pp. 532 et seq.), the court quashed a judgment by a court of appeal and referred the case back to the latter court for re-examination. The reason for this was that the appellate court, as well as the first-instance court, had allowed the prosecutor to use in evidence written records of a police interview with the injured party in a case concerning indictment for robbery. It had not been possible to serve a summons on the injured party to attend the main hearing. The court of appeal had been of the opinion that the information submitted by the injured party to the police had to be given credit and convicted the defendant of robbery. The Supreme Court, on the other hand, emphasised that Article 6 of the Convention and its application and interpretation was of major importance in respect of the application of Chapter 35, section 14, of the Code. In the light of the fact that the European Court of Human Rights had come to the conclusion that there was a breach of Article 6 when a court relied on statements in support of a conviction by a person who had not been heard by the court and whom the defendant had not had the opportunity to question in some other context, the Supreme Court in its turn came to the conclusion that that provision of the Code should be applied more restrictively than was called for by its wording and what appeared to be the original intentions behind the provision.

The first-mentioned case concerned the alleged sexual abuse of a minor, aged 14, who could not give evidence in court on account of mental problems. The evidence consisted mainly of information supplied by the injured party to the police. The police interview had been recorded on videotape. The Supreme Court came to the conclusion that it was inevitable that the value of such statements as evidence was not the same as the value of statements made during the main hearing. Even so, the evidence in that case, that is the injured party's testimony together with other evidence, was deemed to be strong enough for a conviction."

The interviews had taken place in the absence of the suspect and his defence counsel. They were given the opportunity to examine the information and to request that additional information be provided prior to indictment. However, defence counsel was of the opinion that further questioning would prove pointless since, in his view, the injured parties would only repeat from memory what they had submitted previously. The Supreme Court stated that, bearing in mind that the accused had chosen not to request a further examination, his right to a fair trial could not be seen as having been breached on account of the fact that the videotapes had been used as evidence against him. As far as the evaluation of the evidence was concerned, the Supreme Court stressed the fact that the injured parties had only been questioned out of court and that it could not therefore assess their credibility and the trustworthiness of their information by means of impressions conveyed through a direct examination in court. It followed, according to the Supreme Court, that the information submitted by the injured parties should be assessed with particular care. The fact that the accused had been prevented from putting questions to the injured parties through his defence counsel and that the court itself had also been prevented from doing so pointed in the same direction. According to the Supreme Court this did not mean, however, that the videotaped interviews could not be sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The injured parties' submissions, combined with other evidence, led the Supreme Court to the conclusion that the judgment should be based on, inter alia, the submissions in question.",

In his submission, since the object of the system was to prevent the examination from being too critical, the thinking behind the system had to be that the police were not as critical as counsel for the defence. That was probably correct, a fact that was devastating for the legal certainty of the accused.

He asserted that, if there was a desire to protect victims of crime from being harmed by hearings, defence counsel and cross-examinations, the accused would have to be acquitted in such cases.

The Court reiterates that the admissibility of evidence is primarily governed by the rules of domestic law, and that, as a rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them. The task of the Convention organs is to ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (ibid., p. 10, § 26). All evidence must normally be produced in the presence of the accused at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. However, the use in evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him either when he was making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Saïdi v. France, judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 56, § 43, and A.M. v. Italy, no. 37019/97, § 25, ECHR 1999-IX). The Court further draws attention to the fact that Article 6 does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court. It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a witness (see, among other authorities, Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, § 89)."

In regard to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the statements made by M. were virtually the sole evidence on which the courts' findings of guilt were based. The witnesses heard by the courts – M.'s mother and his schoolteacher – had not seen the alleged acts and gave evidence only on the perceived subsequent changes in M.'s personality. The District Court stated that the outcome of the case was entirely dependent on the credibility of M.'s statements and the Court of Appeal considered that this was of decisive importance in determining the applicant's guilt. It must therefore be examined whether the applicant was provided with an adequate opportunity to exercise his defence rights within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention in respect of the evidence given by M."

Such proceedings are often conceived of as an ordeal by the victim, in particular when the latter is unwillingly confronted with the defendant. These features are even more prominent in a case involving a minor. In the assessment of the question whether or not in such proceedings an accused received a fair trial, account must be taken of the right to respect for the private life of the perceived victim. Therefore, the Court accepts that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that such measures can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence (see Baegen v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1995, Series A no. 327-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 44, § 77). In securing the rights of the defence, the judicial authorities may be required to take measures which counterbalance the handicaps under which the defence labours (see Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, p. 471, § 72, and P.S. v.

While accepting that the courts were generally hesitant in letting children give evidence in person, the Government referred to a few cases where minors had actually appeared before the courts. The Court notes that these cases, decided after the applicant's conviction, concerned requests made by the public prosecutor. In view of the apparent absence of cases where counsel for the defence has successfully requested the cross-examination of a minor and noting that the parties have expressed similar opinions on the general practice followed by the Swedish courts in this matter, the Court accepts the applicant's view that, in the circumstances of the case, he could not have obtained the appearance of M. in person before the courts."

However, he consented not to be present, notwithstanding the resulting handicap to the defence, and he also accepted the manner in which the interview was to be conducted. It was open to the applicant's counsel to ask for a postponement of the interview until such time as M.'s counsel was free to attend. However, he chose not to do so. It was also open to him to request that the second interview be videotaped, which would have enabled him to satisfy himself that the interview had been conducted fairly.

Having regard to the special features of criminal proceedings concerning sexual offences (see paragraph 47 above), this provision cannot be interpreted as requiring in all cases that questions be put directly by the accused or his or her defence counsel, through cross-examination or by other means. The Court notes that the videotape of the first police interview was shown during the trial and appeal hearings and that the record of the second interview was read out before the District Court and the audiotape of that interview was played back before the Court of Appeal. In the circumstances of the case, these measures must be considered sufficient to have enabled the applicant to challenge M.'s statements and his credibility in the course of the criminal proceedings.

In its judgment of 6 May 1996 the Court of Appeal noted that the questioning of children during pre-trial investigations must meet high standards with regard to procedure and content. The court took into account the fact that some of the information given by M. had been vague and uncertain and lacking in detail.

Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, Series A no. 194-A, p. 12, § 34, and Lüdi, cited above, p. 21, § 47), it may prove necessary in certain circumstances to refer to depositions made during the investigative stage (in particular, where a witness refuses to repeat his deposition in public owing to fears for his safety, a not infrequent occurrence in trials concerning Mafia-type organisations). If the defendant has been given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge the depositions, either when made or at a later stage, their admission in evidence will not in itself contravene Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d). The corollary of that, however, is that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see Unterpertinger v.

Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, pp. 32-33, § 33). Thus, where a deposition may serve to a material degree as the basis for a conviction, then, irrespective of whether it was made by a witness in the strict sense or by a co-accused, it constitutes evidence for the prosecution to which the guarantees provided by Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention apply (see, mutatis mutandis, Ferrantelli and Santangelo v.

The Constitutional Court thereby enabled trial courts to admit statements made by a co-accused in connected proceedings, irrespective of whether the person against whom they were being used had been given the opportunity of examining the maker of the statement or of having him examined at any stage in the proceedings.

If the defendant has been given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge the depositions, either when made or at a later stage, their admission in evidence will not in itself contravene Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d). The corollary of that, however, is that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see Unterpertinger v.

Thus, where a deposition may serve to a material degree as the basis for a conviction, then, irrespective of whether it was made by a witness in the strict sense or by a co-accused, it constitutes evidence for the prosecution to which the guarantees provided by Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention apply (see, mutatis mutandis, Ferrantelli and Santangelo v.

Belgium judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, para. 89), that the failure to hear the witnesses in question had been incompatible with Article 6 (art. 6). The Brussels Court of Appeal had found that there were a number of items of evidence which, taken together, were in its opinion sufficient to dispel any doubt as to the applicant ’ s guilt. After examining the matter it had considered that the investigative measure requested was not necessary for establishing the truth. Moreover, its decision had been a unanimous one, as required by Article 211 bis of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 27 above), which constituted a safeguard for the defence."

On 26 October 1984 the Liège Court of Appeal had, however, sentenced the applicant to three years ’ imprisonment, suspended, on the sole basis of the case-file and the allegations of Mr Bosch Hernandez (see paragraph 15 above).",

This request appeared on page 26 of his counsel ’ s submissions of 19 November 1985. On pages 3-4 and 21-23 his counsel explained in some detail why the evidence of Mr Scohy appeared to him to be likely to fill in certain deficiencies in the investigation (see paragraph 19 above). He did not specify what purposes would be served by the calling of Mr Bodart, Mr Dauphin and Mr Dausin as witnesses, but given the context it could scarcely be doubted that he wished them to be questioned about the rumours Mr Scohy had spoken of to Mr Derriks on 29 August 1983 (see paragraph 11 above).",

On 11 December 1985, basing its decision on the earlier statements by Mr Bosch Hernandez, who was no longer involved in the case, and the promissory note signed by the applicant, it sentenced him to four years ’ imprisonment, not suspended, in view of the \"extremely serious\" nature of the offences (see paragraphs 18-19 above). On 12 February 1986 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant ’ s second appeal, based inter alia on Article 6 (art. 6) (see paragraph 20 above)."

Spain judgment of 6 December 1988, Series A no. 146, p. 31, para. 68). More specifically, Article 6 para. 3 (d) (art. 6-3-d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses, in the \"autonomous\" sense given to that word in the Convention system (see, as the most recent authority, the Asch v. Austria judgment of 26 April 1991, Series A no. 203, p. 10, para. 25); it \"does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused ’ s behalf: its essential aim, as is indicated by the words ‘ under the same conditions ’, is a full ‘ equality of arms ’ in the matter\" (see the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 38-39, para. 91, and the above-mentioned Bricmont v.

Moreover, the Brussels Court of Appeal gave no reasons for its rejection, which was merely implicit, of the submissions requesting it to call Mr Scohy, Mr Bodart, Mr Dauphin and Mr Dausin as witnesses.",

This is all the more the case as the Brussels Court of Appeal increased the sentence which had been passed on 26 October 1984, by substituting four years for three years and not suspending the sentence as the Liège Court of Appeal had done."
