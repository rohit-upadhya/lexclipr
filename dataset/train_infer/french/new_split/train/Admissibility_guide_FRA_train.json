                "78. The Court reiterates that, following the posting of the above-mentioned comments on the first applicant’s Facebook page, the LGL Association requested the Prosecutor General’s Office to open criminal proceedings against the authors of those comments, which the LGL Association considered to be of a criminal nature (see paragraph 17 above). Subsequently, the LGL Association consistently appealed against the prosecutor’s and the court’s rulings that those comments had been merely unethical and lacked the constitutive elements of a crime (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above). The Court attaches considerable significance to the fact that the LGL Association’s capacity to represent the applicants’ interests before the prosecutors and the courts at two levels of jurisdiction has never been questioned or challenged in any way. As a matter of fact – and irrespective of whether the applicants’ complaint to the LGL Association and their request for criminal proceedings to be initiated in respect of the comments on the first applicant’s Facebook page were submitted to the prosecutor and included in the criminal case file – those authorities dealt with the application and appeals submitted to them without any objections as to standing, regardless of their conclusion as to the merits of the complaint (see paragraphs 18, 20-21 and 23 above; see also Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC], no. 47848/08, § 110, ECHR 2014)."

                "79. Furthermore, the Court cannot but note that under Lithuanian law, any person can notify the law-enforcement authorities that a crime may have been committed, and the authorities are then under an obligation to investigate (see paragraph 32 above; see also Česnulevičius v. Lithuania, no. 13462/06, § 49, 10 January 2012). The Government have not demonstrated that such a complaint could not be lodged by a non-governmental organisation, those entities being created precisely for the purpose of representing and defending their members’ interests (see paragraph 29 above; see also paragraph 140 below). In the present case, where the issue of violence-inciting hate speech against persons belonging to the homosexual minority was brought by the LGL Association to the Lithuanian authorities’ attention, the Court is even more inclined to hold that, once they had been notified of those issues – regardless of by whom – the prosecutors were under an obligation to investigate the comments. Such a conclusion also stems from the Government’s own admission, based on the methodological guidelines issued by the Lithuanian Prosecutor General’s Office, that in respect of homophobic crimes, the launching of a pre-trial investigation should not be formalistic and that prosecutors should be conscious of the vulnerability of the victims of such crimes. Likewise, prosecutors are under an obligation to act, even if the application received is anonymous (see paragraph 31 above). The fact that persons guilty of homophobic speech can be prosecuted on the basis of applications lodged by non-governmental organisations is also supported by the practice of the domestic courts (see paragraphs 50-51 above)."

Although the Government argued that this case had been taken up by the LGL Association by way of strategic litigation, the Court finds that, even if there might have been an element of strategic litigation in the LGL Association lodging the complaint on the applicants’ behalf, this is irrelevant for the admissibility of the applicants’ complaint. It suffices to note that the legal action brought by the LGL Association was not an actio popularis, since it acted not on the basis of any abstract situation, be it a provision of domestic law or practice, affecting LGBT persons in Lithuania, but in response to specific facts affecting the rights of the two applicants – members of that association – under the Convention; moreover, these facts were supported by the evidence which it furnished to the authorities (see paragraph 17 above; see also Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu, cited above, § 110)."

                "81. Against the above background, the Court is satisfied that, given the circumstances of this case and bearing in mind the serious nature of the allegations, it should have been open to the LGL Association, of which the applicants were members (see paragraph 7 above) and which is a non-governmental organisation set up for the purpose of assisting people who have suffered discrimination to exercise their right to a defence, including in court, to act as a representative of the applicants’ “interests” in the domestic criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 29 and 55 above). To find otherwise would amount to preventing such serious allegations of a violation of the Convention from being examined at the national level. Indeed, the Court has held that in modern-day societies recourse to collective bodies such as associations is one of the accessible means, sometimes the only means, available to citizens to defend their particular interests effectively. Moreover, the standing of associations to bring legal proceedings in defence of their members’ interests is recognised by the legislation of most European countries (see Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others v. Spain, no. 62543/00, §§ 37-39, ECHR 2004 ‑ III; see also, mutatis mutandis, Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu, cited above, §§ 101, 103 and 112, and the case-law cited therein). Any other, excessively formalistic, conclusion would make protection of the rights guaranteed by the Convention ineffectual and illusory. In that context, and also in the light of the findings by ECRI (see paragraphs 33 and 58 of the report cited in, respectively, paragraphs 58 and 59 above), the Court is also not ready to disregard the applicants’ statement that they preferred that the LGL Association initiate the criminal proceedings on their behalf for fear that the Internet commenters would retaliate should the applicants launch such proceedings themselves. Lastly, the Court observes that the present application was lodged by the applicants, acting for themselves, after the domestic courts had adopted decisions in the case that dealt with their particular situation."

                "18. On 30 December 2014 a prosecutor at the Klaipėda district prosecutor’s office took the decision not to initiate a pre-trial investigation regarding the LGL Association’s complaint. Having examined the thirty-one comments referred to by the LGL Association, the prosecutor noted that of those thirty-one comments, twenty-seven people had written one comment each, and two people had written two comments each. For the prosecutor, this was easy to establish, since the commenters had placed those comments under their personal profiles. The prosecutor held that in order to assess whether the comments in question were of a criminal nature, it was necessary to take into account not only the comments as such, but also the context in which those comments had been written. Given that the comments had been written by different people, each comment had to be assessed individually, and not collectively. It was also essential to establish whether those comments constituted an active attempt ( aktyvus siekis ) to incite other people to disseminate degrading comments and to incite them to commit violence. The prosecutor then considered that active attempts required “systematic action”. In the applicants’ case, however, that criterion had not been met because various individuals had written only one or two comments, which was not enough to be considered as constituting a systematic attempt to incite hatred or violence against people distinguishable by their sexual orientation. From this it followed that the objective element of a crime, as established under Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code, was absent. Furthermore, the fact that the “expression of opinion” in question had been non-systematic and isolated meant that there had been no subjective element – namely, that of direct intent – in the crime in question, because by posting the comments the authors thereof had merely been “expressing their opinion”, instead of seeking to incite hatred or violence against individuals who were distinguishable by their sexual orientation. Even though the authors of the comments had reacted “unethically” in respect of the image portrayed in the photograph of the two applicants, such “immoral behaviour” did not constitute an element of a crime under Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code. The prosecutor lastly considered that the Supreme Court was of a similar view, in view of the fact that by a ruling of 18 December 2012 in case no. 2K-677/2012 it had acquitted a person who had posted a comment stating that gay people were “perverts” and “belonged in a psychiatric hospital”. In that case the Supreme Court had considered that such a comment, even though unethical, had not actively incited hatred or discrimination against homosexual people (for a more detailed description see paragraphs 39-41 below). The prosecutor thus found that his conclusion was in line with the Supreme Court’s practice in such cases – that is to say, that comments of such a tenor were unethical but not criminal."

                "19. On 9 January 2015 the LGL Association lodged an appeal against the prosecutor’s decision with the Klaipėda City District Court. The LGL Association pointed out that the prosecutor had taken the decision not to prosecute on two grounds: firstly, that the actions of the people who had commented on the above-mentioned Facebook post had not been systematic in nature, and secondly, that in respect of cases concerning similar situations (that is to say, comments of a similar nature) the authorities routinely considered that no crime had been committed. The LGL Association noted that in more than 90% of cases in Lithuania, hatred was promoted through the electronic sphere – for example, by the creation of hatred-promoting groups on the Facebook social network or on Internet forums. The LGL Association also relied on Lithuanian court decisions of 2014 at district court (that is to say, first-instance) level which had found that a single comment had been sufficient to find the author thereof guilty of a crime under Article 170 § 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 50-51 below). The LGL Association thus disputed the prosecutor’s conclusion that such actions had to be systematic in nature in order for criminal liability to arise. The LGL Association argued that the question of whether or not comments could be deemed to be systematic in nature could be taken into account when assessing the gravity of a crime and imposing a punishment on the author of such comments, but it did not amount to a constitutive element of that crime. As to the applicants’ case in particular, it also argued, inter alia, that several terms contained in the comments had promoted the infliction of physical harm and even the killing of members of the group in question (for example, advocating burning and extermination), which had indicated their authors’ “particular attitude” ( ypatingą nusiteikimą ) towards people of non-traditional sexual orientation and had clearly intentionally articulated a call for violence. On this point the LGL Association relied on the Court’s judgment in Vejdeland v. Sweden (no. 1813/07, §§ 54-55, 9 February 2012), in which it had held that Sweden had not breached the rights of the applicants in that case by prosecuting them, even if their statements had not called for violence. Lastly, the LGL Association argued that if the comments under the photograph of the applicants on Facebook had been only “expressing [the authors’] opinion”, it was totally unclear what could be considered to constitute “publicly ridiculing, expressing contempt, urging hatred or inciting discrimination” within the meaning of Article 170 § 2 of the Criminal Code. That norm of criminal law was destined to become a “dead letter”, which the law-enforcement authorities chose not to apply “by giving unjustified preference to freedom of expression, or perhaps owing to other motives which, although not related to law, had an influence on law”."

                "20. By a ruling of 23 January 2015, the Klaipėda City District Court dismissed the LGL Association’s appeal. The court shared the prosecutor’s view that the authors of the impugned comments “had chosen improper words” ( pavartojo netinkamus žodžius ) to express their disapproval of homosexual people. Even so, the “mere use of obscenities” ( tik necenzūrinių žodžių pavartojimas ) was not enough to incur criminal liability under Article 170 § 2 of the Criminal Code. The court considered that in making such comments their authors had not been inciting others to discriminate against or hate homosexuals."

                "21. The District Court also pointed out that the first applicant’s Facebook page, where the picture of the two men kissing had been posted, had been public, visible and accessible not only to his acquaintances and friends, but also to individuals who were completely unknown to him. Therefore, a person who posted in the public sphere ( viešoje erdvėje ) a picture “of two men kissing” should and must have foreseen that such “eccentric behaviour really did not contribute to the social cohesion of those who had different views or to the promotion of tolerance” ( ekscentriškas elgesys tikrai neprisideda prie visuomenėje kitokias pažiūras turinčių asmenų tarpusavio supratimo bei tolerancijos ugdymo ). The owner of a social network profile on which such an image was posted, by exercising his freedom to express his convictions and freedom to promote tolerance, had to take into account the fact that that freedom was inseparable from the obligation to respect the views and traditions of others. According to the court, “the majority of Lithuanian society very much appreciate[d] traditional family values” ( itin vertina tradicinės šeimos vertybes ). Indeed, that view was enshrined in Article 38 of the Constitution, which read that the family should be the basis of society and the State, and that marriage should be undertaken on the basis of the free mutual consent of a man and a woman. The District Court also referred to a passage from the Constitutional Court’s ruling of 28 September 2011 (see paragraph 34 below), and from that ruling inferred that “the family, as a constitutional value, is a union between a man and a woman”. Lastly, the court stated that criminal proceedings were an ultima ratio measure and that they should therefore be initiated only when serious grounds and all the elements of a crime existed. This was not the situation in the case at hand. In its view, the decision not to prosecute the authors of the comments had been reasonable."

It pleaded that certain comments had been clearly meant to incite violence, thus directly constituting an objective element of a crime under Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code. The LGL Association noted that even milder public comments, although concerning racial or ethnic discrimination, had been considered by the Lithuanian courts to constitute a crime. The LGL Association also argued that the subjective element of a crime, that is to say direct intent, should be assessed only after the identification of the alleged perpetrators and during subsequent criminal proceedings, not at the time that a procedural decision was taken regarding whether to start a pre-trial investigation or not. Responding to the District Court’s statement that the majority of Lithuanian society very much appreciated “traditional family values”, the LGL Association underlined that a criminal offence could not be justified by the views and traditions of either an individual or the majority of society. In that connection the LGL Association also relied on the Court’s case-law, which held that freedom of expression was applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that were favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also those that offended, shocked or disturbed. The LGL Association lastly referred to the Court’s judgment in Balsytė-Lideikienė v. Lithuania (no. 72596/01, § 82, 4 November 2008) to the effect that one right, such as the freedom of speech of the authors of the comments, could be restricted if such a restriction was necessary because that speech was offensive."

By a final ruling of 18 February 2015 the Klaipėda Regional Court dismissed the LGL Association’s appeal, upholding the prosecutor’s and the District Court’s reasoning, including that court’s arguments regarding the applicants’ “eccentric behaviour”. The Regional Court also underlined the fact that the first applicant had posted the photograph in question publicly and had not restricted it to his friends or “like-minded people” ( bendraminčiams ), even though the Facebook social network allowed such a possibility. Such an action could therefore be interpreted as constituting “an attempt to deliberately tease or shock individuals with different views or to encourage the posting of negative comments”. The court also considered that, in the absence of objective and subjective elements of a crime under Article 170 of the Criminal Code, it would constitute a “waste of time and resources”, or even an unlawful restriction of the rights of others [that is to say, Internet commenters’] to open criminal proceedings. Lastly, criminal proceedings constituted an ultima ratio measure, and not all actions merited them.",

As a result, they had experienced an increased level of attention and hostility both in the private and in the public spheres. The first applicant had been summoned by his secondary-school headmaster, who had requested him “not to disseminate his ideas”. The second applicant had been summoned by the dean of the university theology faculty, who had requested him to change his course of study because his “lifestyle did not correspond with the faculty’s values”. On several occasions the applicants had been verbally harassed in public places. They had also received a number of threatening private messages in their social network mailboxes. None of those incidents had been reported to the police, because the applicants had been steadily losing their faith in the effectiveness of the law-enforcement system in Lithuania in the light of their unsuccessful attempts to launch a pre-trial investigation in connection with the initial hateful comments."

                "“The unauthorised event near the house of the Seimas [and] the eccentric behaviour of the participants truly did not contribute towards ... an understanding of others who had other points of view or towards building tolerance. The participants in that event, when using their right to freely express their beliefs and promote tolerance, should have had regard to the fact that that freedom is inseparable from the obligation to respect the views and traditions [ pažiūros ir tradicijos ] of others. This has a basis in Article 38 of the Constitution, [which states that] the family shall be the basis of society and the State ... and marriage shall be concluded upon the free mutual consent of a man and a woman. ... Under the legal regulation that today is in force in Lithuania, and the values protected by the Constitution, family – as a value protected by the Constitution – is a union between a man and a woman ...”"

The Supreme Court furthermore noted that J.J. had been found guilty under Article 170 § 2 of the Criminal Code of having publicly ridiculed ( viešai niekino ) “persons of homosexual orientation” by using the words “perverts” and “reprobates”. The Supreme Court then pointed out that according to both the Lithuanian Language Dictionary ( Lietuvių kalbos žodynas ) and the Contemporary Lithuanian Language Dictionary ( Dabartinės lietuvių kalbos žodynas ), a “pervert” was one who had a perversion, was a “degenerate” ( išsigimėlis ), or “a person who did not have a proper lifestyle” ( netvarkingai gyvenąs žmogus ). A “reprobate” was a person who was “naughty” ( išdykęs ), “fidgety” ( nenuorama ), “debauched” ( palaidūnas ) or “profligate” ( ištvirkėlis ). The Supreme Court thus concluded that even though those words had “negative and demeaning” ( neigiama ir niekinama ) connotations in the Lithuanian language, the mere use of those words in the impugned comment, without any concrete and direct statement inciting hatred or discrimination towards this group of persons, meant that there were no objective elements of a crime, as listed in Article 170 § 2 of the Criminal Code."

Lastly, the use of only two such unethical terms in the public sphere was not sufficient to establish the subjective element of a crime – namely that of the direct intent to incite hatred or discrimination in Internet users reading J.J.’s comment against homosexual persons."

Although the prosecutor lodged an appeal on points of law, arguing that V.G.’s comment “Such broken-asses should be given some trimming” ( Duot į kailį tokiems išdraskytašikniams ) underneath an article about gay persons’ rights posted on the Internet portal of a major daily news website merited criminal liability, the Supreme Court did not share that view. It admitted that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was just as perilous as discrimination on the basis of race or colour of skin. Moreover, comments on the Internet, in the event that they instigated hatred or violence, were dangerous, given the fact that persons could be inclined to write such comments because of the protection that anonymity afforded them and the fact that, because of the nature of the Internet, such comments could be read by a large number of persons, especially when published on one of the most popular websites, as was the situation in that case. The Supreme Court also pointed out that “the topic of sexual minorities’ rights in Lithuania was pertinent ( tema aktuali ) and was surrounded by a certain social tension that was linked, among other things, to a rather conservative (or negative) attitude on the part of society towards sexual minorities”."

The Supreme Court acknowledged that V.G.’s comment had been of a negative and demeaning nature and directed against homosexuals. Nevertheless, even if the author of that comment had used his right to freedom of expression inappropriately, such a comment could not have posed a real danger to the values protected by Article 170 of the Criminal Code, that is to say it could not have breached homosexuals’ right of equality, collectively or individually, or their dignity. The comment also could not have genuinely incited readers of the Internet portal in question to commit violence against that group or individuals belonging to that group. For the Supreme Court, that conclusion stemmed from the fact that the comment in question had been “laconic” rather than specific (that is to say, the author had not further elaborated on his views in order to incite others against the group of persons in question); and “violence had been discussed only in an abstract manner and through the means of idiom”. The Supreme Court thus concluded that V.G.’s actions had lacked both the objective and subjective elements of a crime and that he had therefore been correctly acquitted.",

The court noted that V.I. had used that term on one occasion in a public space – on the street in Vilnius. In an appeal on points of law V.I. had pleaded that she had used the term “negro”. The Supreme Court considered that the latter term, if used in Lithuania – which had no history of slave labour, segregation or social conflict on the basis of certain people belonging to another race and where the word “negro” therefore did not have a demeaning connotation – could not have been considered discriminatory on the basis of race. This also stemmed from the fact that “[historically], there were practically no persons of non-Caucasian race living in Lithuania”. The image of a “negro” in Lithuanian culture was linked to that of a person who had been exploited and was hard-working, and who therefore deserved compassion. However, the word “nigger”, which came from the English language, had a demeaning and vulgar connotation, especially when used together with word “fucking”.

The book contains fairy tales featuring members of socially vulnerable groups, such as same-sex couples, Roma, and disabled people, and aims at promoting tolerance and respect for diversity among children. Following the complaints, the LEU explained the withdrawal of the book by suddenly describing it as ‘harmful, primitive and biased homosexual propaganda’. Furthermore, the Office of the Inspector of Journalistic Ethics concluded that two fairy tales that promote tolerance for same-sex couples are harmful to minors. The Inspectorate’s experts deemed the stories in violation of the Law on the Protection of Minors because they encourage ‘the concept of entry into a marriage and creation of a family other than stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania and the Civil Code of the Republic of Lithuania’. The experts also considered the stories to be ‘harmful, invasive, direct and manipulative’.",

In September 2014, fearing a potential violation of the Law on Protection of Minors, Lithuanian TV stations refused to broadcast a TV spot promoting tolerance towards LGBT people which had been prepared by an NGO for the campaign Change It. Subsequently, this decision was confirmed by the Inspector of Journalistic Ethics on the grounds that the TV spot seemed to portray a same-sex family model in a positive light, which the Inspectorate considered to have a negative impact on minors and to be in violation of the law.”"

In its report on Lithuania (fifth monitoring cycle), ECRI recommended that the Lithuanian authorities, as part of the Inter-Institutional Action Plan for 2015-2020 on Non-Discrimination, set up an inter-institutional working group to develop a comprehensive strategy to tackle effectively the problem of racist and homo-/transphobic hate speech. This group should include the relevant authorities, as well as civil society organisations, including, amongst others, representatives of the LGBT community.",

The group met twice in 2016 and 2017. No meetings took place in 2018 and uncertainties remain as to the agreed tasks of the working group. Some activities, however, continued. On 8 March 2018, a seminar took place organised by the OSCE/ODIHR and the EU-FRA, jointly with the Ministry of Interior, for civil society members of the working group on improving monitoring of hate crime and the collection of related data in Lithuania in line with international standards.",

The project aims to ensure effective investigations, prosecutions and adequate sentencing in hate crime cases; raise awareness among national authorities about the impact of hate crime and hate speech; understand the needs of vulnerable communities; address the problem of under-reporting and intensify efforts to counter on-line hate speech.",

Such training for police officers is implementing measures foreseen in the Action Plan for the Promotion of Non-discrimination (2017-2019). While ECRI recognises the positive intentions contained in the Action Plan, its overall level of coordination does not appear to be well developed, which is also highlighted by the fact that the Action Plan was adopted by only one Ministry, namely the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, and shows no evidence of being based on an integrated interagency strategy.",
                "In spite of some useful steps taken by the authorities, ECRI concludes that the various measures do not yet constitute a comprehensive strategic approach to effectively tackle the problem of racist and homo-/transphobic hate speech. The inter-institutional working group has also not arrived at developing such a strategy. ECRI encourages the Lithuanian authorities to continue and scale up its efforts to prevent and combat hate speech and hate crime and to overcome fragmentation by making effective use of the existing working group.",

According to the Government, the criminal case file did not contain the applicants’ letter of 10 December 2014 to the LGL Association asking the latter to pursue criminal proceedings (see paragraph 16 above). The Government asserted that the applicants had only submitted that letter to the Court; it contained no stamp or any other sign confirming its receipt by the LGL Association. In any case, in that letter the applicants had asked the LGL Association to act in its own name, not on their behalf. The Government thus asserted that the opening of the pre-trial investigation had been the intention, exclusively, of the LGL Association, which saw the proceedings as strategic litigation, since the applicants themselves had never wished to institute such proceedings. Even so, the Government acknowledged that under the domestic law, any person could inform the relevant domestic institutions of the alleged commission of a criminal act (see paragraph 32 above)."

Certainly, the applicants’ fear of retaliation by the authors of those comments had not stopped them from lodging an application with the Court. The Government likewise saw no grounds for the applicants’ statement that their personal complaint would have been treated less seriously by law-enforcement officials than a complaint lodged by a non-governmental organisation."

Furthermore, the validity of the reasons behind the applicants’ decision not to initiate the domestic proceedings themselves, but rather to trust the LGL Association to do so on their behalf, was not and should not be a matter of dispute in the instant case. As correctly pointed out by the Government, under domestic law any person could inform the relevant domestic institutions of an alleged criminal act (see paragraph 68 in fine above). Moreover, the Government had failed to explain what difference it would have made if the applicants had initiated the domestic proceedings themselves. It also had to be borne in mind that the LGL Association was the sole civil-society organisation in Lithuania representing the interests of the LGBT community and seeking to improve their situation. In fact, its statutes read that it sought to “promote measures to prevent homophobic ... hate crimes” (see paragraph 55 above). Accordingly, it seemed that the Government were challenging the very fact that a civil-society organisation might also have a legitimate interest in the outcome of the applicants’ case, and thus questioning the fundamental role of non-governmental organisations in performing a “public watchdog” function in a pluralist, democratic society. Lastly, the fact that the LGL Association had acted with the full knowledge and consent of the applicants when initiating the domestic proceedings was further confirmed by the fact that it was the applicants themselves who were complaining before the Court as “victims”, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.

Accordingly, in order to be able to lodge an application in accordance with Article 34, an individual must be able to show that he was “directly affected” by the measure complained of. This is indispensable for putting the protection mechanism of the Convention into motion, although this criterion is not to be applied in a rigid, mechanical and inflexible way throughout the proceedings (see Roman Zakharov v.

Subsequently, the LGL Association consistently appealed against the prosecutor’s and the court’s rulings that those comments had been merely unethical and lacked the constitutive elements of a crime (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above). The Court attaches considerable significance to the fact that the LGL Association’s capacity to represent the applicants’ interests before the prosecutors and the courts at two levels of jurisdiction has never been questioned or challenged in any way. As a matter of fact – and irrespective of whether the applicants’ complaint to the LGL Association and their request for criminal proceedings to be initiated in respect of the comments on the first applicant’s Facebook page were submitted to the prosecutor and included in the criminal case file – those authorities dealt with the application and appeals submitted to them without any objections as to standing, regardless of their conclusion as to the merits of the complaint (see paragraphs 18, 20-21 and 23 above; see also Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v.

Lithuania, no. 13462/06, § 49, 10 January 2012). The Government have not demonstrated that such a complaint could not be lodged by a non-governmental organisation, those entities being created precisely for the purpose of representing and defending their members’ interests (see paragraph 29 above; see also paragraph 140 below). In the present case, where the issue of violence-inciting hate speech against persons belonging to the homosexual minority was brought by the LGL Association to the Lithuanian authorities’ attention, the Court is even more inclined to hold that, once they had been notified of those issues – regardless of by whom – the prosecutors were under an obligation to investigate the comments. Such a conclusion also stems from the Government’s own admission, based on the methodological guidelines issued by the Lithuanian Prosecutor General’s Office, that in respect of homophobic crimes, the launching of a pre-trial investigation should not be formalistic and that prosecutors should be conscious of the vulnerability of the victims of such crimes. Likewise, prosecutors are under an obligation to act, even if the application received is anonymous (see paragraph 31 above). The fact that persons guilty of homophobic speech can be prosecuted on the basis of applications lodged by non-governmental organisations is also supported by the practice of the domestic courts (see paragraphs 50-51 above)."

Although the Government argued that this case had been taken up by the LGL Association by way of strategic litigation, the Court finds that, even if there might have been an element of strategic litigation in the LGL Association lodging the complaint on the applicants’ behalf, this is irrelevant for the admissibility of the applicants’ complaint. It suffices to note that the legal action brought by the LGL Association was not an actio popularis, since it acted not on the basis of any abstract situation, be it a provision of domestic law or practice, affecting LGBT persons in Lithuania, but in response to specific facts affecting the rights of the two applicants – members of that association – under the Convention; moreover, these facts were supported by the evidence which it furnished to the authorities (see paragraph 17 above; see also Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu, cited above, § 110)."

Against the above background, the Court is satisfied that, given the circumstances of this case and bearing in mind the serious nature of the allegations, it should have been open to the LGL Association, of which the applicants were members (see paragraph 7 above) and which is a non-governmental organisation set up for the purpose of assisting people who have suffered discrimination to exercise their right to a defence, including in court, to act as a representative of the applicants’ “interests” in the domestic criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 29 and 55 above). To find otherwise would amount to preventing such serious allegations of a violation of the Convention from being examined at the national level. Indeed, the Court has held that in modern-day societies recourse to collective bodies such as associations is one of the accessible means, sometimes the only means, available to citizens to defend their particular interests effectively. Moreover, the standing of associations to bring legal proceedings in defence of their members’ interests is recognised by the legislation of most European countries (see Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others v. Spain, no. 62543/00, §§ 37-39, ECHR 2004 ‑ III; see also, mutatis mutandis, Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu, cited above, §§ 101, 103 and 112, and the case-law cited therein). Any other, excessively formalistic, conclusion would make protection of the rights guaranteed by the Convention ineffectual and illusory. In that context, and also in the light of the findings by ECRI (see paragraphs 33 and 58 of the report cited in, respectively, paragraphs 58 and 59 above), the Court is also not ready to disregard the applicants’ statement that they preferred that the LGL Association initiate the criminal proceedings on their behalf for fear that the Internet commenters would retaliate should the applicants launch such proceedings themselves.

The content of the domestic authorities’ decisions had also made it clear that it had been the applicants’ sexual orientation, as demonstrated in the photograph posted on the first applicant’s social network page, that had justified the decision not to start a pre-trial investigation. Accordingly, one could not follow the Government’s argument that in the present case the applicants’ homosexuality itself had never been a ground for refusing to start a pre-trial investigation (see paragraph 93 below). In fact, as pointed out by the Regional Court, it was precisely the public display of their sexual orientation that had been identified by that court as “an attempt to deliberately tease or shock individuals with different views or to encourage the posting of negative comments” (see paragraph 23 above)."

The fact that they had been treated differently by the public authorities exclusively owing to their sexual orientation could be illustrated by a hypothetical comparison with other individuals in a similar situation, such as a comparison between the applicants and a hypothetical unmarried opposite-sex couple who had posted a picture of themselves kissing on their public social-media profile. Applying the reasoning of the domestic courts, an opposite-sex kiss would have been in line with “traditional family values”. Moreover, since such an opposite-sex kiss (that is to say, “non-eccentric behaviour”) would not have been aimed at provoking people into posting negative comments, the prosecutors would certainly have launched a pre-trial investigation if comments had been posted encouraging Facebook users to “kill” or “burn” an opposite-sex couple. The applicants were likewise convinced that the outcome of the domestic proceedings, that is to say, the decision not to prosecute, would not have occurred if the picture had depicted any other social or ethnic group within Lithuanian society, such as the Lithuanian Jewish community, and analogous comments, such as “throw [them] into the gas chambers” and “exterminate them”, had been posted.

They therefore maintained that their different treatment on the grounds of their sexual orientation had lacked any objective and reasonable justification. The position of the domestic courts and the Government (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above, and paragraph 94 below) seemed to suggest that the applicants had no right to kiss in public, be that on the first applicant’s Facebook page or on the street, since this amounted to “eccentric behaviour” owing to the applicants’ sexual orientation. The Government’s position also seemed to suggest that if the sight of two men kissing had triggered threats of violence, in strict contravention of Article 170 of the Criminal Code, then that had been the fault of the applicants, and the courts had thus been correct in refusing to enforce the relevant Lithuanian legislation aimed at protecting same-sex couples such as the applicants. Such a position of the Government amounted to accepting as justified the private prejudices of the members of public who had written those threatening comments, rather than using Lithuanian legislation to challenge those prejudices. This was clearly incompatible with Articles 14 and 8 of the Convention and the Court’s case-law on the subject (the applicants relied on Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, § 97, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI, and Alekseyev v.

The Court had also held that the unlawful nature of online comments in certain instances did not require any further linguistic or legal analysis if those remarks were on the face of it unlawful. For the applicants, it was difficult to understand how comments such as “Burn the faggots”, “Into the gas chamber with the pair of them”, “You are fucking gays – you should be exterminated” and “Kill” in their case did not amount to punishable criminal hate speech in respect of sexual orientation under Article 170 of the Criminal Code.

The applicants also criticised the fact that the domestic authorities had considered that a crime under Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 had to have been committed by means of systematic actions, even though neither the wording of that provision nor its interpretation by the domestic courts in other hate-speech cases mandated this criterion. In fact, according to the domestic courts’ case-law, one single expression of public ridicule or contempt – or one single instance of hatred or discrimination against a certain group of people – amounted to the criminal offence of incitement of hatred. It followed that by introducing the additional element of actus reus, the prosecutor and the domestic courts had relied on a flawed interpretation of the law and had violated the fundamental principle of legal certainty."

Likewise, the prosecutor and the courts had attached significant weight to the fact that the alleged crime against the applicants had lacked direct intent, concluding that there was therefore no “subjective element” or mens rea in respect of the crime. However, both the prosecutor and the appellate courts had reached this conclusion without approaching and conducting interviews with the alleged perpetrators, notwithstanding the LGL Association’s request that such investigative steps be taken (see paragraph 22 above)."

Furthermore, out of more than 800 comments posted under the photograph in question, the Government had been able to identify only one that referred to the presence of the image of a cross in the picture. This was not surprising, because the position of the second applicant’s left arm had made it impossible to determine whether there was indeed a cross on his jumper, or some other shape. Additionally, the presence of a cross shape had never been addressed as part of any factual and/or legal assessment undertaken by the prosecutor’s office or the domestic courts when deciding on the applicants’ case. The Government’s attempt to introduce an “additional” – and “distracting” – reason for the hostile comments thus had no basis in facts."

Lastly, the applicants acknowledged that one of their aims in posting the photograph in question had been to test the level of tolerance among the Lithuanian population, and it had been their fundamental right to do so under Article 10 of the Convention. In fact, on multiple occasions the Court had reiterated that freedom of expression was applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that were favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offended, shocked or disturbed the State or any sector of the population. Accordingly, the Government’s suggestion that the applicants could have concealed their sexual orientation, or exercised reserve in expressing their sexual orientation by not kissing in the photograph, or deleted the negative comments once they had been posted (see paragraph 101 below) was irrelevant, because it once again sought to shift the responsibility for hateful comments being written by perpetrators onto the applicants. The Government had thus seemed to engage in “victim shaming” and “victim blaming”. In a case of gender-based violence, the equivalent statement would be that a woman had been raped because she had been wearing “provocative” or “eccentric” clothing. In that context the applicants also referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union’s findings (see paragraph 65 above), which they saw as a fortiori applying to the expression of sexual orientation in the European Union and the Council of Europe member States."

The applicants’ homosexuality had never been a ground in itself for the refusal to start a pre-trial investigation (the Government contrasted the applicants’ situation to that of the applicants in Smith and Grady, cited above, § 121). The applicants’ conduct had been assessed by the domestic authorities in order to establish the context in which the comments had been made and to establish the intent of the commenters. In that respect the Government also wished to emphasise certain aspects of the domestic courts’ conclusion that the applicants had attempted to deliberately tease or shock individuals holding different views or to encourage the posting of negative comments."

The Government accordingly submitted that, firstly, “the photograph itself was already rather provocative on account of the kiss between two gays”, taken together with the image of a big cross across the second applicant’s jumper. The applicants’ conduct, that is to say their non-verbal means of expression – wearing a jumper with a cross, which was the principal symbol of the Christian religion – could be regarded as a way of expressing the applicants’ views as regards the compatibility of homosexuality with the Christian religion (the Government referred to Donaldson v the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 56975/09, § 29, 25 January 2011). In the Government’s view, the public display of such a photograph together with the image of a cross “could have sparked conflict with people of a different cultural and religious background”. This was illustrated by one comment under the photograph, which read as follows: “Very beautiful composition. In particular, the cross on the jumper. In place.” The Government thus considered that in such cases “the Contracting States had a wide margin of appreciation in assessing which emblems could potentially inflame existing tensions if displayed publicly” (ibid., § 28)."

Some persons had strongly supported the act of posting the photograph, some had been strongly opposed to homosexuality as such, and others had not been against homosexuality but had nevertheless not approved of the posting of the photograph in question. Thirdly, the provocative nature of the applicants’ behaviour had been recognised by their supporters themselves. Indeed, in a public post of 9 December 2014 – that is to say, only one day after the posting of the photograph of the applicants – LGBT-friendly Vilnius had specifically used the verb “provoked” (see paragraph 11 above); subsequently the first applicant had implied much the same thing (see paragraph 14 above)."

The Government considered that the domestic authorities’ reference to “traditional values” (see paragraph 21 above) did not mean that homosexuals were not tolerated in Lithuanian society. Rather, the domestic courts had been referring to the applicants themselves, who had deliberately demonstrated their opposition to such values. In other words, the domestic authorities’ decision not to start a pre-trial investigation had had nothing to do with so-called “traditional” and “non-traditional” values as such."

Furthermore, the so-called “eccentric behaviour” of the applicants had not been the sole factor prompting the domestic institutions to decide not to start a pre-trial investigation, given that the constitutive elements of a crime had not been established by the domestic authorities in the present case. The Government considered that the situation in the present case differed from a situation involving intense fear and anxiety, such as that described in the judgment of Identoba and Others (cited above, §§ 70-71). Contrary to the facts in that case, the people who had commented negatively on the Facebook page of the first applicant had not outnumbered the applicants and their supporters, and no physical assaults had ever taken place against them. In that context it was noteworthy that almost since the re-establishment of Lithuania’s independence in 1990 numerous actions had been taken to protect LGBT rights in the country. Baltic Pride, an annual LGBT pride parade, had taken place in Lithuania in 2010, 2013 and 2016. The applicants had taken part in that parade in 2016, and the first applicant had been happy when there had been no protests against the event (see paragraph 15 above)."

Under Article 170 of the Criminal Code it was a criminal offence to make public statements directed at a wide and unlimited group of people seeking to incite them to violence against a group of other persons belonging to a distinct group owing to their sexual orientation (see paragraphs 44-45 above). The Court had likewise recognised that the “potential impact of the medium concerned was an important factor” (the Government referred to Magyar Tartalomszolgáltatók Egyesülete and Index.hu Zrt v. Hungary, no. 22947/13, § 56, 2 February 2016). In the present case, however, the comments had been made on a social network page and not, for example, on an Internet news portal, which could have attracted a large number of comments. Moreover, the comments had been made within the context of a discussion started intentionally by the first applicant and had been made on a social network, an action that had been unlikely to attract much attention."

In their view, the Facebook users had posted their comments “on the spot”, not in a premeditated fashion, after they had come across the photograph together with the comments posted by other Facebook users, including by the applicants themselves and their supporters. In the same vein, those commenters, although they had used improper words, had been trying to show that, contrary to what had been suggested by the applicants and their supporters, homosexuality was negative in itself and had a negative impact on children, and that the applicants’ conduct by depicting a cross in their photograph had been incompatible with the Catholic religion. It had to be borne in mind that the domestic authorities had considered that the comments had not been systematic, and that was one of the factors that could also indicate that there had no been direct intent on the part of the perpetrators, and that posting such comments had therefore not reached the threshold required by Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 52-53 above). The fact that most of the comments had been one-off ( pavieniai ), and that some had consisted of only a couple of words was a further indication of a lack of intent. That also followed from the Supreme Court’s case-law (see paragraph 45 above). Such a lack of direct intent to incite Internet users against homosexuals had also constituted a ground for the domestic institutions to refuse to initiate a pre-trial investigation."

It also had to be noted that, in line with international human rights standards, the domestic courts had deemed that holding someone criminally accountable was an ultima ratio measure.

Belgium (dec.), no. 34367/14, 27 June 2017). The third-party interveners also considered that the elements of likelihood, foreseeability and imminence of hostility or violence had to be considered before determining whether and when instances of hate speech constituted incitement to commit violent acts and should therefore be criminalised. In their view, from the case-law of the Court it appeared clear that there was no need to show that harm had actually been caused. Furthermore, where hate speech constituting incitement to commit violent acts against individuals had occurred, then the Court’s position was clear: failure to investigate, prosecute and punish such hate speech amounted to a breach of the State’s positive obligations under the Convention (in that context, they cited Faruk Temel v.

Such was the situation in, among other States, Spain, Austria, Croatia, Finland, Greece, Malta and Portugal. Moreover, most States recognised intent as one of the defining elements of incitement.

That being so, and although the Government saw the latter fact as provocative, the Court does not view either of those reasons as illegitimate or meriting the suppression of the applicants’ rights. On the contrary, it has already held that there is no ambiguity about the member States’ recognition of the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms (see Alekseyev, cited above, § 84). The Court also points to LGBT-friendly Vilnius’s follow-up posts on its own Facebook page in which it was stated that the applicants’ photograph had been posted to serve the aim of helping other LGBT people in Lithuania, and potentially those who were “condemned by others” and perhaps “[standing] on the roof of some house, or on the edge of a window sill or balcony”, to move “to a safer spot”. The applicants also confirmed this intention when interviewed by the LGL Association (see paragraphs 11 ‑ 12 above). While accepting the Supreme Court’s finding that the atmosphere in respect of issues concerning homosexuality is tense in Lithuania (see paragraph 22 of the ECRI report cited in paragraph 57 above; as confirmed by other international bodies, see paragraphs 63-64 above), the Court cannot view the above-mentioned intentions, as indicated by the applicants, as having threatened to cause public unrest (see paragraph 44 above; compare and contrast Donaldson, cited above, § 29).

In this context the Court notes the applicants’ view that that argument by the Government was “additional” and “distracting”, also given that the Government could only point to a single religion-related comment (see paragraph 90 above). As the Court does not consider it necessary to take a position on this view of the applicants, it suffices to note the Constitutional Court’s case-law to the effect that Lithuania is a secular State where there is no State religion (see paragraph 38 above).

Given those express references to the applicants’ sexual orientation, it is clear that one of the grounds for refusing to open a pre-trial investigation was the courts’ disapproval of the applicants’ demonstrating their sexual orientation (compare and contrast Bączkowski and Others, cited above, §§ 95 and 97)."

                "122. The Court furthermore refers to the Klaipėda District Court’s statements that “the majority of Lithuanian society very much appreciate[d] traditional family values”, according to which “family, as a constitutional value, [was] the union of a man and a woman”, which that court found to be supported by the Constitution and the Constitutional Court’s case-law (see paragraph 21 above). The Court has already considered a similar argument in Kozak v. Poland (no. 13102/02, § 98, 2 March 2010). In that case it accepted that the protection of the family in the traditional sense was, in principle, a weighty and legitimate reason that might justify a difference in treatment. However, in pursuance of that aim a broad variety of measures might be implemented by the State. Moreover, given that the Convention is a living instrument, to be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions, the State, in its choice of means designed to protect the family and to secure, as required by Article 8, respect for family life, must necessarily take into account developments in society and changes in the perception of social, civil status and relational issues, including the fact that there is not just one way or one choice in the sphere of leading and living one’s family or private life. In the present case, although the Klaipėda District Court cited the alleged incompatibility between maintaining family values as the foundation of society and acknowledging the social acceptance of homosexuality, the Court sees no reason to consider those elements to be incompatible, especially in view of the growing general tendency to view relationships between same-sex couples as falling within the concept of “family life” (see Bayev and Others v. Russia, nos. 67667/09 and 2 others, § 67, 20 June 2017)."
            ],
            [
                "123. The Court also has particularly strong reservations as to the validity of the latter element (that is to say, what constitutes a family), since as far back as 2011 the Constitutional Court underlined that while marriage was a union between a man and a woman, the concept of family was not limited to the union of two such persons (see paragraph 34 above). This was confirmed by the Constitutional Court in 2019 when examining questions related to two persons of the same sex living in two different countries who wished to be reunited in Lithuania (see point 32.5 in paragraph 36 above). In the latter ruling the Constitutional Court also underlined not only the fact that under the Lithuanian Constitution “the concept of family [was] neutral in terms of gender” but also that “the Constitution [was] an anti-majoritarian act” and that the views of the majority could not override those of the minority (see points 31.3 and 32.5 in paragraph 36 above). The Court, for its part, has also held that it would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority. Were this so, a minority group’s rights would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective, as required by the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Alekseyev, cited above, § 81, and the case-law cited therein)."

Taking into account all the evidence, the Court thus considers it established that the applicants have made a prima facie case that their homosexual orientation played a role in the way they were treated by the State authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Begheluri, cited above, § 176, and the case-law cited therein). It therefore remains for the Court to determine whether the Government have sufficiently demonstrated that the way the national authorities assessed the relevant facts, as presented in the criminal complaint lodged by the LGL Association, was acceptable (see paragraph 116 above). In particular, the Court is called upon to determine whether the decision by the prosecutor to discontinue the criminal investigation, subsequently confirmed by the national courts, was motivated by a discriminatory attitude and stereotypes related to sexual orientation (see, mutatis mutandis, Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais v. Portugal, no. 17484/15, § 46, 25 July 2017).",
                "(ii) As to the assessment by the domestic authorities of whether the comments constituted a crime under Article 170 of the Criminal Code"
            ],
            [
                "125. On the facts of this case, the Court notes, firstly, the prosecutor’s view that the authors of the comments, including those stating that “it’s not only the Jews that Hitler should have burned” and that “faggots ... [should be thrown] into the gas chamber” or “into the bonfire” or have “a free honeymoon trip to the crematorium”, or have “their heads smash[ed]” or be “castrated” or be “[shot]”(see paragraph 10 above), had acted “unethically” but that such “amoral behaviour” had not reached the threshold required by Article 170 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 18 above). The Klaipėda District Court came to the same conclusion, finding that those comments were mere “obscenities” and the commenters had simply “chosen improper words” (see paragraph 20 above). However, while being careful not to hold that each and every utterance of hate speech must, as such, attract criminal prosecution and criminal sanctions (see paragraph 116 above), the Court is unable to subscribe to the conclusions of the Lithuanian authorities. The Court reiterates its finding that comments that amount to hate speech and incitement to violence, and are thus clearly unlawful on their face, may in principle require the States to take certain positive measures (see, mutatis mutandis, Delfi AS, cited above, §§ 153 and 159). It has likewise held that inciting hatred does not necessarily entail a call for an act of violence or other criminal acts. Attacks on persons committed by insulting, holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population can be sufficient for the authorities to favour combating racist speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner (see Vejdeland and Others v. Sweden, no. 1813/07, § 55, 9 February 2012). Moreover, the Court cannot but observe that other comments, even without calling for violence, regarding the Jews (see paragraph 52 above) have been treated by the Lithuanian authorities as falling under Article 170 of the Criminal Code. It also considers that the Government have not provided weighty arguments to refute the applicants’ view that if comments such as those uttered in their case did not amount to inciting not only hatred but even violence on the basis of the applicants’ sexual orientation, then it is hard to conceive what statements would (see paragraphs 19 and 87 above). Therefore, the Court, sharing the view of the Constitutional Court that the attitudes or stereotypes prevailing over a certain period of time among the majority of members of society may not serve as justifiable grounds for discriminating against persons solely on the basis of their sexual orientation, or for limiting the right to the protection of private life (see point 31.3 in paragraph 35 above), considers that the assessment made in this case by the national authorities was not in conformity with the fundamental principles of a democratic State governed by the rule of law (see also, mutatis mutandis, Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais, cited above, § 46, and Biao v. Denmark [GC], no. 38590/10, § 126, 24 May 2016)."
            ],
            [
                "126. Secondly, the Government also relied on the prosecutor’s finding that the comments lacked a “systematic character”, since most of the comments referred by the LGL Association to the prosecutor had been written by different people (see paragraph 18 above). The Court again cannot subscribe to this argument. It notes that the Lithuanian courts’ practice on this issue is not uniform, in that while the courts sometimes ascribe importance to an accused posting numerous discriminatory comments and find him or her guilty under Article 170 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 52-53 above), in other cases the making of a single discriminatory comment is sufficient to attract criminal liability (see paragraphs 46-49 and 54 above). In this context the Court, while acknowledging that it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see, among many authorities, Nejdet Şahin and Perihan Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, § 49, 20 October 2011), does not disregard the argument that the LGL Association put forward in the domestic proceedings (see paragraph 19 above), namely that the number of comments could constitute a circumstance determining the gravity of the crime or the extent of the culprit’s criminal liability, but that it did not constitute an indispensable element of the crime under the above-mentioned provision of the Criminal Code."
            ],
            [
                "127. The Court also notes the Klaipėda District Court’s finding that the post on the first applicant’s Facebook page and the comments under it were in the “public sphere” (see paragraph 21 above), which was one of the necessary constitutive elements of a crime under Article 170 of the Criminal Code. The potential reach of comments on the Internet, as well as the danger they may cause, especially when published on popular Internet websites, has also been underlined by the Lithuanian Supreme Court (see paragraph 44 above). For its part, the Court has also held that in the light of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information, the Internet plays an important role in enhancing the public’s access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general. At the same time, in considering the “duties and responsibilities” of those posting such information, the potential impact of the medium concerned is an important factor (see, mutatis mutandis, Magyar Tartalomszolgáltatók Egyesülete and Index.hu Zrt, cited above, § 56, with further references). Accordingly, the Court does not find it unreasonable to hold that the posting of even a single hateful comment, let alone a comment that such persons should be “killed”, on the first applicant’s Facebook page was sufficient to be taken seriously. This is further supported by the fact that the photograph had “gone viral” online and received more than 800 comments (see paragraph 10 above). The ECRI report on Lithuania also indicates that the country “has a problem” and that most hate speech takes place on the Internet, and also on social networks (see paragraph 56 above; see also paragraphs 26-27 of the report, cited in paragraph 57 above). The Court therefore also rejects the Government’s argument that comments on Facebook are less dangerous than those on Internet news portals (see paragraph 98 above). Neither can it see as pertinent the Government’s argument that the people who commented negatively on the Facebook page of the first applicant had not outnumbered the applicants and their supporters (see paragraph 97 above)."

                "128. The Court has already pointed out that criminal sanctions, including against the individuals responsible for the most serious expressions of hatred inciting others to violence, could be invoked only as an ultima ratio measure (see paragraph 111 above; on the Klaipėda Regional Court’s position in the applicants’ case that criminal proceedings were an ultima ratio measure, see paragraph 23 above). It considers that this applies equally to hate speech against a person’s sexual orientation and sexual life. The Court observes that the instant case concerns undisguised calls for attacks on the applicants’ physical and mental integrity (see, in this context, Panayotova and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 12509/13, §§ 58-59, 7 May 2019, with further references), which require protection by the criminal law (see paragraph 111 above). Article 170 of the Criminal Code does indeed provide for such a protection (see paragraph 30 above). However, owing to the Lithuanian authorities’ discriminatory attitude, the provisions of this Article were not applied in the applicants’ case, and the requisite protection was not granted to them. The Court considers that in the circumstances of this case, it would have been manifestly unreasonable for the victims, and would also have downplayed the seriousness of the impugned comments, to require the applicants to exhaust any other remedies. Accordingly, the Government’s objection to the effect that the applicants could have had recourse to other – civil law – remedies (see paragraphs 70 and 82 above) must be dismissed."

Having regard to all the material at hand, the Court thus finds it established, firstly, that the hateful comments, including undisguised calls for violence by private individuals directed against the applicants and the homosexual community in general, were prompted by a bigoted attitude towards that community and, secondly, that the very same discriminatory state of mind was at the core of the failure on the part of the relevant public authorities to discharge their positive obligation to investigate in an effective manner whether the comments regarding the applicants’ sexual orientation constituted incitement to hatred and violence; by downplaying the seriousness of the comments, the authorities at the very least tolerated them (see, mutatis mutandis, Begheluri, cited above, § 179). In the light of these findings, the Court also considers it established that the applicants suffered discrimination on the grounds of their sexual orientation. It further considers that the Government did not provide any justification showing that the impugned distinction was compatible with the standards of the Convention (see also Alekseyev, cited above, § 109)."

Furthermore, the applicants had been threatened with serious harm and even subjected to death threats in comments that had contained such exhortations as “burn them”, “exterminate them” and “kill them”. Reading the comments, the applicants had been placed in a situation of intense fear and anxiety, which had continuously affected their daily lives and routines.

They had been singled out and verbally harassed in public spaces and had received a number of threatening private messages in their social network mailboxes. The causal link between the State’s failure to launch an effective pre-trial investigation regarding the above-mentioned instances of hate speech and the resulting atmosphere of impunity, which had led to subsequent attacks on the applicants, was self-evident. Those subsequent incidents had not been reported to the police, because the applicants had lost faith in the effectiveness of the Lithuanian law-enforcement system after the unsuccessful attempt to have a pre-trial investigation launched in relation to the initial hateful comments."

On the basis of those complaints, twenty-eight pre-trial investigations had been initiated in 2013, thirteen in 2014 and eight in 2015. Interestingly enough, all of those pre-trial investigations had been either suspended or terminated, and thus had not led to the actual identification or punishment of the alleged perpetrators. The three main reasons for that had been: (a) the failure to identify the individual who had committed the criminal offence in question; (b) the failure to establish the constitutive elements of a criminal offence; and (c) the fact that the IP address in question had belonged to a foreign jurisdiction. Moreover, between 2013 and 2015 several requests for the launch of a pre-trial investigation had been refused altogether.

                "In the present case, and considering the nature and substance of the violation found in the applicants’ case on the basis of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, the Court finds that a separate examination of the applicants’ complaint is warranted. In its assessment, the Court will have regard to general developments in the case-law of the national courts, to conclusions by international monitoring bodies reviewing the issue of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in Lithuania and to statistical information provided by the Government, the applicants, the third-party interveners and international bodies."

                "152. With regard to the material provided by the Government (see paragraph 54 above), the Court acknowledges that in the cases cited the district courts, that is, the courts of first instance, reached guilty verdicts regarding discriminatory and homophobic comments on the Internet, as well as other types of homophobic behaviour. That being so, and in so far as the applicants’ case is concerned, the Court cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that in reaching the conclusion that the comments at issue had been merely “unethical” and “immoral”, the prosecutor relied on the practice of the Supreme Court to the same effect (see paragraphs 18 and 39-41 above). Indeed, in two cases concerning homophobic hate speech, the Supreme Court reached verdicts exculpating those on trial (see paragraphs 39-45 above; compare and contrast the position of the lower courts, indicated in paragraphs 49-51 and 54 above). The Court notes that in its ruling of 18 December 2016, the Supreme Court had recourse to two dictionaries to reach the conclusion that calling people of homosexual orientation names such as “perverts” and “reprobates” who should “be urgently sent to a psychiatric hospital” was negative and demeaning, but that the use of those names did not call for the application of Article 170 of the Criminal Code, which establishes criminal liability for discrimination, inter alia, on the basis of sexual orientation (see paragraphs 39 and 42 above). The Court notes with concern the emphasis in the Supreme Court’s ruling on the “eccentric behaviour” or the supposed duty of persons belonging to sexual minorities “to respect the views and traditions of others” in exercising their own personality rights (see paragraph 41 above).",
                "At the same time, the Court recognises that the reliance by the prosecutor in the present case on the case-law of the Supreme Court ignored significant differences in the level of gravity of the homophobic speech at stake in this case compared to expressions examined by the Supreme Court in previous judgments which were clearly less grave. As the Government have not provided a single verdict by the Supreme Court showing that the trend of interpretation, which was perceived by the prosecutor as rather lenient towards those accused of hate speech against homosexuals, has been reversed, it does not appear that the Supreme Court has had an opportunity to provide greater clarity on the standards to be applied in hate-speech cases of comparable gravity. In that context the Court notes the statutory obligation on the domestic courts to take into account the Supreme Court’s case-law (see also Orlen Lietuva Ltd. v. Lithuania, no. 45849/13, §§ 33-35, 29 January 2019). Accordingly, the Court finds that the manner in which the case-law of the Supreme Court was applied by the prosecutor, whose decision was upheld by the domestic courts which examined the applicants’ case, did not provide for an effective domestic remedy for complaints of homophobic discrimination."

                "153. As regards the Government’s reliance on the role of the Inspector, the Court observes that although in one of the cases referred to by the parties the Inspector reached a conclusion that was instrumental in a conviction for hate speech (see paragraph 51 above), it was also criticised by ECRI for upholding so-called “traditional values” as a basis for supporting intolerance (see paragraph 61 above; see also the results of the Eurobarometer survey in paragraph 64 in fine above). Similarly, on the facts of the case, and taking into account the gravity of the threats uttered by the Internet commenters, the Court has already found that a civil-law remedy, or the referral of such comments to the Inspector (see paragraph 70 above), did not constitute remedies that had to be exhausted (see paragraph 128 above)."

            [
                "154. On the facts of the present case the Court also notes the prosecutor’s finding that the majority of the persons who had posted hate-inciting comments, including those directly calling for violence, on the first applicant’s Facebook profile had used their own personal profiles (see paragraph 18 above). Accordingly, it cannot find, at least in this case, that the failure to establish the identity of those persons and bring them to justice was impossible on account of any technical limitations, even if the Lithuanian authorities had been willing to do so (see paragraph 140 above)."

            [
                "155. The Court cannot but find that the statistics provided both by the Government and the applicants, as well as those by the third-party interveners and international bodies, show otherwise. Firstly, even acknowledging that between 2012 and 2015 some thirty pre-trial investigations regarding homophobic hate speech were opened in Lithuania, one cannot overlook the fact that all of them were discontinued, mostly because the culprits could not be found (see paragraph 139 above). As ECRI noted in 2016, the growing level of intolerance against sexual minorities has remained largely unchecked (see paragraph 56 above). That being so, the Court also gives weight to the applicants’ argument that in view of the law-enforcement authorities’ practice in this regard – and also in response to the outcome of their own case – they had not felt like complaining to the law-enforcement agencies again (see also paragraph 53 of the ECRI report, cited in paragraph 59 above). In fact, in the applicants’ case the Regional Court even considered that to open criminal proceedings would have been a “waste of time and resources” (see paragraph 23 above). As put forward by the applicants and the third-party interveners, who also relied on the ECRI report (see paragraphs 136 and 148 above), this prejudicial attitude of the domestic court is fraught with the risk that Article 170 of the Criminal Code could become a “dead letter” that, in the words of the LGL Association, the law-enforcement authorities chose not to apply “by giving unjustified preference to freedom of expression, or perhaps owing to other motives which, although not related to law, had an influence on law” (see paragraph 19 above). Secondly, the Court takes notes of the information regarding the Lithuanian law-enforcement institutions’ failure to acknowledge the bias motivation of such crimes and to take an approach which would be appropriate to the seriousness of the situation (see paragraphs 54 ‑ 55 of the ECRI report, cited in paragraph 59 above; see also paragraphs 57-58 of that report, cited in paragraph 60 above). In this connection the Court reiterates that it has already held in Identoba and Others (cited above, § 77) that without such a strict approach on the part of the law-enforcement authorities, prejudice-motivated crimes would unavoidably be treated on an equal footing with ordinary cases without such overtones, and the resultant indifference would be tantamount to official acquiescence or even connivance in hate crimes. Regarding Lithuania, the most recent ECRI materials also show a lack of a comprehensive strategic approach on the part of the authorities to tackle the issue of racist and homophobic hate speech (see paragraph 62 above)."

Consequently, the Court concludes that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention.",

The higher prosecutor is not required to hear the complainant and the ensuing proceedings are entirely a matter between the supervising prosecutor and his subordinates. The complainant is not a party to any proceedings and is entitled only to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body has dealt with his hierarchical appeal. It follows that an appeal to a higher prosecutor does not give the person employing it a personal right to the exercise by the State of its supervisory powers, and that such an appeal does not therefore constitute an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention."

Such an appeal is in fact an information statement followed by a request to that authority to make use of its power to order an additional inquiry if it sees fit to do so. The higher prosecutor is not required to hear the complainant and the ensuing proceedings are entirely a matter between the supervising prosecutor and his subordinates. The complainant is not a party to any proceedings and is entitled only to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body has dealt with his hierarchical appeal. It follows that an appeal to a higher prosecutor does not give the person employing it a personal right to the exercise by the State of its supervisory powers, and that such an appeal does not therefore constitute an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention."

Russia (dec.), no. 49790/99, 14 October 2003). Although in these proceedings the court of general jurisdiction is not competent to pursue an independent investigation or make any findings of fact, a judicial review of a complaint has the benefit of providing a forum guaranteeing due process of law. In public and adversarial proceedings an independent tribunal is called upon to assess whether the applicant has a prima facie case of ill-treatment and, if he has, to reverse the prosecutor's decision and order a criminal investigation."

Bulgaria (dec.), no. 42027/98, 3 April 2003).

The Russian Constitution and the rules of criminal procedure vested the power to order or prolong detention pending trial in prosecutors and courts (see paragraph 49 above). No exceptions to that rule were permitted or provided for. As noted above, in the period from 13 December 2000 to 11 January 2001 there was neither a prosecutor's order nor a judicial decision authorising the applicant's detention.

The Court reiterates that, in determining the length of detention pending trial under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, the period to be taken into consideration begins on the day the accused is taken into custody and ends on the day when the charge is determined, even if only by a court of first instance. In view of the essential link between Article 5 § 3 of the Convention and paragraph 1 (c) of that Article, a person convicted at first instance cannot be regarded as being detained “for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence”, but is in the position provided for by Article 5 § 1 (a), which authorises deprivation of liberty “after conviction by a competent court” (see Panchenko v. Russia, no. 45100/98, § § 91 and 93, 8 February 2005, with further references). Accordingly, the applicant's detention from 5 July 2001, the date of his original first-instance conviction, to 17 October 2001, the date on which that conviction was quashed and his case remitted, cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 5 § 3. The Court consequently finds that the period to be taken into consideration consisted of two separate terms, the first lasting from 11 October 2000 to 5 July 2001 and the second from 17 October 2001 to 18 April 2002, and amounted to fourteen months in total."

As regards the domestic authorities'reliance on the gravity of the charges as the sole and decisive element, the Court has repeatedly held that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Panchenko, cited above § 102; Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, § 81, 26 July 2001; and Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, § 51). This is particularly true in the Russian legal system where the characterisation in law of the facts – and thus the sentence faced by the applicant – is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of the issue whether the evidence that has been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov v.

The Court reiterates that any system of mandatory detention pending trial is incompatible per se with Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, it being incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish and demonstrate the existence of concrete facts outweighing the rule of respect for individual liberty (see Rokhlina v.

Furthermore, the Court observes that the contract between the applicant and Mrs Moskalenko is a template, in which only the parties'names and the amount were filled in, whereas all the remaining fields describing the nature of legal work, the due date and other conditions, have remained blank. It appears that that template did not create a legally enforceable obligation on the applicant to pay any fee to Mrs Moskalenko. This part of the claim must also be rejected (see, mutatis mutandis, Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom (Article 50), judgment of 24 February 1983, Series A no. 59, § 22). Having regard to the above considerations, the Court rejects the applicant's claim for costs and expenses in the Strasbourg proceedings."

The applicant appealed to the High Administrative Court, sitting as a first-instance court. He argued that the HCJ ’ s decision was contrary to the constitutional provisions containing an exhaustive list of cases where judges could be dismissed and an exhaustive list of activities incompatible with judicial office.

However, the HCJ had failed to allow his resignation and had instead proceeded to dismiss him under the GCA, under less favourable conditions. This had been disproportionate, since the goal of the GCA was to remove certain categories of civil servants from their positions, not to punish them, and that goal could have been achieved by allowing the plaintiff to resign.",

                "104. On 27 June 1996 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted Resolution 1096 (1996) on measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems (“the PACE Resolution”). The relevant part of that Resolution reads as follows:",
                "“1. The heritage of former communist totalitarian systems is not an easy one to handle. On an institutional level this heritage includes (over)centralisation, the militarisation of civilian institutions, bureaucratisation, monopolisation, and over ‑ regulation; on the level of society, it reaches from collectivism and conformism to blind obedience and other totalitarian thought patterns. To re-establish a civilised, liberal state under the rule of law on this basis is difficult - this is why the old structures and thought patterns have to be dismantled and overcome ...",
                "4. Thus a democratic state based on the rule of law must, in dismantling the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems, apply the procedural means of such a state. It cannot apply any other means, since it would then be no better than the totalitarian regime which is to be dismantled. A democratic state based on the rule of law has sufficient means at its disposal to ensure that the cause of justice is served and the guilty are punished - it cannot, and should not, however, cater to the desire for revenge instead of justice. It must instead respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as the right to due process and the right to be heard, and it must apply them even to those people who, when they were in power, did not apply them themselves. A state based on the rule of law can also defend itself against a resurgence of the communist totalitarian threat, since it has ample means at its disposal which do not conflict with human rights and the rule of law, and are based upon the use of both criminal justice and administrative measures ...",
                "7. The Assembly also recommends that criminal acts committed by individuals during the communist totalitarian regime be prosecuted and punished under the standard criminal code. If the criminal code provides for a statute of limitations for some crimes, this can be extended, since it is only a procedural, not a substantive matter. Passing and applying retroactive criminal laws is, however, not permitted. On the other hand, the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which at the time when it was committed did not constitute a criminal offence according to national law, but which was considered criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations, is permitted ...",
                "11. Concerning the treatment of persons who did not commit any crimes that can be prosecuted in accordance with paragraph 7, but who nevertheless held high positions in the former totalitarian communist regimes and supported them, the Assembly notes that some states have found it necessary to introduce administrative measures, such as lustration or de-communisation laws. The aim of these measures is to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they cannot be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles, as they have shown no commitment to or belief in them in the past and have no interest or motivation to make the transition to them now.",
                "12. The Assembly stresses that, in general, these measures can be compatible with a democratic state under the rule of law if several criteria are met. Firstly, guilt, being individual, rather than collective, must be proven in each individual case - this emphasises the need for an individual, and not collective, application of lustration laws. Secondly, the right of defence, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed. Revenge may never be a goal of such measures, nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed. The aim of lustration is not to punish people presumed guilty - this is the task of prosecutors using criminal law - but to protect the newly emerged democracy.",
                "13. The Assembly thus suggests that it be ensured that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law, and focus on threats to fundamental human rights and the democratisation process. Please see the ‘ Guidelines to ensure that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law ’ as a reference text.”",

In early March, the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada amended the Law on the Rules of Procedure of Parliament with respect to the provisions for the formation of a ruling coalition. The new provisions now stipulate that a parliamentary majority is established on the basis of the number of individual MPs that support such a coalition. These changes to the Rules of Procedure allowed a new governing coalition to be established.",

On 30 September 2010, the CCU (hereinafter, “the 30 September Judgment”) issued a Decision declaring Law No. 2222 unconstitutional “due to a violation of the constitutional procedure of its consideration and adoption”.

                "“ 32. Party affiliation, political and ideological reasons should not be used as grounds for lustration measures, as stigmatization and discrimination of political opponents do not represent acceptable means of political struggle in a state governed by the rule of law.",
                "63. Finally, as is also stated in Article 1.2 of the Lustration law, “lustration needs to be based on the principle of individual (not collective) liability”.",
                "64. The Lustration law does not comply with these requirements. With the exception of the persons mentioned in Articles 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7, the establishment of individual guilt by an independent organ is not required. The ban on access to public functions, applied to these other persons, is based on the mere fact of having held a certain position, with an ensuing presumption of guilt. While this approach might be acceptable with respect to the holders of high positions during the communist period and holders of some of the crucial government offices during Mr. Yanukovych´s reign (senior offices), in all other cases guilt should be proved on the basis of individual conduct. If the mere fact of belonging to a party, an organisation or an administrative body of the old regime is a ground for banning from public office, then such ban amounts to a form of collective and discriminatory punishment which is incompatible with human rights standards. Lustration then risks becoming a political instrument to oppress opponents.",
                "76. There is an overlap between the Lustration Law and the Law on the Restoration of the Trust in the Judiciary as concerns the Maidan events. The Ukrainian authorities have explained that the inclusion of judges in the new law was justified on two grounds: first, the previous law has proved ineffective (the number of cases processed by the special commission is negligible); second, the previous law does not enable to ban the lustrated judge from public service. The Venice Commission finds that if the previous law is deemed to be ineffective, it should be repealed and replaced by new, more effective provisions which however duly respect the constitutional rules on the independence of judges. The current overlap creates problems of legal certainty and of co-ordination: if a judge has already been the object of a procedure under the Law on the Restoration of Trust in the Judiciary, he or she should be immune from the application of the Lustration law pursuant to the principle of ne bis in idem. If no procedure has been carried out yet, it is unclear which procedure prevails. The lustration of judges should be regulated in one law only.",

This register is created and maintained by the Ministry of Justice. In addition, this information regarding bans under Article 1.4 is also published on the website of the Ministry of Justice, where information including the individual ’ s personal data and progress in the screening are made freely available.",

The adverse effects of such publication on the person ’ s reputation may hardly be removed by a later rectification, and the affected person has no means to defend himself against such adverse effects. The latter may only appear to be a proportionate measure necessary in a democratic society when the collaboration is finally verified, not before. Publication should therefore only occur after the court ’ s decision”.",

                "b) Applying lustration measures in respect of the recent period during which Mr Yanukovych was President of Ukraine would ultimately amount to questioning the actual functioning of the constitutional and legal framework of Ukraine as a democratic state governed by the rule of law.",
                "c) The Lustration law presents several serious shortcomings and would require reconsideration at least in respect of the following:",
                "- Lustration must concern only positions which may genuinely pose a significant danger to human rights or democracy; the list of positions to be lustrated should be reconsidered.",
                "- Guilt must be proven in each individual case, and cannot be presumed on the basis of the mere belonging to a category of public offices; the criteria for lustration should be reconsidered;",
                "- Responsibility for carrying out the lustration process should be removed from the Ministry of Justice and should be entrusted to a specifically created independent commission, with the active involvement of the civil society.",
                "- The lustration procedure should respect the guarantees of a fair trial (right to counsel, equality of arms, right to be heard in person); court proceedings should suspend the administrative decision on lustration until the final judgment; the Lustration law should specifically provide for these guarantees.",
                "- The lustration of judges should be regulated in one piece of legislation and not in overlapping ones, and should only be carried out with full respect of the constitutional provisions guaranteeing their independence, and only the High Council of Justice should be responsible for any dismissal of a judge.",

                "“ 6. In April 2015, the Venice Commission received from the Ukrainian authorities a set of draft amendments to the Law on Government Cleansing that had been submitted to the Parliament... These amendments are under consideration and have not been formally approved yet. This final opinion nevertheless takes them into account when assessing the Law...",
                "A. Aims of the Law on Government Cleansing",
                "23. The Law on Government Cleansing differs from lustration laws adopted in other countries of Central and Eastern Europe in that it is broader in scope. It pursues two different aims. The first is that of protecting the society from individuals who, due to their past behaviour, could pose a threat to the newly established democratic regime. The second is to cleanse the public administration from individuals who have engaged in large-scale corruption. The term lustration in its traditional meaning only covers the first process.",
                "24. The Venice Commission accepts that the two aims pursued by the Law on Government Cleansing are both legitimate.",
                "25. A newly democratic state might have good reasons to remove from the public life, on a temporary basis, individuals who occupied high-level positions under the previous, non-democratic regime or who engaged in serious human rights violations. Doing so limits the risk that the new regime be overturned or tarnished from the beginning by non-democratic practices. It strengthens public trust in the new government and enables the society to have a new, fresh start. At the same time, it is important to keep in mind that lustration is not, and is not meant to be, a form of criminal proceedings. It must never be used as a substitute for a criminal sanction, when such a sanction would be warranted, or as a measure of revenge and retaliation.",
                "26. Anti-corruption measures also play an important role in building up a democratic society. In addition to undermining the national economy, corruption might constitute a security threat. It also has a negative impact on the trust in the public institutions and on social cohesion within the society. In Ukraine, corruption has for some time been a widespread problem with a tendency to grow. In the 2014 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine was ranked 142th of 175 countries.",
                "The fight against corruption is a long-term process. Corruption, once ingrained in the social life, can hardly be eradicated through a one-time measure.",
                "27. The Law on Government Cleansing addresses the two challenges that the young Ukrainian democracy faces – non-democratic elites formerly loyal to President Yanukovych and corrupted officials – at the same time. In doing so, it goes beyond the process of lustration as this has been traditionally defined. During the meetings with the Ukrainian authorities, the Venice Commission delegation has repeatedly expressed the view that trying to deal with the two challenges in the same piece of legislation, and while using identical means, is not optimal. Lustration on the one hand and anti-corruption measures on the other hand, though both legitimate, are not identical in nature. They are also not subject to the same international legal standards and require different means to fight them.",
                "28. The Venice Commission understands that in the specific Ukrainian context, institutionalized corruption was in fact closely linked to, and made part of non-democratic practices exhibited by the regime of the president Yanukovych. This regime, rather than serving any specific ideology, was established to allow the ruling elites to extend their personal wealth. Widespread corruption together with systematic misuse of power was among the means to achieve this goal.",
                "30. The Law on Government Cleansing bans certain categories of individuals from occupying certain public offices. The Venice Commission stresses that in line with the concept of the “democracy capable of defending itself”, the state has the right to exclude from the access to public positions those individuals who might pose a threat to the democratic system and/or have shown themselves unworthy of serving the society. At the same time, as the European Court of Human Rights noted in the Ždanoka case, “every time a State intends to rely on the principle of “a democracy capable of defending itself” in order to justify interference with individual rights, it must carefully evaluate the scope and consequences of the measure under consideration, to ensure that the /.../ balance is achieved” [citing Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, § 100, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV ]. The legal regulation imposing limits on the access to public positions thus has to be clear and non-arbitrary in nature and has to respect the principle of proportionality.",

Current holders of these positions have already been screened, or will be screened in the nearest time, according to the schedule approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. If they admit, or it is found, that they belong to any of the categories under Article 3, they have to be immediately dismissed. Candidates for these positions will be screened and, if they fall under one of the categories falling under Article 3, will be denied appointment.",
                "32. The 1996 Guidelines on Lustration stipulate that:",
                "33. The list under Article 2 of the Law contains a rather extensive number of positions in all the spheres of the public administration (government, prosecution, courts, military forces, police services etc.). The Prime Minister Arseniy Yacenyuk estimates that altogether, the Law should apply to about one million people. The Ukrainian authorities, however, with a view to proving that the impact of lustration measures (in the first meaning of this term) on the civil service will not be as extensive as feared, have provided the Venice Commission with statistical estimates on the percentage of civil servants that are likely to be lustrated on the basis of having occupied specific positions in the Prosecutor ’ s Office (337 to 1348 out of 20367 total amount of posts), in the Ministry of the Interior (372 to 1488 out of 210,000 total amount of posts) and in the State fiscal services (335 to 1340 out of 58,826 total posts). As it stated in its Interim Opinion, the Venice Commission warns that an overbroad personal scope of application of the Law would be very problematic. Not only would it risk violating individual fundamental rights: it would also affect the functioning of the whole Ukrainian civil service and social peace, giving rise to serious antagonisms and stimulating the rancour of those working under the former regime being disqualified from public functions in a disproportionate manner. A large scale lustration process would result in enormous bureaucratic burdens and might lead to an atmosphere of general fear and distrust.",
                "50. Article 3(1)-(2) disqualifies certain individuals on the basis of the position that they held during the period of presidency by Viktor Yanukovych in 2010-2014 (1) or during the Maidan events at the turn of 2013-2014 (2). The disqualification based solely on the position is not a priori contrary to international standards, provided that it is reserved for the high positions within organizations responsible for serious human rights violations and for serious cases of mismanagement. The Venice Commission is not completely persuaded that all the positions listed in Article 3(1)-(2) meet this condition. It notes however that the Ukrainian authorities are better placed to assess which public institutions played a prominent role, engaging in non-democratic processes, in the two relevant periods.",
                "51. The time frame set in Article 3(1) – holding an office “for at least a year cumulatively between February 25, 2010 and February 22, 2014” – would require some justification. Given that Article 3(1) mostly relates to high-level posts within the state administration, it is not clear, why a minimum period of holding such posts is needed and why this minimum period has been set to one year.",
                "68. As the Venice Commission noted in its Interim Opinion, the Law on Government Cleansing “seeks to deal with two different periods of undemocratic rule in the country: the Soviet communist regime and the ‘ power usurpation by the President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych ’ ” (para. 25).",
                "69. With respect to the first period, the Venice Commission stressed that “cogent reasons to justify lustration with regard to persons involved in the Communist regime need to be given” (para. 37). Even after extensive exchange of views with the Ukrainian authorities, the doubts as to the presence of these cogent reasons still persist.",
                "70. The Venice Commission once again recalls that “the measures of lustration are, by their nature, temporary and the objective necessity for the restriction of individual rights resulting from this procedure decreases over time” [ Ādamsons v. Latvia, no. 3669/03, § 116, 24 June 2008 ]. Whereas the totalitarian non-democratic nature of the pre-1991 regime in the Soviet Union is not open to question, the need to use lustration measures with respect to the representatives of this regime, almost 25 years after its fall, seem controversial. It might well be that some of the representatives of the communist regime still constitute a threat to the democratic regime in Ukraine. Yet, this should not be presumed based simply on the position they held prior to 1991. Their behaviour and activities in the period posterior to that date should be taken into account as well.",
                "71. With respect to the second period, that of the “power usurpation by the President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych” (Article 1(2) of the Law), the Venice Commission repeats that “applying lustration measures in respect of acts committed after the end of the totalitarian regime may only be justified in the light of exceptional historic and political conditions” [citing CDL-AD(2012)028, op. cit., para. 77]. It is primarily for the Ukrainian authorities to assess whether such exceptional conditions have existed in the country during and after the fall of the Yanukovych regime. However, this assessment and the measures taken by Ukraine must respect human rights and the European standards on the rule of law and democracy, and will be ultimately monitored by the European institutions.",

It also drew attention to some of the shortcomings of the 2014 Law on Government Cleansing, relating to the personal scope of application of the Law (the need to limit lustration to the most important positions within the state etc.), the time element (two period of exclusion etc.), the administration of lustration (decentralized procedure, absence of an independent body etc.) and the procedural guarantees (individualised liability, protection of personal data of individuals subject to lustration, availability of the judicial review etc.)."

Yanukovych in 2010-2014 or during the Maidan events at the turn of 2013-2014. When doing so, they should take into account the concrete situation in Ukraine, while at the same time respecting that “where an organisation has perpetrated serious human rights violations, a member, employee or agent shall be considered to have taken part in these violations if he was a senior official of the organisation” (para. h) of the Guidelines).",
                "f) Lustration should be administered in a centralised way. If the decentralised procedure is maintained, the competences of the Executive Body should be strengthened (or clarified).

Integrity refers to an employee ’ s adherence to international standards of human rights and professional conduct, including a person ’ s financial propriety. Public employees who are personally responsible for gross violations of human rights or serious crimes under international law revealed a basic lack of integrity and breached the trust of the citizens they were meant to serve. The citizens, in particular the victims of abuses, are unlikely to trust and rely on a public institution that retains or hires individuals with serious integrity deficits, which would fundamentally impair the institution ’ s capacity to deliver its mandate. Vetting processes aim at excluding from public service persons with serious integrity deficits in order to (re ‑ )establish civic trust and (re ‑ )legitimize public institutions.",

At the same time, group removals may also be too narrow and overlook individuals who committed abuses but were not members of the group. Such broadly construed collective processes violate basic due process standards, are unlikely to achieve the intended reform goals, may remove employees whose expertise is needed in the post ‑ conflict or post-authoritarian period, and may create a pool of discontented employees that might undermine the transition.”"

For the Court, this indicates a certain lack of coherence between the Act ’ s proclaimed aims and the rules it actually promulgated (see paragraph 72 above). The Constitutional Court has so far not completed its review of the constitutionality of the GCA and, therefore, the Court cannot benefit from its views on this point (contrast, for example, Animal Defenders International, §§ 13 ‑ 33 and 113-16, and Anchev, § 110, both cited above)."

The Court also notes the first applicant ’ s argument that the then President of Ukraine who had signed the GCA into law had himself served for nine months as a minister in President Yanukovych ’ s government (see paragraph 223 above). The Government stressed, as one of the key goals of the GCA, the need to restore public trust in the State authorities through the visible renewal of their personnel (see paragraphs 252 and 254 above).

As regards the applicant ’ s conduct, they considered that she had been primarily focused on defending herself from the respondent ’ s violence rather than protecting her children from poor living conditions. That is to say, when the interim custody order had come into force, there had been no legal impediment to her taking the children. However, in the efforts to enforce her rights, when she could have been expected to protect the children by taking them to her house regardless of the risk to her from the respondent, she showed a lack of efficiency and emotional engagement, relying on “a unrealistic expectation that she would be protected from the respondent ’ s violence if the State institution helped her in the execution of the custody transfer”. As the children had been alienated from the applicant, and branded a bad mother by the respondent, the children had a perception about their father as the only parent interested in raising them.

Moreover, while what was at stake for the applicant in the proceedings before the Constitutional Court was of considerable importance, the Constitutional Court, according to the Government, was not in position to adopt and implement any priority policy in dealing with constitutional appeals and did not consider doing so, including in child custody-related cases (see paragraph 88 above).

According to the Court ’ s settled case-law, a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him or her of his or her status as a “victim” unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and subsequently afforded appropriate and sufficient redress for the breach of the Convention (see, for the main principles, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, §§ 178-213, ECHR 2006 ‑ V, and Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, §§ 69-98, ECHR 2006-V; see also, among other authorities, Normann v.

In its decision of 23 May 2012 (dispatched on 5 July 2012), the Constitutional Court found, relying on several of the Court ’ s decisions rendered under Article 8, that the applicant had suffered a breach of her “right to a fair trial” on account of the failure of the State to take all necessary measures to enforce the 2005 custody judgment. The Court considers that it is unnecessary to determine in the present case whether the acknowledgment of a violation by the national authorities adequately acknowledged a violation under Article 8, as the redress afforded was in any event not appropriate and sufficient for the reasons outlined below."

The Ministry had thirty days, or ninety days in complex cases, to draw up an analysis of the work of a social care center and give it guidelines on how to proceed.

Thus, the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits (see Vučković and Others v.

The only remedies to be exhausted are those which are effective and were available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say they must have been accessible and capable of providing redress in respect of the complaint and must have offered reasonable prospects of success (see, mutatis mutandis, Akdivar and Others v.

Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article 35 § 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. The Court has recognised that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of the individual case. This means, amongst other things, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 69). It must examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected in order to exhaust domestic remedies."

As regards the first objection, the Court notes that a complaint to the Ministry would be a hierarchical complaint or, in other words, no more than mere information submitted to the supervisory organ with full discretion to make use of its powers as it sees fit and without involving the applicant in the proceedings even if taken (see, mutatis mutandis, V.A.M. v. Serbia, cited above, § 85; Horvat v. Croatia, no. 51585/99, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII; and Hartman v. the Czech Republic, no. 53341/99, § 66, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII (extracts) ). Moreover, the Court notes that the Ministry became involved in the enforcement of the custody judgment in 200 9 and did not enable any significant expedition of those proceedings (see paragraph 48 above).

Depending of the nature of an interim measure and of complaints before the Court, it may be appropriate in certain situations to distinguish between various sets of proceedings and examine them separately. The Court adopted such an approach in the Leonov case (see Leonov v. Russia, no. 77180/11, § 55, 10 April 2018), in which the applicant complained that the domestic authorities had not adduced relevant and sufficient reasons for granting a residence order in favour of his son ’ s mother and, previously, for the interim order prohibiting him from contacting his son or picking him up from his nursery pending the residence order proceedings. In the present case, and unlike in the case of Leonov, the interim decision concerned precisely the same issue, that is care and custody of the children, and both decisions were in the applicant ’ s favour. In the context of continuous non-enforcement of custody/contact -related rights under Article 8, an applicant cannot be expected to make a separate complaint to the Constitutional Court or this Court about the non-enforcement of each and every interim order, of which may be a large number, within the main proceedings. The Court will therefore adopt a global approach when considering the domestic proceedings and have regard to the overall facts which may be important for the context and merits of the main proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Article 6 and ratione materiae compatibility, Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, §§ 77, ECHR 2009 and, in the context of Article 10, Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 22, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV; see, in the child custody context, Šobota-Gajić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 27966/06, § 45, 6 November 2007, and Oller Kamińska v.

The school psychologist had neither been authorised nor had she done so. The State had caused her additional suffering by accusing her of contributing herself to her own tragic situation by failing to go against the wishes of her unprepared crying children. Her tragic situation, which had lasted more than ten years, was however a paradigm of the Serbian system – a failure of the relevant bodies to act in good time and a lack of any responsibility or accountability for their laziness. The applicant blamed the domestic authorities for their failure to do anything about the respondent ’ s aggressive attitude toward her, obstruction of contact and manipulation of the children.

In 2008 the children had already been twelve, the age when their opinions had to be taken into account, and they had stated that they wanted to stay with their father. In such circumstances, any coercion would have been unacceptable, so the authorities had focused on overcoming the bad family relationships and suggested counselling for the parties. The competent court had apparently addressed a letter of 20 November 2009 to the MHI as “urgent”, describing the complex circumstances of the case and indicating what was expected of the Institute. The MHI had declined its authority for mediation and advised the court to direct the family to the Marriage and Family Counselling Office of the Belgrade Social Care Centre. Unfortunately, no cooperation between the parents had been established, “which was not expected, either, bearing in mind [the respondent ’ s] attitude during the entire proceedings as well as the circumstances – he had been assessed as a person of low intellectual and cultural potential in [his] initial contact with the Centre”.

While acknowledging that “the State authorities were slightly passive”, which had led to the Constitutional Court finding a violation of the applicant ’ s right to a fair trial, the Government pointed out the same attitude on the side of the applicant throughout the relevant period, which, in turn, had led to the delay complained of, in particular : (a) in the early years she had departed with her daughter, leaving her son with his father in absolutely inadequate conditions; (b) she had sought the interim measure more than ten months after her husband had taken the children away; (c) she had shown no determination to forcibly take custody of her children as they had been crying even though the conditions had been fulfilled; (d) she had not shown any initiative to fix the hearing after that unsuccessful transfer of the children; and (e) she had failed in her duty to inform the court in good time that the interim measure had become null and to request enforcement of the custody judgment.

In relation to the State ’ s obligation to implement positive measures, the Court has held that Article 8 includes for parents a right that steps be taken to reunite them with their children and an obligation on the national authorities to facilitate such reunions (see, among other authorities, Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania, no. 31679/96, § 94, ECHR 2000-I; Nuutinen v. Finland, no. 32842/96, § 127, ECHR 2000-VIII; and Iglesias Gil and A.U.I. v. Spain, no. 56673/00, § 49, ECHR 2003-V). The obligation of the national authorities to take measures to facilitate a reunion is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with a child who has lived for some time with other persons may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures to be taken to this effect. The nature and extent of that preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and co-operation of all concerned will always be an important ingredient. Whilst national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such co-operation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child. Although coercive measures against children are not desirable in this sensitive area, the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the children live (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, § 106). In cases concerning the enforcement of decisions in the sphere of family law, the Court has repeatedly found that what is decisive is whether the national authorities have taken all necessary steps to facilitate the execution, in so far as can reasonably be demanded in the special circumstances of each case (see, among other authorities, Hokkanen, cited above, § 58; Nuutinen, cited above, §§ 127-28; Glaser, cited above, § 66; Sylvester v.

Following the first interim order of June 2002 which was quashed quickly thereafter, on 27 February 2003 the competent court ordered the respondent to hand over the children to the applicant within twenty-four hours, pending the final outcome of the ongoing custody proceedings (see paragraph 15 above). This interim custody order had been set aside by the custody judgment rendered in October 2005, which was served on the respondent in November 2006 (see paragraphs 16-17 above ). By that final judgment, the court, referring to the respondent ’ s negative behaviour, appalling living conditions and the need for the children ’ s immediate removal, granted sole custody of the children to the applicant, determined the respondent ’ s access rights and prohibited his contact with the children for three months to enable the children to restore emotional ties with the applicant. The new custody decision of June 2010 in the respondent ’ s favour in the course of fresh custody proceedings was soon after quashed and the proceedings terminated following the respondent ’ s ultimate withdrawal (see paragraphs 19-20 above). Both interim and final decisions remained unenforced (see paragraphs 4 0, 6 3 and 64 above).

The Court is mindful of the fact that custody and contact-related disputes are by their very nature extremely sensitive for all the parties concerned, and it is not necessarily an easy task for the domestic authorities to ensure enforcement of a court order where one or both parents ’ behaviour is far from constructive (see Krasicki v. Poland, no. 17254/11, § 90, 15 April 2014). However, a lack of intention to co-operate by one parent rather imposes on the authorities an obligation to take measures that would reconcile the conflicting interests of the parties, keeping in mind the paramount interests of the children to have contact with both parents and be in the custody of the parent who was determined as the custodial parent (see Z. v. Poland, no. 34694/06, § 75, 20 April 2010)."

According to the domestic law, if the initial period of three days for voluntary compliance with a child custody order has passed, fines should be imposed and, ultimately, if necessary, the children be transferred forcibly by the judge (see paragraph 79 above). The enforcement court imposed fines to the respondent on two occasions in an attempt to make him comply with the order of June 2003 (October and December 2003) to no avail as the applicant ’ s house did not contain any valuable assets to collect. The custody transfer fixed for 2 December 2003 also failed as the respondent had apparently hidden with the children. Those initial steps date back prior to 3 March 2004, the date of ratification of the Convention by Serbia, and are noted only for reasons of context whilst examining the situation complained of as a whole."

Six months later, on 17 June 2004, the enforcement court again resorted to imposing an earlier provisional fine on the respondent and announced that a forced custody transfer would take place if he failed to comply voluntarily with the order within three days (see paragraph 25 above). There is no information in the case file as to whether the court attempted to collect the imposed fine, which in any event had proved to be an ineffective measure earlier as it could not be enforced or provide any incentive for the respondent to alter his conduct. The custody transfer fixed by the court for 30 November 2004 failed, as no one could be found at the respondent ’ s address (see paragraph 26 above). It took the court another five months to fix another reunion for 9 May 2005, which failed owing to the failure to duly summon the parties, social services and police officers (see paragraph 27 above). The Court observes that no procedural steps were taken in the meantime in the enforcement proceedings, nor was any attempt made to locate the respondent and make use of a more coercive measure in spite of his clearly uncooperative attitude, or to contact him or the children in order to offer counselling, mediation and prepare for the custody transfer in an adequate manner (compare and contrast Cârstoiu v. Romania ( dec. ), no. 20660/10, § 42, 7 May 2013). The Government have not provided an explanation for any of these periods of inactivity.

The Court observes that the Government considered that the applicant was responsible for her reluctance to physically assume custody of her children on 3 June 2005 on the school premises at a time when all the conditions for a custody transfer had been fulfilled as she preferred a less traumatic custody transfer for the children with the assistance of the Social Care Centre (see paragraph 28 above). While indeed such action by a parent may be held against him or her (see, for example, Zdravković v. Serbia, no. 28181/11, § 67, 20 September 2016, and Damnjanović, cited above, § 80 ), the Court considers that that the State authorities could not merely rely on the applicant ’ s personal abilities and court orders which were not likely to produce the desired results smoothly in the context of a three-year long separation without any contact between the applicant and her two young children, as well as in view of the reported violence by the domestic authorities (see paragraphs 31 and 39 above), without any preparatory measure. No measures were taken or even considered by the authorities to provide expert assistance to the children over a number of motivation sessions and encourage them to meet the applicant, which could have prepared them for the re-establishment of contact and especially precautious swift of child custody in these circumstances."

However, soon after, the RSCC supplied the report requested by the enforcement court (see paragraphs 30-31 above). It reiterated its earlier assessment of the applicant ’ s ability to have custody in comparison to that of the respondent, but noted that disrupting the children ’ s living arrangements with the respondent would not at that time have been in their best interests. The applicant was also criticised for being primarily focused on defending herself from the respondent ’ s violence rather than taking the children from him after the interim measure had been adopted and protecting them from poor living conditions regardless of the risk of violence for her, relying on “an unrealistic expectation that she would be protected from the respondent ’ s violence if the State institution helped her in the execution of the custody transfer”. The RSCC ’ s decisions on the corrective supervision and initiation of the proceedings for deprivation of parental rights came late in the day (see E.S. and Others v. Slovakia, no. 8227/04, 15 September 2009), were focused on the respondent ’ s negative attitude towards the custody transfer and were ultimately not enforced in any event (see paragraph 34 above)."

Referring to the instructions given by the second-instance court, on 19 June 2006 the enforcement court invited the RSCC to consult the court ’ s case file in order to facilitate the protection of the best interests of the children (see paragraph 36 above). The RSCC ’ s lawyer and social worker consulted the court ’ s case file a year later and reported on 6 August 2007 that it would be in the best interests of the children to have the interim custody order enforced (see paragraph 37 above).

During this time, the enforcement court heard the parties (7 July 2009) and the children (23 October 2009).

Contact between the applicant and her children was finally established but reduced, in the children ’ s best interests, to several hours twice a week. The court also eventually requested counselling for the whole family, expert supervision and reporting on the contact and parties ’ behaviour in that respect, as well as on the fortnightly supervision of the children ’ s weekend visits to the applicant. At the same time, it would also appear that there were no clear guidelines as to the competences of various institutions for the family ’ s treatment, or that the two bodies in charge of the enforcement of the custody decisions did not know which institution was entrusted with which tasks (see paragraphs 51-56 above)."

Greece, no. 39034/12, § 47, 15 March 2018). Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured. The effect of that provision is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the Contracting States’ obligations under Article 13 varies, depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint. However, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law. The “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of the Convention does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the “authority” referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; however, if it is not, its powers and the guarantees that it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective (see, among many other authorities, Kudła v.

He told them that on one occasion, while being questioned by the Chechen police, he had been tortured and forced to sign a statement agreeing to serve as an informant for the police; subsequently, the police had tried to find and arrest him. He presented to the border guards documents confirming that after being tortured he had developed post ‑ traumatic stress disorder.

Police officers had come to his home and taken him for questioning to a police station. His home had been raided by armed people wearing masks. Subsequently, he had decided to leave the Chechen Republic and had applied for international protection in Poland. Later, he had moved to Austria.

In addition, international human-rights law has established non-refoulement as a fundamental component of the absolute prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The duty not to refoule is also recognized as applying to refugees irrespective of their formal recognition, thus obviously including asylum-seekers whose status has not yet been determined. It encompasses any measure attributable to a State which could have the effect of returning an asylum ‑ seeker or refugee to the frontiers of territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened, or where he or she would risk persecution. This includes rejection at the frontier, interception and indirect refoulement, whether of an individual seeking asylum or in situations of mass influx.”"

In the view of inspectors, although that is a subjective opinion, officers did not attach much importance to information provided in such cases by foreigners and they were focusing more on proving that the reason for leaving the country was of [an] economic nature. After questions about possible risks, they very often moved on to ask further about a profession performed in the country and the intention to find employment in Poland. The declaration of such an intention itself, although again that is the subjective opinion of inspectors, in many cases sufficed for an officer to assume that a given foreigner came to Poland for economic reasons, despite his/her concerns of other nature.”"

Such an entry contains only information concerning foreigners’ personal details and details of other members of family who accompany him/her, the country of origin, passport numbers and, what is most important, the purpose that the foreigner gives for coming to Poland. The last piece of information is recorded in the form of laconic statements, such as going to Germany; doesn’t want to live with her husband; has no money; wants to live in Poland. In case the interview results in the refusal to enter the territory of Poland, identical information concerning the purpose of arrival is included in the memo [the official note]. The memo is attached to the files of the administrative proceedings in which the decision is issued to refuse the right of entry. This way of documenting interviews which have paramount importance for a possible recognition of a foreigner as a person seeking protection against persecution in the country of origin should be deemed highly insufficient. Firstly, based on an entry made by an officer, it is not possible to reconstruct, even roughly, the course of the interview. Secondly, a foreigner has no chance to inspect the entry, and hence cannot in any way refer to it or set the information right.”"

Greece, no. 39034/12, § 47, 15 March 2018). Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured. The effect of that provision is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the Contracting States’ obligations under Article 13 varies, depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint. However, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law. The “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of the Convention does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the “authority” referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; however, if it is not, its powers and the guarantees that it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective (see, among many other authorities, Kudła v.

Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, § 448, ECHR 2005 ‑ III), independent and rigorous scrutiny of any claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment breaching Article 3 (see Jabari v.

In cases where the authorities choose to remove asylum-seekers to a third country, the Court has stated that this leaves the responsibility of the Contracting State intact with regard to its duty not to deport them if substantial grounds have been shown for believing that such action would expose them, directly (that is to say in that third country) or indirectly (for example, in the country of origin or another country), to treatment contrary to, in particular, Article 3 (see M.S.S. v.

This is because the removing country acts on the basis that it would be for the receiving third country to examine the asylum request on the merits, if such a request is made to the relevant authorities of that country (see Ilias and Ahmed, cited above, § 131)."

The Government submitted that the applicants did not raise any claims in that respect and – in consequence – could not be considered asylum-seekers. The Court attaches more weight to the applicants’ version of the events at the border because it is corroborated by a large number of accounts collected from other witnesses by the national human rights institutions (in particular by the Children’s Ombudsman – see paragraphs 109-14 above). The reports by those bodies indicate the existence of a systemic practice of misrepresenting the statements given by asylum-seekers in the official notes drafted by the officers of the Border Guard serving at the border checkpoints between Poland and Belarus. Moreover, the irregularities in the procedure concerning the questioning of foreigners arriving at the Polish-Belarusian border at the relevant time, including the lack of a proper investigation into the reasons for which they sought entry into Poland, were confirmed by judgments of the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraphs 76-77 above)."

Moreover, the applicants’ version of events in this respect is also supported by the fact that they made numerous attempts to cross the border and sought representation by Polish and Belarusian lawyers, who assisted them with drafting their statements, and who – in the case of the applicants in cases nos. 40503/17 and 43643/17 – on one occasion were present at the border in order to provide representation to the applicants, but were not allowed to meet with them (see paragraphs 11 and 54 above)."

Furthermore, on 14 and 30 June and 4 July 2017 respectively, the Court (the duty judge) informed the Government that in the light of the fact that those documents had been transferred to the Government, it considered that the applicants had lodged requests for international protection (see paragraphs 21, 37 and 61 above). Information about the applicants’ claims was also subsequently submitted by electronic means directly to the Border Guard by the applicants’ representatives (see paragraphs 23, 35 and 64 above).

The applicants indicated individual circumstances that – in their opinion – substantiated their applications for international protection and produced a number of documents (their testimony concerning a history of torture or threats, psychologists’ opinions, and official documents) substantiating their claims. They also raised arguments concerning the reasons for not considering Belarus to be a safe third country for them and why, in their opinion, returning them to Belarus would put them at risk of “chain refoulement ”.

The assessment of those claims should have been carried out by the Polish authorities acting in compliance with their procedural obligations under Article 3 of the Convention. Moreover, the Polish State was under an obligation to ensure the applicants’ safety, in particular by allowing them to remain within Polish jurisdiction until such time as their claims had been properly reviewed by a competent domestic authority. Taking into account the absolute nature of the right guaranteed under Article 3, the scope of that obligation was not dependent on whether the applicants had been carrying documents authorising them to cross the Polish border or whether they had been legally admitted to Polish territory on other grounds."

Therefore, the Court considers that, pending an application for international protection, a State cannot deny access to its territory to a person presenting himself or herself at a border checkpoint who alleges that he or she may be subjected to ill-treatment if he or she remains on the territory of the neighbouring State, unless adequate measures are taken to eliminate such a risk."

Those reports noted a consistent practice of: holding very brief interviews, during which the foreigners’ statements concerning the justification for their seeking international protection were disregarded; emphasis being placed on the arguments that allowed them to be categorised as economic migrants; and misrepresenting the statements made by the foreigners in very brief official notes, which constituted the sole basis for issuing refusal-of-entry decisions and returning them to Belarus, even in the event that the foreigners in question had made it clear that they wished to apply for international protection in Poland (see paragraphs 98-114 above)."

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 102, ECHR 2005-I). Although the object of Article 34 is essentially that of protecting an individual against any arbitrary interference by the authorities, it does not merely compel States to abstain from such interference. There are positive obligations inherent in Article 34 requiring the authorities to furnish all necessary facilities to make possible the proper and effective examination of applications. Such an obligation will arise in particular in situations where applicants are particularly vulnerable (see Iulian Popescu v. Romania, no. 24999/04, § 33, 4 June 2013, and Amirov v.

The vital role played by interim measures in the Convention system not only underpins their binding legal effect on the States concerned, as upheld by the established case-law, but also commands that the utmost importance be attached to the question of the States Parties’ compliance with the Court’s indications in that regard. Any laxity on this question would unacceptably weaken the protection of the core rights in the Convention and would not be compatible with its values and spirit (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, § 88, Series A no. 161; Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, §§ 100 and 125; and Amirov, cited above, § 67)."

Consequently, the full facts of the case will often remain undetermined until the Court’s judgment on the merits of the complaint to which the measure is related. It is precisely for the purpose of preserving the Court’s ability to render such a judgment after an effective examination of the complaint that such measures are indicated. Until that time, it may be unavoidable for the Court to indicate interim measures on the basis of facts which, despite making a prima facie case in favour of such measures, are subsequently added to or challenged to the point of calling into question the measures’ justification (see Paladi, cited above, § 89)."

In so far as the Government argued that such a decision could also be subject to judicial review, even assuming that the latter proceedings had the required scope, the Government have not indicated any time ‑ lines concerning these proceedings, nor given any examples relevant to the context. The Court reiterates that the speed of the procedure for remedial action may also be relevant to whether it is practically effective in the particular circumstances of a given case for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (see Mikalauskas, cited above § 50, and, mutatis mutandis, McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06 § 123, ECHR 2010). In this light, the Court is not convinced that judicial review proceedings would constitute an adequate preventive remedy for the purposes of conditions of detention. This is even more so given that such proceedings would have to be undertaken subsequent to a preliminary three-tier procedure (the Board, the director and the Minister), which would have inevitably taken a certain amount of time."

                "67. The Government submitted that the applicants had failed to institute proceedings before the domestic authorities to complain about the alleged breach. They considered that the applicants could have lodged a complaint to the Board of Visitors of the Prisons under Regulation 107 of the Prison Regulations (S.L. 260.03) (hereinafter “the Board”). The members of the Board regularly visited various divisions of the prison and received complaints from inmates; however, they were also competent to deal with complaints other than those made directly to them during the visits. The Government contended that complaints to the Board were not limited, thus there was no impediment to an applicant complaining about the material conditions of his or her cell. They emphasised that the Board had a duty to reply to such complaints ( Regulation 107) and even though their decisions were not binding ( Regulation 108(2)), where the director, or any other prison officer acting on his behalf, was of the opinion that the recommendations of the Board could not be implemented for reasons which were in the best interests of the prison administration, a written explanation of those reasons had to be forwarded to the chairman of the Board and copied to the Minister, or to a person delegated by him, within one month of the date of receipt of the Board ’ s recommendations. The Minister, or the person delegated by him, may confirm or vary the decision of the director. According to the Government, that regulation thus imposed on the director the duty to issue a decision, which could be challenged in court through an action of judicial review (Article 469 A of the COCP), which the applicants could have brought with the assistance of a legal aid lawyer, in the event that they did not have sufficient funds to appoint their own lawyer."

                "69. Lastly, the Government submitted that the applicants had failed to institute constitutional redress proceedings before the relevant jurisdictions, which had wide - ranging powers to deal with Convention violations. The Government submitted that such proceedings could also be heard with urgency, reducing the duration of the proceedings to two months from the date of filing an application. For example, in the case of Richard John Bridge vs Attorney General, the case (in connection with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction proceedings) had been decided by two levels of jurisdiction in approximately a month and a half (from 6 July to 24 August 2012). Although the Court had previously criticised the duration of such proceedings, in the Government ’ s view any delays in constitutional proceedings were counterbalanced by the fact that those jurisdictions could issue interim orders pending proceedings. They cited for example a decree in the case of Emanuel Camilleri vs Inspector Louise Callejja and the Commissioner of Police (no. 50/2013), where the Civil Court (First Hall), in its constitutional jurisdiction, had released a sentenced person from prison pending the proceedings. In the particular circumstances of that case, the main witness who had testified in the applicant ’ s trial, at which a guilty verdict had ultimately been returned, was subsequently put on trial for perjury in connection with her testimony. Thus, in the Government ’ s view, in the absence of speedy proceedings there nevertheless existed a speedy interim remedy which could be decreed by the constitutional jurisdictions under Article 46 (2) of the Constitution and Article 4(2) of the European Convention Act."

Russia, no. 30251/03, § 79, 25 November 2010, and Benediktov v. Russia, no. 106/02, § 29, 10 May 2007). If an applicant has been held in conditions in breach of Article 3, a domestic remedy capable of putting an end to the on-going violation of his or her right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment is of the greatest value. However, once the applicant has left the facility in which he or she has endured the inadequate conditions, what remains relevant is that he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for the violation that has already occurred (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, § 97, 10 January 2012)."

Where the fundamental right to protection against torture, inhuman and degrading treatment is concerned, the preventive and compensatory remedies have to be complementary in order to be considered effective. The existence of a preventive remedy is indispensable for the effective protection of individuals against the kind of treatment prohibited by Article 3. Indeed, the special importance attached by the Convention to this provision requires, in the Court ’ s view, the States parties to establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to such treatment rapidly (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 98, and Torreggiani and Others v. Italy, nos. 43517/09, 46882/09, 55400/09, 57875/09, 61535/09, 35315/10 and 37818/10, § 50, 8 January 2013 ).

Accordingly, the Court does not consider that the prison authorities would have a sufficiently independent standpoint to satisfy the requirements of Article 13 (see Silver and Others, § 116, and Ananyev and Others, § 101, both cited above) as, in deciding on a complaint concerning conditions of detention for which they are responsible, they would in reality be judges in their own cause (ibid. )."

In this connection, even assuming that the guarantee of independence could be satisfied in relation to a complaint before the Minister concerning the misapplication of the regulations resulting in inadequate conditions of detention – as opposed to a complaint concerning the substance of the regulations made by the Minister him or herself, in respect of which the Minister could not be independent (see, mutatis mutandis, Silver, cited above § 116) – other deficiencies taint the adequacy of this procedure. In particular, the Court notes that there is no legal requirement on the Minister to hear the complainant or ensure his or her effective participation in the process, which would thus be entirely a matter between the Minister and the director, whose decisions and actions are at issue. The complainant would therefore not be a party to any proceedings and would only, if at all, be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body (the Minister) had dealt with the complaint. The Court considers that such a remedy consists of a hierarchical complaint which does not give the person making it a personal right to the exercise by the State of its supervisory powers, and which according to its case-law, cannot be regarded as an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 of the Convention ( see, for example, Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 104 and the cases cited therein, and, mutatis mutandis, Horvat v.

Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06 § 123, ECHR 2010). In this light, the Court is not convinced that judicial review proceedings would constitute an adequate preventive remedy for the purposes of conditions of detention.

In so far as the Government referred to an action in tort, the Court has already held in the above - mentioned Mikalauskas judgment that the Maltese law of tort did not provide for compensation for non- pecuniary damage. It noted that this was different from a loss of opportunity, which is considered as pecuniary damage in Convention case-law. It followed that an action in tort could not give rise to compensation for the non -pecuniary damage suffered (see ibid ., § 49, and, conversely, Nocha v. Poland, (dec.) no. 21116/0 9, 27 September 2011). Nor was it a preventive remedy which could put an end to such treatment rapidly (see Čuprakovs v. Latvia, no. 8543/04, § 55, 18 December 2012 ). In consequence, the Court held that an action in tort could not be considered an effective remedy under Article 3 for the purposes of a complaint of inadequate conditions of detention.

In such proceedings, courts can take cognisance of the merits of the complaint, make findings of fact and order redress that is tailored to the nature and gravity of the violation. Such courts can also make an award of compensation for non-pecuniary damage and there is no limit on the amount which can be granted to an applicant for such a violation. The ensuing judicial decision will be binding on the defaulting authority and enforceable against it (see paragraph 50 of the Mikalauskas judgment). Nevertheless, the Court held that the speed of the procedure for remedial action may also be relevant to whether it is practically effective in the particular circumstances of a given case for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 (see paragraph 75 above ). Bearing in mind the examples given by the Government in that case, the Court considered that such a remedy could not put an end to the treatment complained of rapidly. The Court concluded that while it could not rule out the possibility that constitutional redress proceedings dealt with as urgent may in other cases be considered an effective remedy for the purposes of complaints about conditions of detention and lack of adequate medical treatment under Article 3, the domestic case-law at the time of that case did not allow the Court to find that the applicant had been required to have recourse to that remedy ( see Mikalauskas, cited above § § 68- 69)."

In the absence of any other comparable examples, the Court finds no indication that the constitutional jurisdictions would be willing on a regular basis to release convicted prisoners pending a decision on their claims on conditions of detention. Indeed, the Court has doubts as to the adequacy of such measures.

Russia, no. 46468/06, § 140, 22 December 2008). The “adequacy” of medical care in this respect remains the most difficult element to determine. The mere fact that a detainee is seen by a doctor and prescribed a certain form of treatment cannot automatically lead to the conclusion that the medical care provided was adequate (see Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, § 116, 29 November 2007).

Russia, no. 59696/00, § 83, ECHR 2006-XII), that the diagnoses and care are prompt and accurate (see Hummatov, cited above, § 115, and Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, §§ 104-06, 28 March 2006), and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at curing the detainee ’ s diseases or preventing their aggravation, rather than addressing them on a symptomatic basis (see Hummatov, cited above, §§ 109 and 114; Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, § 79, 4 October 2005; and Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, § 211, 13 July 2006).

Moldova, no. 30649/05, § 117, 7 November 2006). Failure to provide proper medical aid to a detainee would not fall under Article 3 unless there was an actual detriment to his physical or mental condition, or avoidable suffering of a certain intensity, or an immediate risk of such detriment or suffering (see Lebedev v.

While it is rather unfortunate, for the purposes of lighting, that the windows are installed at a height of 2.5 m from the ground, the available artificial lighting should suffice to their needs in the limited hours during which they are confined to their cells. It transpires from the facts of the case that the applicants had, or were allowed, at least two other lamps per cell, apart from a ceiling light. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that in the absence of any indications of overcrowding or malfunctioning of the ventilation system and the artificial lighting, the negative impact of metal shutters does not reach, on its own, the threshold of severity required under Article 3 (see Pavlenko v. Russia, no. 42371/02, §§ 81-82, 1 April 2010, and Matyush v. Russia, no. 14850/03, § 58, 9 December 2008)."

                "116. It would, however, be of concern to the Court if the prison authorities did not ensure that all wall -mounted ventilators are fully functional in all cells, and that they allow fresh air to enter, while barring the entrance of external elements such as strong winds and rain ( see, for example the first applicant ’ s allegations, paragraph 12 above). It would be of even more concern if, contrary to the Government ’ s submission, the prison authorities were not making available the required equipment (be it a two - foot arm, or any other appropriate tool) to open and keep open high windows, as detainees should not have to put themselves in peril by having to climb on beds or sinks, or be dependent on other detainees to lift them up in order to access such windows."
            ],
            [
                "117. As to heating, the Court has previously highlighted the need for adequate heating (see, for example, Apostu v. Romania, no. 22765/12, § 83, 3 February 2015, and by implication, Bouros and Others v. Greece, nos. 51653/12, 50753/11, 25032/12, 66616/12 and 67930/12, § 81, 12 March 2015). The Court reiterates, as it did in the Mikalauskas judgment, that it is uneasy about the fact that no heating whatsoever was available in the prison, in particular in Division 3. It is undeniable that in the winter months the country suffers from great humidity, with temperatures which can drop to a few degrees above zero, as was the case in December 2014, a period during which the applicants were in detention. The Court also observes that the applicants ’ allegations that other inmates were allowed heaters contradict the Government ’ s claim that heaters were not allowed in cells for security reasons. The Court considers that, while the absence of a heating system (or alternatively a dehumidifying system) remains regrettable - as it would particularly help in connection with any mould or dampness present in the cells - in the current circumstances, detainees should at least make requests for further blankets or warmer clothing, which the authorities should be in a position to supply promptly."

            [
                "118. In the instant case, the Court notes that only the second of the three applicants claimed that he sometimes did not have a blanket, while the Government stated that two blankets were distributed on entry to the facility and further blankets were made available on request (see paragraphs 35 and 9 6 above). In connection with the second applicant ’ s allegation, the Court considers that given that it is the detainees ’ responsibility to take care of the material distributed, in the absence of any explanation on his part, the temporary loss of the second applicant ’ s blankets appears to be attributable to him. In any event it has not been shown or claimed that he, or the other two applicants, requested further blankets and were refused."
            ],
            [
                "119. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that access to properly equipped and hygienic sanitary facilities is of paramount importance for maintaining inmates ’ sense of personal dignity. Not only are hygiene and cleanliness integral parts of the respect that individuals owe to their bodies and to their neighbours with whom they share premises for long periods of time, they also constitute a condition and at the same time a necessity for the conservation of health. A truly humane environment is not possible without ready access to toilet facilities or the possibility of keeping one ’ s body clean (See Ananyev and Others, cited above § 114, and the references therein)."
            ],
            [
                "120. Turning to the present case, as regards access to toilets, the Court notes that, although it appears to be the case, the applicants have not complained that the toilet in their cell was not separated from the living area. Indeed, the Court observes that the applicants have individual cells, and not multi-occupancy cells, and that the cell doors are solid rather than transparent panels, and thus no privacy issues arise (compare, Aleksandr Makarov v. Russia, no. 15217/07, § 97, 12 March 2009, and Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, § 99, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI § 99 ). Nevertheless, the Court finds it useful to reiterate that, beyond any privacy issues, close proximity and exposure [to the toilet] is objectionable also from a hygiene perspective (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 157)."
            ],
            [
                "121. In this connection, in the present case the Court takes issue with the fact that the applicants ’ cells are not equipped with an automated flushing system. This is even more so if, as stated by the applicants, water was not always readily available to enable them to flush by using a bucket (see also CPT comments, at paragraph 61 above). This matter raises particular concern to the Court as this may cause unpleasant smells but also a perilous hygiene situation, particularly given that the toilets were situated in the vicinity of the applicants ’ beds without any partition. The Court has already held that the absence of a flush, accompanied by various other factors, such as dampness and filth in a cell, rusty washbasins and beds, as well as worn - out and dirty linen amounted to degrading conditions which were unfit for decent habitation ( see, for example, Zakharkin v. Russia, no. 1555/04, § 126, 10 June 2010). The same concerns arose in respect of toilets in cells with no water supply, accompanied by other sanitary issues (see Iacov Stanciu v. Romania, no. 35972/05, § 175, 24 July 2012). It is thus imperative that running water is available at all times, together with the relevant cleaning materials to ensure the required hygienic standards in each cell. The Court reiterates that it is incumbent on the respondent Government to organise its penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of financial or logistical difficulties (see, mutatis mutandis, Bazjaks v. Latvia, no. 71572/01, § 111, 19 October 2010)."
            ],
            [
                "122. Also pertaining to the domain of hygiene, the Court observes that the applicants had wide access to the showers ( approximately twelve hours daily) and that a detainee could use the shower several times daily (see, by contrast, Iacov Stanciu, cited above, § 173; Čuprakovs, cited above, 44 §; and Varga and Others v. Hungary, nos. 14097/12, 45135/12, 73712/12, 34001/13, 44055/13, and 64586/13, § 32, 10 March 2015). Nevertheless, the applicants ’ allegations made in 2013 concerning the actual functionality of the showers are supported by the CPT report (see paragraph 60 above) concerning the situation in 2011, and similar allegations continue to be made by detainees in Division 3, to date, as transpires from applications introduced with the Court in 2015 (see reference at paragraph 107 ). While the Government submit that the showers may be temporarily unavailable, it is surely inexcusable that over a span of five years the situation concerning the functionality of showers appears to remain problematic. However, even if, as stated by the first applicant, only one shower out of the four available was fully functional for an unspecified period of time, given that the shower room was open for approximately twelve hours daily to serve fifty-five detainees (allowing more than a ten - minute daily shower each), this cannot by itself raise an issue under Article 3. Moreover, it is not excluded that on a more regular basis the applicants had at least three showers at their disposal."
            ],
            [
                "123. Further, while the Court considers that a limited waiting time for hot water usage is normal, it is unfortunate that the authorities fail to ensure a regular supply of both hot and cold water in the showers as well as to maintain the functionality of the four available showers to enable their regular use. The latter factors have a bearing on the general assessment of the conditions of detention (compare, Iacov Stanciu, cited above, § 175) and in this respect the Court will remain vigilant in future cases."
            ],
            [
                "124. As to the quality of the water available in the cells, the Court considers that, even assuming that the tap water was undrinkable, the applicants could have made use of the hot potable water available nearly all day long or alternatively purchased their own bottled water (to which they had access from the tuck shop at least weekly, and which could be purchased with their gratuity money ) if they so wished (see Mikalauskas, cited above, § 68). Moreover, the fact that only cold water was available in each cell cannot be considered treatment contrary to Article 3 (see ibid. , and Tellissi v. Italy, ( dec. ) no. 15434/11, 5 March 2013)."
            ],
            [
                "125. More generally, concerning the applicants ’ less specific complaints, the Court does not find it demeaning for the detainees to be encouraged to paint their cells, with paint provided by the authorities. Indeed it has not been submitted that this was an obligation, nor that the authorities would not have seen to the matter had a detainee refused to do so for medical, physical or age-related reasons or on the basis of any other objection. The same considerations apply, in the present case, in relation to the applicants ’ responsibility to keep their cells clean, including their own linen, provided that the relevant equipment and cleansing products are supplied. Furthermore, the Court observes that work was an option the applicants voluntarily entered into, and any complaints concerning the pension system would require firstly an assessment by the domestic courts."
            ],
            [
                "126. Lastly, the Court reiterates that of the other elements relevant for the assessment of the conditions of detention, special attention must be paid to the availability and duration of outdoor exercise and the conditions in which prisoners could take it. The Prison Standards developed by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture make specific mention of outdoor exercise and consider it a basic safeguard of prisoners ’ well-being that all of them, without exception, be allowed at least one hour of exercise in the open air every day and preferably as part of a broader programme of out ‑ of ‑ cell activities (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 150). In examining the cumulative effect of the above factors, the Court cannot but take account of the fact that cells were unlocked at 7.30 a.m. and left open until 12.30 p.m.; they were unlocked again at 2 p.m. and locked at 8 .30 p.m. Therefore inmates were free to move around and access the exercise yard, as well as other recreational facilities, for more than ten hours a day. Such a favourable situation has a particular bearing when assessing the applicants ’ conditions of detention. In relation to the second applicant ’ s claim that he was not allowed access to the yard (paragraph 41 above), again, in the absence of a detailed and consistent account of such occurrences, the Court cannot but consider the allegation as unsubstantiated."
            ],
            [
                "127. Moreover, the Court observes that all the applicants have had their requests for non-essential items granted and, as transpires from the photographs of the cells at issue, the applicants have acquired more than standard means of entertainment, including televisions, DVD players and other electronic gadgets. Similarly, they have almost unlimited access to telephone services, as shown by the use made of such service by the first applicant (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above). Against the information provided, the latter ’ s complaints on the matter do not appear to raise any concern."

In this respect the Court emphasizes the necessity of abiding by the Prison Regulations in such matters (see Relevant Domestic Law above, in particular paragraphs 50 and 5 5 ). Nevertheless, the Court notes that there is no hard evidence that the authorities stopped the applicants ’ letters. Furthermore, there is no evidence of threats or other concrete attempts to dissuade the applicants from applying to the Court. Indeed, no allegations of undue pressure have been made in the present case. In practice, the applicants were able to lodge their applications and continued corresponding with the Court and their lawyer without any serious obstacles ( see, a contrario, Maksym v.

The amendments as a result of Act X of 2009 [which amended the Civil Code and was aimed at ameliorating the position of land owners who were subject to controlled rents] were of little comfort given that the applicants had been suffering a breach for a long time and would continue to do so for another twelve years given that Article 1531I of the Civil Code resulting from the 2009 amendments ‑ which provided for a possibility of owners regaining their property ‑ could only come to play after twenty years from 2008. Furthermore, the fact that the applicants had not lodged proceedings before the RRB could not play in their disfavour given that the RRB was bound by law and therefore it could not award an amount of rent which would have fulfilled the proportionality requirement."

It then took four years for the applicants to file their submissions. At that stage the court accepted the applicants ’ request to nominate a court-appointed expert, but it then took six years, until 2006, for a court ‑ appointed expert to submit a technical report, which was confirmed on oath in January 2007, and a first ‑ instance judgment was delivered on 28 March 2008. During that time, in 2003 the court had asked the parties for submissions and the applicants had presented their submissions only a year later in 2004. The proceedings before the appeal court had not been excessively long, while it was true that the appeal was lodged on 16 April 2008 and was appointed for hearing on 12 April 2010, the final judgment had been issued just two months later. It was thus clear that most of the delay was due to the applicants, namely, four years for their submissions, and then six years for the additional technical experts ’ report ‑ although the latter ’ s delay was justified given that two of the experts had to be replaced. However, given that the case was of average complexity the State could not be exonerated from its responsibility of an overall twenty ‑ one ‑ year delay. Nevertheless, given the responsibility of the applicants for part of the delay, in the Constitutional Court ’ s view a finding of a violation was sufficient just satisfaction in the present case."

However, given that the application of Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta, in combination with Act XLV of 1973 as amended by Act IX of 1974 had breached the applicants ’ human rights, the Constitutional Court ordered that such laws could no longer be relied on as a basis for the occupation of the premises in the present case. As to compensation, having considered that the applicants had waited twenty ‑ three years to lodge constitutional redress proceedings and the disproportion of the rent received by the applicants in the light of the market value, as well as the order invalidating the effects of the impugned laws between the parties at issue, the Constitutional Court awarded EUR 25,000.

In particular it reiterates that, for the purposes of Article 13, it is for the Court to determine whether the means available to an applicant for raising a complaint are “effective” in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation or of providing adequate redress for any violation that had already occurred. In certain cases a violation cannot be made good through the mere payment of compensation and the inability to render a binding decision granting redress may also raise issues (ibid., § 77).",

Malta (no. 55747/16, 27 August 2019), in the present case the constitutional jurisdictions and in particular the Constitutional Court did not order the eviction of the tenant. There is no doubt that, in law, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction could annul an order and evict a tenant (as sometimes ordered by the first-instance constitutional jurisdiction, see paragraph 67 in fine above), which measure would have prevented the continuation of the violation. However, it is clear, from the case ‑ law relied on by the Government, that in situations such as those of the present case, namely where as a result of a protected rent regime (such as that arising from Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta at issue in the present case) the owners have suffered an excessive burden leading to a violation, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction, and in particular the Constitutional Court on appeal, do not take such action. More particularly, the Constitutional Court revokes such an action when it was ordered by the first ‑ instance court. Indeed, the Government have not provided one example of a final finding ordering eviction, despite having been requested to do so, and despite the fact that numerous violations of the kind have been found at the domestic level. In similar circumstances, in Apap Bologna (concerning violations arising from requisition orders) the Court found that, despite having the power to do so, in practice, the Constitutional Court had repeatedly failed to take the required action which would bring the violation to an end (ibid., § 86)."

                "72. In Apap Bologna, § 88, the Court, noting that it was not for it to interpret domestic law, also expressed regret at the interpretation given by the constitutional jurisdictions as to their impossibility of awarding a higher future rent. According to the Court, such an order would constitute a measure vis ‑ à ‑ vis an individual applicant, which would provide for an end to the violation without affecting the tenant. The same was reiterated in the more recent Portanier judgment, § 48, which noted that this course of action has not been popular with the constitutional jurisdictions, and where the Court reiterated that in the event that the constitutional jurisdictions award a higher future rent (to be paid by the Government, with the possibility of an arrangement with the tenants who would have for years benefitted from a generous regime), eviction would not always be necessary. Indeed, when the measure did pursue a legitimate aim (such as the social protection of needy tenants), the adaptation of the future rent to present circumstances might be sufficient to repair the existing disproportionality and thus bring the violation to an end. The Court notes that, in the present case, despite the less weighty legitimate aim, an adequate future rent in the light of that aim, could nonetheless bring the violation to an end. Moreover, the future rent would have had to be established only until 2028 date when the lease will no longer be protected under Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta. Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court did not take that approach."

                "73. The Court notes that in the present case, while none of the above actions were taken, the Constitutional Court took an alternative action. It ordered that the tenants could no longer rely on the relevant law provisions to retain title to the property. From the domestic case ‑ law brought to the Court ’ s attention by the Government, that same action appears to have become customary, at least since 2016. In Portanier the Court maintained that it still had doubts as to this approach, and reiterated its reservations about the fact that the Constitutional Court, whose role is to bring a violation to an end and to redress the upheld violation, abdicates the responsibility assigned to it by the Constitution of Malta and refers applicants to yet another remedy despite it having the power and authority to grant such redress ( § 51). In that case, while having set out a number of considerations, in view of the parties ’ limited submissions and the fact that the applicant had been successful in evicting the tenants, the Court refrained from adjudicating on the effectiveness of that approach in general ( §§ 52 ‑ 54). Similar considerations apply in the present case in relation to the parties ’ limited submissions, and for, inter alia, those same reasons the Court will refrain from adjudicating on the matter in general. The Court will however adjudicate on the effectiveness of such a measure in the present case."

                "74. Firstly, the Court notes that it has not been informed that eviction proceedings were undertaken and if so that they have been concluded. Nor has the Court been informed that the tenants have voluntarily vacated the property since they now (as a result of the Constitutional Court judgment) no longer have title to it (in the absence of the relevant protection of law). It follows that the inaction of both parties has led to the status quo remaining that which existed on the date of the Constitutional Court judgment, more than three years ago. In this connection the Court makes reference to its case ‑ law to the effect that it is inappropriate to require an individual who has obtained judgment against the State at the end of legal proceedings to then bring enforcement proceedings to obtain satisfaction ( Musci v. Italy [GC], no. 64699/01, § 90 ECHR 2006 ‑ V (extracts)). That reasoning appears to be relevant to the situation in the present case, and echoes the concerns expressed by the Court in Portanier concerning a further set of eviction proceedings."

However, leaving that matter open, the Court notes that, unlike the situation in other similar cases against Malta where the interferences had been justified by the legitimate aim of providing social housing, in the present case the interference applied in favour of a commercial entity, namely a bank. Moreover, as the law stood at the time of the Constitutional Court proceedings, the bank would in any event lose the protection of the law and therefore would have to vacate the property when the lease comes to an end in 2028. It follows that, in the circumstances of the present case, there seems to be no particular justification for delaying redress and continuing to perpetrate the violation established. Thus, in the absence of an award covering future rent until 2028, the Court considers that the only remedy capable of giving adequate and speedy redress to the applicants in the situation of the present case was for the Constitutional Court to order eviction – a course of action it failed to undertake, as is its normal practice (see paragraph 71 above)."

It transpires from the information and cases brought before the Court that this is often not the case. Such pecuniary awards are also often not accompanied by an adequate award of non-pecuniary damage and/or an order for the payment of the relevant costs (ibid. § 90 and Grech and Others, cited above, § 62).

Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 183, ECHR 2006 ‑ V). However, States can also choose to introduce only a compensatory remedy, without that remedy being regarded as ineffective. The Court has set key criteria for verification of the effectiveness of a compensatory remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings. These criteria are as follows:",
                "– an action for compensation must be heard within a reasonable time;",
                "– the compensation must be paid promptly and generally no later than six months from the date on which the decision awarding compensation becomes enforceable;",

                "– the rules regarding legal costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their action is justified;",
                "– the level of compensation must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see Valada Matos das Neves v. Portugal, no. 73798/13, § 73, 29 October 2015, and Brudan v. Romania, no. 75717/14, § 69, 10 April 2018 )."

The situation is, however, different with regard to non-pecuniary damage. There is a strong, although rebuttable, presumption in favour of non-pecuniary damage being occasioned by the excessive length of proceedings. However, there may also be situations where no such damage, or only minimal damage, has been ascertained – for instance where an applicant ’ s conduct has entirely or partly caused the procrastination or where the delay has been caused by circumstances independent of the authorities (see Rutkowski and Others v. Poland, nos. 72287/10 and 2 others, § 182, 7 July 2015, and the case ‑ law cited therein )."

Malta, no. 43675/16, § 42, 28 May 2019, and Portanier, cited above, § 55 ). The same occurred in the present case, where in proceedings where the applicants ’ claims under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 6 in connection with the length of proceedings were upheld, the Constitutional Court nevertheless ordered the applicants to pay 3/5 of the costs of the proceedings (see paragraph 25 above). Thus, while it has not been argued that such costs impede access to such a remedy, they, at the very least, often have an impact on the compensation awarded."

                "87. The Court observes that there existed no limit on the amount of compensation which could be granted to an applicant in such proceedings. The redress to be awarded is based solely on the exercise by the domestic court judges ’ of their discretion as to what might constitute appropriate pecuniary redress in the circumstances of the particular case. The mere fact that an amount of compensation awarded is low, or that no amount is awarded at all, does not render the remedy in itself ineffective, although it does have an impact on the Court ’ s assessment of the applicant ’ s victim status concerning the length of proceedings complaint (see, mutatis mutandis, Zarb v. Malta, no. 16631/04, § 51, 4 July 2006, and Śliwiński v. Poland, no. 40063/06, § 36, 5 January 2010 respectively). In the present case the Constitutional Court denied the applicants any compensation whatsoever without giving sufficient reasons ( see paragraph 47 - 48 above). Moreover, the two cases relied on by the applicants and one of the cases put forward by the Government, as well as the applicants ’ own case, suggest that the Maltese Constitutional Court far too often fails to award any compensation at all for such breaches. Even when they do make an award, the cases brought forward by the Government indicate that the Constitutional Court generally awards sums which do not constitute adequate redress (compare, Apap Bologna, cited above, § 89, in relation to pecuniary awards in property cases ). Indeed, the Court observes that in around two thirds of the cases relied on by the Government the Constitutional Court made awards which were significantly lower (between 20 and 40 % of the amount), or even manifestly unreasonably lower (as low as 2 and 5 % of the amount) than what the Court would have awarded in those circumstances. Thus, the material brought forward by the parties appears to be sufficient evidence to show that the remedy at issue does not fulfil this criterion due to a regular practice of significantly or unreasonably low compensation awards in such cases, or even no compensation at all, as happened in the present case."

Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, § 123, 10 September 2010, and the case ‑ law cited therein ). In particular, the Court has held that to conform with the reasonable time principle, a remedy for length of proceedings should not in principle and in the absence of exceptional circumstances, last more than two and half years over two jurisdictions, including the execution phase (see Gagliano Giorgi v. Italy, no. 23563/07, § 73, ECHR 2012). The Court notes that the parties have not elaborated on this matter.

Malta (just satisfaction), no. 31122/05, § 18 and 20, 17 July 2008).

In the present case, and unlike in the case of Leonov, the interim decision concerned precisely the same issue, that is care and custody of the children, and both decisions were in the applicant ’ s favour. In the context of continuous non-enforcement of custody/contact -related rights under Article 8, an applicant cannot be expected to make a separate complaint to the Constitutional Court or this Court about the non-enforcement of each and every interim order, of which may be a large number, within the main proceedings. The Court will therefore adopt a global approach when considering the domestic proceedings and have regard to the overall facts which may be important for the context and merits of the main proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Article 6 and ratione materiae compatibility, Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, §§ 77, ECHR 2009 and, in the context of Article 10, Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 22, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV; see, in the child custody context, Šobota-Gajić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 27966/06, § 45, 6 November 2007, and Oller Kamińska v. Poland, cited above, § 74, where the Court adopted a global approach to the examination of the entire civil proceedings, the interim orders included, although, if examined separately, the interim orders would have been rejected for non-compliance with the six-month rule )."

The Rakovica Social Care Centre (hereinafter “the RSCC”) sent a lawyer rather than its expert team composed of a child psychologist, social pedagogue and social worker.

They also reiterated that they had asked for the court proceedings to be dealt with urgently, anticipating that the respondent would obstruct any kind of contact between the applicant and their children. As regards the applicant ’ s conduct, they considered that she had been primarily focused on defending herself from the respondent ’ s violence rather than protecting her children from poor living conditions. That is to say, when the interim custody order had come into force, there had been no legal impediment to her taking the children. However, in the efforts to enforce her rights, when she could have been expected to protect the children by taking them to her house regardless of the risk to her from the respondent, she showed a lack of efficiency and emotional engagement, relying on “a unrealistic expectation that she would be protected from the respondent ’ s violence if the State institution helped her in the execution of the custody transfer”. As the children had been alienated from the applicant, and branded a bad mother by the respondent, the children had a perception about their father as the only parent interested in raising them.

In this connection, the Court has repeatedly held that Article 6 § 1 imposes on Contracting States a duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time. Although this obligation cannot be construed in the same way for a constitutional court with its role as guardian of the Constitution as for an ordinary court, this role also makes it particularly necessary for a Constitutional Court sometimes to take into account considerations other than the mere chronological order in which cases are entered on the list, such as the nature of a case and its importance in political and social terms (see Süßmann, cited above, §§ 55-5 7; Gast and Popp v. Germany, no. 29357/95, § 75, ECHR 2000 ‑ II and Šikić v. Croatia, no. 9143/08, § 37, 15 July 2010 ).

Moreover, while what was at stake for the applicant in the proceedings before the Constitutional Court was of considerable importance, the Constitutional Court, according to the Government, was not in position to adopt and implement any priority policy in dealing with constitutional appeals and did not consider doing so, including in child custody-related cases (see paragraph 88 above).

In its decision of 23 May 2012 (dispatched on 5 July 2012), the Constitutional Court found, relying on several of the Court ’ s decisions rendered under Article 8, that the applicant had suffered a breach of her “right to a fair trial” on account of the failure of the State to take all necessary measures to enforce the 2005 custody judgment. The Court considers that it is unnecessary to determine in the present case whether the acknowledgment of a violation by the national authorities adequately acknowledged a violation under Article 8, as the redress afforded was in any event not appropriate and sufficient for the reasons outlined below."

Thus, the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits (see Vučković and Others v.

The only remedies to be exhausted are those which are effective and were available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say they must have been accessible and capable of providing redress in respect of the complaint and must have offered reasonable prospects of success (see, mutatis mutandis, Akdivar and Others v.

The Court has recognised that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of the individual case. This means, amongst other things, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 69).

Depending of the nature of an interim measure and of complaints before the Court, it may be appropriate in certain situations to distinguish between various sets of proceedings and examine them separately. The Court adopted such an approach in the Leonov case (see Leonov v. Russia, no. 77180/11, § 55, 10 April 2018), in which the applicant complained that the domestic authorities had not adduced relevant and sufficient reasons for granting a residence order in favour of his son ’ s mother and, previously, for the interim order prohibiting him from contacting his son or picking him up from his nursery pending the residence order proceedings. In the present case, and unlike in the case of Leonov, the interim decision concerned precisely the same issue, that is care and custody of the children, and both decisions were in the applicant ’ s favour. In the context of continuous non-enforcement of custody/contact -related rights under Article 8, an applicant cannot be expected to make a separate complaint to the Constitutional Court or this Court about the non-enforcement of each and every interim order, of which may be a large number, within the main proceedings. The Court will therefore adopt a global approach when considering the domestic proceedings and have regard to the overall facts which may be important for the context and merits of the main proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Article 6 and ratione materiae compatibility, Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, §§ 77, ECHR 2009 and, in the context of Article 10, Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 22, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV; see, in the child custody context, Šobota-Gajić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 27966/06, § 45, 6 November 2007, and Oller Kamińska v.

The school psychologist had neither been authorised nor had she done so. The State had caused her additional suffering by accusing her of contributing herself to her own tragic situation by failing to go against the wishes of her unprepared crying children. Her tragic situation, which had lasted more than ten years, was however a paradigm of the Serbian system – a failure of the relevant bodies to act in good time and a lack of any responsibility or accountability for their laziness. The applicant blamed the domestic authorities for their failure to do anything about the respondent ’ s aggressive attitude toward her, obstruction of contact and manipulation of the children.

In 2008 the children had already been twelve, the age when their opinions had to be taken into account, and they had stated that they wanted to stay with their father. In such circumstances, any coercion would have been unacceptable, so the authorities had focused on overcoming the bad family relationships and suggested counselling for the parties. The competent court had apparently addressed a letter of 20 November 2009 to the MHI as “urgent”, describing the complex circumstances of the case and indicating what was expected of the Institute. The MHI had declined its authority for mediation and advised the court to direct the family to the Marriage and Family Counselling Office of the Belgrade Social Care Centre. Unfortunately, no cooperation between the parents had been established, “which was not expected, either, bearing in mind [the respondent ’ s] attitude during the entire proceedings as well as the circumstances – he had been assessed as a person of low intellectual and cultural potential in [his] initial contact with the Centre”.

While acknowledging that “the State authorities were slightly passive”, which had led to the Constitutional Court finding a violation of the applicant ’ s right to a fair trial, the Government pointed out the same attitude on the side of the applicant throughout the relevant period, which, in turn, had led to the delay complained of, in particular : (a) in the early years she had departed with her daughter, leaving her son with his father in absolutely inadequate conditions; (b) she had sought the interim measure more than ten months after her husband had taken the children away; (c) she had shown no determination to forcibly take custody of her children as they had been crying even though the conditions had been fulfilled; (d) she had not shown any initiative to fix the hearing after that unsuccessful transfer of the children; and (e) she had failed in her duty to inform the court in good time that the interim measure had become null and to request enforcement of the custody judgment.

In relation to the State ’ s obligation to implement positive measures, the Court has held that Article 8 includes for parents a right that steps be taken to reunite them with their children and an obligation on the national authorities to facilitate such reunions (see, among other authorities, Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania, no. 31679/96, § 94, ECHR 2000-I; Nuutinen v. Finland, no. 32842/96, § 127, ECHR 2000-VIII; and Iglesias Gil and A.U.I. v. Spain, no. 56673/00, § 49, ECHR 2003-V). The obligation of the national authorities to take measures to facilitate a reunion is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with a child who has lived for some time with other persons may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures to be taken to this effect. The nature and extent of that preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and co-operation of all concerned will always be an important ingredient. Whilst national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such co-operation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child. Although coercive measures against children are not desirable in this sensitive area, the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the children live (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, § 106). In cases concerning the enforcement of decisions in the sphere of family law, the Court has repeatedly found that what is decisive is whether the national authorities have taken all necessary steps to facilitate the execution, in so far as can reasonably be demanded in the special circumstances of each case (see, among other authorities, Hokkanen, cited above, § 58; Nuutinen, cited above, §§ 127-28; Glaser, cited above, § 66; Sylvester v.

Following the first interim order of June 2002 which was quashed quickly thereafter, on 27 February 2003 the competent court ordered the respondent to hand over the children to the applicant within twenty-four hours, pending the final outcome of the ongoing custody proceedings (see paragraph 15 above). This interim custody order had been set aside by the custody judgment rendered in October 2005, which was served on the respondent in November 2006 (see paragraphs 16-17 above ). By that final judgment, the court, referring to the respondent ’ s negative behaviour, appalling living conditions and the need for the children ’ s immediate removal, granted sole custody of the children to the applicant, determined the respondent ’ s access rights and prohibited his contact with the children for three months to enable the children to restore emotional ties with the applicant. The new custody decision of June 2010 in the respondent ’ s favour in the course of fresh custody proceedings was soon after quashed and the proceedings terminated following the respondent ’ s ultimate withdrawal (see paragraphs 19-20 above). Both interim and final decisions remained unenforced (see paragraphs 4 0, 6 3 and 64 above). It appears that as of January 2002 the applicant was seeing her children only sporadically during the school breaks on weekdays and was unable to exercise the sole custody granted to her or even establish more regular and better quality contact with them until late 2009.

According to the domestic law, if the initial period of three days for voluntary compliance with a child custody order has passed, fines should be imposed and, ultimately, if necessary, the children be transferred forcibly by the judge (see paragraph 79 above). The enforcement court imposed fines to the respondent on two occasions in an attempt to make him comply with the order of June 2003 (October and December 2003) to no avail as the applicant ’ s house did not contain any valuable assets to collect. The custody transfer fixed for 2 December 2003 also failed as the respondent had apparently hidden with the children. Those initial steps date back prior to 3 March 2004, the date of ratification of the Convention by Serbia, and are noted only for reasons of context whilst examining the situation complained of as a whole."

Six months later, on 17 June 2004, the enforcement court again resorted to imposing an earlier provisional fine on the respondent and announced that a forced custody transfer would take place if he failed to comply voluntarily with the order within three days (see paragraph 25 above). There is no information in the case file as to whether the court attempted to collect the imposed fine, which in any event had proved to be an ineffective measure earlier as it could not be enforced or provide any incentive for the respondent to alter his conduct. The custody transfer fixed by the court for 30 November 2004 failed, as no one could be found at the respondent ’ s address (see paragraph 26 above). It took the court another five months to fix another reunion for 9 May 2005, which failed owing to the failure to duly summon the parties, social services and police officers (see paragraph 27 above). The Court observes that no procedural steps were taken in the meantime in the enforcement proceedings, nor was any attempt made to locate the respondent and make use of a more coercive measure in spite of his clearly uncooperative attitude, or to contact him or the children in order to offer counselling, mediation and prepare for the custody transfer in an adequate manner (compare and contrast Cârstoiu v. Romania ( dec. ), no. 20660/10, § 42, 7 May 2013). The Government have not provided an explanation for any of these periods of inactivity.

The Court observes that the Government considered that the applicant was responsible for her reluctance to physically assume custody of her children on 3 June 2005 on the school premises at a time when all the conditions for a custody transfer had been fulfilled as she preferred a less traumatic custody transfer for the children with the assistance of the Social Care Centre (see paragraph 28 above). While indeed such action by a parent may be held against him or her (see, for example, Zdravković v. Serbia, no. 28181/11, § 67, 20 September 2016, and Damnjanović, cited above, § 80 ), the Court considers that that the State authorities could not merely rely on the applicant ’ s personal abilities and court orders which were not likely to produce the desired results smoothly in the context of a three-year long separation without any contact between the applicant and her two young children, as well as in view of the reported violence by the domestic authorities (see paragraphs 31 and 39 above), without any preparatory measure. No measures were taken or even considered by the authorities to provide expert assistance to the children over a number of motivation sessions and encourage them to meet the applicant, which could have prepared them for the re-establishment of contact and especially precautious swift of child custody in these circumstances."

However, soon after, the RSCC supplied the report requested by the enforcement court (see paragraphs 30-31 above). It reiterated its earlier assessment of the applicant ’ s ability to have custody in comparison to that of the respondent, but noted that disrupting the children ’ s living arrangements with the respondent would not at that time have been in their best interests. The applicant was also criticised for being primarily focused on defending herself from the respondent ’ s violence rather than taking the children from him after the interim measure had been adopted and protecting them from poor living conditions regardless of the risk of violence for her, relying on “an unrealistic expectation that she would be protected from the respondent ’ s violence if the State institution helped her in the execution of the custody transfer”. The RSCC ’ s decisions on the corrective supervision and initiation of the proceedings for deprivation of parental rights came late in the day (see E.S. and Others v. Slovakia, no. 8227/04, 15 September 2009), were focused on the respondent ’ s negative attitude towards the custody transfer and were ultimately not enforced in any event (see paragraph 34 above)."

Referring to the instructions given by the second-instance court, on 19 June 2006 the enforcement court invited the RSCC to consult the court ’ s case file in order to facilitate the protection of the best interests of the children (see paragraph 36 above). The RSCC ’ s lawyer and social worker consulted the court ’ s case file a year later and reported on 6 August 2007 that it would be in the best interests of the children to have the interim custody order enforced (see paragraph 37 above).

Contact between the applicant and her children was finally established but reduced, in the children ’ s best interests, to several hours twice a week. The court also eventually requested counselling for the whole family, expert supervision and reporting on the contact and parties ’ behaviour in that respect, as well as on the fortnightly supervision of the children ’ s weekend visits to the applicant. At the same time, it would also appear that there were no clear guidelines as to the competences of various institutions for the family ’ s treatment, or that the two bodies in charge of the enforcement of the custody decisions did not know which institution was entrusted with which tasks (see paragraphs 51-56 above)."

The interim injunction was upheld by the Graz Court of Appeal ( Oberlandesgericht ) on 7 October 2016, as well as by the Supreme Court ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) in a decision of 29 November 2016. Much of the legal discussion in the domestic proceedings revolved around the question whether the claimants were sufficiently affected by the impugned statements and therefore had locus standi to seek the injunction. The Supreme Court concluded as follows in respect of that issue:",
                "“In the instant case, those imprisoned by the National Socialist regime because of their faith, their origins or their political views were not only described as ‘ criminals ’ in the impugned article entitled ‘ The liberated from Mauthausen as mass murderers ’, but they were also accused of having committed very serious crimes. If, given this factual situation, the lower courts have concluded that the claimants (resistance fighters and persons persecuted on political or racial grounds, and the heir of a person who was persecuted on racial grounds) were sufficiently affected by the impugned statements ..., and that the statements were not only morally lacking in respect for the victims of National Socialism, but also contained untrue accusations of criminal behaviour which can hardly be surpassed in their intensity, such a conclusion cannot be seen as an incorrect assessment to be addressed by the Supreme Court.”",

Wenn die Vorinstanzen bei dieser Sachlage zu der Einschätzung gelangten, dass die Kläger (Widerstandskämpfer bzw. politisch und aus rassischen Gründen Verfolgte bzw. eine Erbin eines aus rassischen Gründen Verfolgten) von den inkriminierten Äußerungen in ausreichendem Maß betroffen sind ..., und es den Vorwürfen nicht nur in moralischer Hinsicht an Respekt vor den Opfern des Nationalsozialismus mangle, sondern es sich um unwahre und an Intensität kaum zu überbietende Vorwürfe von kriminellem Verhalten handle, so ist darin keine vom Obersten Gerichtshof aufzugreifende Fehlbeurteilung zu erblicken. ”"

On 9 September 2016 the Graz Regional Criminal Court ( Landesgericht für Strafsachen; hereinafter “the Criminal Court”) dismissed the claim for compensation and the application for publication. The decisive question for the court was whether an average consumer would individually recognise the claimants and would associate the defamatory allegations with them. It reiterated that in May 1945 about 20,000 people had been liberated from Mauthausen. Because of this large number, the court found that it could not be established that the applicants were individually identifiable in the article in question. It held as follows:",

According to the now established and consistent case-law, the size of the group affected by such a statement is decisive, as is whether the recipient of the statement may associate a particular accusation, on the basis of its meaning, with a single member of the group ... If the claimants are counted as part of the group of approximately 18,000 to 20,000 prisoners liberated from Mauthausen, they cannot have legal standing, that is, they cannot be personally affected, since in the case of groups the entitlement of any individual to bring a claim has to be limited where the group comprises more than approximately fifty people ... A group of 18,000 to 20,000 people is in any event too large for each individual member of the group to be entitled to bring the claim.”",

Die Identifizierbarkeit muss sich aus dem Medienbericht selbst ergeben. ... Nach nunmehr gefestigter und ständiger Judikatur kommt es einerseits auf die Größe des von einer Äußerung betroffenen Kollektivs an aber auch darauf, ob der Erklärungsempfänger den jeweiligen Vorwurf nach dessen Sinngehalt auf ein einzelnes Mitglied des Kollektivs beziehen kann ... Zählt man die Antragsteller als dem Kollektiv der rund 18.000 bis 20.000 befreiten Mauthausen-Häftlinge zugehörig, können sie daher nicht aktivlegitimiert sein, somit nicht persönlich betroffen sein, da bei Kollektiven die Antragsberechtigung jedes Einzelnen dort zu limitieren ist, wo das Kollektiv mehr als etwa 50 Personen umfasst ...

It summarised the article in question and, applying this rule, concluded that it did not contain any separate – defamatory – statements, but that it only described, albeit in a highly polemical and sensationalistic manner ( in äußerst polemischer und reißerischer Art und Weise ), the outcome of the investigation by the Graz public prosecutor ’ s office in respect of M.W.D."

In addition, all of the claimants were known to the public, some of them in particular because of their activism as Holocaust survivors. It followed that they had legal standing to bring their claim. Moreover, they reiterated that the manner in which the article was written expressed the author ’ s identification with and confirmation of the impugned statements.

By the time the second article forming the subject matter of the instant application had been published in February 2016, any claims under the Media Act in relation to the 2015 article had already become time-barred (on account of the time-limit of six months pursuant to section 8a (2) of the Media Act; see paragraph 39 above). The applicant contended that the fact that no legal action had been taken in relation to previously published content which had breached the law did not prompt the conclusion that legal action in relation to different published content was not justified."

The applicant submitted that the institution of counterstatement proceedings (see paragraph 41 above) under sections 12 et seq. of the Media Act did not constitute an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 of the Convention either. Proceedings of that kind were aimed at securing an entirely different form of legal protection. By means of his application under sections 6 and 8a of the Media Act, the applicant had sought compensation for the non-pecuniary damage resulting from the humiliation he had suffered. By contrast, counterstatement proceedings had the purpose of rectifying false media coverage and offered no possibility of enforcing compensation payments. Such proceedings would therefore also have been unsuitable for setting aside judgments that dismissed claims and thus for redressing the violation of the Convention in his case."

The applicant argued that the same applied to a civil action under Article 1330 of the Civil Code: it would not have been capable of providing financial compensation for the non-pecuniary damage he had suffered. Even though cease-and-desist claims and claims in respect of pecuniary damage could be brought under Article 1330 of the Civil Code, the Supreme Court ’ s case-law suggested that there was no right to compensation for non ‑ pecuniary damage. Moreover, a civil action could not bring about the setting aside of judgments by which claims under the Media Act were dismissed."

Fulfilling the elements of the offence defined in section 6 of the Media Act merely required the presence of the actus reus as defined in the above Articles of the Criminal Code. In addition, Articles 111 and 115 governed offences subject to private prosecution, which could only be prosecuted by the injured party, and not by the public prosecutor ’ s office of its own motion. Thus, a prosecution would in addition have required proof of fault and would therefore have been less likely to be successful than the claims for damages which the applicant himself had brought. A prosecution pursuant to Article 297 of the Criminal Code would also have been unlikely to be successful, as it required the victim to have been exposed to prosecution himself, which had not been the case with the applicant."

The Contracting States may regulate questions of compensation for non-pecuniary damage differently, and the imposition of financial limits is not in itself incompatible with a State ’ s positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention (see Mertinas and Mertinienė, cited above, § 51). However, such limits must not be such as to deprive the individual of his or her privacy and thereby empty the right of its effective content (see Biriuk v.

The fact that an applicant was refused compensation in respect of a violation of his right to respect for his private life does not automatically disclose a failure on the domestic authorities ’ part to protect the applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life (see Egill Einarsson v. Iceland (no. 2), no. 31221/15, § 39, 17 July 2018; Rothe v. Austria, no. 6490/07, § 78, 4 December 2012; and Küchl v. Austria, no. 51151/06, § 95, 4 December 2012 ). However, in a case where the Supreme Court of Cyprus denied applicants equitable relief in respect of damage caused by an unlawful administrative act without sufficiently explaining its reasoning, the Court has found a violation of Article 8 (see Taliadorou and Stylianou v. Cyprus, nos. 39627/05 and 39631/05, § 58, 16 October 2008).

However, the Court of Cassation was not called to examine the powers and competence of the Court of Appeal when examining appeals against procedural decisions rendered in the course of criminal proceedings where an indictment had been finalised, with the result that the case file had been transmitted to the trial court whereas the Government, as noted above, has not produced any example of domestic case-law where the Court of Appeal agreed to adjudicate an appeal against a judicial warrant relating to evidence forming part of the body of incriminating evidence submitted to a court determining a criminal charge."

In the objection by which he had challenged the penalty notice the applicant had merely cited the notice in question, had denied having committed the offences, and had asked the court to acquit him.

                "“61. As a rule, impartiality denotes the absence of prejudice or bias. According to the Court ’ s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to ( i ) a subjective test, where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge – that is, whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and (ii) an objective test, that is to say, by ascertaining whether, quite apart from the personal conduct of any of its members, the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, among other authorities, Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, § 93, ECHR 2009, with further references).",
                "62. However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality, as the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to the tribunal ’ s impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (the objective test) but may also go to the issue of the judges ’ personal conviction (the subjective test) (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 119, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports 1996 ‑ III).",
                "63. In this respect, even appearances may be of a certain importance, or in other words, ‘ justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done ’. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public (see Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 78, ECHR 2015). ”",

What in this specific context the Court considers relevant is the fact that an obligation on the part of a judge sitting in a case to inform immediately the president of the court of the circumstances justifying his removal is expressly set out in the national law (see paragraph 21 above, section 104(3) of the Minor Offences Act).

In the present case, although the Constitutional Court had the power to quash the relevant decision on the grounds that it appeared that the trial judge had not been impartial, it declined to do so and upheld the impugned judgment.

In such cases, an official criminal investigation becomes indispensable given that public authorities are often the only entities to have sufficient relevant knowledge to identify and establish the complex phenomena that might have caused an incident (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 140)."

Even taking into account the complexity of the circumstances at issue, the Court does not consider that the stringent procedural requirements originally developed for use in cases involving the use of lethal force, and applied exceptionally to the very special circumstances as those arising in cases such as Öneryıldız despite the non ‑ intentional nature of the deaths at issue (see, for instance, Oruk v.

That said, the Court also notes that the applicant has not explained how the shortcomings in those criminal proceedings prevented him from asserting his property rights by other means, such as before the civil or administrative courts, which could, in theory, establish the liability of any authorities or entities in connection with the explosion (as the Batman Civil Court did in respect of Tüpraş, see paragraph 44 above), and provide appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages (see, mutatis mutandis, Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 112).

According to its interim report dated 11 October 2004, the studies it had carried out in Toptancılar Sitesi showed that the explosion of 3 May 2004 had been the result of an environmental pollution phenomenon that was much more complex than initially estimated. The management of this unprecedented environmental crisis required the utmost care, expertise, information and interpretational skills. The pollutant at issue was a mixture of crude oil and various petroleum products and, according to its estimations, there were between 500 and 2,000 tonnes of such material above groundwater. Technical limitations prevented the determination of the source of the leak with absolute certainty. However, the interpretation of the available data suggested that pollution of such great magnitude could only have been caused over a long period by a facility with a high capacity of petroleum refining and storage in the vicinity, which pointed to the Tüpraş Refinery ( a conclusion which was challenged by Tüpraş and TPAO representatives). The report also stressed, however, the absence of conclusive evidence to back up this assumption.

                "( i ) There were several oil pipelines, oil storage facilities and petrol stations in the area apart from the Tüpraş Refinery, the largest being the ANT facilities. The oil pipeline between ANT and Tüpraş, which had been used since 1972 to transfer F-46 military oil, had been inoperative since 1992, and a report prepared in 2002 attested that the pipeline had been empty at the time. However, the studies conducted on the pipeline after the explosion showed not only that there had been F-57 military oil in the pipeline, which had not been supplied by Tüpraş, but also that the pipeline had been damaged.",
                "( ii ) According to its modus operandi, the ownership of both oil pipelines and the product supplied by Tüpraş belonged to the purchaser, and Tüpraş was not accountable for any damage or loss arising from a damaged pipeline.",
                "( iii ) The wells drilled around the Tüpraş storage tanks had not revealed any oil leaks, which ruled out the possibility that the leak had originated from the refinery.",
                "( iv ) The petroleum extracted from the various wells drilled in Toptancılar Sitesi had been analysed in the ODTÜ laboratory, and the results of the analysis showed that the sample product was not amongst those produced at the Tüpraş Batman Refinery.",
                "( v ) Petroleum production consisted of only 5.95 % of the total production of the Tüpraş Refinery, and the remaining capacity was mainly devoted to the production of diesel fuel, asphalt, fuel-oil, solvents, residual oil and naphtha. In these circumstances, it was illogical to claim that the leak allegedly originating from the Tüpraş Refinery consisted only of the 5.95 % of its production, and that none of the remaining products, which made up the bulk of its production, had leaked.",

They also claimed that the analysis conducted at the ODTÜ laboratory was not decisive, as the laboratory had checked the samples obtained from the wells only against the current products of the Tüpraş Refinery. That analysis did not necessarily take into account the changes over time in the refinery ’ s production or the changes sustained by the products underground, considering that the leak had been ongoing for a long time."

Relying on all the information in the case file, including the commission reports noted in paragraphs 10 to 24 above, the experts made the following findings.",
                "( i ) The studies carried out so far were inadequate to determine the source of the leak. For instance, although wells had been drilled outside the surrounding walls of the Tüpraş Refinery, which had revealed a significant amount of petroleum above groundwater, no drilling had been carried out on the other side of the walls. Without drilling wells in the appropriate key locations, it would not be possible to determine whether the leak had originated from a damaged pipeline or from the refinery.",
                "( ii ) Various construction works and excavations carried out in the Toptancılar Sitesi area over the years had revealed the presence of petroleum under the ground long before the explosion. Therefore, the fact that there was an oil leak had been known for many years, including, most probably, by the State authorities, although it was not possible to pinpoint when the leak had started.",
                "( iii ) The suspected corporations should normally have the technical means and manpower to detect any leaks originating from their facilities and take the necessary precautions. However, where leaks arose from breaches of pipelines or other equipment by malicious individuals for the purposes of theft, then these institutions could not be expected to uncover such incidents by their own efforts alone.

The Court of Cassation held in this connection that the explosion at issue had taken place on 3 May 2004 and that, soon after that date, some of the property owners in Toptancılar Sitesi had brought compensation claims against Tüpraş. Since the applicant was also a property owner in Toptancılar Sitesi, he should have formed an opinion regarding the responsibility of Tüpraş for the explosion on the date of its occurrence. The Court of Cassation stated that venturing a guess as to the identity of the tortfeasor, within the bounds of possibility, was sufficient to bring an action; it was not necessary to have the tortfeasor established with certainty. The applicant ’ s claim that he had brought the action subsequent to the establishment of the tortfeasor as Tüpraş in a case brought earlier by other property owners could not stop the running of the time-limit from the date of the explosion. The Court of Cassation further stated that although criminal proceedings had also been brought against Tüpraş executives in connection with the explosion in question, the longer prescription period applicable to the criminal offence at issue could not apply to the civil compensation claim brought against Tüpraş within the meaning of Article 60 § 2 of the former Code of Obligations. That was because, where a civil claim brought against a company for offences committed by its employees was concerned, the longer time-limit provided in the Criminal Code applied in the civil proceedings only for offences under Article 465 of the Criminal Code.

In all of those decisions, the time-limit objections raised by Tüpraş had been dismissed for lack of evidence or documents in the relevant case files to demonstrate that the claimants had learned of the damage and the responsibility of Tüpraş for that damage prior to lodging their claims in 2006."

The parties differ in particular on the criteria to be used for establishing the date on which the applicant could have been deemed to have “known ” the identity of the tortfeasor for the purposes of Article 60 § 1. In its decisions in the present case, the Court of Cassation found that the applicant should be considered to have “known” the identity of the tortfeasor on the very same day that the explosion had occurred, as he had been in a position to “ guess ” the responsibility of Tüpraş for the incident from as early as that day. The applicant argued that the interpretation adopted by the Court of Cassation ( i ) had been contrary to the generally accepted construction of the relevant time-limit rule and many decisions delivered by that court concerning the very same incident, and (ii) had failed to take into account the complexities of the circumstances underlying his claim."

The applicant, for his part, submitted, both to the Court of Cassation and subsequently to the Strasbourg Court, some examples of the case-law of the Joint Civil Chambers of the Court of Cassation and the legal doctrine to support his argument that mere suspicions as to the identity of the wrongdoer would not trigger the one-year time-limit in question. The Court has also discovered proprio motu that the Joint Civil Chambers of the Court of Cassation delivered a number of judgments in 201 2 and afterwards, in which it verified that merely being in a position to learn the identity of the wrongdoer was not sufficient to start the time-limit (see paragraph 65 above)."

While the Court is in no position to assess when the applicant should be considered to have “known” that Tüpraş was responsible for the incident – however that term is to be construed – expecting him to have acquired the requisite knowledge on the very date that the explosion took place appears to have imposed a disproportionate burden on him in the circumstances."

Numerous commissions were, therefore, established and studies were conducted by experts in the field in order to shed light on the circumstances of the explosion and determine who was responsible for it. Those experts acknowledged that the explosion of 3 May 2004 had been a highly complex phenomenon, and the technical limitations encountered prevented rapid progress in establishing the circumstances surrounding it, including the identity of the entity responsible. They also stated that it ultimately fell on a court of law to determine, with certainty, responsibility for the explosion. Even the expert reports obtained subsequently during the criminal proceedings indicated that there was no sufficient evidence to determine conclusively that Tüpraş was responsible for the incident (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). Moreover, the expert report dated 3 March 2006, that ultimately determined the responsibility of Tüpraş for the incident, had been based on highly technical considerations which a layman could not be expected to make (see paragraph 43 above).

Bulgaria, no. 40897/98, § 38, 28 October 2004). The Court further reiterates that the right of access to court under Article 6 § 1 may be impaired if a time-limit for instituting compensation proceedings for damages starts to run at a moment when an applicant was not or could not have been aware of the claim or of the factual basis for making such claim (see, mutatis mutandis, Eşim v. Turkey, no. 59601/09, §§ 21-27, 17 September 2013; Sefer Yılmaz and Meryem Yılmaz v. Turkey, no. 611/12, §§ 62-74, 17 November 2015; Çakmakçı v.

The Court notes that in the view of the 4th Chamber of the Court of Cassation, the time-limit at issue had started running on the date of the explosion. However, having regard to the nature of the explosion, the uncertainty of the cause of the damage, the complexity of the matter, as well as the various reports on the issue, the Court finds it difficult to follow the reasoning of the Court of Cassation. In the Court ’ s opinion, the Court of Cassation ’ s interpretation and application of the relevant time ‑ limit rule, whereby the applicant was required to institute proceedings at a moment when he could not realistically have sufficient knowledge of the cause of the damage or the identity of those responsible, seems very formalistic, bearing particularly in mind the possible practical and financial implications of such requirement for the applicant. The Court stresses in this connection that contrary to the arguments of the Court of Cassation and the Government (see paragraphs 53 and 89 above), the victims who initiated compensation proceedings within one year of the explosion did not bring those actions against Tüpraş alone, but against both possible tortfeasors (see paragraph 42 above)."

The Court further observes in this connection its finding in a similar case that omissions such as those alleged in the present case are more likely to result from a combined failure of a number of officials, whose individual liability does not necessarily attain the gravity required for a criminal conviction, especially if those omissions have been ongoing for some time, as appears to have been in the instant case (see, mutatis mutandis, Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 112). For that reason, the Court considers that an action for compensation against Tüpraş and the responsible State authorities before the civil and administrative courts would not only be capable, but perhaps also more suitable, to provide the applicant with adequate redress."

The Court reiterates in this connection that mere doubts regarding the effectiveness of a particular remedy will not absolve an applicant from the obligation to try it (see, for instance, Vučković and Others, cited above, § 74). In the Court ’ s opinion, and as already discussed above, the administrative courts were, in principle, empowered to establish the facts of the case, to attribute responsibility for the events in question and to deliver enforceable decisions.

                "30. When assessing whether the proceedings had been excessively long, the Supreme Court firstly observed that the case had been rather complex as regards the issues of law, and very complex from an evidentiary perspective. Nine persons had been accused, two of whom had been Members of Parliament whose immunity had had to be lifted (see paragraph 15 above). Complex schemes had been used to commit the offences in question, and the activities of the accused had involved a high level of conspiracy. This had made the collection of evidence concerning the offences difficult and the analysis of the ( circumstancial ) evidence time-consuming. Numerous witnesses had been heard during the pre-trial proceedings and in court (see paragraphs 13 and 17 above). The proceedings before the court of first instance had entailed hearings over the course of ninety-two days, and this also indicated how many questions had needed to be addressed and how complex the questions had been."

            [
                "31. Secondly, the Supreme Court stated that there had been no delays during the pre-trial and trial stage of the proceedings. Rather, the lower courts had attempted to guarantee that the proceedings would not last an excessively long time. Some procedural flexibility had been lost due to the fact that the first-instance court had allowed the accused who had not been directly concerned by particular questions and evidence to be absent from the hearings altogether (see paragraph 17 above). At the same time, this had alleviated the effect of the proceedings on the accused, and had therefore been justified. The Supreme Court admitted that the organisation of the court hearings at first instance (not planning hearings sufficiently far in advance and not deciding on procedural matters quickly enough, thus allowing for long disputes between the parties ), the volume and structure of the criminal file, and the presentation of the statement of charges (which had entailed unnecessary repetition and the structure of which had been illogical to some extent ) might have added to the duration of the proceedings. However, the court noted that the defence representatives had opposed hearings being planned in advance, and in that regard they too had to be considered responsible. Furthermore, although it might have been reasonable for the prosecution to remove some of the material from the criminal file, the Supreme Court also considered that it had been for the defence representatives and not for the prosecution to decide whether some of the evidence in the criminal file was relevant from the perspective of the defence. The presentation of the statement of charges had not hindered defence rights either. As for separating the criminal case of E.T. from the rest of the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 79 below), the Supreme Court considered that this had related to only one of the charges against the third applicant and the first applicant company, and the latter ’ s counsel had not objected to the separation. Accordingly, the decision not to separate the case of E.T. from the rest of the proceedings could not be considered justified. In conclusion, the Supreme Court found that although some time might have been lost owing to the above-mentioned issues, the overall loss of time had been relatively insignificant in the context of the total duration of the proceedings."

In that regard, it noted that the defence representatives could not have been expected to preventively clear their timetables for possible appeal hearings in autumn 2012. Therefore, the fact that, at the appeal stage, hearings had only taken place six months after the Court of Appeal had started planning the relevant dates (see paragraph 21 above) could not be held against the applicants. Although the applicants could not be reproached for the fact that hearings had had to be cancelled or adjourned owing to their health and other personal reasons (see paragraph 17 above), such delays could not be attributed to the State either."

At the same time, the court considered that other than the two months and nineteen days that the second applicant had spent in detention, and the two days when the first applicant had been under arrest, the applicants had not been detained. Moreover, on 17 February 2010 the first-instance court had annulled a restriction imposed on the first, the second and the third applicants not to leave their place of residence."

                "36. The Supreme Court then addressed the preliminary investigation judges ’ decisions authorising the surveillance activities. Firstly, it noted that, in accordance with Article 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Kriminaalmenetluse seadustik, hereinafter “the CCrP ”, see paragraph 49 below) all court decisions, including decisions authorising secret surveillance activities, had to be reasoned. That meant that, in accordance with Article 110 § 1 of the CCrP (see paragraph 45 below), authorisation decisions had to contain reasoning as to why the issuing court found that there was probable cause to believe that an offence had been committed, and why it was impossible, or especially complicated, to collect evidence by other means (the principle of ultima ratio ). That reasoning could not be merely declaratory. The necessary reasoning could, however, rely on general criminological knowledge, for example knowledge concerning the nature of organised crime, the high level of conspiracy involved in the case in question, a presumed lack of witnesses willing to give statements, and so on. In any event, the reasoning had to be linked to the evidence in that particular case. Owing to time pressure and the likely fragmentary nature of information available at the time, the duty to provide reasons was less extensive when authorising secret surveillance than when deciding to convict a person."

                "37. The Supreme Court then noted that the preliminary investigation judges ’ decisions (see paragraph 12 above) had not complied with the requirement of being reasoned. However, the lack of reasoning did not amount to a lack of authorisation, and did not mean that the surveillance activities had been conducted arbitrarily and beyond judicial control. This was so because the investigating authority was not competent to assess the adequacy of reasoning. It had the right to rely on the operative part of a decision authorising surveillance activities. Therefore, the failure to give proper reasons for a decision authorising surveillance activities did not result in the inadmissibility of evidence thereby collected. The Supreme Court reasoned that it was not only during the authorisation stage that the ultima ratio nature of the secret surveillance measures could be examined. In fact, regardless of the existence of earlier decisions authorising surveillance activities, courts subsequently hearing a criminal case also had an obligation to examine whether the substantive conditions for granting the authorisation decisions had been fulfilled at the time the decisions had been issued. If necessary, the courts could then declare the evidence thereby obtained inadmissible. A lack of requisite reasoning in an initial authorisation decision required the subsequent examination to be conducted with special diligence."

                "38. The Supreme Court went on to note that it had directly examined the material in the surveillance file, including the prosecutors ’ applications for authorisation of surveillance activities. Based on that material, it had concluded that the substantive conditions for authorising surveillance activities had been fulfilled at the time the authorisation decisions had been issued. The Supreme Court was convinced that at that time there had been probable cause to believe that offences had been committed, and that it had been impossible to collect evidence by other means to verify that suspicion. In support of its findings, the Supreme Court referred to the nature of the crimes and the high level of conspiracy involved, and considered that it was unlikely that written or electronic evidence could have been collected or that witnesses could have been found without the proceedings being jeopardised."

It then reiterated its position outlined above regarding the decisions issued by a preliminary investigation judge authorising surveillance activities.

It found that the relevant regulation was constitutional.

Up until that judgment, it had been established case-law that, in accordance with Article 111 of the CCrP, violating the ultima ratio principle when issuing secret surveillance authorisations also inevitably meant that the evidence thereby obtained was inadmissible. In the instant case, the Supreme Court had distinguished between “granting authorisation for secret surveillance activities” and “obtaining evidence via secret surveillance activities”, and had stated that a violation of law during the authorisation stage could not affect the admissibility of evidence.",

Against that background, the legislature had created a system of safeguards. The central part of those safeguards was the requirement that measures which interfered with fundamental rights particularly severely (those mentioned in Articles 116, 118 and 119 of the CCrP ) be taken only when authorised under Article 114 of the CCrP by a preliminary investigation judge.

Case no. 3-3-1-34-16 concerned compensation for surveillance activities in circumstances where domestic courts had previously declared insufficiently reasoned surveillance authorisations and the surveillance measures taken on the basis of those authorisations unlawful (see paragraph 61 above). In a judgment of 13 June 2016, the Supreme Court found that as the surveillance activities in question had already been declared unlawful, the damage caused by them fell under section 7 ( 1 ) of the Act on Compensation for Damage Caused in Criminal Proceedings. The violation of a person ’ s home or private life or the confidentiality of his or her messages constituted grounds for compensating for non-pecuniary damage (section 11 ( 2 ) of the same Act). Non-pecuniary damage was presumed (first sentence of section 11 ( 3 ) of the same Act). The Supreme Court also stressed that in the event that a criminal court had already adjudicated upon the ( un) lawfulness of certain measures taken in criminal proceedings and that judgment had become final, such conclusions were binding for the administrative court deciding on compensation. The court reiterated that it was only in exceptional circumstances, where a person had not had the opportunity to ask for the lawfulness of procedural measures to be assessed in the so-called main proceedings, that a court adjudicating upon the compensation claim was competent to assess the lawfulness of actions or orders taken in criminal proceedings."

Not only did it involve several accused, but it concerned the “hidden offences” of offering and accepting gratuities, characterised by a high level of conspiracy and complex patterns of conduct between various people, which thus rendered it difficult to gather and present evidence of the alleged crimes. Moreover, the case involved the examination of a number of witnesses. Against that background, it is understandable that the investigation, the analysis and presentation of evidence and the ensuing court proceedings were time-consuming. The Court finds that, in a situation where criminal proceedings involve closely interlinked acts of several of the accused, and where separating the cases would not be attainable or procedurally reasonable (including from the perspective of defence rights – see paragraph 18 above), the complexity of the case must be assessed as a whole, not from the perspective of every single accused person."

Despite the considerable length of the pre-trial proceedings, the Court cannot discern anything from the facts of the case which would suggest that the investigating authorities or the prosecution acted inappropriately or otherwise failed to carry out their duties with due diligence from the moment the applicants became involved. Furthermore, as regards the proceedings before the first-instance court, although the first and the second applicants claimed that there had been periods of inactivity during that stage, they did not specify when exactly those periods had occurred, and owing to which circumstances. As for the applicants ’ criticism about the delay resulting from the failure to schedule hearings at appellate level, the Court notes that the Supreme Court specifically explained that it had not been possible to find hearing dates that suited all of the applicants ’ representatives (see paragraphs 21 and 32 above). The Court takes into account that scheduling a trial of such magnitude depends not only on the courts; there must also be due regard for representatives and their availability."

The Court takes particular note of the critical comments of the Supreme Court concerning the presentation of the statement of charges, the composition and structure of the criminal file, and the planning and management of the hearings before the first-instance court (see paragraph 31 above). At the same time, it notes that although the Harju County Court – being aware of the risk of excessively long proceedings – took steps to speed up the proceedings (see paragraph 17 above regarding hearing witnesses ), the decisions to limit hearings to three days a week, not to plan hearings more than a year in advance and to grant flexibility to the defence representatives as regards appearing in court were taken either at the request of the applicants or in their interests. As to the criticism expressed regarding the quality of the statement of charges, the composition of the criminal file and – as raised by the applicants – the reclassification of the offence as offering and accepting gratuities rather than bribery, the Court does not find that any of these acts, viewed against the wider background of the proceedings, contributed to the length of the proceedings to such an extent as to be decisive on their own. Although separating E.T. ’ s case from the proceedings (see paragraph 31 above) would feasibly have had an impact on the length of the proceedings against her, the Court cannot speculate about the possible impact this could have had on the duration of the proceedings against the applicants. As noted above, the separation of the first applicant ’ s case from the rest of the proceedings was opposed by other applicants ’ representatives (see paragraphs 18 above).

As the decisions in question had not been sufficiently reasoned, the interference with the applicants ’ rights could not have been “in accordance with the law” and had failed to satisfy the foreseeability requirement. In that regard, it was of no relevance that the Supreme Court ’ s decision had been taken only after the Court ’ s judgment in the case of Dragojević. Furthermore, referring to the dissenting opinion of Judge Kergandberg, the Supreme Court judge (see paragraph 41 above), they argued that the Supreme Court ’ s solution of retrospectively providing reasoning for authorisation decisions opened a door to arbitrariness, and had been a radical reversal of the Supreme Court ’ s previous approach."

This, in turn, meant that the authorisations had not been in accordance with the law. In support of his argument, he pointed to the modification of the relevant regulation as of 1 January 2013 (see paragraph 53 above), a modification which meant that having insufficient reasoning when granting secret surveillance authorisations would result in evidence being declared inadmissible. The second applicant disagreed with the Supreme Court ’ s line of argument that insufficient reasoning in authorisation decisions could not be equated to a lack of authorisation as such. He considered that this departed from the Supreme Court ’ s previous case- law. In that regard, he relied on the dissenting opinion of Judge Kergandberg (see paragraph 41 above). In the Dragojević case, there had been no established domestic case-law on the matter in Croatia. However, in the instant case, despite the fact that there had been domestic case-law, the Supreme Court had started to retrospectively justify the necessity of secret surveillance. The second applicant doubted the necessity of the secret surveillance in his case, and doubted that the Supreme Court had considered the private life aspect when assessing the admissibility of evidence obtained via secret surveillance.

It stressed in particular that ex post facto reviews of the lawfulness of secret surveillance – which allowed verification of whether compulsory ex ante reviews had indeed been carried out – had proved to be effective in Estonia. This applied to cases where the courts were called upon to verify whether the preconditions for authorising surveillance measures had been fulfilled (for example by assessing whether there had been written authorisation, see paragraph 60 above), or where the courts performed checks on whether the surveillance activities carried out had indeed been in accordance with such authorisation. The Government pointed to the domestic case-law whereby the Supreme Court had declared secret surveillance authorisations unlawful once it had found – as a result of an ex post facto review – that at the time the authorisations had been granted, the ultima ratio principle had not been complied with (see paragraph 62 above). The relevant authorities were aware that insufficient reasoning in authorisations could render the ex post facto verification of adherence to the ultima ratio principle impossible, and thus result in the inadmissibility of evidence.

In any event, the Dragojević judgment, which had been the first judgment of the Court to deal with the consequences of insufficiently reasoned surveillance authorisations, had been rendered after the final judgment in the present case, and thus its conclusions could not have been taken into account by the Estonian Supreme Court at the relevant time."

The aim of Article 110 of the CCrP was to ensure that interferences arising from secret surveillance were compatible with the right to privacy. Also, the Supreme Court had confirmed that the preconditions set out in Article 110 CCrP were meant to guarantee suspects ’ privacy as well as their right of defence (see paragraphs 35 and 58 above ). However, the Government pointed out that the applicants themselves had raised the issue of insufficient reasoning in authorisations, primarily in connection with the admissibility of evidence, and thus this had been the issue that the domestic courts had had to solve. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court, also acting as a constitutional court, had assessed the compatibility of the domestic regulation of secret surveillance with the guarantees provided by the Constitution and the Convention (see paragraph 40 above).

The Government confirmed that such remedies existed in Estonia. It had been open to the applicants to contest the relevant authorisations themselves, as well as the activities carried out on the basis of those authorisations, once they had been notified of the secret surveillance or had otherwise become aware of it (that is, at the latest, when the criminal file had been presented to them ). This could have been done in the pre-trial proceedings ( as regards the prosecutors ’ authorisations, see paragraphs 50, 51 and 54 above ) or alternatively during the court proceedings ( as regards both the prosecutors ’ authorisations and those issued by the preliminary investigation judge). The domestic courts could then have declared either the authorisations or the actions based on the authorisations unlawful, and the applicants could have lodged an application for compensation for non-pecuniary damage with an administrative court (before 1 May 2015, see paragraphs 66 to 68 above) or with a county court (after 1 May 2015, under the Act on Compensation for Damage Caused in Criminal Proceedings, see paragraphs 68 and 69 above ). It was admittedly difficult to predict the potential success of a damages claim which concerned only a procedural error, namely authorisations having insufficient reasoning.

Thus, the domestic law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to any such measures (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 229)."

In view of the risk that a system of secret surveillance for the protection of national security may undermine or even destroy democracy under the cloak of defending it, the Court must be satisfied that there exist guarantees against abuse which are adequate and effective. This assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to permit, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 232). Review and supervision of secret surveillance measures may come into play at three stages: when the surveillance is first ordered, while it is being carried out, or after it has been terminated. As regards the first two stages, the very nature and logic of secret surveillance dictate that not only the surveillance itself but also the accompanying review should be effected without the individual ’ s knowledge. Consequently, since the individual will necessarily be prevented from seeking an effective remedy of his or her own accord or from taking a direct part in any review proceedings, it is essential that the procedures established should themselves provide adequate and equivalent guarantees safeguarding his or her rights ( see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 233)."

It was exactly this practice of circumventing the requirement to provide reasons at the initial authorisation stage and accepting that they could also be provided later during the proceedings which opened a door to arbitrariness contrary to the guarantees under Article 8 of the Convention.

Having regard to the material in its possession and the above considerations, and noting that, in the instant case, only a violation of Article 8 was found, whereas a number of the applicants ’ complaints were declared inadmissible (see paragraph 5 above), the Court finds it reasonable to award the second applicant EUR 1, 5 00, and the third applicant and the applicant companies the sum of EUR 1, 5 00 jointly, plus any tax that may be chargeable to them, covering costs under all heads."

As the identity of the culprit had remained unknown the legal conditions for bringing civil compensation proceedings had not been met. Also, bringing separate civil proceedings against the State would not have constituted a means of ensuring the effectiveness of the investigation.

The Court notes that Article 3, read in conjunction with the State’s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in ... [the] Convention”, requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to ill-treatment, including ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see A. v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 22, Reports 1998-VI, and Z. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, §§ 73-75, ECHR 2001 ‑ V). This general requirement involves a procedural obligation. In cases of allegations of medical negligence the obligations under Article 3 incumbent on the authorities have been interpreted as in principle not requiring the provision of a criminal-law remedy (see V.C. v. Slovakia, no. 18968/07, §§ 125-26, ECHR 2011 (extracts); N.B. v. Slovakia, no. 29518/10, § 84, 12 June 2012; I.G. and Others v. Slovakia, no. 15966/04, § 129, 13 November 2012; and Dvořáček v. Czech Republic, no. 12927/13, § 111, 6 November 2014). By contrast, where an individual makes an “arguable claim” or a “credible assertion” that he has suffered treatment infringing Article 3 at the hands of, inter alia, the police or other similar authorities, the aforementioned provisions require by implication that there should be an effective official investigation of a criminal nature. If this were not the case, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 24760/94, § 102, 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII; Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 131, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV; El ‑ Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, § 186, ECHR 2012; Mocanu and Others v.

Even in the absence of a formal complaint, once the matter has come to the attention of the authorities, this gives rise ipso facto to an obligation under that Article that the State carries out an effective investigation (see Gorgiev v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 26984/05, § 64, 19 April 2012; El ‑ Masri, cited above, § 186)."

The assessment of that level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, principally the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Muršić v.

Indeed, as already indicated in paragraphs 116-118 such treatment is in essence, albeit not exclusively, characterised by an intention to harm, humiliate or debase an individual, by a display of disrespect for or diminution of his or her human dignity, or by the creation of feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking his or her moral and physical resistance.

In the area of medical care the Court has held that, whilst the right to health is not as such among the rights guaranteed under the Convention or its protocols, a positive obligation under Article 8 (parallel to the one under Article 2) is, firstly, to have in place regulations compelling both public and private hospitals to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of their patients’ physical integrity and, secondly, to provide victims of medical negligence access to proceedings in which they can, if appropriate, obtain compensation for damage (see Vasileva v.

It is true that by its very nature, this activity involved a risk that serious personal harm might occur in the event of an accident (see, mutatis mutandis, Vilnes and Others v. Norway, nos. 52806/09 and 22703/10, §§ 222 and 239, 5 December 2013). However, that risk was minimised by traffic regulations aimed at ensuring road safety for all road users, including through the proper separation of vehicles on the road. Secondly, the accident did not occur as the result of an act of violence intended to cause harm to the applicant’s physical and psychological integrity.

It also requires the State to make regulations compelling institutions, whether private or public, to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of people´s lives (see, in the context of the use of force by State agents, McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, § 151, Series A no. 324; Makaratzis v.

Turkey, no. 3648/04, § 61, 2 February 2016).

The Court has held that such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities. Not every alleged risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. In order to engage this positive obligation, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time, of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk ( Osman, cited above, §§ 115-16; Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 74 and 101; Bone v.

Such system may vary according to circumstances (see paragraph 158 below). It should, however, be capable of promptly establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress to the victim (compare Calvelli and Ciglio, cited above, § 49; Vo v.

It entails an obligation to carry out an effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as the result of the use of force, but may extend to accidents where an individual has been killed. In this context, the Court has found Article 2 to be equally applicable in the context of accidents, notably road-traffic accidents, where the direct victim died (see, for example, Anna Todorova v. Bulgaria, no. 23302/03, 24 May 2011; Prynda v. Ukraine, no. 10904/05, 31 July 2012; and Fatih Çakır and Merve Nisa Çakır v. Turkey, no. 54558/11, § 41, 5 June 2018)."

In such cases the Court considered it relevant that the victim had sustained life ‑ threatening injuries (see Igor Shevchenko v. Ukraine, no. 22737/04, 12 January 2012; and Kotelnikov v. Russia, no. 45104/05, 12 July 2016, both in the context of road-traffic accidents)."

                "140. It further emerges from the Court’s case-law that, where the victim was not killed but survived and where he or she does not allege any intent to kill, the criteria for a complaint to be examined under this aspect of Article 2 are, firstly, whether the person was the victim of an activity, whether public or private, which by its very nature put his or her life at real and imminent risk and, secondly, whether he or she has suffered injuries that appear life-threatening as they occur. Other factors, such as whether escaping death was purely fortuitous (compare and contrast Makaratzis, cited above, §§ 54-55, in the context of non-fatal shootings by police officers in a hot ‑ pursuit operation, and Krivova v. Ukraine, no. 25732/05, § 45, 9 November 2010) or whether the victim was infected with a potentially fatal disease (see G.N. and Others v. Italy, no. 43134/05, 1 December 2009, in the context of an infection with hepatitis C by blood transfusions) may also come into play. The Court’s assessment depends on the circumstances. While there is no general rule, it appears that if the activity involved by its very nature is dangerous and puts a person’s life at real and imminent risk, like the use of life-threatening violence, the level of injuries sustained may not be decisive and, in the absence of injuries, a complaint in such cases may still fall to be examined under Article 2 (see R.R. and Others v. Hungary, no. 19400/11, § 32, 4 December 2012, where exclusion from a witness protection scheme entailed exposure to life ‑ threatening vengeance from the mafia; Kolyadenko and Others, cited above, § 155, in the context of natural disasters)."

However, whatever mode of investigation is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention.

The choice of means for ensuring the positive obligations under Article 2 is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State’s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues for ensuring Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided for by domestic law, it may still have fulfilled its positive duty by other means (see Ciechońska, cited above, § 65; Ilbeyi Kemaloğlu and Meriye Kemaloğlu, cited above, § 37; and Lopes de Sousa Fernandes, cited above, § 216)."

Nor was it regarded as such by the domestic authorities, who considered, for a substantial period of time, that there were grounds for a criminal investigation in the case. Secondly, the remedy pursued by the applicant afforded a joint examination of criminal responsibility and civil liability arising from the same culpable conduct, thus facilitating the overall procedural protection of the rights at stake. The introduction of the civil claim in the criminal proceedings may well have been preferable for the applicant because, even if he bore the burden of proving that his claim was well-founded, the investigating authorities were also under an obligation to gather evidence, including evidence found at the site of the accident. The expert opinions requested by the investigating bodies and the other evidence collected by them in the criminal proceedings could have been used by the applicant in any civil proceedings and would probably have been essential for the determination of his civil claim. Accordingly, the Court does not perceive any reason to consider that the applicant acted inappropriately when choosing to pursue his case under the Code of Criminal Procedure (see Elena Cojocaru v.

In this connection it may be reiterated that in the event of there being a number of domestic remedies which an individual can pursue, that person is entitled to choose, for the purpose of fulfilling the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies, a remedy which addresses his or her essential grievance.

The Court has emphasised, however, that the essence of such breach does not necessarily lie in the fact of the disappearance of the family member but rather concerns the authorities’ reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention (see Çakıcı, cited above, § 98). In finding that the authorities’ conduct disclosed a level of severity which raised an issue under and breached Article 3, the Court gave weight for instance to the authorities’ indifference and callousness in dealing with the applicants’ concerns and the acute anguish and uncertainty which the applicants had suffered as a result and continued to suffer (see Taş, cited above, § 79)."

In Azerbaijan, while in some courts “ metal cages ” have been replaced by “glass barriers” (see, for example, Section 3 “Developments in the Justice Sector” of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe 2011 Trial Monitoring Report on Azerbaijan), their continued use is provided for by the Instruction of the Ministry of Justice of Azerbaijan of 29 December 2012 on the Procedures for Escorting Arrested and Convicted Persons and the Instruction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Azerbaijan of 14 January 2013 on the Procedures for the Guarding and Escorting by the Police of Persons Kept in Temporary Detention Facilities."

In France, some courts use glass docks, which in rare cases are reinforced with steel cables and used pursuant to a decision by the presiding judge of the court. In Latvia, although a minority of tribunals still have metal cages, that practice is falling into disuse.

Where it is clear from the outset however that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, § 157, ECHR 2009 ). Where the alleged violation constitutes a continuing situation against which no domestic remedy is available, the six-month period starts to run from the end of the continuing situation (see Ülke v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 39437/98, 1 June 2004 ). As long as the situation continues, the six-month rule is not applicable (see Iordache v. Romania, no. 6817/02, § 50, 14 October 2008 ). The concept of a “continuing situation” refers to a state of affairs which operates by continuous activities by or on the part of the State to render the applicant a victim (see Petkov and Others v. Bulgaria ( dec. ), nos. 77568/01, 178/02 and 505/02, 4 December 2007). The Court found previously that in the situation of a repetition of the same events, such as, for example, an applicant ’ s transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court ’ s view, a “continuing situation” which brought the entire period complained of within the Court ’ s competence (see Fetisov and Others v. Russia, nos. 43710/07, 6023/08, 11248/08, 27668/08, 31242/08 and 52133/08, § 75, 17 January 2012 ).

The Court notes that the applicants did not raise their complaint before any domestic authority, alleging that confinement in a metal cage in the courtroom was a standard practice applicable to each and every suspect or accused detained on remand, an allegation that has not been disputed by the Government. The applicants, who have implied that as a consequence of that situation there were no domestic remedies to be exhausted, ought therefore to have lodged their applications with the Court no later than six months from the cessation of the situation complained of, in order to comply with the six ‑ month rule. By lodging their applications on 5 May 2008 and 2 July 2008, respectively, at the time when the third trial was pending, the applicants complied with that rule in relation to their confinement in a cage during the third trial only. The Court will therefore disregard their confinement in a cage during the first and second trials which ended in 2004 and 2006 – more than six months before the dates on which the applications were introduced – as falling outside the scope of its examination (see, mutatis mutandis, Cyprus v.

Furthermore, before being rearrested on 6 December 2005 Mr Slyadnev had been free for one year and five months following his acquittal on 22 June 2004. During that period there had been nothing to justify those fears, that is, nothing to suggest that he had threatened the victims and witnesses or committed any other unlawful acts against them. In the decision of 8 February 2005 the Magadan Regional Court had imposed on the applicants an undertaking not to leave their place of residence as a preventive measure, which restriction had lasted ten months. The court and the prosecution, which had not appealed against that decision, had not considered that the applicants posed a danger to society. There had been no grounds on which to change that preventive measure to detention on remand on 6 December 2005. Mr Slyadnev had been detained on the same grounds as his co-defendant Mr Grishin. The Court ’ s finding of a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in the case brought by Mr Grishin and, in particular, the finding of the lack of grounds for the witnesses ’ fears, were applicable to the present case (see Mikhail Grishin v. Russia, no. 14807/08, §§ 147-156, 24 July 2012).

Such treatment, comparable to the treatment of wild animals kept in metal cages in a circus or zoo, had intimidated the applicants and humiliated them in their own eyes and in those of the public and aroused in them a sense of fear, anguish and inferiority; it had also undermined the principle of the presumption of innocence.

The Court further notes that in the third set of proceedings the hearing was adjourned for a similar break for a shorter period of time – one month and a half – and thus finds no evidence in the case file that the first delay was entirely justified.",

The appeal against the Regional Court ’ s second judgment was examined in six months, and on 6 June 2007 the judgment was quashed, this time on the ground, in particular, that the defendants and their lawyers had abused their rights and violated the jury trial procedure in an attempt to influence the jurors ’ verdict. They thereby contributed to the resultant delay in the proceedings.",

For a year and nine months, until the third judgment was delivered, and while the second applicant continued to be held on remand, the case lay dormant for three months before the Regional Court opened the proceedings in September 2007. Another five months passed before the jury was formed and the trial could begin, which then lasted for more than a year. The hearing was adjourned for about a month owing to a co-defendant ’ s illness. The appeal against the third judgment was examined in four months; on 23 July 2009 the appeal was rejected and the judgment was upheld.",
                "88. Even though there were some delays for which the applicants or their co ‑ defendants were responsible, and which do not engage the State ’ s responsibility, there were significant delays attributable to the State during the period when the case was pending before the trial court for the second and the third time which amounted to at least a year, and during that time the applicants were detained on remand, so that particular diligence was required on the part of the domestic courts to administer justice expeditiously (see Kalashnikov, cited above, § 132). While taking into account the complexity of the case and the difficulties which the Magadan Regional Court faced, the Court reiterates that the State remains responsible for the efficiency of its system, and the manner in which it provides for mechanisms to comply with the ‘ reasonable time ’ requirement – whether by automatic time-limits and directions or some other method – is for it to decide. If a State allows proceedings to continue beyond the ‘ reasonable time ’ prescribed by Article 6 of the Convention without doing anything to advance them, it will be responsible for the resultant delay (see Blake v. the United Kingdom, no. 68890/01, § 45, 26 September 2006).”"

Against this background, and in view of the Court ’ s above finding that lodging an appeal in a separate procedure at that stage of the proceedings did not constitute an effective remedy either, in view of the uncertainty as to the effectiveness of this remedy, the Court considers that it was not unreasonable for the applicant to try to bring her grievances to the attention of the trial court. This finding is further reinforced by the fact that the domestic courts did in fact examine the applicant ’ s complaints, which primarily concerned the alleged unlawfulness of surveillance measures (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above) and therefore addressed, in substance, her Convention complaints. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant cannot be reproached for her attempt to bring her grievances to the attention of the domestic courts through the remedies which she mistakenly considered effective (see Zubkov and Others v.

Relying on the decision of the Court of Cassation of 28 March 2014 (see paragraph 34 above), the Government submitted that the applicant could have lodged an appeal against the warrant of 3 February 2010 within fifteen days from the moment when she became acquainted with it, that is 12 May 2010, which she failed to do.

However, the Court of Cassation was not called to examine the powers and competence of the Court of Appeal when examining appeals against procedural decisions rendered in the course of criminal proceedings where an indictment had been finalised, with the result that the case file had been transmitted to the trial court whereas the Government, as noted above, has not produced any example of domestic case-law where the Court of Appeal agreed to adjudicate an appeal against a judicial warrant relating to evidence forming part of the body of incriminating evidence submitted to a court determining a criminal charge."

Notably, in its decision of 28 March 2014 the Court of Cassation also acknowledged the need to adopt a different approach, in so far as the procedure for lodging appeals against procedural decisions was concerned, depending on the type of the operative and intelligence measure.

The Court observes that Section 14 (1) of the Operative and Intelligence Measures Act contains an exhaustive list of types of operative and intelligence measures and that list does not contain a measure called “audio and video recordings” (see paragraph 31 above) referred to in the court warrant of 3 February 2010. In the present case the police recorded the applicant ’ s conversations with A.S. during their meetings of 3 and 4 February as well as their telephone conversation on the former date (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above).

This involves an examination of the “unlawfulness” in question and, where a violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see Bykov v.

Croatia, no. 20100/06, § 49, 25 February 2010). While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see Lee Davies, cited above, § 42; Bykov, cited above, § 90; and Bašić v.

The alleged absence of any activity in the inquiry of such serious assertions for such a lengthy period of time should have prompted him to draw appropriate conclusions and to introduce the complaint before the Court. The applicant did not provide any information that would justify his inactivity in that respect and his failure to apply directly to the Court without such a long delay.

The scope of a case “referred to” the Court in the exercise of the right of individual application is determined by the applicant ’ s complaint or “claim” which is the term used in Article 34 of the Convention (see, as a recent authority, Radomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/12, § § 108-09, 20 March 2018, and Foti and Others v. Italy, 10 December 1982, § 44, Series A no. 56). The wording of Article 34 indicates that a “claim” or complaint in Convention terms comprises two elements, namely factual allegations and the legal arguments underpinning them. These two elements are intertwined because the facts complained of ought to be seen in the light of the legal arguments adduced and vice versa. An illustration of this intrinsic link between the factual and legal components of a complaint may be found in the Rules of Court. Thus, Rule 47 § 1 (e) and (f) of the Rules of Court provides that all applications must contain, amongst other things, a concise and legible statement of the facts and of the alleged violation(s) of the Convention and the relevant arguments. By virtue of Rule 47 § 5 ( 1 ), a failure to comply with these requirements may, under certain conditions, result in the application not being examined by the Court (see Radomilja and Others, cited above, §§ 110-11)."

While the Court has full jurisdiction to review circumstances complained of in the light of the entirety of the Convention or to “view the facts in a different manner”, it is nevertheless limited by the facts presented by the applicants in the light of national law. However, this does not prevent an applicant from clarifying or elaborating upon his or her initial submissions during the Convention proceedings. The Court may take account not only of the original application but also of the additional documents intended to complete the latter by eliminating any initial omissions or obscurities. Likewise, the Court may clarify those facts proprio motu (see again, as a recent authority, Radomilja and Others, cited above, § § 121 and 122, and K.-H.W. v. Germany [GC], no. 37201/97, § 107, ECHR 2001 ‑ II (extracts)). If, after the notification of an application to the respondent Government, the applicant introduces new grievances that cannot be considered as an elaboration of his or her original complaints and on which the parties have commented, the Court will not normally take these fresh matters into consideration (see, amongst many other authorities, Kovach v. Ukraine, no. 39424/02, § 38, ECHR 2008, and Saghinadze and Others v. Georgia, no. 8768/05, § 72, 27 May 2010 )."

The Court observes that the wording of the relevant parts of the original application forms submitted by the applicants, when read carefully and compared to each other against the relevant facts of the case, does not leave any doubt about the exact object of each of the four applicants ’ applications (see paragraphs 23 7 and 23 8 above). Thus, it is evident that the first applicant made its various complaints in relation to the injunction proceedings, whilst the second to fourth applicants, the owners of Rustavi 2, called into question the ownership dispute. If the first applicant wished to extend the scope of its application to the ownership dispute as well, it should have stated so in section “F” of its original application form – “Statement of alleged violation(s) of the Convention and/or Protocols and relevant arguments” – in a clear manner, similarly to what it did subsequently, in its post- notification submissions. Indeed, according to Rule 47 §§ 1 (f) and 2 (a) of the Rules of Court, when determining the nature and scope of the submitted complaints, the Court cannot be expected to have regard to any document other than the concise and legible statement of the alleged violation(s) of the Convention as described by the applicant. Thus, it was on the basis of how the first applicant itself described the alleged violations of the Convention in the relevant part of its application form that the Court, who is free to attribute to the facts of the case a characterisation in law different from that given by the applicant or, if need be, to view the facts in a different manner (see Foti and Others, cited above, § 4 4), construed the first applicant ’ s complaints as relating to the injunction proceedings and the second to fourth applicants ’ around the ownership dispute."

The prosecutorial authority further outlined the reasons for the delay in bringing charges against Judge T.U. ’ s mother. In particular, the statement explained that the incident had occurred on 7 January 2014, during a family conflict between the woman and her son-in-law, after the former ’ s daughter (and the latter ’ s spouse) had died, leaving behind her twelve-year-old child. The investigation had been commenced immediately on the charge of intentional infliction of injury of a less serious nature (Article 118 § 1 of the Criminal Code ). As the offence was classified as a less serious one under domestic legislation, and taking into account the age (seventy-five years old) and state of health of the offender as well as the interests of her grand-daughter, the investigative authorities decided, before charging the woman, to allow time for reconciliation with the victim. Such a procedural move was consistent with the well-established practice of the investigative authorities.

Firstly, he noted that one of the legal grounds for lodging the claim for annulment of the impugned agreements had been Article 85 of the Civil Code on the basis of duress (see paragraphs 7 5 above). However, the judge observed that the claimant had failed to substantiate duress with sufficient evidence. Thus, although K.K. had lodged the criminal complaints, including that of 1 December 2008, regarding the loss of his business interests as a result of alleged pressure from the then President of Georgia, the mere fact of lodging those complaints, without the investigation having established any concrete facts, such as the actual use of threats or violence against K.K., could not be taken by the civil courts as proof of duress.

In that connection, the judge referred to a State auditor ’ s expert opinion dated 9 September 2015 which had established that, using an asset-based valuation method ( აქტივებზე დაფუძნებული მეთოდი ) the value of Rustavi 2 – the company as such together with all its assets and liabilities – in 2005-06 had been approximately GEL 7,322,686 (approximately EUR 2,727,041). However, since the claimant had given up the company under the impugned share-purchase agreements for, overall, as little as GEL 571,400 (approximately EUR 212,766), that significant price difference itself meant that the contracts contradicted sound reason, ethical and equitable principles and public policy considerations. The judge also stated that the available case -file material did not confirm that even the derisory price stipulated in the impugned purchase agreements – GEL 571,400 – had in actual fact been paid to K.K. by G.-T.

Ltd had further disposed of those shares in very short periods of time, fourteen days and nine months respectively, at almost the same price for which they had been purchased from K.K. All those circumstances clearly suggested that neither of the two purchasers had ever been genuinely interested in acquiring and running the television company, and moreover that media had never formed part of their ordinary business activities. All in all, and particularly given the manifest difference between the value of the ceded property and the derisory payment received in exchange, the judge concluded that the share-purchase agreements of 26 December 2005 and 17 November 2006 had been illusory, entered into in disregard of various public considerations, and were unenforceable under Article 54 of the Civil Code. That being so, those agreements were also void ab initio, which entailed the extinguishment of all possible legal consequences relating to the conclusion of the defective agreements, pursuant to Article 61 § 1 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 18 4 below). In the light of the above factual findings, and noting that there were no specific statutory time-limits in relation to claims concerning ab initio void contracts, the judge decided to apply the general statute of limitations of ten years under Article 128 § 3 of the Civil Code."

The judge then continued by noting that it was legitimate for the shares in the company in the current owners ’ possession to be retrieved in favour of K.K., given that they could not be considered bona fide purchasers. In that connection, the judge firstly noted that the third applicant, who had always run various businesses with his brother ( the fourth applicant ), had been the authorised representative of a company which had bought Rustavi 2 from G.-T. Ltd on 1 December 2006, that is to say only fourteen days after G.-T. Ltd had obtained the property from K.K. (see paragraphs 1 7 and 1 9 above ). In other words, the third and fourth applicants had known about the derisory price for which K.K. had given up the television company, and thus should have realised that they had been acquiring property which had been clearly tainted. In that regard, the judge relied on Article 187 § 2 of the Civil Code, in accordance with which a third-party acquirer of movable property, such as shares in the company, could not be considered a bona fide owner if the property in question had been misappropriated from the original owner. In his reasoning, Judge T.U. also referred to the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008 as well as the follow-up criminal complaints lodged by K.K. with the Chief Public Prosecutors Office in 2008 - 09, by which the latter had brought the authorities ’ attention to the wrongful acts committed against him. The judge considered that the existence of those criminal complaints should have rebutted the presumption of regularity of any subsequent transfers of Rustavi 2 shares in the eyes of the relevant domestic authorities."

The applicants mainly argued that Judge T.U., in his injunction order, had not sufficiently explained whether the freezing of the company ’ s own assets and the owners ’ shares in that company had been truly necessary. The judge had not elaborated on why it had not been possible to proceed with an examination of the property dispute on the merits without applying such drastic measures against the television company and its owners. The applicants complained of the disproportionate and sweeping nature of the interim measures applied, measures which had clearly interfered with their property interests. They feared that the actual result of the impugned measures would be the opposite of what the first-instance judge had allegedly pursued. Without being able to manage its various movable and immovable assets freely and fully, the television company could suffer serious financial setbacks, which would have an adverse impact on its ability to perform its media activities with the requisite independence. In that connection, the applicants specified certain particular aspects of doing business in the media sector, such as, for instance, the seasonality of media production, which created the need for maintaining permanent access to the banking sector. Citing the relevant case-law of the Constitutional Court of Georgia and the Strasbourg Court, all four applicants referred to both the company ’ s various proprietary interests as well as the first applicant ’ s right to impart information under Article 10 of the Convention."

                "124. In its reasoning, the appellate court began by stating that the standard of proof in interlocutory proceedings was always lower than that normally applied by a civil court to the merits of a property dispute. Thus, it was not necessary to address the necessity of the applied interim measures from the standpoint of preponderance of evidence. Rather, in the appellate court ’ s view, it was sufficient to establish that a prima facie situation existed militating in favour of an interim measure. In that connection, the Court of Appeal referred to the history of numerous transfers of Rustavi 2 shares from one private party to another within very short periods of time (see paragraphs 10 -2 8 above). Given the ease with which the television company had changed hands in the past, there was a prima facie risk that another change in ownership could occur whilst the proceedings on the merits were still ongoing, something which would unduly thwart the execution of a final court decision. It stated that the legitimate aim pursued by the interim injunction of 5 August 2015 had been the need to avoid the creation of any new barriers to the enforcement of a final court decision in the future."

            [
                "125. The appellate court then addressed the question of whether all of the interim measures applied by Judge T.U. had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In that connection, the court stated that, whilst all the other freezing measures seemed reasonable, it could not comprehend the rationale behind restricting the company ’ s right to rent some of its various movable and immovable assets (see paragraph 8 5 above). That particular restriction, which did not have any relevance to the legitimate aim pursued, ought therefore to be lifted, and the television company would be allowed to rent a number of its assets for a limited but renewable period of time (thus rental contracts should not exceed three months)."

In that regard, it explained that the restriction only targeted the company ’ s external corporate structure. However, the measure should not be understood as preventing the company from implementing any internal organisational change which its director deemed necessary to maintain cost optimisation. The company was thus free to implement any type of internal organisational changes, such as those relating to hierarchy, employment contracts and various administrative procedures."

However, given the political sensitivity surrounding the dispute over Rustavi 2, it was inappropriate for a judge with a clear political orientation to sit in the case."

The Grand Chamber delivered that ruling prior to its final judgment on the merits of the case (see paragraph 16 4 below). Amongst other things, the Grand Chamber dismissed the applicants ’ application of 28 November 2016 for Judge M.T. and the President of the Supreme Court to recuse themselves. It stated that the grounds referred to by the applicants were insufficient for calling into question the judges ’ impartiality and independence under either the subjective or objective tests under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Specifically, in so far as Judge M.T. was concerned, the Grand Chamber stated that the applicants had failed to explain what the link between the judge ’ s personal experience and the subject-matter of the ownership dispute had been. As regards the President of the Supreme Court, the Grand Chamber firstly stated that, although N.Gv. had brought disciplinary charges against her back in 2006, this fact was irrelevant because he had not been party to the ownership dispute in question. The Grand Chamber also emphasised that the President of the Supreme Court had not examined the ownership dispute as single-judge but as a member of the collegial body composed of nine judges. The court then stated that the applicants had not presented any proof capable of showing that the President had expressed any negative statements or attitudes in respect of N.Gv. in relation to the events that had occurred more than a decade previously. The Grand Chamber further attached significance to the fact that, although the disciplinary proceedings had resulted in the President ’ s dismissal from her previous judicial post back in 2006, that disciplinary record had already been irrevocably erased and she had been able to obtain re-election to the highest judicial office in the country. These positive developments in her career further diminished the risk of the President ’ s feeling personal animosity towards N.Gv. owing to the past and by that time completed and irrelevant dealings."

Notably, it ruled that, given the particular factual circumstances, the dispute should not have been examined with reference to Article 54 of the Civil Code, which the lower courts had referred to, but rather in accordance with Article 85 of the Civil Code. Indeed, the essence of K.K. ’ s civil claim was proving that he had been coerced into giving up the television channel by signing the share-purchase agreements of 26 December 2005 and 17 November 2006 because of threats from high-ranking State officials, such as the President of Georgia, the Minister of the Interior and the Chief Public Prosecutor. The Supreme Court stated that examining the ownership dispute through the lens of Article 85 of the Civil Code did not involve a need for establishment of any new factual findings. On the contrary, the cassation instance specified, by reference to its previous case-law, that “duress was not a matter of fact but of legal evaluation”, stating that “ the lower courts had erred in their legal evaluation of the factual description of duress.”"

As to the statute of limitations applicable to claims for the annulment of contracts made under duress under Article 89 of the Civil Code, a statute which set out a period of one year, the Grand Chamber noted that, in accordance with the above-mentioned provision, the relevant period should have started to run from the moment the situation constituting duress had ceased to pertain. In K.K. ’ s case, since the duress had been the pressure exerted upon him by high-ranking State officials of the former UNM government, such a situation had lasted until the change in the ruling forces brought about by the results of the parliamentary election of October 2012. However, even prior to the change in the ruling forces, a fact which could have triggered the running of a statutory limitation period of one year under Article 89 of the Civil Code, K.K. had already exercised his right to repudiate as void the relevant share-purchase agreements by lodging a criminal complaint on 1 December 2008 regarding the misappropriation of his property by high-ranking State officials."

                "167. The Grand Chamber also developed an alternative line of reasoning with regard to the question of whether or not K.K. ’ s claim was time-barred. It suggested that, under Article 85 of the Civil Code, a claim to annul a contract resulting from coercion could also be lodged within three years under the statute of limitations applicable to civil wrongs under Article 1008 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 19 1 below)."

That being so, the Grand Chamber concluded that, by lodging the criminal complaint regarding the misappropriation of his property by the State machinery with the prosecuting authority on 1 December 2008, K.K. had done nothing else but voice his claim over Rustavi 2. Consequently, it had been on 1 December 2008 that K.K. had interrupted, under Article 138 of the Civil Code, the running of the statutory time-limit of either one year – specifically applicable under Article 89 of the Civil Code to claims of duress within the meaning of Article 85 – or of three years – normally applicable, under Article 1008 of the Code, to all types of civil wrongs."

The Grand Chamber emphasised that provisions allowing claims for the annulment of contracts as null and void ab initio, of which Article 85 of the Civil Code ( concerning contracts resulting from coercion) was an example, should be treated with utmost care. This was because the annulment of such a contract would result in the nullification of all legal consequences associated with the civil contract, which was prejudicial in respect of the principle of legal certainty."

                "(ii) the fact that on 21 April 2009 K.K., who by that time had left Georgia for fear of persecution by the State, had been granted political asylum in Germany;",

That being so, the burden of proving that his allegations had been untrue had shifted onto the respondents, who, in their written submissions, had failed to effectively rebut the claimant ’ s allegations. In that connection, the Grand Chamber emphasised that one of the main respondents, G.-T. Ltd, had waived its right to submit written comments in reply to K.K. ’ s initial claim, whilst the written submissions of H.

In that connection, the Supreme Court stated that the epithets that the Director General of Rustavi 2 had levelled against the judges of the first and appellate instances, with Judge T.U. being the primary target, had been unacceptable insults that had gone beyond the limits of a permissible criticism. The Supreme Court also referred to the fact that during one of his televised press conferences the Director General, N.Gv., had publicly confirmed that he had intentionally been attacking Judge T.U. in order to provoke the judge and create a precondition for his recusal (a copy of the video recording of N.Gv. ’ s relevant public statements is also contained in the case file)."

Thus, between September 2015 and March 2017, during various public interviews broadcast nationwide by Rustavi 2, the latter ’ s Director General used such terms with respect to Judge T.U. including, amongst others, “illiterate”, “corrupt”, “puppet”, “pseudo-servant of Themis”, “armed with an axe”, “ for-hire ” and “scoundrel.” Then again, with respect to T.U. and certain other judges who took part in the examination of the case at the appellate and cassation instances, N.Gv. interchangeably used such epithets in respect of them as “slave”, “mob boss”, “executioner”, “criminal”, “ignorant”, “swindler”, “riff - raff”, “bribe taker”, “traitor”, and “shameful”, among others."

At the same time, according to Article 138 of the Civil Code, the running of the period of the statute of limitations should be interrupted if the rightful person brings a civil claim or tries to obtain the satisfaction of the claim by other means, such as by filing a document confirming the existence of the claim with any State agency or with a court, or by obtaining a writ of execution."

                "225. In March 2007 the Judicial Group on Strengthening Judicial Integrity adopted the Commentary on the Bangalore Principles. Its relevant parts read as follows:",
                "“65. Outside court too, a judge should avoid deliberate use of words or conduct that could reasonably give rise to a perception of an absence of impartiality. Everything from his or her associations or business interests to remarks which the judge may consider to be ‘ harmless banter ’ may diminish the judge ’ s perceived impartiality. All partisan political activity and association should cease upon the assumption of judicial office. Partisan political activity or out of court statements concerning issues of a partisan public controversy by a judge may undermine impartiality. They may lead to public confusion about the nature of the relationship between the judiciary on the one hand and the executive and legislative branches on the other. Partisan actions and statements, by definition, involve a judge in publicly choosing one side of a debate over another. The perception of partiality will be reinforced if, as is almost inevitable, the judge ’ s activities attract criticism and/or rebuttal. In short, a judge who uses the privileged platform of judicial office to enter the partisan political arena puts at risk public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary. There are some exceptions. These include comments by a judge on an appropriate occasion defensive of the judicial institution, or explaining particular issues of law or decisions to the community or to a specialized audience, or defence of fundamental human rights and the rule of law. However, even on such occasions, a judge must be careful, as far as possible, to avoid entanglements in current controversies that may reasonably be seen as politically partisan. The judge serves all people, regardless of politics or social viewpoints. That is why the judge must endeavour to maintain the trust and confidence of all people, so far as that is reasonably possible. ...",
                "67. The potential for conflict of interest arises when the personal interest of the judge (or of those close to him or her) conflicts with the judge ’ s duty to adjudicate impartially. Judicial impartiality is concerned both with impartiality in fact and impartiality in the perception of a reasonable observer. In judicial matters, the test for conflict of interest must include both actual conflicts between the judge ’ s self-interest and the duty of impartial adjudication and circumstances in which a reasonable observer would (or might) reasonably apprehend a conflict. For example, although members of a judge ’ s family have every right to be politically active, the judge should recognize that such activities of close family members may, even if erroneously, sometimes adversely affect the public perception of the judge ’ s impartiality. ...",
                "69. A judge should discourage members of the judge ’ s family from engaging in dealings that would reasonably appear to exploit the judge ’ s judicial position. This is necessary to avoid creating an appearance of exploitation of office or favouritism and to minimize the potential for disqualification. ...",
                "81. The generally accepted criterion for disqualification is the reasonable apprehension of bias. Different formulae have been applied to determine whether there is an apprehension of bias or prejudgment. These have ranged from ‘ a high probability ’ of bias to ‘ a real likelihood ’, ‘ a substantial possibility ’, and ‘ a reasonable suspicion ’ of bias. The apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable, fair minded and informed persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. The test is ‘ what would such a person, viewing the matter realistically and practically – and having thought the matter through – conclude. Would such person think that it is more likely than not that the judge, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly ’? The hypothetical reasonable observer of the judge ’ s conduct is postulated in order to emphasize that the test is objective, is founded in the need for public confidence in the judiciary, and is not based purely upon the assessment by other judges of the capacity or performance of a colleague. ...",
                "90. Depending on the circumstances, a reasonable apprehension of bias might be thought to arise (a) if there is personal friendship or animosity between the judge and any member of the public involved in the case; (b) if the judge is closely acquainted with any member of the public involved in the case, particularly if that person ’ s credibility may be significant in the outcome of the case; (c) if, in a case where the judge has to determine an individual ’ s credibility, he had rejected that person ’ s evidence in a previous case in terms so outspoken that they throw doubt on the judge ’ s ability to approach that person ’ s evidence with an open mind on a later occasion; (d) if the judge has expressed views, particularly in the course of the hearing, on any question at issue in such strong and unbalanced terms that they cast reasonable doubts on the judge ’ s ability to try the issue with an objective judicial mind; or (e) if, for any other reason, there might be a real ground for doubting the judge ’ s ability to ignore extraneous considerations, prejudices and predilections, and the judge ’ s ability to bring an objective judgment to bear on the issues. Other things being equal, the objection will become progressively weaker with the passage of time between the event which allegedly gives rise to a danger of bias and the case in which the objection is made. ...",
                "143. The judge ’ s family, friends, and social, civic and professional colleagues with whom he or she associates regularly, communicates on matters of mutual interest or concern, and shares trust and confidence, are in a position to improperly influence, or to appear to influence, the judge in the performance of his or her judicial functions. They may seek to do so on their own account or as peddlers of influence to litigants and counsel. A judge will need to take special care to ensure that his or her judicial conduct or judgment is not even sub-consciously influenced by these relationships.”"

The whole process was coordinated to ensure favourable decision for the Government ’ s proxy K[.]K[.] ...

The August 5 2015 order on seizure issued by Judge T[.][U.] was unlawful excessive and abusive. However, maintaining the order without oral hearing by the Supreme Court, in particular, after Rustavi 2 ended to be civil respondent, was a clear violation of the procedure. This is especially striking in light of the flexibility showed by the company to at least modify the order and allow the company to engage in normal, almost routine financial relations. The request was rejected based on ridiculous justification that the judgment on merits was in favour of the civil claimants.",

After the Constitutional Court suspended provisions on immediate enforcement and thus delayed transfer of the company to the government proxy [K.K.], Judge [T.U.] appointed temporary managers in Rustavi 2. The November 5 2015 decision demonstrates the true motives of the government: Judge [T.U] criticised the editorial policy of Rustavi 2 by saying that the company focuses on the court proceedings against it and thus endangers the right of the Georgian public to receive important information. In addition, according to the judge, while reporting on important matters for public, objective and fair standards shall be followed, which is not guaranteed under the current management. At the same time, Judge [T.U] granted unlimited authority of the temporary managers to change editorial policy, cancel the programs, dismiss and fire journalists working at the company, and exercise all managerial and representative functions.",

The scope of a case “referred to” the Court in the exercise of the right of individual application is determined by the applicant ’ s complaint or “claim” which is the term used in Article 34 of the Convention (see, as a recent authority, Radomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/12, § § 108-09, 20 March 2018, and Foti and Others v. Italy, 10 December 1982, § 44, Series A no. 56). The wording of Article 34 indicates that a “claim” or complaint in Convention terms comprises two elements, namely factual allegations and the legal arguments underpinning them. These two elements are intertwined because the facts complained of ought to be seen in the light of the legal arguments adduced and vice versa. An illustration of this intrinsic link between the factual and legal components of a complaint may be found in the Rules of Court. Thus, Rule 47 § 1 (e) and (f) of the Rules of Court provides that all applications must contain, amongst other things, a concise and legible statement of the facts and of the alleged violation(s) of the Convention and the relevant arguments. By virtue of Rule 47 § 5 ( 1 ), a failure to comply with these requirements may, under certain conditions, result in the application not being examined by the Court (see Radomilja and Others, cited above, §§ 110-11)."

While the Court has full jurisdiction to review circumstances complained of in the light of the entirety of the Convention or to “view the facts in a different manner”, it is nevertheless limited by the facts presented by the applicants in the light of national law. However, this does not prevent an applicant from clarifying or elaborating upon his or her initial submissions during the Convention proceedings. The Court may take account not only of the original application but also of the additional documents intended to complete the latter by eliminating any initial omissions or obscurities. Likewise, the Court may clarify those facts proprio motu (see again, as a recent authority, Radomilja and Others, cited above, § § 121 and 122, and K.-H.W. v.

Ukraine, no. 39424/02, § 38, ECHR 2008, and Saghinadze and Others v. Georgia, no. 8768/05, § 72, 27 May 2010 )."

Thus, it is evident that the first applicant made its various complaints in relation to the injunction proceedings, whilst the second to fourth applicants, the owners of Rustavi 2, called into question the ownership dispute. If the first applicant wished to extend the scope of its application to the ownership dispute as well, it should have stated so in section “F” of its original application form – “Statement of alleged violation(s) of the Convention and/or Protocols and relevant arguments” – in a clear manner, similarly to what it did subsequently, in its post- notification submissions. Indeed, according to Rule 47 §§ 1 (f) and 2 (a) of the Rules of Court, when determining the nature and scope of the submitted complaints, the Court cannot be expected to have regard to any document other than the concise and legible statement of the alleged violation(s) of the Convention as described by the applicant. Thus, it was on the basis of how the first applicant itself described the alleged violations of the Convention in the relevant part of its application form that the Court, who is free to attribute to the facts of the case a characterisation in law different from that given by the applicant or, if need be, to view the facts in a different manner (see Foti and Others, cited above, § 4 4), construed the first applicant ’ s complaints as relating to the injunction proceedings and the second to fourth applicants ’ around the ownership dispute."

Malta ([GC], no. 17056/06, §§ 84-85, ECHR 2009), the injunction measure of which the first applicant complained of – the freezing of its assets – could not be considered to have effectively determined the civil rights and obligations which had constituted the subject matter of the ownership dispute."

Thus, whilst the first applicant had called into question the injunction order of 5 August 2015, in so far as that order had frozen its various assets, the final domestic decision in that connection had been, as a matter of domestic civil procedure (see Articles 197 (1) and 419 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, cited in paragraphs 19 6 and 200 above), the Tbilisi Court of Appeal ’ s decision of 20 November 2015. That decision had finally upheld the contested injunction order. Questions relating to interim injunctions were examined only at two levels of jurisdiction, and the decision of the second and thus highest level of jurisdiction in the injunction proceedings was final and binding. The Government emphasised that that approach had been consistently restated and maintained by the Supreme Court in its case-law (see paragraphs 20 4, 20 6 -0 7, 2 10 and 21 5 above). As regards the application of 17 November 2016 that the first applicant, together with the other three applicants, had lodged with the Supreme Court under Articles 196 and 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 14 8 above), that course of action had been an inappropriate legal remedy and thus could not have stopped the running of the six-month period. In particular, the Government submitted that whilst the use of those legal provisions had been reserved only for actual parties to the proceedings, the first applicant had irrevocably lost its standing as a co ‑ respondent on 7 June 2016, when the judgment of 3 November 2015 in its part concerning the first applicant had become final upon its confirmation by the appellate instance. The first applicant had itself acknowledged at the domestic level losing its standing as a party (see paragraph 14 9 above). The Government argued that, under Article 83 of the Code of Civil Procedure, only actual parties to the proceedings could lodge applications with the domestic courts. The Government emphasised that, after the first applicant had ceased to be a co- respondent, it had not applied to become involved in the proceedings as a third party, under Articles 88-92 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In that connection, the Government brought the Court ’ s attention to the Supreme Court ’ s decision of 18 May 2018 (case no. 194-194-2018), which clearly stated that no provision in the Code of Civil Procedure could be construed to confer upon individuals and legal entities the right to address a domestic court without complying with the basic procedural requirements of access (see paragraph 21 6 above)."

The Government also submitted that the first applicant ’ s application of 17 November 2016 to lift the interim injunction of 5 August 2015 under Article 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure had moreover been ill-founded. They submitted in that connection that the contested injunction had concerned all respondents to the dispute, not just the first applicant. The imposed interim measures had thus been necessary in their totality because, even after the first applicant had ceased to be a co-respondent, the ownership dispute had continued with respect to the second, third and fourth applicants, the owners of the first applicant. That being so, the value of shares held by the owners of the company would have been at risk of diminishing and even disappearing if the company had been allowed to enter into various legal relationships as a separate legal entity. As regards the first applicant ’ s reference to Article 196 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 25 7 below), the Government reiterated that the wording of that provision made it clear that it could be relied on only by actual parties to the proceedings – either a claimant, a respondent or a third party with or without an independent claim (see their argument in paragraph 25 3 above). The Government also emphasised that, in the light of all the above-mentioned procedural shortcomings, the first applicant ’ s application of 17 November 201 6, which had represented an inappropriate legal remedy, had not been examined on the merits by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 15 1 above). In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Government concluded that first applicant ’ s application of 17 November 201 6 had represented a mere attempt to stop the running of the six - month time-limit which had otherwise started from the delivery of the Tbilisi City Court ’ s decision of 20 November 2015, the final decision, within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, with respect to the injunction proceedings. Since the first applicant had lodged its complaints about the injunction proceedings as late as 3 March 2017, the relevant part of the application had clearly been lodged out of time."

Alternatively, the Government also suggested that the first applicant ’ s complaints concerning the injunction proceedings were inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, within the meaning of Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention. In particular, if the first applicant had considered that the injunction order of 5 August 2015 had become unlawful after it had lost the standing of a co-respondent on 7 June 2016, it should have lodged an interlocutory appeal under Articles 414 ‑ 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, requesting the lifting of the injunction by reference to Article 199 (1) of the same Code. As regards the first applicant ’ s application of 17 November 2016, the Government emphasised that, apart from lacking the relevant standing for lodging such an application, Rustavi 2 had addressed the impugned application to the wholly inappropriate domestic court. Thus, it had lodged the application with the Supreme Court, whilst the rules on lodging interlocutory appeals had made it crystal clear that such appeals should first be lodged with the court which had allegedly committed the alleged procedural breach. In particular, if the first applicant had considered that the Tbilisi Court of Appeal had omitted to discontinue the injunction measure after the termination of the copyright proceedings, the application for lifting the injunction order on the basis of Article 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure should first have been lodged with the latter court in accordance with the procedure on interlocutory appeals. In support of that argument, the Government invited the Court to take note of the relevant judicial practice of the Supreme Court. In particular in its decision of 29 December 2016 (case no. AS-806-773-2016), a copy of which has been submitted to the Court by the applicants (see paragraphs 20 7 and 20 8 above ), the Supreme Court stated that an application for the lifting of the interim measure made on the basis of Article 199 (1) ought to be lodged with the competent court and examined under Article 197 (1), 419 and 420 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the provisions that regulated the procedure for lodging interlocutory appeals.",

In particular, the first applicant argued that, taking into account the nature of the disputed injunction measure – the freezing of Rustavi 2 ’ s assets – the measure had had a significant and direct effect on the civil right at stake in the ownership dispute. In support of its position, the first applicant drew a number of parallels with the Court ’ s judgment in the case of Pekárny a cukrárny Klatovy, a.s., v. the Czech Republic ( nos. 12266/07 and 3 others, § 64 ‑ 73, 12 January 2012)."

However, the first applicant argued that the six-month time-limit should not be calculated from the final decision of 20 November 2015 because there had been two further possibilities for calling into question the injunction order of 5 August 2015. In particular, the first applicant referred to Articles 196 and 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, the two provisions that constituted the legal grounds for its application of 17 November 2016 lodged with the Supreme Court. As regards Article 196, the first applicant claimed that by virtue of that provision any entity or individual subject to an injunction – whether it was a claimant, respondent, third person or just an affected person without the status of a party to the proceedings – could apply for that interim measure to be replaced with another one. The first applicant emphasised, by reference to the Supreme Court ’ s decision of 13 November 2012 concerning civil case no. AS-1185-1114-2012 (see paragraph 20 9 above), that the right to lodge an application under Article 196 of the Code of Civil Procedure was not constrained by any time ‑ limits and depended only on a change of circumstances in the case at hand.

As regards the alternative provision for applying for the lifting of an interim injunction, Article 199 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the first applicant submitted that the cited provision had been an appropriate remedy because, following the withdrawal of the copyright claim by K.K. and the termination of the dispute with respect to the first applicant, the Tbilisi Court of Appeal had been obliged to lift the injunction freezing Rustavi 2 ’ s assets. Since that court had failed to do so, the first applicant had been allowed to lodge under Article 199 1 an appeal against the final appellate decision of 20 November 2015 with the highest judicial instance, the Supreme Court. In that connection, the first applicant claimed that the relevant domestic law and practice did not oblige it to lodge its application for the replacement or lifting of the interim measure under the procedure reserved for interlocutory appeals (whereby an appeal was first lodged with the same court that had issued a ruling negatively affecting the party ’ s rights or interests). The first applicant also asserted that the Tbilisi Court of Appeal ’ s judgment of 7 June 2016 had not been served on it. In the light of these circumstances, the first applicant claimed that it had been entitled to address its application of 17 November 2016 directly to the Supreme Court. The first applicant also stated that the exercise of the right under Article 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, similarly to that under Article 196, was not subject to any statutory limits, and therefore its application of 17 November 2016 could not be said to have been time ‑ barred."

In addition, the first applicant referred to the Supreme Court ’ s decision of 13 May 2016 in case no. AS-277-263-2016 to prove that under domestic law it was open even for a person not constituting a party to the civil proceedings to challenge an interim measure affecting his/her/its rights (see paragraph 20 3 above).

What mattered, in the first applicant ’ s opinion, was the fact that the Supreme Court had, in actual fact, examined its application of 17 November 2016 on the merits, without acknowledging the existence of any procedural deficiency (see paragraph 15 1 above). In any event, the first applicant also suggested that the freezing of its various assets by virtue of the injunction order of 5 August 2015 had been a continuing situation that had uninterruptedly lasted from the date of its application until 2 March 2017, the date of the delivery by the Supreme Court of its ruling on the injunction matter and of the final judgment on the merits of the ownership dispute."

Since the core of the alleged violations was the imposition of the above-mentioned injunction order by the first - instance court, the first question that needs to be answered is what constituted the final domestic decision in the injunction proceedings at stake. The answer to this question is straightforward, as the relevant domestic law makes it clear that the proceedings relating to injunction measures are conducted at two levels of jurisdiction only, with the second, and the highest, instance delivering, under the procedure reserved for interlocutory appeals, final decisions on the matter (see Articles 197 (1) and 419 § 3 of the CCP, as well as the Supreme Court ’ s relevant practice, cited in paragraphs 20 4, 20 6 - 7, 210 and 21 5 above ).

The Court considers that this argument is ill-founded in the light of its relevant case-law, since, whenever the alleged violation of a Convention right is caused by a particular event produced at a particular time ( the delivery of a court decision or other written legal act being a vivid example ), the legal consequences of such an event, which may even stretch over significant time, do not qualify as “a continuing situation” for the purposes of the calculation of the six- month rule contained in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (see, amongst many other authorities, Călin and Others v.

Armenia (dec.), no. 37780/02, 27 May 2008; and Petkov and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), nos. 77568/01 and 2 others, 4 December 2007)."

                "264. The third and final question before the Court regarding the admissibility of the relevant part of the first applicant ’ s complaints is whether, after the injunction order of 5 August 2015 had been irrevocably upheld by the final decision of 20 November 2015, the first applicant ’ s application of 17 November 2016, requesting either replacement or lifting of the imposed interim measures under Articles 196 and 199 (1) of the CCP, could be considered as an additional effective remedy. In this regard, the Court observes that the rule on exhaustion requires, under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, that the only remedies to be exhausted are those that are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 74, ECHR 1999-V). However, an applicant is not obliged to have recourse to remedies that are inadequate or ineffective (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 67, Reports 1996 ‑ IV ), and the pursuit of such remedies will unavoidably have consequences for the identification of the “final decision” and, correspondingly, for the calculation of the starting point for the running of the six-month rule ( compare, for example, Prystavska v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 21287/02, 17 December 2002, and Kucherenko v. Unkraine (dec.), no. 41974/98, 4 May 1999)."

                "265. In this connection, the Court duly notes the parties ’ extensive arguments regarding the question of whether or not the first applicant had had the requisite locus standi for lodging an application under either Article 196 or Article 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Notably, the parties have exchanged their views on whether, after it had ceased to be a co-respondent, the first applicant was still entitled to lodge an application under those two provisions. The Court observes that, even assuming that the first applicant had had the requisite standing for lodging such an application, it is clear, as a matter of relevant domestic law and practice, that this application ought to have been lodged in accordance with Articles 197 (1), 41 9 and 420 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that is to say in accordance with the rules governing the examination of interlocutory appeals. Indeed, examination of the Supreme Court ’ s practice, including the decisions submitted by the first applicant itself, consistently demonstrates that applications for changing or lifting of injunction measures were identical, in so far as their processing was concerned, to interlocutory appeals (see paragraphs 20 6, 20 8, 20 9 -1 2 and 217 above). Processing of an interlocutory appeal in accordance with Articles 197 (1), 419 and 420 of the Code meant, in its turn, that such an appeal should first be lodged with the court that had allegedly breached the party ’ s procedural rights and interests."

            [
                "266. In particular, the Court observes that, in a situation similar to the one examined in the present case, the Supreme Court of Georgia ruled in its decision of 29 December 2016 (case no. AS-806-773-2016) that where a domestic court failed to lift the interim injunction after one of the preconditions listed in Article 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure had materialised, such a failure could be challenged by the affected party through the lodging an interlocutory appeal under Article 197 (1) of the same Code (see paragraphs 20 7 and 20 8 above). In other words, the Court notes that the only procedurally appropriate manner of lodging an application under Articles 196 and/or 199 1 of that Code would have been for the first applicant to lodge an interlocutory appeal with the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, the very same court that had allegedly failed to lift the disputed injunctions after it had terminated the main proceedings in relation to this particular applicant. Since the first applicant did not do so, it can be concluded that it failed to use the claimed remedies in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law, as interpreted and applied by domestic courts. The latter finding automatically renders the first applicant ’ s procedurally defective application of 17 November 2016 immaterial for the purposes of the calculation of the six-month rule ( compare, for instance, Rezgui v. France (dec.), no. 49859/99, 7 November 2000; Polcarová v. the Czech Republic (dec.) [Committee], no. 52256/15, § 58, 15 May 2018; and Sazas v. Slovenia (dec.)

                "267. Furthermore, the remedies provided in Articles 196 and 199 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure embody extraordinary remedies in the injunction proceedings. The Court observes that, as acknowledged by the first applicant and confirmed by the judicial practice, the lodging of an application under either of the two above-mentioned provisions was not subject to any time-limits. However, the Court reiterates its well-established case-law, according to which remedies that have no precise time-limits, thus creating uncertainty and rendering nugatory the six-month rule contained in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, are not effective remedies within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 (see, amongst many other authorities, Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 6986/03, § 39, 15 November 2007; Williams v. the United Kingdom (dec.) no. 32567/06, 17 February 2009; Kolu v. Finland (dec.), no. 56463/10, 3 May 2011; and Denisov v. Russia (dec.), no. 33408/03, 6 May 2004). Indeed, the possibility for requesting either the replacement or the lifting of the interim injunctions was not regulated by any specific time-limits and was free to use at any moment providing that certain unforeseen circumstances had emerged, and such features of the remedies in question generate unacceptable uncertainties as to the final point in the proceedings (compare, for instance, Smadikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 10810/15, §§ 39, 41, 46 and 49, 31 January 2017 )."

                "268. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that, even if the first applicant had lodged its application of 17 November 20 1 6 in compliance with the procedural formalities (see the findings in paragraph 26 6 above), this application could not have been taken into account for the calculation of the six-month time-limit because it would have been based on Articles 196 and 199 1 of the CCP, two extraordinary remedies falling outside the normal chain of domestic remedies envisaged for examination of injunction proceedings (compare, mutatis mutandis, Martynets v. Russia (dec.), no. 29612/09, 5 November 2009, and AO “Uralmash” v. Russia (dec.), no. 13338/03, 10 April 2003 ). It should also be reiterated in this regard that whenever an injunction is contested before the Court, only those domestic remedies that form part of the ordinary chain of domestic exhaustion reserved for the injunction proceedings are taken into account for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, irrespective of whether any arguably remedial action may or may not have occurred at a later stage in the parallel set of the proceedings on the merits (see, for instance, RTBF v. Belgium, no. 50084/06, § § 90-91, ECHR 2011 (extracts); Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France (dec.), no. 71111/01, 2 February 2006; and Maurice v. France (dec.), no. 11810/03, 6 July 2004 )."

The Court thus concludes that the first applicant ’ s application of 17 November 20 1 6 did not constitute an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. It therefore follows that the date from which the six-month period began to run was 20 November 201 5, the date on which the Tbilisi Court of Appeal rendered the decision finally upholding the contested injunction measures (compare Tucka v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) (dec.), no. 34586/10, §§ 12-15, 18 January 2011; Riedl ‑ Riedenstein and Others v. Germany (dec.), no. 48662/99, 22 January 2002; and Babinsky v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 35833/97, 11 January 2000). However, as the first applicant lodged its complaints under Articles 6 § 1, 10 and 18 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 with this Court on 3 March 2017, these belated complaints must be declared inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

They further suggested that, if the first applicant had considered that the ownership dispute had affected any of its rights, it could have applied to be involved in the proceedings as a third party with or without an independent claim (see also paragraph 25 3 above). Alternatively, in the light of its omission to involve itself in the proceedings as a third party, the Government argued that the first applicant ’ s complaints concerning the ownership dispute could also be rejected as inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention."

Secondly, the first applicant also argued that it had not been obliged to request involvement as a third party because such an application would have been doomed, in its view, to failure. In particular, the first applicant argued that Article 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure – the provision setting down the framework for involvement of a third party without an independent claim – could hardly have applied in its situation because it had been unable to claim, within the meaning of the wording of that domestic provision, that the outcome of the ownership dispute could have affected its civil rights and responsibilities vis-à-vis either the claimant, K.K., or the respondents, the second to fourth applicants."

The Court further considers that, even assuming that the first applicant was right in claiming that it could not get involved as a third party in the ownership dispute, this argument makes it even more evident that Rustavi 2 could not be a subject in the ownership dispute. The first applicant, the company, was rather the object of the ownership dispute between the claimant and the respondents, the second to fourth applicants. The Court also observes that the first applicant acknowledged itself that its rights and legal interests had been represented by the second to fourth applicants at the domestic level. What is more, the same three applicants, in their capacity as the owners of the first applicant, have continued to voice the latter ’ s interests before this Court as well (see paragraph 279 below ). In other words, the first applicant cannot possibly claim to possess any independent and unprotected interest in relation to the ownership dispute. However, the Court reiterates, in line with its well-established case-law, that a person cannot complain of a violation of his or her Convention rights in proceedings to which he or she was not a party (see, for instance, Štimac and Kuzmin-Štimac v.

France, nos. 65399/01 and 3 others, § 38, 13 October 2005, and Skondrianos v. Greece, nos. 63000/00 and 2 others, §§ 29-30, 18 December 2003 )."

However, contrary to the applicants ’ initial allegations, it became clear, after the notification of the case to the Government and receipt of the parties ’ additional submissions, that the ownership dispute had never been examined at the lower levels of jurisdiction – the Tbilisi City Court and the Tbilisi Court of Appeal – solely under Article 54 of the Civil Code. On the contrary, it was clear from both the legal grounds mentioned in K.K. ’ s civil action of 4 August 2015 and the reasons contained in the decisions of the first-instance and appellate courts, that Article 85 of the Civil Code had been constantly discussed throughout the proceedings. The second to fourth applicants had had ample opportunity to submit their arguments with respect to Article 85 before the domestic courts, and both the first-instance and the appellate court had given due consideration to Article 85 of the Civil Code in their respective decisions (see paragraphs 7 5, 8 1, 110 -1 1 and 145 above).The Court attaches particular importance to the fact that the second to fourth applicants argued, in their initial statement of defence made before the first-instance court, that it was not Article 54 but rather Articles 85 ‑ 89 of the Civil Code which should have been held applicable to the circumstances of the ownership dispute (see paragraph 8 2 above). Against this background, when the three applicants themselves insisted that the case ought to be examined under Article 85 of the Civil Code, the Court finds it striking that they now reproach the Supreme Court for applying that legal provision."

                "291. Furthermore, the Court does not see any advantage afforded to K.K. over the second to fourth applicants in the proceedings before the Supreme Court. Both sides were equal in their opportunity to make written submissions, and neither of them was obviously able to adduce any new factual evidence during the appeal-on-points-of-law proceedings (contrast Súsanna Rós Westlund, cited above, § 71 ). If anything, it might even be considered that the second to fourth applicants were placed in a procedurally more advantageous position vis-à-vis their opponent given that it was only them, and not their opponent, who were able to file with the Supreme Court an amicus brief addressing, amongst other legal issues, Article 85 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 15 8 above). As regards the second to fourth applicants ’ complaint that they did not address Article 85 of the Civil Code in their appeal on points of law, the Court does not see how that fact could be held imputable to the Supreme Court. The applicants knew or should have known that Article 85, together with Article 54, had been invoked by the claimant, K.K., and that both the first-instance and the appellate courts had addressed that legal provision in their decisions. If, despite the above-mentioned circumstances, the applicants decided not to address Article 85 in their appeal on points of law, that was caused either by their omission or tactical choice, and, in either scenario, they should assume the legal consequences of their approach to present the case before the Supreme Court (compare, mutatis mutandis, Roberts and Roberts v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 38681/08, § 37, 5 July 2011)."

The Court further observes that the Supreme Court ’ s decision to examine the ownership dispute through the lens of Article 85 of the Civil Code, the provision originally invoked by the claimant and addressed by the lower courts, was not a factual assessment but a legal one (see paragraph 16 5 above). In essence, the Supreme Court, having regard to the submissions of both parties in the case file, did nothing else but clarify a point of law and, in the light of that clarification, accepted the argument of duress that had been made by the claimant and contested by the second to fourth applicants from the very beginning to the end of the proceedings. Consequently, it cannot be said that the principles of the equality of arms or the adversarial nature of proceedings were infringed (compare with the very similar situation in APBP v. France, no. 38436/97, § § 30-34, 21 March 2002 ). In the light of the latter conclusion, the fact that the Supreme Court dispensed with an oral hearing in the present case cannot raise any arguable issue under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The cassation instance was fully capable of properly reviewing the lower courts ’ interpretation of the pertinent legal provisions on the sole basis of the parties ’ written submissions and other material in the case file, especially since numerous oral hearing had been held with the participation of both parties before the two lower courts (see, as the leading authority on this country-specific matter, Rizhamadze v.

The Court reiterates that the Contracting States have greater latitude when dealing with civil cases concerning civil rights and obligations than they have when dealing with criminal cases (see, amongst many other authorities, Levages Prestations Services v. France, no. 21920/93, § 46, 23 October 1996, and Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, § 32, no. 14448/88, 27 October 1993). The requirements of Article 6 § 1 as regards cases concerning civil rights are thus less onerous than they are for criminal charges (see, as a recent authority, Bartaia v. Georgia, no. 10978/06, § § 28 and 32, 26 July 2018; see also König v. Germany, no. 6232/73, § 96, 28 June 1978). Furthermore, according to its long-standing and established case-law, it is not for this Court to deal with alleged errors of law or fact committed by the national courts unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention, for instance where it can, exceptionally, be said that they are constitutive of “ unfairness ” incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention. While this provision guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way in which evidence should be assessed, these being primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts. Normally, issues such as the weight attached by the national courts to given items of evidence or to findings or assessments in issue before them for consideration are not for the Court to review. The Court should not act as a fourth instance and will not therefore question under Article 6 § 1 the judgment of the national courts, unless their findings can be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable. According to the thinking underlying the notion of “a manifest error of assessment” ( une erreur manifeste d ’ appréciation – a concept of French administrative law), as used in the context of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, if the error of law or fact by the national court is so blatantly evident that, from the standpoint of an objective observer, no reasonable court could ever have made it, this manifest error may disturb the fairness of the proceedings (compare, for instance, Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], no. 22251/08, § § 61-62, ECHR 2015, and the other authorities cited therein )."

As regards the second to fourth applicants ’ first claim, the one concerning the Supreme Court ’ s alleged omission to apply the statutory time-limit under Article 89 to the situation of duress (see paragraph 28 6 above), the Court observes that this allegation is manifestly ill-founded. In its judgment of 2 March 2017, the Supreme Court concluded that the time-limit mentioned in Article 89 specifically applied to the circumstances of the case in conjunction with Article 85. Indeed, the Supreme Court found that K.K. had been in a continuing situation of duress until the parliamentary election of October 2012, which had led to the change of the ruling power in the country. The cassation instance then cited Article 138 of the Civil Code, which deals with the general rule on interruption of the running of time-limits. In that connection, the Supreme Court found that by lodging the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008, K.K. had interrupted, within the meaning of Article 138, the running of the statutory time-limit under Article 89. In addition to its analysis of the situation under Article 89 of the Civil Code, the Supreme Court also noted that the act of duress was so blatant that it could be considered a civil tort, and under Article 1008 of the Civil Code the time-limit for claiming damages in respect of a tort was three years. That being so, the Supreme Court developed an alternative line of reasoning, stating that, even if the situation were to be considered as a tort, the three-year limitation period under Article 1008 would still have been interrupted, within the meaning of Article 138 of the Civil Code by the lodging of the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008. In short, the same result – interruption of the statutory time-limit even before the situation constitutive of either duress or tort had ceased to pertain – would have been reached irrespective of whether the time-limit of one year under Article 89 and or the time-limit of three years under Article 1008 of the Civil Code had been applied."

The Court attaches particular significance to the fact that the findings of the Supreme Court concerning the pausing of the running of the statutory time-limits echoed the well-established domestic case-law (see paragraphs 21 9 and 220 above). Of particular interest was the Supreme Court ’ s decision of 15 March 2002 delivered in case no. 3/1186-01, in the light of which it cannot be said that the Supreme Court ’ s judgment of 2 March 2017 was inconsistent with previous domestic case-law. The Court further observes that the second to fourth applicants had themselves been perfectly aware of the existence of the above-mentioned domestic legal practice under Articles 85-89 and 138 of the Civil Code – interruption of the relevant one-year time-limit by lodging of a criminal complaint – because that was exactly the subject-matter of the constitutional complaint brought by the second applicant on 16 February 2016 (see paragraph 13 3 above). In the light of the foregoing, it cannot be said that the Supreme Court either circumvented the one-year time-limit applicable under Article 89 of the Civil Code to the situation of duress or erred in interpreting the relevant domestic law by ruling that the relevant time-limit had been interrupted under Article 138 of the Civil Code (contrast, for instance, Anđelković v.

The second to fourth applicants ’ only response to K.K. ’ s reference to that complaint was that “the mere fact of lodging a criminal complaint ... was not sufficient to turn the allegation of coercion into an established fact ... ” (see paragraph 8 1 above). It should also be noted that the civil case file had contained a copy of the two follow-up criminal complaints lodged by K.K. on 28 January and 12 March 2009, which documents had reproduced the content of the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008. Furthermore, the fact that K.K. had lodged the criminal complaint on 1 December 2008 had apparently been a matter of public knowledge, because it had been well documented in the Georgian Public Defender ’ s annual report of 2008 as well as in the report of the US Department of State concerning the property row over Rustavi 2 (see paragraphs 22 2 and 22 3 above). In the light of the foregoing, the Court is unable to share the second to fourth applicants ’ concern that the absence of the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008 from the civil case rendered the Supreme Court findings on the facts manifestly unreasonable (contrast Khamidov v.

Having regard to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the second to fourth applicants ’ applications for the recusal of Judge N.G., in so far as the disciplinary proceedings against the latter were concerned, and Judge Sh.K., were left without examination owing to the applicants ’ failure to comply with the relevant procedural requirements. Specifically, whilst Article 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure – the provision setting out the formal rules for lodging recusal applications – imperatively stated that such applications must be made in writing and, at the very latest, before the parties have exchanged their last oral arguments, the second to fourth applicants had already, as a matter of fact, applied after the exchange of the parties ’ pleadings, on 7 and 9 June 2016 (see paragraphs 14 1 and 14 2 above ).The applicants did not convincingly explain to the domestic courts why they had waited so long before applying. On the other hand, the Court notes that, according to the material available in the case file, the applicants knew or should have known about the facts on which they grounded their recusal applications much earlier. Thus, with respect to Judge Sh.K., the applicants should have known of that particular judge ’ s specialisation in criminal law as early as 27 April 2016 (see paragraph 13 8 above), whilst, as regards the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings against Judge N.G., they should have known of that fact by 1 June 2016 at the latest, when the Director General of Rustavi 2 had mentioned that fact during the press conference (see paragraphs 13 9 above). The Court takes note of the second applicant ’ s claim that it was 3 June 2016 when it applied for the recusal of Judge N.G. on account of the disciplinary proceedings for the first time (see paragraph 28 7 above). However, whilst that applicant did not submit a proof of its assertion, the available case -file material clearly shows that the first time the second applicant lodged a signed written application for recusal of the mentioned judge on the relevant grounds was 7 June 201 6 (see paragraph 14 1 above)."

It can only be applied in conjunction with an Article of the Convention or the Protocols thereto which sets out or qualifies the rights and freedoms that the High Contracting Parties have undertaken to secure to those under their jurisdiction. Whilst there can be a breach of Article 18 even if there is no breach of the Article in conjunction with which it applies, a breach of the former provision can only arise if the right or freedom at issue is subject to restrictions permitted under the Convention, (ibid., §§ 287 and 290 )."

In the light of these cited principles, the first question before the Court is whether Article 18 of the Convention can be relied on in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. In other words, the issue is whether the rights and freedoms protected by the latter provision are subject to permissible restrictions. It should be noted in this connection that in the case of OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia, (no. 14902/04, § § 263-66, 20 September 2011) the Court, without giving a definitive answer to the question of whether Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was prone to permissible restrictions, implicitly accepted that Article 18 of the Convention can, in principle, be brought to bear in conjunction with the former provision. However, the problem in the case at hand is that the second to fourth applicants ’ reference to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was manifestly ill-founded. With the Court ’ s having been unable to establish the existence of an interference by the State with the relevant applicants ’ property interests (see paragraphs 31 0- 1 2 above), Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 cannot be said to have ever been engaged. This is what distinguishes the present case from that of OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos, where the Court accepted that there had been multiple instances of interference with the applicant company ’ s property rights and proceeded to the examination of the merits of the relevant complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, reaching the findings of both violations and non-violations of the substantive provision (compare OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos, cited above, §§ 558, 563-75, 588-607 and 664)."

                "320. With respect to the first- instance court, the second to fourth applicants asserted that Judge T.U., the single judge who had decided the case, had neither been independent from the executive branch of government, nor impartial. In support of their assertions, the three applicants firstly averred that the examination of the case had started with “forum shopping”. They asserted in that regard that, being aware that Judge T.U. had been the only civil judge specialising in intellectual- property disputes on duty at the Tbilisi City Court, K.K. had artificially included in his action a clearly unmeritorious copyright claim. Secondly, the second to fourth applicants referred to the fact that Judge T.U. ’ s mother had been accused of a criminal offence. They argued that, from the perspective of an objective observer, it looked questionable that the criminal investigation had been revived and the charge formally preferred against that woman twenty months after the relevant incident (see paragraph 9 7 above). Those dubious circumstances might lead the public to think that, by renewing the criminal case against the judge ’ s mother after such an inexplicable delay, which coincided with the commencement of the examination of the Rustavi 2 ownership dispute, the authorities had wished to obtain leverage over the examining judge. The fact that Judge T.U. ’ s mother had eventually been convicted had not detracted from the way in which the State had used those criminal proceedings against her as a way of exerting pressure on the judge. Thirdly, the second to fourth applicants referred to the Facebook posts made by Judge T.U. ’ s wife on 7 July, 13 August and 2 October 2015, complaining that those posts contained negative views of Rustavi 2. With such biased attitudes held by the judge ’ s closest family member against the television channel, it was objectively justifiable to assume that the judge himself could not have been impartial during the examination of the ownership dispute over the television company. The second to fourth applicants argued that the inference drawn from the Facebook posts was not that specific posts influenced specific decisions of Judge T.U., but that the collection of posts had provided a reasonable basis for a fear that the judge ’ s wife and the judge himself had not been impartial in relation to Rustavi 2 and its owners. The fact that the judge ’ s wife had posted such views of Rustavi 2 repeatedly showed that she had consistently held such views. In that connection, the second to fourth applicants referred to Principle 4.8 of the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct in accordance with which a judge must not allow his or her family, social or other relationships to influence improperly his or her judicial conduct. They argued that the actions of a judge ’ s close family member sufficed to raise concerns as to the impartiality of the judge even in the absence of a direct proof that such views were also held by the judge himself. Lastly, the second to fourth applicants also claimed that the speed with which Judge T.U. had examined the ownership dispute as well as the preliminary and interim rulings that he had issued to the detriment of the applicants, including Judge T.U. ’ s refusal to recuse himself from the case, proved further his personal bias against them."

                "321. With respect to the appellate instance, the second to fourth applicants submitted that the Tbilisi Court of Appeal had not been impartial during the examination of the ownership due to the participation of Judge N.G. In particular, the three applicants argued that the latter judge had had close links with Judge T.U. as both had been founding members of the Union of Judges of Georgia, the association of judges that had publicly expressed its support towards Judge T.U. and criticised the Director General of Rustavi 2 (see paragraph 13 5 above). In that connection, the second to fourth applicants submitted that the public statements issued by the association had been uncalled for as Rustavi 2 had never attacked the judiciary but had simply reported, in a neutral manner, on the civil proceedings. Being a public watchdog, the television channel had been fully entitled to do so. The second to fourth applicants also denied that the first applicant, Rustavi 2, had ever tried to artificially create conditions for the recusal of the various judges, including Judge N.G. The television channel had merely been exercising its freedom of expression, whilst the judges had been under an obligation to keep a low profile and tolerate the legitimate criticism of the media. They also argued that the fact that the statements of the Union of Judges of Georgia had not addressed the merits of the case was not important at all. Rather, for the purposes of assessing impartiality, the significance lay in the fact that those statements had expressed support towards Judge T.U. and his arbitrary decisions."

            [
                "322. Lastly, as regards the cassation instance, the second to fourth applicants claimed that it had lacked independence and impartiality because of two judges on its bench, Judge M.T. and the President of the Supreme Court. As regards the former judge, the applicants referred to the fact that, prior to being elected to the Supreme Court, she had worked as the head of the legal department of a bank owned by the former Prime Minister and had donated GEL 34,000 (approximately EUR 10,600) to the GDC between 2012 and 2014 (see paragraph 15 7 above), a fact which proved that she had clear political sympathies towards the ruling party. However, since the ownership dispute over Rustavi 2 had been a politically sensitive one, it had been inappropriate for the judge with a clear political orientation to sit in the case. With regard to the President of the Supreme Court, the applicants referred to the fact that she could have held animosity towards the Director General of Rustavi 2, N.Gv., since it had been the latter who had brought disciplinary charges against the former back in 2006, while N.Gv. had been a member of the High Council of Justice. Those disciplinary proceedings, led by N.Gv., had resulted in the judge being dismissed from her judicial post in 2006. The second to fourth applicants claimed that those facts had constituted a sufficient basis for an objective observer to suspect that the President of the Supreme Court could be biased against Rustavi 2 ’ s Director General. Lastly, although the second to fourth applicants ’ challenge had been directed against only two of the nine judges in that composition of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 161 above), they claimed that it had been perfectly possible for those two judges to exert influence over the rest of the bench. They also submitted that, as a matter of principle, the main question was not whether such influence had actually been exerted but that the likelihood of such influence had existed. Therefore, the lack of independence or impartiality on the part of two judges had tainted the whole bench of the Supreme Court that had examined the ownership dispute, in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.",

                "323. The Government submitted that the second to fourth applicants ’ complaints concerning Judge T.U., Judge N.G., Judge M.T. and the President of the Supreme Court fell short of the standard of proof required under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and were unable to refute the presumptions of independence and impartiality of the first, appellate and cassation courts."
            ],
            [
                "324. As regards Judge T.U, the Government firstly submitted that the allegations of “forum-shopping” were unsubstantiated. First of all, contrary to the applicants ’ allegations, T.U. had not been the only judge at the Tbilisi City Court who had been expert in issues related to copyright law. At the material time, two other judges in the same court had been specialists in examining copyright disputes. Furthermore, the Government referred to the fact that the assignment of the ownership dispute to that particular judge had been conducted in alphabetical order, pursuant to section 5 of the Allocation of Cases to Judges Act of June 1998 (see paragraph 9 1 above). As regards the challenge to Judge T.U. on the basis of the initiation of the criminal proceedings against his mother, the Government submitted that those proceedings had commenced in January 2014, long before K.K. had brought the ownership dispute to the court on 4 August 2015. As regards the reasons for the delay between the incident and charges being brought against the woman, the Government referred to the documents confirming that it had been caused by the prosecution authorities ’ decision to give the parties time for reconciliation (see paragraph 9 7 above). The Government emphasised that such practice was far from being unusual. They submitted statistical data from the Chief Public Prosecutor ’ s Office demonstrating that in 2014 the investigation of offences under Article 118 of the Criminal Code, the same provision under which Judge T.U. ’ s mother had been charged, had commenced in 1,032 cases, out of which charges had been brought only in 115 cases, whilst the remaining cases had ended with reconciliation between the parties. Furthermore, the Government submitted documents which disclosed that Judge T.U. ’ s mother had eventually been convicted on 11 December 2017, that is to say well after Judge T.U. had delivered the judgment in favour of K.K. (see paragraphs 98 before). Judge T.U. had never shown personal bias and no circumstances existed that could objectively justify the second to fourth applicants ’ fear that the judge had been pressurised by the authorities into deciding the ownership dispute in favour of K.K."

            [
                "325. As regards the issue related to the Facebook posts published by Judge T.U. ’ s wife, the Government submitted that the second to fourth applicants had not presented any evidence to show that Judge T.U. had been under the influence of his spouse while adjudicating on the case. Neither the Bangalore Principles, to which the three applicants referred, nor any other international document on the impartiality of judges contained any provision restricting the freedom of expression of judges ’ family members or their right to form opinions, positive or negative, with regard to events and individuals. Furthermore, the impugned Facebook posts had not expressed any opinion on the outcome of the civil case, they had simply made negative comments about Rustavi 2 and its Director General. However, as long as it had not been showed that the judge had been influenced by those opinions, it could not be said that the he had lacked either independence or impartiality. The Government attached importance to the fact that Judge T.U. had emphasised in his decision of 19 October 2015 that his spouse had never agreed the contents of the Facebook posts with him, nor had he been aware of the existence of those posts. They also submitted that, as a matter of fact, Judge T.U. had taken a number of decisions, both procedurally and on the merits, in favour of the applicants, and that those decisions could be taken as an indication of the absence of any particular bias against them. Lastly, the Government invited the Court, by submitting the relevant documentary proof, to take note of the fact that Judge T.U. ’ s term of office had expired on 29 April 2016. He had subsequently applied to the High Council of Justice for reappointment for life and took part in an open recruitment competition but, far from receiving favourable treatment, he had in fact been passed over by the Council in favour of another candidate. Those developments in Judge T.U. ’ s career further underscored, in the Government ’ s view, the baseless nature of the second to fourth applicants ’ suggestion that he had been acting under the influence of the Government in his adjudication of the Rustavi 2 dispute."

                "326. As regards the independence and impartiality of the appellate level of jurisdiction involved in the examination of the ownership dispute, and in particular the complaints made against Judge N.G., the Government first acknowledged that at the time of the examination of the ownership dispute, Judges T.U. and N.G. had been members of the association of judges together with approximately fifty other acting judges. The Government argued that nothing in the association ’ s statements of 31 August and 20 October 2015 had demonstrated any indication of personal bias or a predetermined position on the part of Judge N.G. or Judge T.U. The impugned statements had not concerned the merits of the ownership dispute. Rather, they had been aimed at protecting the judiciary from the virulent attacks in the media at that time. In general, the Government argued, with reference to relevant comparative material relating to such countries as Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Portugal, that the practice of protecting individual judges from attacks in the media by non-governmental organisations and associations of judges was not uncommon."

                "327. As regards the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Court, particularly the accusations levelled by the second to fourth applicants against Judge M.T. and the President of that court, the Government submitted that the relevant complaints were manifestly ill-founded. As regards the former judge, the Government stated that her connection as an employee of the bank owned by Mr Ivanishvili ’ s family, which was in no way connected to the ownership dispute, could not cast legitimate doubts on her impartiality during the examination of the ownership dispute. The Government further submitted documentary proof of the following facts. Before being elected as a Supreme Court judge in 2015, Judge M.T. had held various judicial offices in different courts in Georgia from 1985 to 2005. She had then worked for ten years in the private sector from 2005 to 2015. She had made donations to the GDC only between 2012 and 2014, that is to say during the period when she had been employed in the private sector. There was no information on Judge M.T. ’ s political activity following her appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court on 12 June 2015. On the contrary, according to a letter of the State Audit Service, since 12 June 2015 M.T. had not made any donations to the GDC or any other political party. As regards the President of the Supreme Court, the Government emphasised that there was no proof capable of showing that the President had held or expressed any negative attitudes in respect of the Director General of Rustavi 2 in relation to the events that had occurred more than a decade previously – the disciplinary proceedings that had been conducted against her in 2006. On the other hand, the Government argued that a judge ’ s negative attitude towards one of the parties due to past affairs could be discerned only in cases where the judge clearly expressed his or her willingness for retribution. In any event, the judgment of 2 March 2017 was adopted unanimously by nine judges of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court. In these circumstances, any concerns regarding the independence and impartiality of the two particular judges could not have affected the judicial decision adopted by nine judges in consensus. The Government also emphasised in that regard that the majority of the judges sitting in the Grand Chamber (five out of nine) had become members of the Supreme Court during the period 2009 - 11, when President Saakashvili and his UNM party had been in power and during which time the then Director General of Rustavi 2, N. Gv., had held various high-ranking positions in the then Government of Georgia."

An important and relevant aspect of that context was the fact that, as the Supreme Court noted in its judgment of 2 March 2017 (see paragraph 17 3 above), Rustavi 2 had been waging a concerted, extra-curial campaign throughout with the aim of pressurising various judges and creating conditions for their recusal. The Government referred in that connection to the various insults that had been directed at the judges by the Director General of the television channel (see paragraphs 17 5 - 7 6 above), urging the Court to take this aspect into account when examining the relevant complaints."

Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 49, ECHR 2013 (extracts), with further references therein ). A member of the tribunal must be independent of both the executive and also of the parties (see, for instance, Ringeisen v. Austria, judgment of 16 July 1971, Series A no. 13, p. 39, § 95, and Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 24, § 55)."

            [
                "331. The Court reiterates that impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways. According to the Court ’ s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to a subjective test where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge, that is to say whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and also according to an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, for example, Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 118, ECHR 2005-XIII, and Micallef, cited above, § 93). In the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues the Court has focused on the objective test (see Micallef, cited above, § 95, and Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 75, 23 April 2015). However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test) (see Kyprianou, cited above, § 119). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports 1996-III)."
            ],
            [
                "332. As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge ’ s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Micallef, cited above, § 96, and Morice, also cited above, § 76). The objective test mostly concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other actors in the proceedings (see Micallef, cited above, § 97). It must therefore be decided in each individual case whether the relationship in question is of such a nature and degree as to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the tribunal (see Pullar, cited above, § 38). In this connection even appearances may be of a certain importance or, in other words, “justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done” (see Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 6639/11, § 63, 25 September 2018, and De Cubber v. Belgium, 26 October 1984, § 26, Series A no. 86). What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public. Thus, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw (see Castillo Algar v. Spain, 28 October 1998, § 45, Reports 1998-VIII). The Court further restates that appearance of partiality under the objective test is to be measured by the standard of an objective observer (see, amongst other authorities, Pullar, cited above, § 39, A.K. v. Liechtenstein, no. 38191/12, § 75, 9 July 2015; and Miminoshvili v. Russia, no. 20197/03, § 114, 28 June 2011). The Court further observes that the appearance that a judge is not impartial can be given not only by apparent conflict of interest (see, for instance, Micallef, cited above, § 102; Ramljak v. Croatia, no. 5856/13, § 31, 27 June 2017; and Dorozhko and Pozharskiy v. Estonia, nos. 14659/04 and 16855/04, § 58, 24 April 2008) or a judge ’ s demeanour on the bench (compare Morice, cited above § 86), but equally by the conduct of a judge outside the courtroom (compare, mutatis mutandis, Tocono and Profesorii Prometeişti v.

It is of the opinion that the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in developing methods for the assignment of cases to particular judicial formations. A wide range of factors, such as, for instance, resources available, qualification of judges, conflict of interests, judicial workload etc., must be taken into account by the authorities when assigning a case. The Court has previously held that, although it is not its role to assess whether there were valid grounds for the domestic authorities to (re)assign a case to a particular judge or court, it must be satisfied that such (re)assignment was compatible with Article 6 § 1, and, in particular, with the requirements of independence and impartiality ( compare, mutatis mutanids, with Sutyagin v. Russia, no. 30024/02, § 187 178-93, 3 May 2011). On the facts of the present case, the Court cannot see indices of the type of judicial “forum shopping” alleged by the applicants. Whilst the applicants claimed that Judge T.U. had been the only judge at the Tbilisi City Court specialising in the examination of intellectual- property law, the documents available in the case file suggest that, in actual fact, two other judges with such a specialisation had also been available. Of further significance in that connection is that Judge T.U. himself explained in detail the way in which the ownership dispute had been allocated to him. Specifically, he confirmed that the decision on allocation had been made, under section 5 of the Allocation of Cases to Judges Act of June 1998, in alphabetical order (see paragraphs 9 1 and 32 4 above).

However, the Court notes that both the prosecution authority at the domestic level and the Government in the Convention proceedings provided a sound explanation in respect of those circumstances. Thus, according to the material available in the case file, given the senior age and the state of health of the accused, Judge T.U. ’ s mother, as well as the less-serious character of the impugned offence under domestic legislation (Article 118 of the Criminal Code), the prosecution authority had given her, in accordance with the well-established practice, time for reconciliation with the victim of the offence, her son-in-law. The existence of such a reconciliatory practice is confirmed by the statistical data of the prosecutor ’ s office regarding the prosecution of offences committed under Article 118 of the Criminal Code in 2014 - 15.

Public confidence, in its turn, rests, amongst other things, upon institutional and individual independence of a judge and his or her impartiality, the latter being an essential quality required of a judge. Impartiality must exist both as a matter of fact (subjective test) and as a matter of reasonable appearance (objective test) (see the case-law principles summarised in paragraphs 33 1- 33 3 above )."

The Court considers that, as a matter of principle, a judge should consider disqualifying him or herself from sitting if the judge has made public statements relating to the outcome of the case. The Court notes that Judge T.U. did not make any such statements. Since the Facebook posts in question were made not by the Judge but by his spouse, the objective test applies. Two interrelated questions arise: (i) whether the character of those statements was such as to raise objectively justifiable concerns about the impartiality of the judicial review of the ownership dispute over Rustavi 2 shares and (ii) whether the statements published by Judge T.U. ’ s wife can be said to have been associated with the judge himself."

In so far as the first question is concerned, regarding the character of the impugned public statements, the Court recognises that those statements conveyed the negative views of the author of the posts in relation to Rustavi 2 as a television channel and to its Director General, N.Gv., personally. However, neither of these two represented an actual party to the ownership dispute. The judge ’ s wife did not comment in any manner on the eventual outcome of the on-going ownership dispute. None of the Facebook posts, one of which predated the assignment of the ownership dispute to Judge T.U., could be understood as creating an impression that the judge ’ s spouse was attempting to exploit her husband ’ s judicial position or influence him."

As to the second question, the Court notes that, according to the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, a judge shall not allow his or her family, social or other relationships to influence his or her judicial conduct (see point 4.8 of the Bangalore Principles cited in paragraphs 22 4 above). The requirement of judicial impartiality cannot prevent a judge ’ s family expressing their views on issues affecting society. However, it cannot be excluded that the activities of close family members might, in certain circumstances, adversely affect the public ’ s perception of a given judge ’ s impartiality (see paragraph 67 of the Commentary on the Bangalore Principles, cited in paragraph 22 5 above). The Court notes that, in the case at hand, the second to fourth applicants have not presented any evidence that Judge T.U. was influenced by his spouse ’ s social networking statements while adjudicating the case. There is no proof in the case file that the judge ever discussed the ownership dispute over Rustavi 2 shares with his spouse either privately or in public. In his decision of 19 October 2015, the judge emphasised that his spouse had never agreed the contents of her Facebook posts with him and that he had not even been aware of the existence of those posts. The Court thus considers that, from the standpoint of an objective observer, the judge sufficiently distanced himself from the opinions which his wife published on Facebook."

Lastly, the Court reiterates that a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention cannot be grounded on the alleged lack of independence or impartiality of a decision-making tribunal if the decision taken was subject to subsequent oversight by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and ensures respect for the guarantees laid down in that provision (see, for instance, Helle v. Finland, 19 December 1997, § 46, Reports 1997 ‑ VIII ). In this connection, the Court is not oblivious to the fact that the second to fourth applicants had access to the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, an instance with full jurisdiction to re-examine the ownership dispute on matters of fact and law. The impartiality of the appellate court is examined below (see paragraphs 349 -5 3 below). The Court considers that the Court of Appeal not only ensured a full re-examination of the merits of the ownership dispute but also addressed, albeit not in the same detailed manner as that was subsequently done by the Supreme Court, the second to fourth applicants ’ challenge to Judge T.U. ’ s independence and impartiality (see paragraphs 10 6, 14 7 and 17 3 above; and contrast with Kyprianou, cited above, § 134, and Henryk Urban and Ryszard Urban v.

The second to fourth applicants challenged the independence and impartiality of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal on account of the alleged proximity of Judge N.G., who was one of the three judges on the appellate bench, to Judge T.U, who had decided the case at first instance. In support of that allegation, the applicants referred to the fact that both judges had been founding members of the Union of Judges of Georgia and that the latter non-governmental organisation had issued misplaced public statements supporting the first-instance judge."

                "349. However, the Court considers that, from the standpoint of an objective observer, viewing the matter realistically and practically, the second to fourth applicants ’ allegations concerning Judge N.G. are unsubstantiated. To start with, the Court reiterates that a judge, like any other individual, is entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly, but in exercising these rights, he or she should conduct himself or herself in such a manner as to preserve the dignity of the judicial office and the impartiality and independence of the judiciary ( see its findings in paragraph 344 above; and compare, mutatis mutandis, N.F. v. Italy, no. 37119/97, § § 31 and 32, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX; Kudeshkina v. Russia, no. 29492/05, § 86, 26 February 2009; and Harabin v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 62584/00, 29 June 2004 ). A judge may form or join associations of judges or participate in other organisations representing the interests of judges (see the Commentary to the Bangalore Principles, cited in paragraph 22 5 above). Thus, it does not see anything improper in the fact that both Judge T.U. and Judge N.G had been founding members, together with sixteen other judges, of the Union of Judges of Georgia, an association representing acting judges ’ interests. At the time of the examination of the ownership dispute, Judge T.U. and Judge N.G were still members of the organisation, together with some fifty other acting judges in Georgia."
            ],
            [
                "350. As regards the issuance of the statements by the association of judges on 31 August and 20 October 2015, the Court does not see anything improper about that occurrence either. Firstly, it attaches significance to the fact that those statements were made in response to the Rustavi 2 Director General ’ s public attacks on Judge T.U. The terms and expressions that the Director General had used with respect to that particular judge in his televised statements included : “a Sonder - judge” (the latter expression being used with a Nazi connotation ), “soil will burn under the judge”, illiterate”, “corrupt”, “puppet”, “pseudo-servant of Themis”, “armed with an axe”, “ for- hire” and “scoundrel” (for more epithets used by Rustavi 2 ’ s Director General in the course of the domestic proceedings, see paragraphs 17 5 ‑ 6 above). It furthermore is evident from the available case -file material that the Director General did not even hide the fact that he was making such abusive public statements intentionally, with the aim of provoking the judge and obtaining grounds for requesting the latter ’ s recusal (see paragraphs 10 4 and 17 3 above). In that regard, the Court considers it important to emphasise that, whilst parties to the proceedings may defend their rights and legal interests even in a boisterous manner, which may include resort to exuberant speech, they are nevertheless expected to confine such conduct strictly to the courtroom (see, for instance, Čeferin v. Slovenia, no. 40975/08, § 54, 16 January 2018). In the present case, however, Rustavi 2 ’ s Director General, chose to voice his criticism of Judge T.U. not in a courtroom, although he had every possibility to do so given the involvement of Rustavi 2 as a party to the proceedings at that time, but by employing Rustavi 2 ’ s powerful media premises and with the inappropriate goal of provoking the judge and artificially creating the preconditions for the latter ’ s recusal."
            ],
            [
                "351. Furthermore, whilst Judge T.U. was subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than an ordinary person (see Morice, cited above, § 131), the Court considers that Rustavi 2 ’ s Director General overstepped the bounds of that permissible criticism by proffering through that television channel strong personal affronts in respect of the judge ( see, amongst many other authorities, Rodriguez Ravelo v. Spain, no. 48074/10, § 46, 12 January 2016; Kincses v. Hungary, no. 66232/10, § 37, 27 January 2015; Saday v. Turkey, no. 32458/96, § 35, 30 March 2006; and Skałka v. Poland, no. 43425/98, § 36, 27 May 2003). Since Rustavi 2 ’ s Director General ’ s gratuitous media attacks on Judge T.U. could be seen as an improper attempt to influence the judge ’ s decision-making and contribute to the erosion of the authority of the judiciary in general (see also his attempts to reach out to the President of the Tbilisi City Court in paragraphs 17 7 and 17 8 above), the Court does not find anything unfitting in the judicial association ’ s decision to issue public statements in defence of the judiciary in general and Judge T.U. in particular, especially since the latter was precluded himself from replying by a duty of discretion (see Radobuljac v. Croatia, no. 51000/11, § 54, 28 June 2016, and Morice, cited above, § 108). As regards the content of those statements, the Court observes that they were civil and balanced."

Finland, no. 47221/99, § 33, ECHR 2004 ‑ V). Secondly, having regard to the general question of the significance of the appearance of judicial independence from the executive and legislative branches, the Court is ready to accept that, in addition to the need for judges to refrain from taking part publicly in controversial political discussions (see the Court ’ s findings in paragraphs 344 and 349 above), it would be normally preferable for professional judges to refrain, during their mandate, from partisan political activities, such as contributing to political parties or campaigns (see also the Bangalore Principles and the Commentary thereto, cited in paragraphs 22 4 and 22 5 above). However, according to the case ‑ file material, Judge M.T. contributed to the political party in question some years previously, at a time when she was employed in the private sector (see paragraph 32 7 above).

Requests for recusal of domestic judges should not be aimed at paralysing the defendant State ’ s legal system and this aspect bears special importance where courts of last instance are concerned and where such requests cannot, therefore, be decided upon by the appeal court (see A.K., cited above, § § 80 and 82).",

In practice, however, it is very difficult to establish the existence of personal bias of a judge under the subjective test, and the Court normally prefers to assess the situation from the objective standpoint. For instance, in the case of Tocono and Profesorii Prometeişti, the Court held that the judge ’ s personal grudge towards a party to the proceedings could only be discerned under the objective test by having due regard not only to past events that could, from the perspective of an objective observer, be considered as the plausible cause of the animosity but also to the question of whether or not the judge had ever expressed a willingness to retaliate ( see Tocono and Profesorii Prometeişti, cited above, §§ 28-33 )."

A set of disciplinary proceedings leading to dismissal is a serious matter which, in principle, can have a significant effect on the private and professional life of the person concerned. With this mind, the Court considers that the enlarged bench of the Supreme Court, the body seized with the relevant request for recusal of its President, had to subject the request to a serious scrutiny. The Court observes that in its ruling of 2 March 2017, the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court extensively addressed the relevant arguments of the second to fourth applicants, carefully assessing them under both the subjective and objective tests contained in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

Denmark, 24 May 1989, § 47, Series A no. 154), the Court further notes that the second to fourth applicants have not presented, either at the domestic level or in the proceedings before it, any information to show that the President of the Supreme Court held such a negative attitude with regard to N.Gv. in relation to the past affairs that had occurred more than a decade before. Leaving aside the lack of proof of the President ’ s willingness to retaliate ( again contrast Tocono and Profesorii Prometeişti, cited above, §§ 28 ‑ 33, and Remli, cited above, §§ 43-48), there is also no evidence in the case file to show that the judge ever expressed any views at all either about Rustavi 2, N.Gv. or the latter ’ s role in the disciplinary proceedings conducted against her. In the circumstances when the second to fourth applicants had been systematically introducing ill-founded recusal requests against many different judges of all three levels of jurisdiction and when the attacks broadcast by Rustavi 2 against some of the judges involved in the case had been sustained, the Court considers that the Supreme Court ’ s well ‑ reasoned decision to maintain the President was not, given the circumstances of the case and the elements relied on when seeking her recusal, unjustified."

The Court observes that in the instant case a criminal investigation into the road traffic accident of 22 November 2003 was opened promptly, and by 3 December 2003 the applicant was already granted victim status. She then used her procedural status to regularly enquire about progress in the investigation, starting from an early stage of the proceedings. Thus, it cannot be said that she did not show an interest in having the relevant facts elucidated through a criminal investigation at the domestic level (contrast Akhvlediani and Others, cited above, § 25; Manukyan v. Georgia (dec.), no. 53073/07, § 30, 9 October 2012; and Deari and Others v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” (dec.), no. 54415/09, §§ 47-49, 6 March 2012). The Court is not convinced by the Government’s claim that the six ‑ month time-limit ought to be calculated from the prosecutorial decision of 1 February 2007. That decision was of a rather anodyne procedural nature, merely rejecting one of the applicant’s procedural requests; it was not a decision on the final discontinuation of the proceedings; nor was it a decision denying the applicant the right to be meaningfully involved in the investigation or undermining the eventual effectiveness of the investigation by prejudging its outcome (contrast, for instance, Shavlokhova v. Georgia (dec.) [Committee], no. 4800/10, § 23, 18 September 2018).

It reiterates in this connection that the exact circumstances surrounding the road traffic accident of 22 November 2003, in particular, the speed at which the AMV had been travelling, the side of the road on which it had crashed into the car driven by the applicant’s son, and the question of whether or not A.M., the driver of the AMV, had fled the scene of the accident, were all in dispute between the parties (see paragraphs 8, 47 and 48 above). Without knowledge of such crucial facts, it is impossible to assess properly the applicant’s claim that the respondent State should be held responsible for the alleged breach of the traffic regulations on account of either negligent or deliberate conduct on the part of the AMV driver, who was either a military or police officer at the material time (see paragraph 14 above; contrast Mikhno v. Ukraine, no. 32514/12, §§ 125 and 129, 1 September 2016, and Kotelnikov v. Russia, no. 45104/05, §§ 93 and 94, 12 July 2016). Having regard to its subsidiary role, the Court must remain cautious when it is called upon to reconstruct the exact facts surrounding an accident which occurred sixteen years previously. It must bear in mind that the competent domestic authorities are better placed and equipped for such a fact-finding mission (compare, among many other authorities, McShane, cited above, § 103, and Shanaghan v. the United Kingdom, no. 37715/97, § 95, 4 May 2001). Indeed, the situation at hand cannot be equated to a death in custody, where the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the State to provide a satisfactory and plausible explanation (see McShane, cited above, §§ 101 and 104), or to a death that occurred as a result of the State’s failure to put in place an adequate regulatory framework for dangerous activities (see Mikhno, cited above, § 126; Finogenov and Others v. Russia, nos. 18299/03 and 27311/03, § 209, ECHR 2011 (extracts); and Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 90, ECHR 2004‑XII). Neither has the applicant ever complained, nor is there any similar suggestion on the facts of the case, that the death of the applicant’s next-of-kin was caused either by a framework deficiency or the State’s failure to discharge “a preventive operational measure” (compare with Nicolae Virgiliu Tănase v. Romania [GC], no. 41720/13, §§ 135 and 136, 25 June 2019). While it was a military vehicle that caused the fatal road traffic accident, it cannot be inferred from the facts that there might have been use of force by the AMV’s driver for which State responsibility under Article 2 arises (contrast with McShane, cited above, § 101)."

                "50. Consequently, the Court considers that it is not in a position to reach any definite findings under the Convention with regard to the alleged responsibility of the respondent State for the death of the applicant’s son and sister under the substantive limb of Article 2 of the Convention. Based on the material available in the case file and in the light of the conduct of the investigative authorities at the domestic level, it will thus confine the examination of this application to an assessment of whether the domestic investigation was in compliance with the relevant standards under the procedural limb of Article 2 (see, for various circumstances where the Court proceeded with the examination of Article 2 complaints under the procedural limb, Nicolae Virgiliu Tănase, cited above, §§ 137-138, 153 and 157-158; Kotelnikov, cited above, §§ 99-101 and 111; Masneva v. Ukraine, no. 5952/07, § 51, 20 December 2011; Fedina v. Ukraine, no. 17185/02, § 63, 2 September 2010; McShane, cited above, § 105; and Shanaghan, cited above, § 99).",

            ],
            [
                "51. The first sentence of Article 2 of the Convention requires the States, amongst other obligations, to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life in the context of any activity, whether public or not, in which the right to life may be at stake (see, among many other authorities, Zubkova v. Ukraine, no. 36660/08, § 35, 17 October 2013). In the case of a life-threatening injury or death, the above obligation calls for an effective independent judicial system to ensure enforcement of the aforementioned legislative framework by providing appropriate redress (see, for example, Anna Todorova v. Bulgaria, no. 23302/03, § 72, 24 May 2011). This obligation also applies in the context of designing a framework for the protection of life from road traffic accidents (see, for example, Al Fayed v. France (dec.), no. 38501/02, §§ 73-78, 27 September 2007; Rajkowska v. Poland (dec.), no. 37393/02, 27 November 2007; and Railean v. Moldova, no. 23401/04, § 30, 5 January 2010). An effective judicial system, as required by Article 2, may – and under certain circumstances must – include recourse to the criminal law (see Cioban v. Romania (dec.), no. 18295/08, § 25, 11 March 2014). Whilst States have the discretion to decide how a system for the implementation of a regulatory framework protecting the right to life must be designed and implemented, what is important is that whatever form the investigation takes, the available legal remedies, taken together, must amount to legal means capable of establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress (see Antonov v. Ukraine, no. 28096/04, § 46, 3 November 2011)."
            ],
            [
                "52. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Šilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, § 195, 9 April 2009). Thus, in a number of cases before the Court concerning the implementation of a domestic regulatory framework for the protection of life from road traffic accidents, the finding of a violation was largely based on the existence of unreasonable delays and a lack of diligence on the part of the authorities in conducting the proceedings, regardless of their final outcome (see Anna Todorova, cited above, § 76; Antonov, cited above, §§ 50-52; Igor Shevchenko v. Ukraine, no. 22737/04, §§ 57-62, 12 January 2012; Sergiyenko v. Ukraine, no. 47690/07, §§ 51-53, 19 April 2012; Prynda v. Ukraine, no. 10904/05, § 56, 31 July 2012; and Zubkova, cited above, §§ 41-42, 17 October 2013).",
                "(ii) Application of these principles to the circumstances of the present case"
            ],
            [
                "53. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that, having learned about the fatal road traffic accident of 22 November 2003, the authorities promptly instituted criminal proceedings and undertook, in the immediate aftermath, a number of important investigative measures, such as an on-site reconstruction of the events, questioning of the suspect and witnesses, and relevant forensic examinations. However, all of those positive steps taken in the early stages of the investigation were subsequently overshadowed by the overall length of the investigation and the prohibitive delays on the part of the investigative authorities. The road traffic accident and the death of the applicant’s son and sister occurred on 22 November 2003, whereas the investigation ended on 1 March 2017, more than thirteen years later, without any final determination of the case on the merits. The exceptionally protracted investigation, which in itself raises serious concerns as to the domestic authorities’ compliance with the requirements of promptness and reasonable expedition (see, for instance, Starčević v. Croatia, no. 80909/12, § 58, 13 November 2014), was further exacerbated by several lengthy periods of total inactivity on the part of the investigative authorities (see paragraphs 21-23 and 28-34 above and compare, for instance, Prynda, cited above, § 56; Zubkova, cited above, § 41; and Dvořáček and Dvořáčková v. Slovakia, no. 30754/04, §§ 68 and 69, 28 July 2009). On various occasions the domestic authorities themselves acknowledged that the investigators had acted without due diligence when collecting evidence (see paragraphs 27-29 above, and compare, for instance, Antonov, cited above, §§ 50 and 51, and Oleynikova v. Ukraine, no. 38765/05, § 81, 15 December 2011)."
            ],
            [
                "54. At the same time, the Court cannot discern any particular reason for such a protracted investigation at the domestic level. In particular, while the person who had been driving the AMV had been identified, the witnesses were heard and the relevant forensic examinations conducted repeatedly in the very early stages, the authorities failed to reach any conclusion in the criminal proceedings. The Government did not even argue that a lengthy investigation had been justified by the necessity to perform numerous vital procedural measures, by the applicant’s behaviour, or for other relevant reasons (compare, for instance, Igor Shevchenko, § 60, and Sergiyenko, § 52, both cited above, and contrast with Nicolae Virgiliu Tănase, also cited above, § 184). In this connection, the Court reiterates that justice delayed is often justice denied, as the existence of unreasonable periods of inactivity and a lack of diligence on the authorities’ part in conducting the proceedings renders the investigation ineffective irrespective of its final outcome (see, as a recent authority, Vazagashvili and Shanava v. Georgia, no. 50375/07, § 89, 18 July 2019, with further references). The Court further observes that, as a result of the accumulated delays, the investigative authorities’ allowed the criminal proceedings to stagnate for more than ten years, which resulted in the expiry of the relevant statute of limitations and the consequent discontinuation of the proceedings without establishing the criminal responsibility of the AMV driver (compare Mažukna v. Lithuania, no. 72092/12, § 83, 11 April 2017, and Angelova and Iliev v. Bulgaria, no. 55523/00, §§ 101 and 116, 26 July 2007). Such a lack of due diligence, which in the eyes of the Court looks like a deliberate delay, was the sole cause of the proceedings becoming time-barred. This is yet another indication of the fact that the criminal-law system has proved to be far from rigorous and deprived the applicant of any possibility of obtaining redress (compare, mutatis mutandis, V.K. v. Russia, no. 68059/13, § 185, 7 March 2017; Kraulaidis v. Lithuania, no. 76805/11, §§ 58 and 63, 8 November 2016; and İzci v. Turkey, no. 42606/05, § 72, 23 July 2013). It is exactly because of the ineffectiveness of the domestic investigation that the Court has been prevented to rule on the responsibility of the respondent State under the substantive limb of Article 2 of the Convention (see paragraphs 49 and 50 above)."

However, it has been said that the six - month time-limit does not apply as such to continuing situations because, if there is a situation of ongoing breach, the time-limit in effect starts afresh each day and it is only once the situation ceases that the final period of six months will run to its end ( Chiragov and Others v.

The appellant was walking along a public street in full view of anyone passing and he was completely naked with his private parts entirely on show. Such conduct would be severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people especially when it was being carried out in an ordinary public street.

I came to the conclusion that the context in which the conduct was taking place – being naked in a brazen fashion in the public street with no attempt to cover himself and no obvious explanation or reason for the conduct – would cause serious disturbance to the community because of the reaction of ordinary people to his presence in that state in that place.

Equally, in our view, it is neither possible nor desirable to derive a comprehensive definition from a close analysis of the facts of individual cases in which it has been held that a breach of the peace had been committed ... [I]t is, in our view, clear that what is required to constitute the crime is conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community ... What is required, therefore, it seems to us, is conduct which does present as genuinely alarming and disturbing, in its context, to any reasonable person.",

It would be artificial to ignore this wider pattern when considering the compliance of the measures with the applicant ’ s Article 10 rights, since it is precisely their repeated nature which has led to the applicant ’ s detention for a number of years. The Court will therefore examine the compatibility of the applicant ’ s 2011 arrest, prosecution, conviction and imprisonment with Article 10 of the Convention in the light of the pattern of prior and subsequent such incidents.",

A significant majority of States either did not treat public nudity as a criminal offence or treated it as a minor misdemeanour susceptible to a fine or a short period of imprisonment.

While they do not benefit from the special protection afforded to the press, even small and informal campaign groups must be able to carry on their activities effectively. There exists a strong public interest in enabling such groups and individuals, outside the mainstream, to contribute to the public debate by disseminating information and ideas on matters of general public interest such as health and the environment ( Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 89, ECHR 2005-II and, mutatis mutandis, Bowman v. the United Kingdom, 19 February 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ I)."

The Court has previously found that, in the context of religious opinions and beliefs, such duties and responsibilities may include an obligation to avoid as far as possible expressions that are gratuitously offensive to others and thus an infringement of their rights, and which therefore do not contribute to any form of public debate capable of furthering progress in human affairs. This being so, it said, it may be considered necessary in certain democratic societies to sanction or even prevent improper attacks on objects of religious veneration, provided always that the penalty imposed be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Otto-Preminger-Institut v.

As an individual intent on achieving greater acceptance of public nudity, the applicant is entitled to seek to initiate such a debate and there is a public interest in allowing him to do so.

The comparative data supplied by the Government show that even in the small number of States surveyed, the responses of the law and of the authorities to public nudity are far from uniform.

Turning to examine the approach to manifestations of public nudity in Scotland, the police and the Crown Office had discretion in deciding how to respond to such incidents, as demonstrated by the applicant ’ s own case. The measures taken against him were not the result of any blanket prohibition: each incident was considered on its facts and in light of the applicant ’ s own history of offending. Following his early arrests, he was generally released with no further action being pursued (see paragraphs 8 to 31 above). On the occasions when he was prosecuted, the courts demonstrated a similarly individualised approach. The applicant was only convicted after it had established at trial, on the basis of evidence as to his conduct in a particularly public place, that the offence of breach of the peace had been made out, namely that he had caused alarm to other people and serious disturbance to the community (see paragraph 101 above) On one occasion the Sheriff found on the prosecution evidence that there was no case to answer and three times the applicant was found not guilty, either following acceptance of a not guilty plea or after a trial of the facts (see paragraphs 19, 24, 36 and 48 above). Following the applicant ’ s 2011 trial, at which he also appeared naked (see paragraph 76 above), the Sheriff was satisfied that the applicant ’ s appearance naked on a public road outside HMP Perth was sufficiently severe to cause alarm to ordinary people and serious disturbance to the community (see paragraph 80 above). Although the applicant could have avoided arrest outside HMP Perth by complying with the police officers ’ request that he put on clothes, he refused to do so (see paragraph 75 above). The Sheriff commented that had the applicant appeared naked in a more remote place or in a place where fewer people would be congregated, rather than “in or near one of the main streets of a busy town ”, he might have reached a different conclusion (see paragraph 80 above)."

As to the severity of the sanctions, it is noteworthy that after his early convictions the applicant was either admonished (see paragraph 10 above) or received short sentences of imprisonment of between two weeks and three months (see, for example, paragraphs 11, 16 and 31 above). It was only after a number of convictions for public nudity that the courts began to impose more substantial custodial sentences on the applicant. Even then, efforts were made to reach a less severe penalty. When sentencing the applicant for breach of the peace in 2009, the Sheriff explored the possibility of a non-custodial sentence if the applicant would agree to wear clothes, and only imposed a one-year sentence when the applicant refused to accept a condition of remaining clothed (see paragraph 60 - 61 above). By the time of his 2011 conviction and sentence of 330 days, together with a requirement to serve in addition 237 days outstanding for a previous sentence (see paragraph 81 above), he had been arrested over thirty times for public nudity and convicted almost twenty times. In assessing the proportionality of the penalty imposed, the Court is therefore not concerned with the respondent State ’ s response to an individual incident of public nudity but with its response to the applicant ’ s persistent public nudity and his wilful and contumacious refusal to obey the law over a number of years (see for example the Sheriff ’ s comments as to sentence in respect of the June 2009 conviction at paragraphs 60 - 61 above)."

It is true that by the time that the 2011 sentence was imposed, the applicant had already served a cumulative total of five years and three months in detention since 18 May 2006, on remand pending fifteen criminal prosecutions and post-conviction pursuant to twelve sentences of imprisonment, with only four days ’ spent at liberty during that period. At the point at which he subsequently left Scotland on 9 October 2012, he had spent almost six and a half consecutive years in prison with less than a dozen days at liberty throughout the entire period. The cumulative period of imprisonment in Scotland since 2003 for the repeated instances of his refusal to dress in public stands at over seven years. While the penalty imposed for each individual offence, taken on its own, is not such as to raise an issue under Article 10 in terms of lack of proportionality, the cumulative impact on the applicant of the measures taken by the respondent State, which was undeniably severe, is otherwise. However, the applicant ’ s own responsibility for the convictions and the sentences imposed cannot be ignored. In exercising his right to freedom of expression, he was in principle under a general duty to respect the country ’ s laws and to pursue his desire to bring about legislative or societal change in accordance with them (see, mutatis mutandis, Tănase, cited above, § 167). Many other avenues for the expression of his opinion on nudity or for initiating a public debate on the subject were open to the applicant. He was also under a duty, particularly in light of the fact that he was asking for tolerance in respect of his own conduct, to demonstrate tolerance of and sensibility to the views of other members of the public. However, the applicant appears to reject any suggestion that acceptance of public nudity may vary depending on the nature of the location and the presence of other members of the public. Without any demonstration of sensibility to the views of others and the behaviour that they might consider offensive, he insists upon his right to appear naked at all times and in all places, including in the courts, in the communal areas of prisons and on aeroplanes (see, for example, paragraphs 22, 29, 33, 53, 76 and 93 above)."

The applicant ’ s case is troubling, since his intransigence has led to his spending a substantial period of time in prison for what is – in itself – usually a relatively trivial offence (see paragraph 100 above). However, the applicant ’ s imprisonment is the consequence of his repeated violation of the criminal law in full knowledge of the consequences, through conduct which he knew full well not only goes against the standards of accepted public behaviour in any modern democratic society but also is liable to be alarming and morally and otherwise offensive to other, unwarned members of the public going about their ordinary business. Having regard to the considerations set out above and to the wide margin of appreciation, the Court finds that the reasons for the measures adopted by the police, the prosecuting authorities and the courts, and in particular those adopted in respect of his arrest in 2011, were “relevant and sufficient” and that the measures met a pressing social need in response to repeated anti-social conduct by the applicant. It cannot be said that the repressive measures taken in reaction to the particular, repeated form of expression chosen by the applicant to communicate his opinion on nudity were, even if considered cumulatively, disproportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued, namely the prevention of disorder and crime. In particular, Article 10 does not go so far as to enable individuals, even those sincerely convinced of the virtue of their own beliefs, to repeatedly impose their antisocial conduct on other, unwilling members of society and then to claim a disproportionate interference with the exercise of their freedom of expression when the State, in the performance of its duty to protect the public from public nuisances, enforces the law in respect of such deliberately repetitive antisocial conduct. Even though, cumulatively, the penalties imposed on the applicant undoubtedly did entail serious consequences for him, the Court cannot find in the circumstances of his case, having regard in particular to his own responsibility for his plight, that the public authorities in Scotland unjustifiably interfered with his exercise of freedom of expression.

                "182. The concept of “private life” is broad in scope and not susceptible of exhaustive definition. In general terms, it secures to the individual a sphere within which he can freely pursue the development and fulfilment of his personality (see Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, § 43, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII; and Shtukaturov v. Russia, no. 44009/05, § 83, ECHR 2008 ). In S.A.S. v. France [GC], no. 43835/11, § 107, 1 July 2014, the Grand Chamber stated that personal choices as to an individual ’ s desired appearance, whether in public or in private places, relate to the expression of his personality and thus fall within the notion of private life. The notion of private life also protects a right to identity and to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. There is, therefore, a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of “private life” (see P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 56, ECHR 2001-IX; Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ I; Perry v. the United Kingdom, no. 63737/00, § 36, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX (extracts); and Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, no. 4158/05, § 61, ECHR 2010 (extracts))."

On the other hand, not every activity that a person might seek to engage in with other human beings in order to establish and develop relationships will be protected by Article 8: it will not, for example, protect interpersonal relations of such broad and indeterminate scope that there can be no conceivable direct link between the action or inaction of a State and a person ’ s private life (see Friend and Others, cited above, § 41 ). However, the fact that behaviour is prohibited by the criminal law is not sufficient to bring it outside the scope of “private life” (see A.D.T. v. the United Kingdom, no. 35765/97, § 23, ECHR 2000 ‑ IX; and Pay v. the United Kingdom (dec.). no. 32792/05, 16 September 2003). Finally, the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the guarantee afforded by Article 8, (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 61, ECHR 2002 ‑ III; and Gillan and Quinton, cited above, § 61)."

The applicant, by deliberately and consistently appearing naked in very public places such as urban centres, courtrooms and the communal parts of prisons, was intent on making a public statement of his belief in the inoffensive nature of the human body. The Court has found that his conduct amounted to a form of expression protected by Article 10 (see paragraph 150 ). It has previously indicated that a distinction must be drawn between carrying out an activity for personal fulfilment and carrying out the same activity for a public purpose, where one cannot be said to be acting for personal fulfilment alone (see Friend and Others, cited above, § 42). Furthermore, as concerns in particular an individual ’ s personal choices as to his desired appearance in public (as referred to in S.A.S., cited above), on analogy with the applicability of Article 9 of the Convention to religious beliefs (text of Article 9 cited below at paragraph 185 ), Article 8 cannot be taken to protect every conceivable personal choice in that domain: there must presumably be a de minimis level of seriousness as to the choice of desired appearance in question (see, mutatis mutandis, in relation to Article 9, Bayatyan, cited above, § 110; and Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 48420/10, § 81, ECHR 2013 (extracts) ). Whether the requisite level of seriousness has been reached in relation to the applicant ’ s choice to appear fully naked on all occasions in all public places without distinction may be doubted, having regard to the absence of support for such a choice in any known democratic society in the world. In any event, however, even if Article 8 were to be taken to be applicable to the circumstances of the present case, the Court is satisfied that those circumstances are not such as to disclose a violation of that provision on the part of the public authorities in Scotland. In sum, any interference with the applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life was justified under Article 8 § 2 for essentially the same reasons given by the Court in the context of its analysis of the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 10 of the Convention (see paragraphs 171 - 176 above ).",

In particular, as held by the domestic courts, section 1 of that Act was not applicable to investigative measures taken in the course of criminal proceedings, while under section 2 the State could have been held liable only if Mr Gutsanov ’ s detention had been found to be unlawful, the proceedings against him had been discontinued, or a conviction had been set aside.

The Court takes note of the Government ’ s argument that the organisation of the bringing of charges necessitated time (see paragraph 40 above) and does not consider itself in a position to question that assertion, despite its general character. The authorities were facing a complex investigation linked to loans provided by the applicant to numerous individuals (see paragraph 15 above), and the collection of evidence, through searches carried out at the flat and the office of the applicant, required time. The Court also does not accept the first applicant ’ s argument (see paragraph 3 6 above) that the authorities had to postpone until the next day the examination of the prosecution ’ s application to place him under house arrest. Domestic law provided that a person had to be brought before a court for the examination of such an application “immediately” after the bringing of charges against him or her (see paragraph 2 7 above), the two procedural steps being functionally and temporally related. As pointed out by the Government, the only possibility to delay the examination of that application was to detain the applicant (see paragraph 40 above), a path which the prosecution clearly sought to avoid. That is why, even though it does not dispute the applicant ’ s claim that the examination of the application to place him under house arrest in the evening of 7 April 2011 caused him additional fatigue, after he had already been exhausted from the events of the day (see paragraph 3 6 above), the Court does not find this in itself problematic."

It is not for it to assess the suitability of a particular investigative measure, and in this particular case, due to the care assistant ’ s intimate involvement in the applicant ’ s movements and activities, he might well have been considered a suspect or a key witness. It has not been claimed by the Government, however, that no other person trained to provide care to a person with disabilities could have been found; it is significant in that regard that the events under discussion occurred within the context of a planned operation of the prosecution authorities (see paragraph 10 above), who have never claimed that they were unaware of the first applicant ’ s handicap and daily needs."

As concerns the application of Article 8, it has not been disputed that the flat where the first applicant served his house arrest and which the police visited to check up on him was the four applicants ’ “home”. Nor have the parties contested the fact that those visits amounted to interference with the applicants ’ right to a “home”, as guaranteed by that provision."

It has not been disputed either that this interference was “in accordance with the law”, as domestic law authorised the police to take measures to secure compliance with house arrest (see paragraph 26 above), nor that it pursued a legitimate aim in the public interest, namely compliance with the restrictions imposed on the first applicant related to the proper and effective conduct of the criminal proceedings against him, which in the circumstances may fall under “prevention of crime”."

An interference will be considered necessary within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention if it answers a “pressing social need” and in particular if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, among other authorities, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 181, ECHR 2012)."

In examining the necessity of the interference with the applicants ’ rights, the Court observes that between 15 April and 20 June 2011 the police visited their home on numerous occasions, up to four or five times a day, although usually less or not at all (see paragraphs 18 - 22 above). However, it has not been shown that apart from verifying quickly whether the first applicant was there, the police disturbed the applicants ’ daily life in any other manner. They never visited during the night. Moreover, it is important that despite not having been allowed in the flat on several occasions (see paragraphs 20 - 21 above), the police never attempted to force their way in. The period of time during which the interference with the applicants ’ right to a home lasted – slightly more than two months – was not significant either."

In addition, the Court, like the Government (see paragraph 71 above), attaches considerable weight to the fact that on two occasions ( on 15 and 29 April 2011 ) the first applicant was found to have left his home without authorisation (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above). Moreover, it appears that it was exactly his sighting in the city centre by the police on 15 April that triggered the checks on his home, as prior to that there had been no such checks at all (see paragraph 17 above). On another occasion, on 16 June 2011, the police officers appear to have been justifiably suspicious because the applicant had failed to show up for an appointment with a physiotherapist (see paragraph 22 above). Seen in this light, the frequent police checks on the first applicant do not appear to have been arbitrary or unnecessary."

The Court cannot reach a different conclusion on account of the fact, emphasised by the applicants (see paragraph 72 above), that at the time of the events at issue the fourth applicant was a minor. It has already been noted that the police visits to her home were brief and did not significantly disturb her daily life with her parents. As pointed out in addition by the Government (see paragraph 71 above), on weekdays she was at school and was not present during many of the police visits, while in the evening, upon the arrival of the police, she was usually taken to another room."

Lastly, the Court will not speculate on whether it would have been feasible and practical for the police to organise, as an alternative to the police visits and as suggested by the applicants (see paragraph 72 above), constant monitoring of the entrance to the building where their flat was situated. It suffices to note in that connection that the police made a choice as to the measures to employ, which the Court does not consider unreasonable or unsuitable."

In a judgment of 10 June 2010 (4A_458/2009) the Federal Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, mainly on the ground that the arbitral panel could, in its view, be regarded as “independent and impartial”. It rejected the other grounds of appeal that it had declared admissible. The relevant part of the Federal Court’s judgment reads as follows:",
                "“3.1 Like a national court, an arbitral tribunal must present sufficient guarantees of independence and impartiality (ATF [Federal Court judgment] 125 I 389 at 4a; 119 II 271 at 3b and cases cited). Failure to comply with this rule entails unlawful composition under the aforesaid legal provision (ATF 118 II 359 at 3b). In order to determine whether an arbitral tribunal presents such guarantees, reference must be made to the constitutional principles developed with regard to national courts (ATF 125 I 389 at 4a; 118 II 359 at 3c p. 361). However, the specificities of arbitration and in particular those of international arbitration must be taken into account when examining the circumstances of a given case (ATF 129 III 445 at 3.3.3 p. 454). In this connection, sports arbitration as instituted by the CAS has some particularities which have already been outlined elsewhere (ATF 129 III 445 at 4.2.2.2), such as a closed list of arbitrators. These should not be disregarded, even though they do not per se mean that one should be less demanding of sports arbitration than of commercial arbitration.",
                "3.2.1 The appellant claims that on 1 September 2009 his English counsel received an anonymous e-mail advising him, in substance, that the Milan law firm in which Professor [L. F.] worked represented the interests of [R. A.], an important Russian businessman who controlled the respondent, a circumstance that the president of the arbitral panel had failed to disclose in his declaration of independence.",
                "On 13 October 2009 [L. F.] filed a detailed written statement attached to the CAS answer, in which he vigorously denied the appellant’s allegations derived from that anonymous e-mail. That statement was communicated to the appellant, who did not deem it useful to challenge its content as he abstained from filing submissions in reply.",
                "3.2.2 As the appellant claims to have become aware of the ground for revision upon receipt of the 1 September 2009 e-mail, namely before the deadline for appeal, he rightly raised that argument in the present appeal on the basis that the arbitral panel was unlawfully composed (section 190(2)(a) PILA [Private International Law Act]) and not by seeking revision (judgment 4A_234/2008 of 18 August 2008 at 2.1).",
                "That being said, the appellant himself concedes in his observations (n. 58 and 62) that he is not in a position to verify the accuracy of the information he was given anonymously and that the facts mentioned in the aforesaid e-mail would constitute ground for a challenge only if they were established. It must be admitted, however, having regard to the detailed written statement of Professor [F.], not called into question by the appellant, that this requirement is not met. Indeed, in that statement the president of the arbitral panel refutes item by item all allegations challenging his independence in relation to the respondent. He has not been contradicted and his presence on the arbitral panel which made the award under appeal does not appear unlawful, such that the appellant has no cause to complain about it a posteriori.",
                "3.3.1 The appellant also challenges the independence of arbitrator [D.-R. M.], chosen by the respondent, on the ground that this arbitrator presided over the arbitral panel which issued the first award in favour of the English club in the dispute between the parties. In this connection, the appellant refers to the International Bar Association’s Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration approved on 22 May 2004 (http://www.ibanet.org/publications/Publications_home.cfm; hereinafter ‘the Guidelines’; on this subject see judgment 4A_506/2007 of 20 March 2008 at 3.3.2.2 and the authors cited therein). In his view, the alleged circumstance fell within paragraph 2.1.2 of the Guidelines, which concerns the situation where ‘the arbitrator has previous involvement in the case’, under the so-called ‘waivable red list’ covering instances in which the arbitrator must withdraw unless otherwise expressly agreed by the parties (paragraph 2 of Part II of the Guidelines). According to the appellant, that circumstance could also come under the ‘orange list’ (intermediate situations which must be disclosed but do not necessarily justify a challenge), and specifically paragraph 3.1.5, which applies to an arbitrator ‘who currently serves or has served within the past three years as arbitrator in another arbitration on a related issue involving one of the parties or an affiliate of one of the parties’. The appointment of [D.-R. M.] as arbitrator by the respondent was a reflection, in the appellant’s view, of the appreciation of the party which had won the first case between the same parties (appeal n. 75 in fine ).",
                "3.3.3.1 Whatever the appellant may claim, it is far from certain that the two rules of the Guidelines he relies upon would apply in the present case.",
                "The first one supposes that the arbitrator was previously involved in the case (para. 2.1.2); this implies the same dispute on the basis of the heading under which that rule appears (‘2.1 Relationship of the arbitrator to the dispute’). From that perspective and on the basis of a purely formal criterion, the present case is not the same as that which gave rise to the first award dated 15 December 2005. Evidence of that is the fact that the two cases were registered under different docket numbers by the CAS Court Office (CAS 2005/A/876 for one, CAS 2008/A/1644 for the other). A third case was initiated and disposed of in the meantime through an award of 21 May 2007, made by three other arbitrators (CAS 2006/A/1192).",
                "As to the second rule, when also taken to the letter, it deals with cases where the arbitrator acts, or has acted over the three previous years, as arbitrator in another arbitration concerning one of the parties (or an entity affiliated to one of the parties) but not both of them as is the case here. Moreover, that rule falls under the orange list and any breach thereof does not justify the automatic replacement of an arbitrator who falls foul thereof.",
                "That being said, the weight of these formal arguments should not be overestimated. Indeed, one should not forget that the Guidelines, while admittedly a precious working instrument, do not have legislative value. Hence the circumstances of the case at hand, like the case-law of the Federal Court in this field, will remain decisive in settling any conflict of interest (judgment 4A_405/2007, cited above, ibid.).",
                "3.3.3.2 The fact that a judge has already acted in a case may give rise to a suspicion of bias. Acting in both cases is therefore admissible only if the judge, when participating in previous decisions concerning the same case, has not already taken a position as to certain issues such that he will no longer appear to be free from bias in the future and, accordingly, the outcome of the proceedings appears to be pre-determined. To decide that issue, the facts, the procedural specificities and the specific issues raised at the various stages of the proceedings must be taken into account (ATF 126 I 168 at 2 and the cases cited). The same applies in the field of arbitration. An arbitrator’s behaviour during the arbitration proceedings may also cast doubt on his independence and impartiality. However, the Federal Court has shown itself to be demanding in assessing whether there is a risk of bias. Thus there is case-law to the effect that procedural measures, whether right or wrong, are not sufficient per se to justify an objective suspicion of bias on the part of the arbitrator who has taken them (ATF 111 Ia 259 at 3b/at p. 264 and cases cited). That remark also applies to an arbitrator who has actively participated in a partial award, even if it is erroneous (ATF 113 IA 407 at 2a p. 409 i.f.).",
                "In the present case, the task entrusted to the CAS panel which made the first arbitral award with arbitrator [D.-R. M.] as its president was clearly circumscribed. Indeed, appearing before that appellate body, the appellant already no longer denied having committed a serious breach of his contractual obligations by taking cocaine. However, he argued that to the extent that the initiative of terminating his employment contract on that ground had been taken by the respondent, he could not be blamed for a ‘unilateral breach of the contract without cause or without sporting cause’ within the meaning of Article 21 of the 2001 Regulations and accordingly he could not be ordered to compensate his former employer. The arbitrators’ task was therefore only to interpret the words ‘unilateral breach’ in the English version of Article 21 of the 2001 Regulations. The panel decided that issue of principle by finding that the aforesaid wording referred to the breaking of an employment contract and not to its termination. Moreover it rejected a second argument whereby the appellant had called for a distinction to be drawn between a player who left his club without cause and one who seriously breached his contractual obligations.",
                "In so deciding, the panel certainly made an award in the respondent’s favour, as it dismissed a major objection by the party from whom the former sought damages. However, besides the fact that the appellant never challenged the first award, and unless one attributes ulterior motives to arbitrator [M.], it is not possible to find objectively that by deciding the two aforesaid issues, essentially of a theoretical nature, the arbitrator acted in a manner which could cast doubt on his impartiality and give credence to the idea that he had already chosen to take the respondent’s side. Moreover, it does not appear from the 15 December 2005 award that the panel prejudged in any way the issue of the amount of compensation due by the appellant. It must also be emphasised that we are talking here about three awards issued in the same matter, substantively speaking, which could if appropriate have been made by the same panel, the first two being interlocutory in relation to the third, namely the final award now under appeal. As a matter of principle, save in exceptional circumstances, it is not admissible to challenge a posteriori the lawfulness of the composition of the arbitral panel which made the final award simply because its members had already ruled on the matter by participating in interlocutory or partial awards. To admit this would be tantamount to a call for the abolition of such awards, whilst their usefulness is no longer in issue. The appellant invokes no such circumstances. Consequently, the doubts he casts retrospectively as to the independence and impartiality of arbitrator [M.] are not justified.",

Under these circumstances it is not compatible with the principle of good faith to have raised the issue of the impartiality of the arbitral panel for the first time in an appeal before the Federal Court. The complaint that the arbitral panel lacked independence must therefore be dismissed.",

The appellant claims that F.’s appointment by G., a former member of the National Olympic Committee and president of an international sporting association and member of the IOC Sport and Law Commission, thus meant that the decision had in fact already been made.",

The accusation directed at the president of the arbitral panel to the effect that he had stated in another context that he took a ‘hard line’ on doping issues is too vague and general to give rise to reasonable doubt about the independence of F., especially since there is no direct relationship to these proceedings (compare ATF 133 I 89 at 33 p. 92; and ATF 105 Ia 157 at 6a p. 163).",

Contrary to the allegation in the appeal, this process does not give rise to any doubt that the decision was taken solely by the arbitral panel.

                "“4.3.2.2 ... Competitive sport is characterised by a very hierarchical structure whether at international or national level. On a vertical axis, the relationship between the athletes and the organisations which deal with various sports can thus be distinguished from horizontal relationships between parties to a contractual relationship (ATF 129 III 445 point 3.3.3.2 p. 461). This structural difference between the two types of relationship is not without influence on the meeting of the minds which leads to the formation of any agreement. In principle, where two parties do business on an equal footing, each one expresses its intention without being bound to submit to the wishes of the other. This is generally the case in international commercial relations. The situation is very different in the field of sport. Leaving aside the case – which is rather academic – where a well-known athlete, on account of his or her fame, would be in a position to dictate conditions to the international federation governing the relevant sport, experience shows that, most of the time, a sportsperson will not have free rein in his or her dealings with the federation and will be required to submit, for better or for worse, to its desires. Thus an athlete wishing to take part in a competition organised under the auspices of a sports federation whose regulations prescribe arbitration would have no choice other than to accept the arbitration clause, in particular by signing up to the instrument of the sports federation in question in which the clause is to be found, all the more so in the case of a professional. He or she will be confronted with the following dilemma: to agree to arbitration or practise his or sport in a non-professional context ... Presented with the choice between abiding by arbitration or practising the sport ‘in the garden’ ... while watching competitions ‘on the TV’ ..., an athlete who wants to play against real competitors or who must do so because it is his/her sole source of income (monetary or in kind, advertising revenue, etc.) will be obliged in actual fact, nolens volens, to opt for the first of those alternatives.",
                "For similar reasons, it is obvious that a refusal to appeal against a future arbitral award, i.e. on the part of an athlete, will not generally be the result of a freely expressed will. The agreement stemming from the concordance between the will thus displayed and that expressed by the sports organisation concerned will consequently be affected thereby ab ovo on account of the mandatory consent given by one of the parties. By accepting beforehand to abide by any future award, the athlete, as has been shown, deprives himself at the outset of the right to seek redress at a later stage for any violation of fundamental principles or of essential procedural safeguards that could be committed by the arbitral tribunal ruling in his case. In addition, as regards any disciplinary penalty that may be imposed, such as suspension, which does not require an enforcement procedure, he will not be able to submit his complaints on such grounds to the enforcements judge. Accordingly, having regard to its importance, the objection that the athlete has waived any right of appeal may not, in principle, be raised, even where such a waiver would satisfy the formal conditions laid down in section 192 (1) PILA ... That conclusion is strengthened by the consideration that any refusal to examine the appeal of an athlete who had no choice other than to accept a waiver of a right of appeal in order to be allowed to participate in competitions also appears questionable in terms of Article 6 § 1 ECHR ...”"

It must be pointed out that this is a case involving ordinary arbitral proceedings, within the meaning of Article R38 et seq. of the Code as opposed to the vast majority of CAS cases reviewed by the Federal Tribunal, which involve the arbitral appeal procedure following the challenging of a decision issued by the organs of a sports federation having accepted CAS jurisdiction (see Article R47 et seq. of the Code). To that extent, the dispute submitted to the CAS with regard to the international contract involved had all the characteristics of an ordinary commercial arbitration, except for its sports context. The dispute was between two parties on an equal footing, which sought to have it adjudicated in arbitration and were fully aware of the financial issues involved; from that point of view, their situation was quite different from that of the humble professional sportsman confronting a powerful international federation (see ATF 133 III 235 at 4.3.2.2).”"

                "“3.3.3.2 ... As it has been implemented since the 1994 reform, the system of the list of arbitrators now satisfies the constitutional requirements of independence and impartiality applicable to arbitral tribunals. The arbitrators included on the list are at least 150 in number and the CAS has about 200 at the present time. The parties’ ability to choose is thus certainly genuine, whatever the appellants may claim, even if one takes account of the nationality, language and sport of the athlete whose case is before the CAS. ...",
                "It must further be pointed out that the CAS, in so far as it functions as an external appellate body for the international federations, is not comparable to an association’s permanent arbitral tribunal responsible for settling internal disputes at last instance. Reviewing the facts and the law with a full power of examination and having complete freedom to give a new decision in the place of the body which ruled previously (REEB, Revue, ibid.), it is more like a judicial authority that is independent of the parties. In respect thereof, the system of the list of arbitrators does not therefore raise the same objections as those encountered when it is used by arbitral tribunals set up by associations. Moreover, it is not certain that the so-called ‘open list’ system – providing the parties (or one of them) with the possibility of choosing an arbitrator outside the list, unlike the system of closed lists applied by the CAS (see CLAY, op. cit., n. 478 p. 400) –, which is preferred by certain authors (see esp.: BADDELEY, op. cit., p. 274; STEPHAN NETZLE, ‘Das Internationale Sport-Schiedsgericht in Lausanne. Zusammensetzung, Zuständigkeit und Verfahren’, in Sportgerichtsbarkeit, in Recht und Sport, vol. 22, p. 9 ff., 12), constitutes a panacea. On the contrary, from the perspective of the efficiency of the arbitral tribunal, this system carries the risk that there might be, within the tribunal, one or more arbitrators who are not specialised and who may be inclined to act as if they were the lawyers of the parties who appointed them (see, on this subject, SCHILLIG, op. cit., p. 160).”",

The Court is concerned with the supervision of the implementation by Contracting States of their obligations under the Convention. It should not take on the role of Contracting States, whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined therein are respected and protected on a domestic level. The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is based on the assumption – reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged violation. The rule is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection (see Vučković and Others v.

It should be emphasised that the Court is not a court of first instance; it does not have the capacity, nor is it appropriate to its function as an international court, to adjudicate on large numbers of cases which require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation – both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic courts (ibid., § 70)."

In this connection, the Court would refer to its decision in Suovaniemi and Others (cited above), where it took the view that the applicants’ choice to have recourse to arbitration had not only been voluntary, because they had freely accepted the arbitration agreement, but also “unequivocal”, because they had not sought the withdrawal, during the arbitral proceedings, of the arbitrator whose independence and impartiality they were challenging."

The CAS was financed by the sports federations and, consequently, this appointment system meant that the arbitrators chosen by the CAS court office were inclined to favour the federations.

Similarly, the procedural public policy laid down in section 190(2)(a) of the PILA guaranteed the parties the right to an independent judgment on the submissions and statement of facts before the court in a manner consistent with the applicable procedure.

An organ which has not been established in accordance with the will of the legislature would necessary lack the legitimacy required in a democratic society to hear the cases of individuals. The phrase “established by law” covers not only the legal basis for the very existence of a “tribunal” but also the composition of the bench in each case (see Lavents v. Latvia, no. 58442/00, § 114, 28 November 2002). The “law” referred to in this provision is therefore not only the legislation on the establishment and competence of judicial organs, but also any other provision of domestic law of which any breach would cause the participation of one or more judges in the examination of the case to be unlawful."

Austria, no. 8790/79, § 36, 22 October 1984). A court or tribunal is characterised in that substantive sense by its judicial function, that is to say determining matters within its competence on the basis of legal rules, with full jurisdiction and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner (see ibid., and Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no. 25781/94, § 233, ECHR 2001 ‑ IV). A power of decision is inherent in the very notion of “tribunal”. The procedure before it must ensure the “determination of the matters in dispute” as required by Article 6 § 1 (see Benthem v. the Netherlands, 23 October 1985, § 40, Series A no. 97). For the purposes of Article 6 § 1, a tribunal need not be a court of law integrated within the standard judicial machinery. It may be set up to deal with specific subject matter which can be appropriately administered outside the ordinary court system (see Rolf Gustafson v. Sweden, 1 July 1997, § 45, Reports 1997 ‑ IV). In addition, only an institution that has full jurisdiction and satisfies a number of requirements, such as independence from the executive and also from the parties, merits the designation “tribunal” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (see Beaumartin v. France, 24 November 1994, § 38, Series A no. 296 ‑ B, and Di Giovanni v. Italy, no. 51160/06, § 52, 9 July 2013)."

Austria, 24 February 1993, §§ 27 ‑ 28 and 30, Series A no. 255-A, and Wettstein v. Switzerland, no. 33958/96, § 42, ECHR 2000‑XII)."

Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 119, ECHR 2005‑XIII). Thus in cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of a judge’s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports 1996-III)."

                "(iii ) although the circumstances of the creation of the Czech and Slovak Republics as separate States were clearly not identical to the present case, the Court ’ s response to this situation is relevant: namely, notwithstanding the fact that the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic had been a party to the Convention since 18 March 1992 and that on 30 June 1993 the Committee of Ministers had admitted the two new States to the Council of Europe and had decided that they would be regarded as having succeeded to the Convention retroactively with effect from their independence on 1 January 1993, the Court ’ s practice has been to regard the operative date in cases of continuing violations which arose before the creation of the two separate States as being 18 March 1992 rather than 1 January 1993 (see, for example, Konečný v. the Czech Republic, nos. 47269/99, 64656/01 and 65002/01, § 62, 26 October 2004)."

In that connection, the first applicant insisted that she and R. had developed emotional ties that were equivalent to those between a mother and her child. The first applicant stressed that, unlike in the case cited by the Government, she had been taking care of R. for a very prolonged period, and more specifically during the first nine years of his life; during that period she had remained the only significant adult in his life. Moreover, during that period, she had had a formal legal link to R., having been his guardian. The first applicant further insisted that there was no conflict of interest between her and R., and that R. ’ s biological parents were not in a position to protect effectively his interests in the present case, given the issues it raised. The first applicant compared the situation in the present case with cases brought on children ’ s behalf by their natural parents deprived of the parental authority over those children, and argued that there was a danger that otherwise R. ’ s interests would never be brought to the Court ’ s attention."

The Government stressed that the guardianship had had to remain in place until R. ’ s condition had improved. In fact, in 2007, when R. ’ s state of health had stabilised, his parents had expressed their intention to take him home.

There is currently a broad consensus – including in international law – in support of the idea that in all decisions concerning children, their best interests must be paramount (see Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, § 135, 6 July 2010, and X v. Latvia [GC], no. 27853/09, § 96, ECHR 2013). The child ’ s best interests may, depending on their nature and seriousness, override those of the parents. In particular, a parent cannot be entitled under Article 8 to have such measures taken as would harm the child ’ s health and development (see, for instance, Kocherov and Sergeyeva v. Russia, no. 16899/13, § 95, 29 March 2016 ). The parents ’ interests nevertheless remain a factor when balancing the various interests at stake. Child interests dictate that the child ’ s ties with his or her family be maintained, except in cases where the family has proved particularly unfit. It follows that family ties may only be severed in very exceptional circumstances and that everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, if and when appropriate, to “rebuild” the family (see, as a recent authority, Kacper Nowakowski v. Poland, no. 32407/13, § 75, 10 January 2017 ). Article 8 of the Convention thus imposes on every State the obligation to aim at reuniting natural parents with his or her child (see Görgülü, cited above, § 45)."

To that end, they were called upon to assess and fairly balance the competing interests of R. ’ s parents and those of the applicants. They also had to bear in mind that, in view of his special physical and psychological conditions, R. was a particularly vulnerable child. The domestic authorities were therefore required to show particular vigilance in assessing his interests and to afford him increased protection with due regard to his state of health."

The Court notes, firstly, that, as pointed out by the applicants (see paragraph 101 above), R. spent the first nine years of his life in the first applicant ’ s care, a period during which she remained the boy ’ s primary carer, having fully assumed the role of his parent. The Court considers that, albeit undoubtedly a considerable period of time, this factor alone could not have ruled out the possibility of R. ’ s reunification with his biological family. Indeed, effective respect for family life requires that future relations between parent and child be determined in the light of all the relevant considerations and not by the mere passage of time (see Ribić v. Croatia, no. 27148/12, § 92, 2 April 2015 )."

                "117. It further notes that it is true that R. ’ s parents acquiesced to the appointment of the first applicant as R. ’ s guardian. At the same time, as pointed out by the Government, they never formally renounced their parental authority over their son; neither were they restricted in, nor deprived of that authority (see paragraphs 16 and 39 above). Moreover, the domestic courts established that, although during the first eight years of R. ’ s life his parents had not maintained contact with him, they had nevertheless supported him financially and had accommodated the first applicant ’ s requests regarding medicine, food for a special diet for the boy, and the like ( see paragraph 18 above). Moreover, in 2009, they re-established their relationship with R. when the District Court determined their contact rights regarding him (see paragraphs 28 - 30 above). They therefore remained present in their son ’ s life, with the result that, even in the absence of any explicit time-limits or conditions for ending the first applicant ’ s guardianship in the text of the administrative decision of 23 November 2001, she could not have realistically assumed that R. would have remained in her care permanently. It thus rejects the first applicant ’ s argument to that end (see paragraph 99 above). The Court reiterates in that connection that care orders are by their very nature meant to be temporary measures, to be discontinued as soon as circumstances permit, and any measures implementing temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parents and the child (see Ageyevy, cited above, § 143, and S.S. v. Slovenia, no. 40938/16, § § 85 and 101, 30 October 2018)."

                "118. Furthermore, the case file reveals that the domestic courts carefully assessed R. ’ s best interests, with due regard to his state of health and his needs. In various sets of court proceedings, they noted, in particular, the first applicant ’ s attachment and genuinely caring attitude towards the child; her proactive approach in taking care of him and addressing his health issues, which had ensured progress in his physical and psychological development and overall improvement of his conditions (see paragraphs 22 and 40 above). As regards the biological parents, initially the authorities had doubts about whether they were fit and capable of securing R. ’ s needs. In particular, the authorities pointed to the lack of personal contact between them and R. and urged them to take a more responsible attitude regarding their parental obligations (see paragraphs 15, 19 and 23 above). In that connection, the courts rejected R. ’ s parents first claim for the boy ’ s transfer to their care, noting that such an immediate transfer could traumatise him and compromise his health, and that an adaptation period was necessary for R. to get used to his natural parents (see paragraph 24 above). In the proceedings concerning R. ’ s parents ’ second claim for his transfer, however, the courts found that R. ’ s parents were fit to raise him. It is noteworthy that by that time the contact arrangements between R. and his parents had been in place for a year. When taking that decision, the domestic courts satisfied themselves, with due regard to written evidence, including psychological reports, and witness statements, that R. ’ s parents had re-established their relations with the child; that they could adequately understand his psychological particularities, emotional state, needs and capabilities; that they had appropriate living conditions for the child; and that the latter felt calm and comfortable with them (see paragraphs 35, 42 and 43 above)."

It further considers that they provided “relevant and sufficient” reasons for the measure complained of.

Those provisions set out an exhaustive list of individuals who are entitled to maintain contact with a child, without providing for any exceptions to take account of the variety of family situations and of the best interests of the child. As a result, a person, who is not related to the child but who has taken care of him or her for a long period of time and has formed a close personal bond with him or her, is entirely and automatically excluded from the child ’ s life and cannot obtain contact rights in any circumstances, irrespective of the child ’ s best interests (see Nazarenko, cited above, §§ 65 and 67). The Court has found that the complete and automatic exclusion of the applicant from the child ’ s life after his parental status in respect of her was terminated as a result of the inflexibility of the domestic legal provisions – in particular the denial of contact rights without giving proper consideration to the child ’ s best interests – amounted to a failure to respect the applicant ’ s family life (ibid., § 68)."

The Court reiterates that, in the context of the execution of judgments in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, a judgment in which it finds a breach imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation under that provision to put an end to the breach and to make reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach ( restitutio in integrum ). However, its judgments are essentially declaratory in nature and, in general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment (see, among other authorities, Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII; Brumărescu v. Romania (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 28342/95, § 20, ECHR 2001-I; Akdivar and Others v.

In the view of inspectors, although that is a subjective opinion, officers did not attach much importance to information provided in such cases by foreigners and they were focusing more on proving that the reason for leaving the country was of [an] economic nature. After questions about possible risks, they very often moved on to ask further about a profession performed in the country and the intention to find employment in Poland.

The last piece of information is recorded in the form of laconic statements, such as going to Germany; doesn’t want to live with her husband; has no money; wants to live in Poland. In case the interview results in the refusal to enter the territory of Poland, identical information concerning the purpose of arrival is included in the memo [the official note]. The memo is attached to the files of the administrative proceedings in which the decision is issued to refuse the right of entry. This way of documenting interviews which have paramount importance for a possible recognition of a foreigner as a person seeking protection against persecution in the country of origin should be deemed highly insufficient. Firstly, based on an entry made by an officer, it is not possible to reconstruct, even roughly, the course of the interview. Secondly, a foreigner has no chance to inspect the entry, and hence cannot in any way refer to it or set the information right.”"

For instance, one of the men who had applied for international protection on 10 January 2017 had stated that he had asked for refugee status, as he could not return to his country of origin. He had submitted that he had been a taxi driver and had been accused of transporting militants. He said that two of his brothers had been killed and that he was wanted by the Chechen authorities. He had expressed fear for the security of his children and family.

Greece, no. 39034/12, § 47, 15 March 2018). Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured. The effect of that provision is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the Contracting States’ obligations under Article 13 varies, depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint. However, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law. The “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of the Convention does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the “authority” referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; however, if it is not, its powers and the guarantees that it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective (see, among many other authorities, Kudła v.

In these circumstances, Article 3 implies an obligation not to return the person in question to that country (see Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, §§ 124-25, ECHR 2008; F.G. v.

Belgium and Greece, cited above, § 286). The Court’s assessment of the existence of a real risk must necessarily be a rigorous one (see, for example, F.G. v.

Sweden, cited above, § 125). However, the Court acknowledges that, owing to the special situation in which asylum-seekers often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in support thereof (ibid., § 113). That assessment must focus on the foreseeable consequences of the applicant’s return to the country of destination, in the light of the general situation there and of his or her personal circumstances (see Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, 30 October 1991, § 108, Series A no. 215)."

The Government submitted that the applicants did not raise any claims in that respect and – in consequence – could not be considered asylum-seekers. The Court attaches more weight to the applicants’ version of the events at the border because it is corroborated by a large number of accounts collected from other witnesses by the national human rights institutions (in particular by the Children’s Ombudsman – see paragraphs 109-14 above). The reports by those bodies indicate the existence of a systemic practice of misrepresenting the statements given by asylum-seekers in the official notes drafted by the officers of the Border Guard serving at the border checkpoints between Poland and Belarus. Moreover, the irregularities in the procedure concerning the questioning of foreigners arriving at the Polish-Belarusian border at the relevant time, including the lack of a proper investigation into the reasons for which they sought entry into Poland, were confirmed by judgments of the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraphs 76-77 above)."

Moreover, the applicants’ version of events in this respect is also supported by the fact that they made numerous attempts to cross the border and sought representation by Polish and Belarusian lawyers, who assisted them with drafting their statements, and who – in the case of the applicants in cases nos. 40503/17 and 43643/17 – on one occasion were present at the border in order to provide representation to the applicants, but were not allowed to meet with them (see paragraphs 11 and 54 above)."

Furthermore, on 14 and 30 June and 4 July 2017 respectively, the Court (the duty judge) informed the Government that in the light of the fact that those documents had been transferred to the Government, it considered that the applicants had lodged requests for international protection (see paragraphs 21, 37 and 61 above). Information about the applicants’ claims was also subsequently submitted by electronic means directly to the Border Guard by the applicants’ representatives (see paragraphs 23, 35 and 64 above).

They also raised arguments concerning the reasons for not considering Belarus to be a safe third country for them and why, in their opinion, returning them to Belarus would put them at risk of “chain refoulement ”.

The assessment of those claims should have been carried out by the Polish authorities acting in compliance with their procedural obligations under Article 3 of the Convention. Moreover, the Polish State was under an obligation to ensure the applicants’ safety, in particular by allowing them to remain within Polish jurisdiction until such time as their claims had been properly reviewed by a competent domestic authority. Taking into account the absolute nature of the right guaranteed under Article 3, the scope of that obligation was not dependent on whether the applicants had been carrying documents authorising them to cross the Polish border or whether they had been legally admitted to Polish territory on other grounds."

Firstly, the Government reiterated that as the applicants had not had valid visas to enter Poland they had been directed to the second line of border control, at which individual interviews had been carried out in a language understood by the applicants. Those interviews had been aimed at obtaining full knowledge of the reasons for which the applicants had arrived at the border without the necessary documents. Each adult applicant had been interviewed separately; the minor applicants had not been interviewed – instead, the decisions issued in respect of their parents had also applied to them. Secondly, the Government submitted that each interview had been recorded in the form of an official note detailing the reasons given by each of the applicants for seeking entry into Poland and – if necessary – any other circumstances in respect of their cases. Thirdly, the Government indicated that the decisions denying entry had been prepared as separate documents in respect of each of the adult applicants (that is to say, on an individual basis) after a careful examination of his or her respective situation. All the applicants had been presented with the decisions. In some cases the applicants had refused to sign the respective decision and accept a copy thereof. Fourthly, the Government emphasised the fact that the number of attempts a foreigner had made to cross the border did not influence the decisions taken by the border guards."

According to the Court’s case-law, collective expulsion is to be understood as “any measure compelling aliens, as a group, to leave a country, except where such a measure is taken on the basis of a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual alien of the group” (see Sultani v. France, no. 45223/05, § 81, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV (extracts), and Georgia v. Russia (I) [GC], no. 13255/07, § 167, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). This does not mean, however, that where the latter condition is satisfied the background to the execution of an expulsion order plays no further role in determining whether there has been compliance with Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 (see Čonka, § 59, and Khlaifia and Others, § 237, both cited above)."

With regard to the scope of the application of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4, the Court notes that the wording of this provision, unlike Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 7, does not refer to the legal situation of the persons concerned. Moreover, it can be seen from the commentary on the draft of Protocol No. 4 that, according to the Committee of Experts, the aliens to whom Article 4 refers are not only those lawfully residing within a State’s territory, but also “all those who have no actual right to nationality in a State, whether they are merely passing through a country or reside or are domiciled in it, whether they are refugees or entered the country on their own initiative, or whether they are stateless or possess another nationality” (see Article 4 of the Committee’s final draft, p. 505, § 34; see also Georgia v.

Russia (I), § 170, both cited above). The Court has also applied Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 to persons who were intercepted on the high seas while trying to reach the territory of a respondent State and were stopped and returned to the originating State (see Hirsi Jamaa and Others, cited above, § 182), as well as to persons who were apprehended in an attempt to cross a national border by land and were immediately removed from a State’s territory by border guards (see N.D. and N.T. v.

In order to determine whether there has been a sufficiently individualised examination, it is necessary to consider the circumstances of each such case and to verify whether a decision to return a foreigner took into consideration the specific situation of the individuals concerned (see Hirsi Jamaa and Others, cited above, § 183).

Cyprus, §§ 246 and 254, and Khlaifia and Others, § 239, both cited above). In the past, when assessing the collective nature of expulsion, the Court has taken into consideration certain factors such as the fact that the decisions concerning the return of the applicants made no reference to their asylum request (even though the asylum procedure had not yet been completed), that the actions aimed at the return of foreigners had taken place in conditions that made it very difficult for the applicants to contact a lawyer, and that the relevant political bodies had announced that there would be operations of that kind (see Čonka, cited above, §§ 60 ‑ 63).

The Court has held, in particular, that a lack of active cooperation on the part of applicants with the available procedure for conducting an individual examination of their circumstances or recourse to unauthorised and clearly disruptive means of attempting to enter the State’s territory despite the existence of a genuine and effective access to means of legal entry might prompt the Court to find that the Government cannot be held responsible for the fact that the applicants’ circumstances were not individually examined (see N.D. and N.T. v.

In this context, the Court notes that in the case of Hirsi Jamaa and Others it held that Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 applied to migrants intercepted by the authorities of a State on the high seas and their removal to their countries of transit or origin (cited above, § 180). Given that the prohibition on the collective expulsion of aliens expressed in that provision was held to be applicable in respect of the actions of a State, the effect of which was to prevent migrants from reaching the borders of that State, then it is even more evident that it applies to a situation in which the aliens present themselves at a land border and are returned from there to the neighbouring country (see also N.D. and N.T. v.

In this context the Court notes the Government’s argument that each time the applicants presented themselves at the Polish border, they were interviewed by the officers of the Border Guard and received individual decisions concerning the refusal to allow them entry into Poland. However, the Court has already indicated that it considers that during this procedure the applicants’ statements concerning their wish to apply for international protection were disregarded (see paragraph 174 above) and that even though individual decisions were issued with respect to each applicant, they did not properly reflect the reasons given by the applicants to justify their fear of persecution. The Court also points to the fact that the applicants were not allowed to consult lawyers and were denied access to them even when – in respect of the applicants in cases nos. 40503/17 and 43643/17 – their lawyers were at the border checkpoint and demanded to be allowed to meet with their clients (see paragraphs 11 and 54 above)."

They attempted to cross the border in a legal manner, using an official checkpoint and subjecting themselves to border checks as required by the relevant law. Hence, the fact that the State refused to entertain their arguments concerning the justification for their applications for international protection cannot be attributed to their own conduct (compare N.D. and N.T. v.

Those reports noted a consistent practice of: holding very brief interviews, during which the foreigners’ statements concerning the justification for their seeking international protection were disregarded; emphasis being placed on the arguments that allowed them to be categorised as economic migrants; and misrepresenting the statements made by the foreigners in very brief official notes, which constituted the sole basis for issuing refusal-of-entry decisions and returning them to Belarus, even in the event that the foreigners in question had made it clear that they wished to apply for international protection in Poland (see paragraphs 98-114 above)."

In most such cases, the applicants face a genuine threat to life and limb, with the ensuing real risk of grave, irreversible harm, in breach of the core provisions of the Convention. The vital role played by interim measures in the Convention system not only underpins their binding legal effect on the States concerned, as upheld by the established case-law, but also commands that the utmost importance be attached to the question of the States Parties’ compliance with the Court’s indications in that regard. Any laxity on this question would unacceptably weaken the protection of the core rights in the Convention and would not be compatible with its values and spirit (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, § 88, Series A no. 161; Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, §§ 100 and 125; and Amirov, cited above, § 67)."

Furthermore, the Court would stress that it follows from the very nature of interim measures that a decision on whether they should be indicated in a given case will often have to be made within a very short space of time, with a view to preventing imminent potential harm from being done. Consequently, the full facts of the case will often remain undetermined until the Court’s judgment on the merits of the complaint to which the measure is related. It is precisely for the purpose of preserving the Court’s ability to render such a judgment after an effective examination of the complaint that such measures are indicated. Until that time, it may be unavoidable for the Court to indicate interim measures on the basis of facts which, despite making a prima facie case in favour of such measures, are subsequently added to or challenged to the point of calling into question the measures’ justification (see Paladi, cited above, § 89)."

Consequently, it is not open to a Contracting State to substitute its own judgment for that of the Court in verifying whether or not there existed a real risk of immediate and irreparable damage to an applicant at the time when the interim measure was indicated. It is for the Court to verify compliance with the interim measure, while a State which considers that it is in possession of material capable of convincing the Court to annul the interim measure should inform the Court accordingly (see, mutatis mutandis, Tanrıkulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, § 131, ECHR 1999-IV, and Paladi, cited above, § 90). At the same time a High Contracting Party may lodge at any time a request to lift an interim measure."

The Court will therefore examine whether the respondent State complied with the letter and the spirit of the interim measure indicated to it. Article 34 will be breached if the authorities of a Contracting State fail to take all steps that could reasonably have been taken in order to comply with the measure indicated by the Court. It is for the Government to demonstrate to the Court that the interim measure was complied with (or, exceptionally, that there was an objective impediment which prevented compliance), and that the Government took all reasonable steps to remove that impediment and to keep the Court informed about the situation. In examining a complaint under Article 34 concerning the alleged failure of a Contracting State to comply with an interim measure, the Court will not, however, re ‑ examine whether its decision to apply that interim measure was correct (see, mutatis mutandis, Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, §§ 228 ‑ 32, 22 December 2008, and Paladi, cited above, §§ 91-92).",

In cases nos. 40503/17 and 42902/17, the Court furthermore specified that the measures in question should be interpreted in such a way that – when the applicants presented themselves at a Polish border checkpoint – their applications for asylum should be received and registered by the Border Guard and forwarded for examination by the relevant authorities; the Court moreover specified that, pending examination of their asylum applications, the applicants should not be sent back to Belarus. Despite the indication of the interim measures, the applicants were turned away to Belarus not only on the days on which the measures were indicated (see paragraphs 16, 33 and 59 above) but also at least a few times thereafter (see paragraphs 22, 34, 38 and 62 above). It should be noted that on a number of those occasions the applicants were carrying with them copies of letters informing them of the indication of an interim measure in respect of their cases and that their representatives had sent copies of those letters directly to the Border Guard."

The Government also disputed the legitimacy of interim measures being indicated in respect of the present cases; they submitted that there had not been a sufficient factual basis for them and that the applicants had abused this tool in order to force the Border Guard to admit them to Poland. The Court would point out that the Government have continued to rely on those arguments even after the Court rejected them by dismissing the Government’s applications for the measures to be lifted (see paragraphs 21, 37 and 61 above)."

As for the objection concerning its competence ratione temporis, the Court reiterates that the procedural obligation to carry out an effective and prompt investigation under Article 2 has evolved into a separate and autonomous duty. Although it is triggered by acts concerning the substantive aspects of Article 2, it can give rise to a finding of a separate and independent “interference”. In this sense it can be considered to be a detachable obligation, arising out of Article 2 and capable of binding the State, even when the substantive act took place before the critical date (see Šilih, cited above, § 159, and Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, § 138, 18 September 2009)."

However, having regard to the principle of legal certainty, the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction as regards compliance with the procedural obligation of Article 2 in respect of deaths that occur before the critical date is not open-ended. Firstly, it is clear that where the death occurred before the critical date, only procedural acts and/or omissions occurring after that date can fall within the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction. Secondly, there must exist a genuine connection between the death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State for the procedural obligations imposed by Article 2 to come into effect. Thus a significant proportion of the procedural steps required by this provision – which include not only an effective investigation into the death of the person concerned, but also the institution of appropriate proceedings for the purposes of determining the cause of death and holding those responsible to account – will have been, or ought to have been, carried out after the critical date. However, the Court would not exclude that in certain circumstances the connection could also be based on the need to ensure that the guarantees and underlying values of the Convention are protected in a real and effective manner ( Šilih, cited above, §§ 161-163)."

Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, § 148, ECHR 2013)."

The authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death, or identify the person or people responsible, will risk falling foul of this standard.

Of course, the act committed by R.S. has never been approved by the authorities of Azerbaijan, for that act he was arrested by the Hungarian court, and we believe that this corresponds to committed act. But there is one question that Azerbaijani society has discussed for several years.... At that time, the Hungarian court treated R.S. too cruelly, and imposed an inadequate punishment on him, under heavy pressure from Armenians, including the pressure of the representatives of some pro-Armenian diaspora, and foreign organizations... For a crime committed by R.S., European countries, Azerbaijan, and Armenia itself and others impose a punishment of fifteen years, and after serving half the sentence, a prisoner, falling under an amnesty for good behaviour, is released. Therefore punishment passed by Hungarian court for eight and a half years has continuously been assessed by Azerbaijani people as inadequate decision... The result is obvious, and today, after eight and a half years of serving the sentence, the Azerbaijani society regards R.S.’ release as a just act. In fact, the President of Azerbaijan pardoned R.S. using both the opinion formed during that time, and possibility, created by the Azerbaijani law as well... Azerbaijani authorities and socio-political circles do not assess the act committed by R.S. as heroic... We believe that R.S. had to answer for what he did, and he did answer.

There ICJ drew a clear distinction between the legal situation immediately following the seizure of the United States embassy and its personnel by the militants, and that created by a decree of the Iranian State which expressly approved and maintained the situation.",

The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation created by the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its diplomatic and consular staff as hostages. The approval given to these facts by the Ayatollah Khomeini and other organs of the Iranian State, and the decision to perpetuate them, translated continuing occupation of the Embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of that State.’",
                "(5) As regards State practice, the capture and subsequent trial in Israel of Adolf Eichmann may provide an example of the subsequent adoption of private conduct by a State. On 10 May 1960, Eichmann was captured by a group of Israelis in Buenos Aires. He was held in captivity in Buenos Aires in a private home for some weeks before being taken by air to Israel. Argentina later charged the Israeli Government with complicity in Eichmann’s capture, a charge neither admitted nor denied by Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir, during the discussion in the Security Council of the complaint. She referred to Eichmann’s captors as a ‘volunteer group’. Security Council resolution 138 (1960) of 23 June 1960 implied a finding that the Israeli Government was at least aware of, and consented to, the successful plan to capture Eichmann in Argentina. It may be that Eichmann’s captors were ‘in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of’ Israel, in which case their conduct was more properly attributed to the State under article 8. But where there are doubts about whether certain conduct falls within article 8, these may be resolved by the subsequent adoption of the conduct in question by the State.",
                "(6) The phrase ‘acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own’ is intended to distinguish cases of acknowledgement and adoption from cases of mere support or endorsement. ICJ in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case used phrases such as ‘approval’, ‘endorsement’, ‘the seal of official governmental approval’ and ‘the decision to perpetuate [the situation]’. These were sufficient in the context of that case, but as a general matter, conduct will not be attributable to a State under article 11 where a State merely acknowledges the factual existence of conduct or expresses its verbal approval of it. In international controversies, States often take positions which amount to ‘approval’ or ‘endorsement’ of conduct in some general sense but do not involve any assumption of responsibility. The language of ‘adoption’, on the other hand, carries with it the idea that the conduct is acknowledged by the State as, in effect, its own conduct. Indeed, provided the State’s intention to accept responsibility for otherwise non-attributable conduct is clearly indicated, article 11 may cover cases where a State has accepted responsibility for conduct of which it did not approve, which it had sought to prevent and which it deeply regretted. However such acceptance may be phrased in the particular case, the term ‘acknowledges and adopts’ in article 11 makes it clear that what is required is something more than a general acknowledgement of a factual situation, but rather that the State identifies the conduct in question and makes it its own.",
                "(8) The phrase ‘if and to the extent that’ is intended to convey a number of ideas. First, the conduct of, in particular, private persons, groups or entities is not attributable to the State unless under some other article of chapter II or unless it has been acknowledged and adopted by the State. Secondly, a State might acknowledge and adopt conduct only to a certain extent. In other words, a State may elect to acknowledge and adopt only some of the conduct in question. Thirdly, the act of acknowledgment and adoption, whether it takes the form of words or conduct, must be clear and unequivocal.",
                "(9) The conditions of acknowledgement and adoption are cumulative, as indicated by the word ‘and’. The order of the two conditions indicates the normal sequence of events in cases in which article 11 is relied on. Acknowledgement and adoption of conduct by a State might be express (as for example in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case), or it might be inferred from the conduct of the State in question.”"

The Court does not see itself required to decide at this stage whether the ILC’s Articles dealing with attribution, apart from Articles 4 and 8, express present customary international law, it being clear that none of them apply in this case. The acts constituting genocide were not committed by persons or entities which, while not being organs of the FRY, were empowered by it to exercise elements of the governmental authority (Art. 5), nor by organs placed at the Respondent’s disposal by another State (Art. 6), nor by persons in fact exercising elements of the governmental authority in the absence or default of the official authorities of the Respondent (Art. 9); finally, the Respondent has not acknowledged and adopted the conduct of the perpetrators of the acts of genocide as its own (Art. 11).",

In determining the question as to whether the illegal conduct of the individuals can somehow be attributed to SFOR, the Trial Chamber refers to the principles laid down in the Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (‘ILC’) on the issue of ‘Responsibilities of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’. These Draft Articles were adopted by the ILC at its fifty-third session in 2001. The Trial Chamber is however aware of the fact that any use of this source should be made with caution. The Draft Articles were prepared by the International Law Commission and are still subject to debate amongst States. They do not have the status of treaty law and are not binding on States. Furthermore, as can be deduced from its title, the Draft Articles are primarily directed at the responsibilities of States and not at those of international organisations or entities.

As indicated in Article I of Annex 1-A to the Dayton Agreement, IFOR (SFOR) is a multinational military force. It ‘may be composed of ground, air and maritime units from NATO and non-NATO nations’ and ‘will operate under the authority and subject to the direction and political control of the North Atlantic Council.’ For the purposes of deciding upon the motions pending in the present case, the Chamber does not deem it necessary to determine the exact legal status of SFOR under international law. Purely as general legal guidance, it will use the principles laid down in the Draft Articles insofar as they may be helpful for determining the issue at hand.",
                "64. The Trial Chamber observes that both Parties use the same and similar criteria of ‘acknowledgement’, ‘adoption’, ‘recognition’, ‘approval’ and ‘ratification’, as used by the ILC. The question is therefore whether on the basis of the assumed facts SFOR can be considered to have ‘acknowledged and adopted’ the conduct undertaken by the individuals ‘as its own’. It needs to be re-emphasised in this context that it cannot be deduced from the assumed facts that SFOR was in any way, directly or indirectly, involved in the actual apprehension of the accused in the FRY or in the transfer of the accused into the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Nor has it in any way been argued or suggested that SFOR instructed, directed or controlled such acts. What can be concluded from the assumed facts is merely that the Accused was handed over to an SFOR unit after having been arrested in the FRY by unknown individuals and brought into the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. From the perspective of SFOR, the Accused had come into contact with SFOR in the execution of their assigned task. In accordance with their mandate and in light of Article 29 of the Statute and Rule 59 bis, they were obliged to inform the Prosecution and to hand him over to its representatives. From these facts, the Trial Chamber can readily conclude that there was no collusion or official involvement by SFOR in the alleged illegal acts.”"

In the light of the above-mentioned case-law it appears that if the investigative or judicial authorities of a Contracting State institute their own criminal investigation or proceedings concerning a death which has occurred outside the jurisdiction of that State, by virtue of their domestic law ..., the institution of that investigation or those proceedings is sufficient to establish a jurisdictional link for the purposes of Article 1 between that State and the victim’s relatives who later bring proceedings before the Court ...",

Where no investigation or proceedings have been instituted in a Contracting State, according to its domestic law, in respect of a death which has occurred outside its jurisdiction, the Court will have to determine whether a jurisdictional link can, in any event, be established for the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 to come into effect in respect of that State. Although the procedural obligation under Article 2 will in principle only be triggered for the Contracting State under whose jurisdiction the deceased was to be found at the time of death, ‘special features’ in a given case will justify departure from this approach, according to the principles developed in Rantsev, §§ 243-44.

Romania (dec.), no. 36659/04, 1 June 2010; see also Korolev v. Russia (dec.), no. 25551/05, ECHR 2010-V). Inspired by the general principle of de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court (see Ladygin v. Russia (dec.), no. 35365/05, 30 August 2011). The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case (see Gagliano Giorgi, cited above, § 55). The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant’s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev, cited above, and Eon v. France, no. 26118/10, § 34, 14 March 2013). However, the applicant’s subjective perception alone cannot suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, inter alia, Mura, cited above, §§ 21 and 24)."

That threshold is not limited to the mere “approval” and “endorsement” of the act in question, which, in the words of the ILC Commentary, “do not involve any assumption of responsibility” (ibid.) – Article 11 of the Draft Articles explicitly and categorically requires the “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of that act (see paragraph 34 above). The differentiation between the mere “approval” and “endorsement” of the act in question – which, on the one hand, in and of themselves do not bring about the responsibility of a respective State for that act, and, on the other hand, its “acknowledgment” and “adoption” as a threshold that must be reached for that responsibility to be invoked, has also been endorsed in the case-law of the ICTY (see paragraph 37 above). Moreover, the two conditions – “acknowledgment” and “adoption” – are cumulative, as stems directly from the wording of Article 11 of the Draft Articles, and, in addition, require that the State “acknowledges” and “adopts” the act “as its own”, which again demonstrates the very stringent requirements set by that provision. The Court furthermore observes that, according to the ILC Commentary, such an act of “acknowledgment” and “adoption” must, importantly, be “clear and unequivocal”, whether it takes the form of words or conduct (see paragraph 35 above)."

In the context of the present case, in order to assuredly establish that there has been a violation by the State of Azerbaijan of Article 2 of the Convention under its substantive limb, those cumulative conditions and the threshold that has to be reached under Article 11 of the Draft Articles require that it be convincingly demonstrated that, by their actions, the Azerbaijani authorities not only “approved” and “endorsed” the impugned acts (R.S. killing G.M. and preparing to kill the first applicant), but also “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” these acts “as their own” within the meaning of those terms, as they are interpreted and applied under international law. In other words, they require that the Azerbaijani authorities “acknowledge” and “adopt” them as acts perpetrated by the State of Azerbaijan – thus directly and categorically assuming responsibility for the killing of G.M. and the preparations for the murder of the first applicant."

In this context, the Court is mindful of the evolution of international law on State responsibility and is conscious that the case-law on this particular issue is scarce and that further developments may therefore be expected in this area (see, mutatis mutandis, Jones and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 34356/06 and 40528/06, § 213, 14 January 2014). The Court reiterates that, according to the ICTY, the Draft Articles are “still subject to debate amongst States”, “do not have the status of treaty law” and are “not binding on States”, and that “any use of this source should be made with caution” (see paragraph 37 above). Nevertheless, the Court’s assessment in the present case must be limited to the existing rules of international law, as elaborated in the ILC Commentary and applied by international tribunals (see paragraphs 35-37 above)."

The Court reiterates the circumstances of the present case in which the State of Azerbaijan took measures in the form of pardoning R.S., releasing him immediately upon his arrival, awarding him eight years’ salary arrears, providing him with a flat for his own use and promoting him within the military. Each of those measures certainly constituted, individually and cumulatively, the subsequent “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s acts by various institutions and the highest officials of the State, and that “approval” and “endorsement” strongly resonated with the feelings of Azerbaijani society at large. In particular, such measures as awarding R.S eight years’ salary arrears or promoting him within the military are indications of not only the State’s explicit, clear and unequivocal “endorsement” of the crimes committed by him, but also of their appreciation of R.S.’s conduct at the time when he was in the military service of the State of Azerbaijan."

The applicants argued that such glorifying statements – including those contained in the special section dedicated to R.S. on the official webpage of the President of Azerbaijan (see paragraph 25 above) – amounted to Azerbaijan’s “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of R.S.’s crimes as its own. The Court agrees that many of the statements in question are particularly disturbing in that they glorify R.S. as a national hero for the gruesome crimes that he committed."

In sum, the Court considers it clear that, viewing the actions of the Azerbaijani Government as a whole, including the decision to pardon R.S. and then to promote him to the rank of major during the course of a public ceremony and to award him eight years of salary arrears and the use of a flat (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above), Azerbaijan must be considered to have demonstrated its “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s conduct."
            ],
            [
                "118. The Court now turns to the assessment of the impugned measures from the standpoint of whether they constituted not the mere “approval” and “endorsement” by the State of Azerbaijan of the criminal acts committed by R.S., but also their “acknowledgment” and “adoption” in the sense of Article 11 of the Draft Articles. Although not decisive for the Court’s assessment, it is of importance that R.S.’s criminal acts were purely private acts of a criminal nature, and not related, whether directly or indirectly, with any State action at the time when they were committed (see paragraph 111 above). It has not escaped the Court’s attention that the impugned measures – in particular the granting of salary arrears and promoting R.S. in rank within the military – were undertaken by the State of Azerbaijan. That being so, the legal question before the Court in its examination of the applicants’ complaints under the substantive limb of Article 2 remains whether the very fact that the impugned measures were taken by the State of Azerbaijan allows for their categorisation – within the context of the factual circumstances, as submitted and argued by the parties, and in accordance with the standards of international law as it stood at the material time and stands today (see paragraphs 114-116 above) – in such a manner as to justify the Court in concluding that the respective State not only manifestly demonstrated its “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s acts, but in fact “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” them as acts not just, strictly speaking, perpetrated by R.S., but in fact as having been perpetrated by the State itself. Having most thoroughly examined the nature and scope of the impugned measures within the overall context in which they were taken and in the light of international law, the Court is unable to conclusively find that such “clear and unequivocal” “acknowledgement” and “adoption” indeed took place. In substance those measures can be interpreted not so much as the State’s “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of R.S.’s criminal acts, as such, but rather as having the purpose of publicly addressing, recognising and remedying R.S.’s adverse personal, professional and financial situation, which the authorities of Azerbaijan perceived, unjustifiably in the Court’s view, as being the consequence of the allegedly flawed criminal proceedings in Hungary (see paragraph 106 above). It follows that, although the Court considers it beyond any doubt that by their actions various institutions and highest officials of the State of Azerbaijan “approved” and “endorsed” the criminal acts of R.S., applying the very high threshold set by Article 11 of the Draft Articles – as interpreted and applied by international tribunals, in particular the ICJ and the ICTY (see paragraphs 36-37 above) – the Court cannot but conclude that, on the facts of the case, as presented by the applicants, it has not been convincingly demonstrated that the State of Azerbaijan “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” “as its own” R.S.’s deplorable acts, thus assuming, as such, responsibility for his actual killing of G.M. and the preparations for the murder of the first applicant. The Court places emphasis on the fact that this assessment is undertaken on the basis of the very stringent standards set out by the existing rules of international law, as they stood at the material time and stand today, from which the Court sees no reason or possibility to depart in the present case. Therefore, contrary to what was argued by the applicants, the present case cannot be considered fully comparable to the ICJ’s United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case."

                "119. Lastly, the applicants claimed that Azerbaijan had failed to properly regulate military service requirements and in particular had failed to establish R.S.’s mental state prior to sending him into an environment in which he would inevitably be called upon to interact with representatives of the Armenian military. Admittedly, in cases where crimes have been committed by police officers acting outside of their official duties, the Court has already held that the member States of the Council of Europe are expected to set high professional standards within their law-enforcement systems and ensure that the persons serving in these systems meet the requisite criteria (see Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, § 290; and Gorovenky and Bugara v. Ukraine, nos. 36146/05 and 42418/05, § 38, 12 January 2012). The Court accepts that similar standards may apply to members of the armed forces. However, having regard to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court is not convinced that the private acts of R.S. could have been foreseen by his commanding officers or should be held imputable to the Azerbaijani State as a whole, just because that individual happened to be its agent. Indeed, the impugned acts were so flagrantly abusive and so far removed from R.S.’s official status as a military officer that, on the facts of the case, his most serious criminal behaviour cannot engage the State’s substantive international responsibility. What is more, nothing in the case file suggests that the procedure in Azerbaijan for the recruitment of members of the armed forces and the monitoring of their compliance with professional standards at the time that R.S. was sent on his mission – including their continued mental fitness to serve – had been inadequate."

Turkey, no. 42942/02, § 61, 8 April 2008). The applicants emphasised that the issues of deterrence and the prevention and suppression of offences were inextricably linked to the question of punishment, all of which were highly relevant to the case, given its very high profile, both nationally and internationally. Such a profile meant that the Azerbaijani authorities’ failure to act in an appropriate way to ensure that others were deterred from committing similar offences had magnified the effects of the case.

In that case the Commission had held that “the failure of an individual criminal to serve an adequate term may give rise to an international liability even where the original sentence is adequate.” Thus, in certain circumstances pardons and amnesties had been considered a form of denial of justice under international law."

The effect of the exercise of the President’s discretion to issue a pardon had therefore been “to lessen the consequences of a serious criminal act ... rather than to show that such acts could in no way be tolerated” (see Ali and Ayşe Duran, cited above, § 68). Rather than being promoted and receiving other benefits, R.S. should have been dismissed from the military (see Abdülsamet Yaman, cited above, § 55).

In order to be “adequate” the investigation must be capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances and of identifying and – if appropriate – punishing those responsible (ibid., §§ 240, 243)."

Having served over eight years of his prison term there, R.S. was transferred to Azerbaijan in order to continue serving his prison sentence in his home country. However, upon his return, R.S. was released on the basis of a pardon by the Azerbaijani President. This was followed by granting him a flat in Baku, salary arrears for the time he spent in prison in Hungary as well a promotion in military rank at a public ceremony (see paragraph 21 above) and accompanied by strong support and approval from a number of Azerbaijani public figures and high ranking officials (see paragraph 25 above)."

Indeed, pursuant to the preamble to the Transfer Convention, its main aims are to promote justice and the social rehabilitation of sentenced persons. Moreover, in its 2014 resolution, the Parliamentary Assembly concluded that, by granting R.S. a pardon, Azerbaijan had violated the principle of good faith and the rule of law (see paragraph 41 above).

In the Court’s opinion, in view of the extremely tense political situation between the two countries, the authorities should have been all the more cautious, given that the victims of the crimes in the present case were of Armenian origin (see in this sense the European Parliament’s resolution cited at paragraph 42 above)."

First of all, in the absence of any proof other than an affidavit lodged by R.S.’s defence lawyer (see paragraph 13 above), it is difficult to seriously question the fairness of criminal proceedings conducted in another Council of Europe Member State. Indeed, R.S. was afforded a criminal trial in Hungary before courts at two judicial instances, which delivered well-reasoned decisions. In particular, the Hungarian courts explained that R.S. himself had initially asked for an interpreter from Hungarian into Russian and that – once he had complained about not understanding that language to the necessary degree – they had conducted an in-depth analysis of the disadvantage at which this may have put him in the proceedings against him. In the end, they concluded that it was proven that R.S. had a good command of Russian and that, in any event, at his request he had subsequently been provided with interpreters and translations of documents into his native language (see paragraph 15 above)."

In any event, there is insufficient evidence that any procedural omission – if indeed there had been one – was not subsequently offset by procedural safeguards or that such an omission rendered the entire proceedings against him unfair (see, mutatis mutandis, Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, § 262, ECHR 2016).

In particular, the Court is satisfied that R.S.’s mental capacities had been thoroughly assessed during his trial in Hungary by a number of medical experts and that he was found to have been mentally able to understand the dangers and consequences of his actions at the time of the offences (see paragraph 15 above). The subsequent decision by the Azerbaijani authorities to promote R.S. to a higher military rank would clearly suggest that he was deemed fit to continue to serve in the military and therefore did not suffer from a serious mental condition."

The Azerbaijani Government did not provide any explanation as to why R.S. had been granted those benefits, nor did they indicate the legal basis for such actions apart from citing the applicable regulation on military promotion (see paragraph 30 above).

Although the reply of the Azerbaijani authorities was admittedly incomplete and worded in general terms – which in turn could have aroused suspicion as to the manner of the execution of R.S.’s prison sentence and prompted them to further action, as concluded by the Hungarian Commissioner for Fundamental Rights (see paragraph 24 above) – no tangible evidence has been adduced before the Court by the parties in the present case to show that the Hungarian authorities unequivocally were or should have been aware that R.S. would be released upon his return to Azerbaijan. Indeed, bearing in mind particularly the time already served by R.S. in a Hungarian prison, the Court does not see how the competent Hungarian bodies could have done anything more than respect the procedure and the spirit of the Transfer Convention and proceed on the assumption that another Council of Europe member State would act in good faith."

Under Articles 21 and 23 of the Vienna Convention, a reservation established with regard to another party modified those provisions to the same extent for that other party in its relations with the State expressing the reservation question, and any claim to the contrary would run against the fundamental principle of the sovereign equality of States. Azerbaijan could not, therefore, avoid the legal effects of its own reservation. Its decision regarding the pardon of R.S. should have been agreed with the competent authorities of Hungary. If the Court accepted that the declaration of Azerbaijan constituted an interpretative declaration and not a reservation, it would show the understanding of the Republic of Azerbaijan to be that the correct interpretation of Article 12 implied that the consent of the sentencing State must be sought. Azerbaijan had not acted in good faith."

Discrimination on account of, inter alia, a person’s ethnic origin is a form of racial discrimination. Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy’s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment ( see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 145, and Timishev v. Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, § 56, ECHR 2005). The Court has also held that no difference in treatment which is based exclusively or to a decisive extent on a person’s ethnic origin is capable of being objectively justified in a contemporary democratic society built on the principles of pluralism and respect for different cultures (see Timishev, cited above, § 58)."

Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see Nachova, cited above, § 147)."

The ethnic bias in respect of R.S.’s crimes was thus fully investigated and highlighted by the Hungarian courts, and the Court sees no reasons to question those conclusions. Nor did the applicants in the present case complain of a failure to investigate racist motives for R.S.’s crimes. In fact, the applicants submitted under Article 14 of the Convention that the Armenian ethnic origin of the victims had not only been the main reason for the said crimes, but also for the various subsequent actions of the Azerbaijani authorities, including the pardoning and glorification of the perpetrator. In that respect, the applicants’ discrimination complaint differs significantly from complaints typically raised under the procedural limb of Articles 2 or 3 in other cases concerning discriminatory violence (compare with, among many other authorities, Lakatošová and Lakatoš v. Slovakia, no. 655/16, § 65, 11 December 2018; Ciorcan and Others v. Romania, nos. 29414/09 and 44841/09, § 152, 27 January 2015; and Angelova and Iliev, cited above, § 107)."

Faced with the applicants’ complaint of a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 2, as formulated, the Court’s task is to establish whether or not the Armenian ethnic origin of R.S.’s victims and the nature of his crimes played a role in the measures taken by the Azerbaijani authorities following his return to Azerbaijan."

Firstly, R.S. was pardoned immediately upon his return to Azerbaijan; there is nothing in the case file to indicate that a formal request to this end was ever made, and nor is there any indication that there ensued any kind of reflection process or legal procedure for the pardon (see paragraph 29 above). Secondly, R.S. was not only reinstated to his post in the military, he was also promoted in military rank in a public ceremony shortly after his return to Azerbaijan. Moreover, he received a flat in Baku, together with salary arrears in respect of the entire period that he had spent in prison (even though the latter measure was provided under the domestic law only in respect of acquitted persons – see paragraph 28 above). As already stated, the Government did not indicate a domestic legal basis for all of those additional measures (see paragraph 169 above), which were understandably perceived as constituting rewards for R.S.’s actions (see paragraph 172 above).

A vast number of those letters were still viewable on that webpage, all of them thanking the President for pardoning R.S. on the basis that they agreed with his having killed his Armenian victim. While it is true that the President himself had never posted anything in that section, its mere existence and the reason therefor pointed to the idea that R.S. had been pardoned because his attack had been of an ethnic nature and that the granting of the pardon could be perceived as an important step in the process of legitimising and glorifying R.S.’s actions."

The Court is mindful of the difficulty faced by the applicants in proving such bias beyond a reasonable doubt, given that the facts in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the Azerbaijani authorities.

In the Court’s view, the two statements provided by the Azerbaijani Government are therefore not sufficient to refute the overwhelming body of evidence submitted by the applicants indicating that the various measures leading to R.S.’s virtual impunity, coupled with the glorification of his extremely cruel hate crime, had a causal link to the Armenian ethnicity of his victims."

It has not been suggested that the crimes committed by R.S. were committed on orders given by his superiors and nor is there is any evidentiary basis for such a far-reaching conclusion."

In so far as the applicants rely on Article 11 of the Draft Articles and claim that Azerbaijan subsequently “acknowledged” and “adopted” R.S.’s conduct as its own, and assuming that in the present case the Court were to interpret the substantive limb of Article 2 of the Convention in the light of Article 11 of the Draft Articles (see paragraph 114 below), it notes at the outset that the current standard under international law – which stems from the latter provision, as elaborated in the ILC Commentary (see paragraph 35 above) – sets a very high threshold for State responsibility for an act otherwise non-attributable to a State at the time of its commission. That threshold is not limited to the mere “approval” and “endorsement” of the act in question, which, in the words of the ILC Commentary, “do not involve any assumption of responsibility” (ibid.) – Article 11 of the Draft Articles explicitly and categorically requires the “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of that act (see paragraph 34 above). The differentiation between the mere “approval” and “endorsement” of the act in question – which, on the one hand, in and of themselves do not bring about the responsibility of a respective State for that act, and, on the other hand, its “acknowledgment” and “adoption” as a threshold that must be reached for that responsibility to be invoked, has also been endorsed in the case-law of the ICTY (see paragraph 37 above). Moreover, the two conditions – “acknowledgment” and “adoption” – are cumulative, as stems directly from the wording of Article 11 of the Draft Articles, and, in addition, require that the State “acknowledges” and “adopts” the act “as its own”, which again demonstrates the very stringent requirements set by that provision. The Court furthermore observes that, according to the ILC Commentary, such an act of “acknowledgment” and “adoption” must, importantly, be “clear and unequivocal”, whether it takes the form of words or conduct (see paragraph 35 above)."

In the context of the present case, in order to assuredly establish that there has been a violation by the State of Azerbaijan of Article 2 of the Convention under its substantive limb, those cumulative conditions and the threshold that has to be reached under Article 11 of the Draft Articles require that it be convincingly demonstrated that, by their actions, the Azerbaijani authorities not only “approved” and “endorsed” the impugned acts (R.S. killing G.M. and preparing to kill the first applicant), but also “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” these acts “as their own” within the meaning of those terms, as they are interpreted and applied under international law. In other words, they require that the Azerbaijani authorities “acknowledge” and “adopt” them as acts perpetrated by the State of Azerbaijan – thus directly and categorically assuming responsibility for the killing of G.M. and the preparations for the murder of the first applicant."

In this context, the Court is mindful of the evolution of international law on State responsibility and is conscious that the case-law on this particular issue is scarce and that further developments may therefore be expected in this area (see, mutatis mutandis, Jones and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 34356/06 and 40528/06, § 213, 14 January 2014). The Court reiterates that, according to the ICTY, the Draft Articles are “still subject to debate amongst States”, “do not have the status of treaty law” and are “not binding on States”, and that “any use of this source should be made with caution” (see paragraph 37 above). Nevertheless, the Court’s assessment in the present case must be limited to the existing rules of international law, as elaborated in the ILC Commentary and applied by international tribunals (see paragraphs 35-37 above)."

The Court reiterates the circumstances of the present case in which the State of Azerbaijan took measures in the form of pardoning R.S., releasing him immediately upon his arrival, awarding him eight years’ salary arrears, providing him with a flat for his own use and promoting him within the military. Each of those measures certainly constituted, individually and cumulatively, the subsequent “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s acts by various institutions and the highest officials of the State, and that “approval” and “endorsement” strongly resonated with the feelings of Azerbaijani society at large. In particular, such measures as awarding R.S eight years’ salary arrears or promoting him within the military are indications of not only the State’s explicit, clear and unequivocal “endorsement” of the crimes committed by him, but also of their appreciation of R.S.’s conduct at the time when he was in the military service of the State of Azerbaijan."

The applicants argued that such glorifying statements – including those contained in the special section dedicated to R.S. on the official webpage of the President of Azerbaijan (see paragraph 25 above) – amounted to Azerbaijan’s “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of R.S.’s crimes as its own. The Court agrees that many of the statements in question are particularly disturbing in that they glorify R.S. as a national hero for the gruesome crimes that he committed."

                "117. In sum, the Court considers it clear that, viewing the actions of the Azerbaijani Government as a whole, including the decision to pardon R.S. and then to promote him to the rank of major during the course of a public ceremony and to award him eight years of salary arrears and the use of a flat (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above), Azerbaijan must be considered to have demonstrated its “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s conduct."
            ],
            [
                "118. The Court now turns to the assessment of the impugned measures from the standpoint of whether they constituted not the mere “approval” and “endorsement” by the State of Azerbaijan of the criminal acts committed by R.S., but also their “acknowledgment” and “adoption” in the sense of Article 11 of the Draft Articles. Although not decisive for the Court’s assessment, it is of importance that R.S.’s criminal acts were purely private acts of a criminal nature, and not related, whether directly or indirectly, with any State action at the time when they were committed (see paragraph 111 above). It has not escaped the Court’s attention that the impugned measures – in particular the granting of salary arrears and promoting R.S. in rank within the military – were undertaken by the State of Azerbaijan. That being so, the legal question before the Court in its examination of the applicants’ complaints under the substantive limb of Article 2 remains whether the very fact that the impugned measures were taken by the State of Azerbaijan allows for their categorisation – within the context of the factual circumstances, as submitted and argued by the parties, and in accordance with the standards of international law as it stood at the material time and stands today (see paragraphs 114-116 above) – in such a manner as to justify the Court in concluding that the respective State not only manifestly demonstrated its “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s acts, but in fact “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” them as acts not just, strictly speaking, perpetrated by R.S., but in fact as having been perpetrated by the State itself. Having most thoroughly examined the nature and scope of the impugned measures within the overall context in which they were taken and in the light of international law, the Court is unable to conclusively find that such “clear and unequivocal” “acknowledgement” and “adoption” indeed took place. In substance those measures can be interpreted not so much as the State’s “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of R.S.’s criminal acts, as such, but rather as having the purpose of publicly addressing, recognising and remedying R.S.’s adverse personal, professional and financial situation, which the authorities of Azerbaijan perceived, unjustifiably in the Court’s view, as being the consequence of the allegedly flawed criminal proceedings in Hungary (see paragraph 106 above). It follows that, although the Court considers it beyond any doubt that by their actions various institutions and highest officials of the State of Azerbaijan “approved” and “endorsed” the criminal acts of R.S., applying the very high threshold set by Article 11 of the Draft Articles – as interpreted and applied by international tribunals, in particular the ICJ and the ICTY (see paragraphs 36-37 above) – the Court cannot but conclude that, on the facts of the case, as presented by the applicants, it has not been convincingly demonstrated that the State of Azerbaijan “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” “as its own” R.S.’s deplorable acts, thus assuming, as such, responsibility for his actual killing of G.M. and the preparations for the murder of the first applicant. The Court places emphasis on the fact that this assessment is undertaken on the basis of the very stringent standards set out by the existing rules of international law, as they stood at the material time and stand today, from which the Court sees no reason or possibility to depart in the present case. Therefore, contrary to what was argued by the applicants, the present case cannot be considered fully comparable to the ICJ’s United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case."

            [
                "119. Lastly, the applicants claimed that Azerbaijan had failed to properly regulate military service requirements and in particular had failed to establish R.S.’s mental state prior to sending him into an environment in which he would inevitably be called upon to interact with representatives of the Armenian military. Admittedly, in cases where crimes have been committed by police officers acting outside of their official duties, the Court has already held that the member States of the Council of Europe are expected to set high professional standards within their law-enforcement systems and ensure that the persons serving in these systems meet the requisite criteria (see Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, § 290; and Gorovenky and Bugara v. Ukraine, nos. 36146/05 and 42418/05, § 38, 12 January 2012). The Court accepts that similar standards may apply to members of the armed forces. However, having regard to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court is not convinced that the private acts of R.S. could have been foreseen by his commanding officers or should be held imputable to the Azerbaijani State as a whole, just because that individual happened to be its agent. Indeed, the impugned acts were so flagrantly abusive and so far removed from R.S.’s official status as a military officer that, on the facts of the case, his most serious criminal behaviour cannot engage the State’s substantive international responsibility. What is more, nothing in the case file suggests that the procedure in Azerbaijan for the recruitment of members of the armed forces and the monitoring of their compliance with professional standards at the time that R.S. was sent on his mission – including their continued mental fitness to serve – had been inadequate."

Of course, the act committed by R.S. has never been approved by the authorities of Azerbaijan, for that act he was arrested by the Hungarian court, and we believe that this corresponds to committed act. But there is one question that Azerbaijani society has discussed for several years.... At that time, the Hungarian court treated R.S. too cruelly, and imposed an inadequate punishment on him, under heavy pressure from Armenians, including the pressure of the representatives of some pro-Armenian diaspora, and foreign organizations... For a crime committed by R.S., European countries, Azerbaijan, and Armenia itself and others impose a punishment of fifteen years, and after serving half the sentence, a prisoner, falling under an amnesty for good behaviour, is released. Therefore punishment passed by Hungarian court for eight and a half years has continuously been assessed by Azerbaijani people as inadequate decision... The result is obvious, and today, after eight and a half years of serving the sentence, the Azerbaijani society regards R.S.’ release as a just act. In fact, the President of Azerbaijan pardoned R.S. using both the opinion formed during that time, and possibility, created by the Azerbaijani law as well... Azerbaijani authorities and socio-political circles do not assess the act committed by R.S. as heroic... We believe that R.S. had to answer for what he did, and he did answer.

There ICJ drew a clear distinction between the legal situation immediately following the seizure of the United States embassy and its personnel by the militants, and that created by a decree of the Iranian State which expressly approved and maintained the situation.",

The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation created by the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its diplomatic and consular staff as hostages. The approval given to these facts by the Ayatollah Khomeini and other organs of the Iranian State, and the decision to perpetuate them, translated continuing occupation of the Embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of that State.’",
                "(5) As regards State practice, the capture and subsequent trial in Israel of Adolf Eichmann may provide an example of the subsequent adoption of private conduct by a State. On 10 May 1960, Eichmann was captured by a group of Israelis in Buenos Aires. He was held in captivity in Buenos Aires in a private home for some weeks before being taken by air to Israel. Argentina later charged the Israeli Government with complicity in Eichmann’s capture, a charge neither admitted nor denied by Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir, during the discussion in the Security Council of the complaint. She referred to Eichmann’s captors as a ‘volunteer group’. Security Council resolution 138 (1960) of 23 June 1960 implied a finding that the Israeli Government was at least aware of, and consented to, the successful plan to capture Eichmann in Argentina. It may be that Eichmann’s captors were ‘in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of’ Israel, in which case their conduct was more properly attributed to the State under article 8. But where there are doubts about whether certain conduct falls within article 8, these may be resolved by the subsequent adoption of the conduct in question by the State.",
                "(6) The phrase ‘acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own’ is intended to distinguish cases of acknowledgement and adoption from cases of mere support or endorsement. ICJ in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case used phrases such as ‘approval’, ‘endorsement’, ‘the seal of official governmental approval’ and ‘the decision to perpetuate [the situation]’. These were sufficient in the context of that case, but as a general matter, conduct will not be attributable to a State under article 11 where a State merely acknowledges the factual existence of conduct or expresses its verbal approval of it. In international controversies, States often take positions which amount to ‘approval’ or ‘endorsement’ of conduct in some general sense but do not involve any assumption of responsibility. The language of ‘adoption’, on the other hand, carries with it the idea that the conduct is acknowledged by the State as, in effect, its own conduct. Indeed, provided the State’s intention to accept responsibility for otherwise non-attributable conduct is clearly indicated, article 11 may cover cases where a State has accepted responsibility for conduct of which it did not approve, which it had sought to prevent and which it deeply regretted. However such acceptance may be phrased in the particular case, the term ‘acknowledges and adopts’ in article 11 makes it clear that what is required is something more than a general acknowledgement of a factual situation, but rather that the State identifies the conduct in question and makes it its own.",
                "(8) The phrase ‘if and to the extent that’ is intended to convey a number of ideas. First, the conduct of, in particular, private persons, groups or entities is not attributable to the State unless under some other article of chapter II or unless it has been acknowledged and adopted by the State. Secondly, a State might acknowledge and adopt conduct only to a certain extent. In other words, a State may elect to acknowledge and adopt only some of the conduct in question. Thirdly, the act of acknowledgment and adoption, whether it takes the form of words or conduct, must be clear and unequivocal.",
                "(9) The conditions of acknowledgement and adoption are cumulative, as indicated by the word ‘and’. The order of the two conditions indicates the normal sequence of events in cases in which article 11 is relied on. Acknowledgement and adoption of conduct by a State might be express (as for example in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case), or it might be inferred from the conduct of the State in question.”"

                "“60. In determining the question as to whether the illegal conduct of the individuals can somehow be attributed to SFOR, the Trial Chamber refers to the principles laid down in the Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (‘ILC’) on the issue of ‘Responsibilities of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’. These Draft Articles were adopted by the ILC at its fifty-third session in 2001. The Trial Chamber is however aware of the fact that any use of this source should be made with caution. The Draft Articles were prepared by the International Law Commission and are still subject to debate amongst States. They do not have the status of treaty law and are not binding on States. Furthermore, as can be deduced from its title, the Draft Articles are primarily directed at the responsibilities of States and not at those of international organisations or entities. As Draft Article 57 emphasises,",
                "[t]hese articles are without prejudice to any question of the responsibility under international law of an international organization, or of any State for the conduct of an international organization.",
                "61. In the present context, the focus should first be on the possible attribution of the acts of the unknown individuals to SFOR. As indicated in Article I of Annex 1-A to the Dayton Agreement, IFOR (SFOR) is a multinational military force. It ‘may be composed of ground, air and maritime units from NATO and non-NATO nations’ and ‘will operate under the authority and subject to the direction and political control of the North Atlantic Council.’ For the purposes of deciding upon the motions pending in the present case, the Chamber does not deem it necessary to determine the exact legal status of SFOR under international law. Purely as general legal guidance, it will use the principles laid down in the Draft Articles insofar as they may be helpful for determining the issue at hand.",
                "64. The Trial Chamber observes that both Parties use the same and similar criteria of ‘acknowledgement’, ‘adoption’, ‘recognition’, ‘approval’ and ‘ratification’, as used by the ILC. The question is therefore whether on the basis of the assumed facts SFOR can be considered to have ‘acknowledged and adopted’ the conduct undertaken by the individuals ‘as its own’. It needs to be re-emphasised in this context that it cannot be deduced from the assumed facts that SFOR was in any way, directly or indirectly, involved in the actual apprehension of the accused in the FRY or in the transfer of the accused into the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Nor has it in any way been argued or suggested that SFOR instructed, directed or controlled such acts. What can be concluded from the assumed facts is merely that the Accused was handed over to an SFOR unit after having been arrested in the FRY by unknown individuals and brought into the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. From the perspective of SFOR, the Accused had come into contact with SFOR in the execution of their assigned task. In accordance with their mandate and in light of Article 29 of the Statute and Rule 59 bis, they were obliged to inform the Prosecution and to hand him over to its representatives. From these facts, the Trial Chamber can readily conclude that there was no collusion or official involvement by SFOR in the alleged illegal acts.”"

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non ‑ exhaustion to satisfy the Court that any remedy it cites was in fact an effective one, and was available both in theory and in practice at the relevant time – that is to say that it was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant’s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement (see Akdivar and Others v.

Inspired by the general principle of de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court (see Ladygin v. Russia (dec.), no. 35365/05, 30 August 2011). The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case (see Gagliano Giorgi, cited above, § 55). The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant’s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev, cited above, and Eon v. France, no. 26118/10, § 34, 14 March 2013). However, the applicant’s subjective perception alone cannot suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage.

That was corroborated by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance in its June 2016 report on Azerbaijan.

That threshold is not limited to the mere “approval” and “endorsement” of the act in question, which, in the words of the ILC Commentary, “do not involve any assumption of responsibility” (ibid.) – Article 11 of the Draft Articles explicitly and categorically requires the “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of that act (see paragraph 34 above). The differentiation between the mere “approval” and “endorsement” of the act in question – which, on the one hand, in and of themselves do not bring about the responsibility of a respective State for that act, and, on the other hand, its “acknowledgment” and “adoption” as a threshold that must be reached for that responsibility to be invoked, has also been endorsed in the case-law of the ICTY (see paragraph 37 above). Moreover, the two conditions – “acknowledgment” and “adoption” – are cumulative, as stems directly from the wording of Article 11 of the Draft Articles, and, in addition, require that the State “acknowledges” and “adopts” the act “as its own”, which again demonstrates the very stringent requirements set by that provision. The Court furthermore observes that, according to the ILC Commentary, such an act of “acknowledgment” and “adoption” must, importantly, be “clear and unequivocal”, whether it takes the form of words or conduct (see paragraph 35 above)."

In this context, the Court is mindful of the evolution of international law on State responsibility and is conscious that the case-law on this particular issue is scarce and that further developments may therefore be expected in this area (see, mutatis mutandis, Jones and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 34356/06 and 40528/06, § 213, 14 January 2014).

Each of those measures certainly constituted, individually and cumulatively, the subsequent “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s acts by various institutions and the highest officials of the State, and that “approval” and “endorsement” strongly resonated with the feelings of Azerbaijani society at large. In particular, such measures as awarding R.S eight years’ salary arrears or promoting him within the military are indications of not only the State’s explicit, clear and unequivocal “endorsement” of the crimes committed by him, but also of their appreciation of R.S.’s conduct at the time when he was in the military service of the State of Azerbaijan."

The applicants argued that such glorifying statements – including those contained in the special section dedicated to R.S. on the official webpage of the President of Azerbaijan (see paragraph 25 above) – amounted to Azerbaijan’s “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of R.S.’s crimes as its own.

            [
                "118. The Court now turns to the assessment of the impugned measures from the standpoint of whether they constituted not the mere “approval” and “endorsement” by the State of Azerbaijan of the criminal acts committed by R.S., but also their “acknowledgment” and “adoption” in the sense of Article 11 of the Draft Articles. Although not decisive for the Court’s assessment, it is of importance that R.S.’s criminal acts were purely private acts of a criminal nature, and not related, whether directly or indirectly, with any State action at the time when they were committed (see paragraph 111 above). It has not escaped the Court’s attention that the impugned measures – in particular the granting of salary arrears and promoting R.S. in rank within the military – were undertaken by the State of Azerbaijan. That being so, the legal question before the Court in its examination of the applicants’ complaints under the substantive limb of Article 2 remains whether the very fact that the impugned measures were taken by the State of Azerbaijan allows for their categorisation – within the context of the factual circumstances, as submitted and argued by the parties, and in accordance with the standards of international law as it stood at the material time and stands today (see paragraphs 114-116 above) – in such a manner as to justify the Court in concluding that the respective State not only manifestly demonstrated its “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s acts, but in fact “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” them as acts not just, strictly speaking, perpetrated by R.S., but in fact as having been perpetrated by the State itself. Having most thoroughly examined the nature and scope of the impugned measures within the overall context in which they were taken and in the light of international law, the Court is unable to conclusively find that such “clear and unequivocal” “acknowledgement” and “adoption” indeed took place. In substance those measures can be interpreted not so much as the State’s “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of R.S.’s criminal acts, as such, but rather as having the purpose of publicly addressing, recognising and remedying R.S.’s adverse personal, professional and financial situation, which the authorities of Azerbaijan perceived, unjustifiably in the Court’s view, as being the consequence of the allegedly flawed criminal proceedings in Hungary (see paragraph 106 above). It follows that, although the Court considers it beyond any doubt that by their actions various institutions and highest officials of the State of Azerbaijan “approved” and “endorsed” the criminal acts of R.S., applying the very high threshold set by Article 11 of the Draft Articles – as interpreted and applied by international tribunals, in particular the ICJ and the ICTY (see paragraphs 36-37 above) – the Court cannot but conclude that, on the facts of the case, as presented by the applicants, it has not been convincingly demonstrated that the State of Azerbaijan “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” “as its own” R.S.’s deplorable acts, thus assuming, as such, responsibility for his actual killing of G.M. and the preparations for the murder of the first applicant. The Court places emphasis on the fact that this assessment is undertaken on the basis of the very stringent standards set out by the existing rules of international law, as they stood at the material time and stand today, from which the Court sees no reason or possibility to depart in the present case. Therefore, contrary to what was argued by the applicants, the present case cannot be considered fully comparable to the ICJ’s United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case."

Lastly, the applicants claimed that Azerbaijan had failed to properly regulate military service requirements and in particular had failed to establish R.S.’s mental state prior to sending him into an environment in which he would inevitably be called upon to interact with representatives of the Armenian military. Admittedly, in cases where crimes have been committed by police officers acting outside of their official duties, the Court has already held that the member States of the Council of Europe are expected to set high professional standards within their law-enforcement systems and ensure that the persons serving in these systems meet the requisite criteria (see Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, § 290; and Gorovenky and Bugara v. Ukraine, nos. 36146/05 and 42418/05, § 38, 12 January 2012). The Court accepts that similar standards may apply to members of the armed forces. However, having regard to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court is not convinced that the private acts of R.S. could have been foreseen by his commanding officers or should be held imputable to the Azerbaijani State as a whole, just because that individual happened to be its agent. Indeed, the impugned acts were so flagrantly abusive and so far removed from R.S.’s official status as a military officer that, on the facts of the case, his most serious criminal behaviour cannot engage the State’s substantive international responsibility. What is more, nothing in the case file suggests that the procedure in Azerbaijan for the recruitment of members of the armed forces and the monitoring of their compliance with professional standards at the time that R.S. was sent on his mission – including their continued mental fitness to serve – had been inadequate."

It was worth noting that the said declaration was one of five such declarations made on the same date, alongside one (so entitled) “reservation”. Logic would suggest that Azerbaijan had distinguished between “declarations” and “reservations” and that the declaration in question had not in fact been intended as a reservation. In any event, the declaration was not applicable in the circumstances in question, as it referred to persons transferred by Azerbaijan and not those transferred to it. It was not reciprocal, since Hungary had not made any equivalent declaration or reservation; as such there was no need to seek the consent of Hungary to any pardon it might wish to make.",

The Explanatory Report to the Transfer Convention stated that the Convention had been conceived as an instrument to further the offender’s social rehabilitation, an aim which could only be usefully pursued where the length of the sentence to be served was sufficiently long.

Indeed, pursuant to the preamble to the Transfer Convention, its main aims are to promote justice and the social rehabilitation of sentenced persons.

In the Court’s opinion, in view of the extremely tense political situation between the two countries, the authorities should have been all the more cautious, given that the victims of the crimes in the present case were of Armenian origin (see in this sense the European Parliament’s resolution cited at paragraph 42 above)."

Indeed, R.S. was afforded a criminal trial in Hungary before courts at two judicial instances, which delivered well-reasoned decisions. In particular, the Hungarian courts explained that R.S. himself had initially asked for an interpreter from Hungarian into Russian and that – once he had complained about not understanding that language to the necessary degree – they had conducted an in-depth analysis of the disadvantage at which this may have put him in the proceedings against him. In the end, they concluded that it was proven that R.S. had a good command of Russian and that, in any event, at his request he had subsequently been provided with interpreters and translations of documents into his native language (see paragraph 15 above)."

In any event, there is insufficient evidence that any procedural omission – if indeed there had been one – was not subsequently offset by procedural safeguards or that such an omission rendered the entire proceedings against him unfair (see, mutatis mutandis, Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, § 262, ECHR 2016).

In particular, the Court is satisfied that R.S.’s mental capacities had been thoroughly assessed during his trial in Hungary by a number of medical experts and that he was found to have been mentally able to understand the dangers and consequences of his actions at the time of the offences (see paragraph 15 above).

The Azerbaijani Government did not provide any explanation as to why R.S. had been granted those benefits, nor did they indicate the legal basis for such actions apart from citing the applicable regulation on military promotion (see paragraph 30 above).

Although the reply of the Azerbaijani authorities was admittedly incomplete and worded in general terms – which in turn could have aroused suspicion as to the manner of the execution of R.S.’s prison sentence and prompted them to further action, as concluded by the Hungarian Commissioner for Fundamental Rights (see paragraph 24 above) – no tangible evidence has been adduced before the Court by the parties in the present case to show that the Hungarian authorities unequivocally were or should have been aware that R.S. would be released upon his return to Azerbaijan.

Under Articles 21 and 23 of the Vienna Convention, a reservation established with regard to another party modified those provisions to the same extent for that other party in its relations with the State expressing the reservation question, and any claim to the contrary would run against the fundamental principle of the sovereign equality of States. Azerbaijan could not, therefore, avoid the legal effects of its own reservation. Its decision regarding the pardon of R.S. should have been agreed with the competent authorities of Hungary. If the Court accepted that the declaration of Azerbaijan constituted an interpretative declaration and not a reservation, it would show the understanding of the Republic of Azerbaijan to be that the correct interpretation of Article 12 implied that the consent of the sentencing State must be sought.

Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy’s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment ( see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 145, and Timishev v. Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, § 56, ECHR 2005).

Secondly, R.S. was not only reinstated to his post in the military, he was also promoted in military rank in a public ceremony shortly after his return to Azerbaijan. Moreover, he received a flat in Baku, together with salary arrears in respect of the entire period that he had spent in prison (even though the latter measure was provided under the domestic law only in respect of acquitted persons – see paragraph 28 above). As already stated, the Government did not indicate a domestic legal basis for all of those additional measures (see paragraph 169 above), which were understandably perceived as constituting rewards for R.S.’s actions (see paragraph 172 above).

A vast number of those letters were still viewable on that webpage, all of them thanking the President for pardoning R.S. on the basis that they agreed with his having killed his Armenian victim. While it is true that the President himself had never posted anything in that section, its mere existence and the reason therefor pointed to the idea that R.S. had been pardoned because his attack had been of an ethnic nature and that the granting of the pardon could be perceived as an important step in the process of legitimising and glorifying R.S.’s actions."

The Court is mindful of the difficulty faced by the applicants in proving such bias beyond a reasonable doubt, given that the facts in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the Azerbaijani authorities.

In the Court’s view, the two statements provided by the Azerbaijani Government are therefore not sufficient to refute the overwhelming body of evidence submitted by the applicants indicating that the various measures leading to R.S.’s virtual impunity, coupled with the glorification of his extremely cruel hate crime, had a causal link to the Armenian ethnicity of his victims."

It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 § 1 and the notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see, Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 67, ECHR 2008 ‑ I )."

The Court therefore considers that the applicant ’ s detention in Greece, although formally for the purpose of her extradition, was part of the mechanism used by the Moldovan authorities to implement the Botanica District Court ’ s decision of 19 June 2009 outside Moldova ’ s borders and to bring the applicant before a competent Moldovan legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence. Therefore, as regards Moldova, the applicant ’ s detention is to be examined under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention. In reaching this conclusion the Court bears in mind the principle according to which “[t]he Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective” (see Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 24, Series A no. 32). Had it been otherwise, the applicant would remain without the protection of Article 5 of the Convention."

                "39. The Court notes that the reason for ordering the applicant ’ s detention relied upon by the Moldovan courts was the fact that she had failed to appear before the investigating authorities when summoned (see paragraph 12). In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant left the country lawfully at a time when no criminal proceedings were pending against her. It was after her leaving the country that the authorities initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant. The Court further notes the applicant ’ s submission, which the Government did not contest, that she had given the police her contact information in Greece at a meeting with them after the events of 15 September 2008. In spite of that, the prosecutors issued the summons to her Moldovan address in Causeni. Moreover, according to the material in the case-file, the prosecutors contacted the applicant ’ s adult son and a relative of hers but failed to ask them to inform the applicant that she had to appear before them and made no attempt to follow up the information that she was in Greece. In fact, the case-file material does not contain any evidence to the effect that the authorities made any reasonable attempts to inform the applicant of the criminal proceedings and the necessity to appear before them within the framework of those proceedings."

                "40. The Court considers that where such an important issue as the right to liberty is at stake, it is incumbent on the domestic authorities to convincingly demonstrate that detention was necessary. Where the authorities order the detention of an individual pending trial on the grounds of his or her failure to appear before them when summoned, they should make sure that the individual in question had been given adequate notice and sufficient time to comply and take reasonable steps to verify that he or she has in fact absconded. That was certainly not the case in the present case where the authorities chose to take a very formalistic approach to the problem of summoning the applicant and when the applicant did not show up they hastily concluded that she was absconding. The Court notes that this appears to be contrary to Article 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which states in clear terms that detention pending trial can be imposed only when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect could abscond from the investigating authorities (see paragraphs 17 above). It also appears to be contrary to Article 238 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which states that if the person to be summoned declared another address during the proceedings, then the summons shall be sent to that address (see paragraph 18 above)."

In her habeas corpus application the applicant argued that she had not been summoned to present herself before the prosecutors and that she undertook to appear before them and give up her passport. The refusal of the domestic courts to check the applicant ’ s submissions about improper summoning and to give her a chance to appear before the authorities has persuaded the Court that the applicant ’ s detention cannot be considered necessary and devoid of arbitrariness under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention (compare to Ladent v. Poland, no. 11036/03, § 56, 18 March 2008). There has therefore been a breach of Article 5 § 1.",

There was no specific law and none of the legal provisions cited in the arrest warrant (section 22 (1) (f) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance and the 120 A (1) (f) of the Medical and Kindred Professions Ordinance ) referred to the alleged facts.

Moreover, he complained that the Court of Magistrates which had been requested to examine speedily the lawfulness of his arrest did not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention in so far as, according to section 409A of the CC (see paragraph 35 below ), only the prosecution had a right of appeal, not the accused.

Indeed, the Court of Criminal Inquiry in its referral stage had no competence to issue the arrest warrant, even more so since the issuing of such warrant had not been requested by the Attorney General and such action did not fall within the ambit of Article 405 of the CC regarding the examination of witnesses; therefore the applicant ’ s arrest was devoid of any legal basis and contrary to Article 5 § 1 and the applicant should accordingly be released.

While subsection (e) covered only persons who were Maltese citizens or residents, subsection (f) covered any person in Malta or outside the territory of Malta, and was not a follow-up to the previous subsection; therefore it did not carry the same limitations.

Further, nothing else provided reason to believe that subsection (f) had to be read as a continuation of subsection (e); indeed, the use of the word “or” suggested that the contrary interpretation applied.

Furthermore, such interpretation has become customary in domestic practice and was further reaffirmed by the criminal courts which later convicted the applicant. Consequently, the Court considers that the offences of which the applicant was accused constituted a “law” of sufficient “quality” within the meaning of the Court ’ s case-law and nothing suggests that the Maltese courts interpreted the relevant domestic law provisions unreasonably or in such a way as to make punishable acts which would otherwise have remained outside the scope of the relevant criminal law.

Moreover, although Article 5 § 4 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of applications for release from detention.

Thus, in order to be effective the Constitutional Court should have ordered the applicant ’ s release, as did the court of first instance by issuing an order to the Maltese authorities to take all necessary steps through diplomatic channels to reverse the effects of the unlawful warrant.

It can only apply within the jurisdiction where the person is being effectively detained and a remedy should be sought before a court within that jurisdiction, in the present case Spain. In so far as Article 5 § 4 may be applicable, the Constitutional Court freed the applicant from the effects of the warrant in that he could no longer be considered to be subject to the warrant of arrest issued against him. However, he could not be physically released in Malta since he was not physically detained there. Maltese courts have no jurisdiction over the Spanish authorities.

Since Article 5 § 4 does not establish a right to an order of unconditional release (see D.W. v. the United Kingdom, no. 21387/93 Commission Decision of 21 October 1996, unpublished ) it follows that release on bail is considered to be lawful release for the purposes of this Article."

While the Government have not raised an objection as regards the applicability of Article 10 of the Convention, the Court considers that it has to address this issue of its own motion. It recalls in this connection that questions relating to the applicability of Article 10 and the existence of interferences, the latter forming part of the merits of the relevant complaints, are often inextricably linked (see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, §§ 71 and 117, 8 November 2016, and also, as regards the applicability of Article 8 of the Convention, see Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, § 92, 25 September 2018). As it has previously explained in the latter case concerning Article 8, since the question of applicability is an issue of the Court’s jurisdiction ratione materiae, as a general rule the relevant analysis should be carried out at the admissibility stage, unless there is a particular reason to join this question to the merits (ibid., § 93). In the present case, the Court considers that the significance of the fact that the first and second applicants were able to finalise their journalistic investigation for the purposes of which they had requested access to certain court decisions is closely linked with the question of whether there has been an interference with their rights under Article 10 of the Convention. More importantly, the present case raises a novel issue at domestic level and is one of the first cases following the judgment of the Grand Chamber in Magyar Helsinki Bizottság to test the limits to the right of access to information recognized in that judgment in certain circumstances and the applicability of Article 10 of the Convention in that regard. Accordingly, the Court decides to join the Government’s objection to the merits of application no. 44920/09. Furthermore, it decides to examine the question of applicability of Article 10 of the Convention together with that pertaining to the existence of interference under this provision on the merits of the present cases. That decision, however, does not detract from the general rule, referenced above, according to which issues relating to the applicability of Article 10 will normally fall to be examined in most cases at the admissibility stage."

Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, §§ 71 and 117, 8 November 2016, and also, as regards the applicability of Article 8 of the Convention, see Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, § 92, 25 September 2018). As it has previously explained in the latter case concerning Article 8, since the question of applicability is an issue of the Court’s jurisdiction ratione materiae, as a general rule the relevant analysis should be carried out at the admissibility stage, unless there is a particular reason to join this question to the merits (ibid., § 93). In the present case, the Court considers that the significance of the fact that the first and second applicants were able to finalise their journalistic investigation for the purposes of which they had requested access to certain court decisions is closely linked with the question of whether there has been an interference with their rights under Article 10 of the Convention. More importantly, the present case raises a novel issue at domestic level and is one of the first cases following the judgment of the Grand Chamber in Magyar Helsinki Bizottság to test the limits to the right of access to information recognized in that judgment in certain circumstances and the applicability of Article 10 of the Convention in that regard. Accordingly, the Court decides to join the Government’s objection to the merits of application no. 44920/09. Furthermore, it decides to examine the question of applicability of Article 10 of the Convention together with that pertaining to the existence of interference under this provision on the merits of the present cases.

They explained that they had sought access to the criminal case material because they believed that the person who had come forward as the victim in those criminal proceedings had, in actual fact, been an agent provocateur, and they had, at the material time, been working on a documentary exposing police misconduct. Acknowledging the fact that they had been able to finalise their journalistic investigation even in the absence of the solicited information (see paragraph 13 above and paragraph 36 below), the two applicants argued that the disclosure of that information would have allowed them to deliver an even better journalistic product. The first and second applicants argued that the relevant judicial authority’s refusal to grant them access to information of interest to them had been unlawful because the criminal case material had related not to an ongoing criminal case but one which had already been terminated. They claimed that since the Special Investigative Activities Act did not apply to closed criminal cases, section 5 should not have been relied on as the legal basis for withholding public information from them. The two applicants further argued that the interference with their right to receive information had not pursued any legitimate aim and had been disproportionate. Thus, with respect to those elements, the applicants argued, among other things, that since the criminal case material had already been examined openly and publicly in court, its non-disclosure could not possibly serve the interests of protecting either a State secret or personal data about the parties to the proceedings."

He further stated that since all six of the criminal cases about which he had requested information had been directed against former high-ranking State officials, who had all been well ‑ known public figures, prosecuted for various corruption offences, the public had had the right to know all the details about those high-profile criminal proceedings. The third applicant further claimed that, generally speaking, full access to decisions issued by domestic courts promoted the general principles of transparency and accountability.

Referring the Court to the web address of the video in question, the Government noted that it had already had more than thirty-seven thousand views, which could be taken as proof that the applicants had been successful in their investigation and that, consequently, there could be no room for suspecting that the State had interfered with their freedom of expression.

However, such a right or obligation may arise, firstly, where disclosure of the information has been imposed by a judicial order which has gained legal force and, secondly, in circumstances where access to the information is instrumental for the individual’s exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression. Whether and to what extent the denial of access to information constitutes an interference with an applicant’s freedom ‑ of ‑ expression rights must be assessed in each individual case and in the light of its particular circumstances (see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság, cited above, §§ 156-57). In order to determine whether Article 10 can be said to apply to a public authority’s refusal to disclose information, the situation must be assessed in the light of the following criteria: (a) the purpose of the information request; (b) the nature of the information sought; (c) the particular role of the seeker of the information in “receiving and imparting” it to the public; and (d) whether the information was ready and available (ibid., §§ 157 ‑ 70).",

Turning to the circumstances of application no. 44920/09, the Court notes that, whilst the journalistic role of the first and second applicants was undeniably compatible with the scope of the right to solicit access to State ‑ held information (compare, for instance, Roşiianu v. Romania, no. 27329/06, § 61, 24 June 2014), the purpose of their information request cannot be said to have satisfied the relevant criterion under Article 10 of the Convention (see the preceding paragraph in fine ). This is because they failed to specify, in the relevant domestic proceedings, the purpose of their request for permission to consult the criminal case file. They never explained to the relevant court registry why the documents were necessary for the exercise of their freedom to receive and impart information to others (see paragraph 6 above, and contrast Cangı v. Turkey, no. 24973/15, § 32, 29 January 2019). Noting that omission, the domestic authority explicitly invited the applicants to address that gap by clarifying the purpose of their request. What is more, the authority expressed its readiness to reconsider its initial refusal upon receipt of the requisite information from the applicants. The latter, however, ignored that opportunity and instead decided to sue the authority for breaching their alleged right to have unrestricted access to State-held information of public interest (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above, and compare Sioutis v. Greece (dec.), no. 16393/14, § 27, 29 August 2017, and also, mutatis mutandis, Bubon v. Russia, no. 63898/09, § 47, 7 February 2017). However, it should be restated in this connection that Article 10 of the Convention does not confer on individuals an absolute right to access State ‑ held information (see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság, cited above, § 156)."

The Court firstly considers that when, as in the instant case, an individual has been convicted after proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, a retrial or the reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation. In that regard, it notes that Article 449 of the Portuguese Code of Criminal Procedure permits the reopening of proceedings at domestic level where the Court has found a violation of a person ’ s fundamental rights and freedoms. However, the specific remedial measures, if any, required of a respondent State in order to discharge its obligations under the Convention must depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case and be determined in the light of the terms of the Court ’ s judgment in that case ( see Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 210, ECHR 2005-IV, and Panasenko v. Portugal, no. 10418/03, § 78, 22 July 2008). In the present case, the only point at issue is the fact that the applicant was not given a hearing by the Court of Appeal.",
                "42. Secondly, the Court notes that in the present case the only applicable basis for an award of just satisfaction lies in the fact that the applicant was not afforded the safeguards of Article 6. In that regard, it does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged, and rejects this claim. The Court cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal would have been if it had examined the applicant at a public hearing ( see Igual Coll v. Spain, no. 37496/04, § 51, 10 March 2009). On the other hand, it considers it appropriate to award the applicant EUR 2, 400 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. ”",

At this stage of the proceedings, the Supreme Court ’ s sole task – I repeat – is to determine whether this formal condition for granting a review is present.

Among the member States in question are : Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine."

In some of these States, however, this option is possible by means of an extensive interpretation of the general provisions on the reopening of proceedings (for example, in Albania, Denmark, Italy and Sweden ).

Switzerland (no. 2) ([GC], no. 32772/02, ECHR 2009 ) and its decision in Egmez v.

The principles set out by the Court in those judgments and that decision may be summarised as follows :",
                "( a) Findings of a violation in its judgments are essentially declaratory and, by Article 46 of the Convention, the High Contracting Parties undertook to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they were parties, execution being supervised by the Committee of Ministers ( see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz ( VgT ) (no. 2), cited above, § 6 1 ).",
                "( b) The Committee of Ministers ’ role in this sphere does not mean, however, that measures taken by a respondent State to remedy a violation found by the Court cannot raise a new issue undecided by the judgment and, as such, form the subject of a new application that may be dealt with by the Court. In other words, the Court may entertain a complaint that a retrial at domestic level by way of implementation of one of its judgments gave rise to a new breach of the Convention ( ibid, § 62; see also Bochan (no. 2), cited above, § 33, and Egmez, cited above, § 51).",
                "( c) On that basis, the Court has found that it had the competence to entertain complaints in a number of follow-up cases, for example where the domestic authorities had carried out a fresh examination of the case by way of implementation of one of the Court ’ s judgments, whether by reopening the proceedings or by initiating an entirely new set of proceedings ( see Egmez, cited above, § 52, and the references therein ).",
                "( d) It transpires from the Court ’ s case-law that the determination of the existence of a “new issue” very much depends on the specific circumstances of a given case and that distinctions between cases are not always clear-cut ( see Bochan (no. 2), cited above, § 34, and, for an examination of that case-law, Egmez, cited above, § 54). The powers assigned to the Committee of Ministers by Article 46 to supervise the execution of the Court ’ s judgments and assess the implementation of measures adopted by States under that Article are not encroached on where the Court has to deal with relevant new information in the context of a fresh application ( see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz ( VgT ) (no. 2), cited above, § 67)."

Nevertheless, as stated in Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 of the Committee of Ministers, the practice of the Committee of Ministers in supervising the execution of the Court ’ s judgments shows that in exceptional circumstances the re-examination of a case or the reopening of proceedings has proved the most efficient, if not the only, means of achieving restitutio in integrum, that is to say ensuring that the injured party is restored, as far as possible, to the situation which he or she enjoyed prior to the violation of the Convention. Among the cases in which the Court finds a violation, re-examination or reopening will be of particular importance in the field of criminal law, according to the explanatory memorandum to the Recommendation ( see paragraphs 32 and 33 above )."

For example, in the specific context of cases concerning the independence and impartiality of the Turkish national security courts, the Court has held that, in principle, the most appropriate form of redress would be for the applicant to be given a retrial by an independent and impartial tribunal (see Gençel v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, § 27, 23 October 2003)."

                "( a) Where an individual has been convicted following proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, a retrial or the reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation. However, the specific remedial measures, if any, required of a respondent State in order for it to discharge its obligations under the Convention must depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case and be determined in the light of the Court ’ s judgment in that case, and with due regard to the Court ’ s case-law.",

The respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its obligation to put the applicant, as far as possible, in the position he would have been in had the requirements of the Convention not been disregarded, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment and with the rights of the defence."

In that connection, the Court notes that there is no uniform approach among the Contracting States as regards the right to apply for the reopening of proceedings that have been closed. It also observes that in most of those States the reopening of proceedings is not automatic and is subject to admissibility criteria, whose observance is supervised by the domestic courts, which have a broader margin of appreciation in that sphere ( see paragraphs 34 et seq. above )."

That being so, the question whether the procedure for considering the application for review was compatible with the fair - trial standards deriving from Article 6 of the Convention can be examined separately from the aspects relating to the execution of the judgment delivered by the Court in 2011 (see, mutatis mutandis, Bochan (no. 2), cited above, § 37)."

It accordingly ruled that the argument put forward in support of the application for review, based on Article 449 § 1 (g) – an Article which the Court had expressly mentioned as permitting the reopening of the proceedings – was unsubstantiated."

The Court reiterates that in Bochan (no. 2) ( cited above ) it considered the issue of the applicability of Article 6 to remedies concerning the reopening of civil proceedings which had been concluded by final judicial decisions. The principles set out by the Court in that case may be summarised as follows :",
                "( a) According to long - standing and established case-law, the Convention does not guarantee a right to have a terminated case reopened. Extraordinary remedies by which the reopening of terminated judicial proceedings may be sought do not normally involve the determination of “civil rights and obligations” or of “any criminal charge” and therefore Article 6 is deemed inapplicable to them. This approach has also been followed in cases where the reopening of terminated domestic judicial proceedings has been sought on the ground of a finding by the Court of a violation of the Convention ( ibid ., §§ 44 ‑ 45, with the references therein).",
                "( b ) However, should an extraordinary remedy lead automatically or in the specific circumstances to a full reconsideration of the case, Article 6 applies in the usual way to the “reconsideration” proceedings. Moreover, Article 6 has also been found to be applicable in certain instances where the proceedings, although characterised as “extraordinary” or “exceptional” in domestic law, were deemed to be similar in nature and scope to ordinary appeal proceedings, the national characterisation of the proceedings not being regarded as decisive for the issue of applicability ( ibid ., §§ 46-47).",
                "( c) In sum, while Article 6 § 1 is not normally applicable to extraordinary remedies by which the reopening of terminated judicial proceedings may be sought, the nature, scope and specific features of the relevant procedure in the legal system concerned may be such as to bring the procedure within the ambit of Article 6 § 1 and of the safeguards of a fair trial which that provision affords to litigants ( ibid ., § 50)."

As regards criminal proceedings, the Court has found that Article 6 is not applicable to applications for their reopening, given that a person who, having been convicted with final effect, submits such an application is not “ charged with a criminal offence ” within the meaning of that Article. Likewise, Article 6 is not applicable to a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law, brought with the aim of quashing a final conviction following a finding by the Court of a violation, as the person concerned is likewise not “ charged with a criminal offence ” in such proceedings (see, for example, Fischer v. Austria ( dec. ), no. 27569/02, ECHR 2003 -VI, and Öcalan v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 5980/07, 6 July 2010)."

            [
                "62. Still in the criminal-law sphere, the Court has held that the requirements of legal certainty are not absolute. Considerations such as the emergence of new facts, the discovery of a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings that could affect the outcome of the case, or the need to afford redress, particularly in the context of the execution of the Court ’ s judgments, all militate in favour of the reopening of proceedings. Accordingly, the Court has held that the mere possibility of reopening a criminal case is prima facie compatible with the Convention (see Nikitin v. Russia, no. 50178/99, §§ 55-57, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII). However, it has emphasised that higher courts ’ power of review should only be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, and not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Bujniţa v. Moldova, no. 36492/02, § 20, 16 January 2007, and Bota v. Romania, no. 16382/03, § § 33 and 34, 4 November 2008 )."

Similarly, the Court has found that the upholding, after review proceedings, of a conviction which breached the right to a fair trial amounted to an error of assessment which perpetuated that breach (see Yaremenko v. Ukraine (no. 2), no. 66338/09, §§ 52-56 and 64-67, 30 April 2015). On the other hand, the arbitrary reopening of criminal proceedings, in particular to the detriment of a convicted person, infringes the right to a fair trial (see Savinskiy v. Ukraine, no. 6965/02, § 25, 28 February 2006; Radchikov v. Russia, no. 65582/01, § 48, 24 May 2007; and Ştefan v. Romania, no. 28319/03, § 18, 6 April 2010)."

The Court has also considered other stages in criminal proceedings where the applicants were no longer “persons charged with a criminal offence” but persons “convicted ” as a result of judicial decisions deemed final under domestic law. Given that “criminal charge” is an autonomous notion and having regard to the impact which the procedure for examining an appeal on points of law may have upon the determination of a criminal charge, including the possibility of correcting errors of law, the Court has found that such a procedure is covered by the safeguards of Article 6 (see Meftah and Others v. France [GC], nos. 32911/96, 35237/97 and 34595/97, § 40, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII), even where it is treated as an extraordinary remedy in domestic law and concerns a judgment against which no ordinary appeal lies. By the same token, the Court has held that the safeguards of Article 6 are applicable to criminal proceedings in which the competent court began by examining the admissibility of an application for leave to appeal with a view to having a conviction quashed (see Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 54, Series A no. 115)."

The Court reiterates that in its Bochan (no. 2) judgment ( cited above ) it considered, under the civil head of Article 6 of the Convention, the issue of unfairness resulting from the reasoning adopted by the domestic courts. The principles set forth by the Court in that case may be summarised as follows.",
                "( a) It is not for the Court to deal with alleged errors of law or fact committed by the national courts unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention, for instance where, in exceptional cases, such errors may be said to constitute “unfairness” incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention (ibid. , § 61).",
                "( b) Article 6 § 1 of the Convention does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way in which evidence should be assessed, these being primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts. Normally, issues such as the weight attached by the national courts to particular items of evidence or to findings or assessments submitted to them for consideration are not for the Court to review. The Court should not act as a fourth - instance body and will therefore not question under Article 6 § 1 the national courts ’ assessment, unless their findings can be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (ibid., § 61; see also the cases cited therein: Dulaurans v. France, no. 34553/97, §§ 33-34 and 38, 21 March 2000; Khamidov v. Russia, no. 72118/01, § 170, 15 November 2007; and Anđelković v. Serbia, no. 1401/08, § 24, 9 April 2013; as well as the application of this case-law in more recent judgments: Pavlović and Others v. Croatia, no. 13274/11, § 49, 2 April 2015; Yaremenko (no. 2), cited above, §§ 64 ‑ 67; and Tsanova-Gecheva v. Bulgaria, no. 43800/12, § 91, 15 September 2015)."

            [
                "84. The Court also reiterates that according to its established case-law reflecting a principle linked to the proper administration of justice, judgments of courts and tribunals should adequately state the reasons on which they are based. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case ( see García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 26, ECHR 1999 ‑ I). Without requiring a detailed answer to every argument advanced by the complainant, this obligation presupposes that parties to judicial proceedings can expect to receive a specific and explicit reply to the arguments which are decisive for the outcome of those proceedings ( see, among other authorities, Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 1994, §§ 29-30, Series A no. 303 ‑ A, and Higgins and Others v. France, 19 February 1998, §§ 42-43, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I). Moreover, in cases relating to interference with rights secured under the Convention, the Court seeks to establish whether the reasons provided for decisions given by the domestic courts are automatic or stereotypical ( see, mutatis mutandis, Paradiso and Campanelli v. Italy [GC], no. 25358/12, § 210, ECHR 2017). Furthermore, the Convention does not require jurors to give reasons for their decision and Article 6 does not preclude a defendant from being tried by a lay jury even where reasons are not given for the verdict. Nevertheless, for the requirements of a fair trial to be satisfied, the public, and above all the accused, must be able to understand the verdict that has been given ( see Lhermitte v. Belgium [GC], no. 34238/09, § § 66 and 67, ECHR 2016 ).",

In total about 800 heavily armed police officers appeared. The police cordon started approaching the tents and panic broke out among the demonstrators who started waking the others up. Some of the demonstrators managed to switch on the microphones and the lights on the square. Mr Ter-Petrosyan, who was also at the square, addressed the demonstrators: “We see that police forces have arrived at the square. Please, do not have any contact with them and do not touch them in any way. Please keep your distance from them. Let us wait and see what they want from us. If they have something to tell us, we are ready to listen. Please, be patient and peaceful”. Then there was silence for about a minute. By then the police forces had already encircled the square with a triple cordon. Suddenly, without any prior warning or orders to disperse, the police forces, shouting loudly, attacked the demonstrators, most of whom were still asleep in their tents, violently beating them with rubber batons and destroying the camp. Mr Ter-Petrosyan was immediately arrested and taken away. Within a few minutes no demonstrator remained at the square, since everybody, including the applicant, had tried to save themselves by fleeing. He and other activists were then pursued by the police through the streets and arrested (see paragraph 25 below)."

The Government contested the applicant ’ s allegations and claimed that the reason for the police operation of 1 March 2008 at Freedom Square had been information obtained on 29 February 2008 by the Armenian Police and National Security Service, according to which a large number of weapons, including metal rods, wooden clubs, firearms, grenades and explosives, were to be distributed to the protesters to incite provocative actions and mass disorder in Yerevan on 1 March 2008. The police operation had aimed to verify that information. For that purpose, members of the relevant police force, without being equipped with any protective gear, had arrived at Freedom Square where about 800 to 900 demonstrators armed with metal rods and wooden clubs had gathered waiting for the police. The demonstrators had attacked the police officers, hitting them and throwing stones, pointed metal objects and Molotov cocktails at them, as a result of which numerous police officers had been injured."

The police operation of 1 March 2008 was based on intelligence information received the previous day by the police and the national security service, according to which a large quantity of metal rods, wooden clubs, firearms, grenades and explosives was to be distributed to the demonstrators in order to instigate mass disorder.

A number of unarmed police officers had entered Opera Square where they were attacked by 800-900 demonstrators armed with metal rods and wooden clubs, who were expecting the arrival of the police.

The applicant submitted that he was not a member of any political party and had not organised any demonstrations, and the charges against him were politically motivated and lacked corpus delicti. As regards the charge of assault under Article 316 § 2 of the CC, a group of 20-25 persons, without presenting themselves as police officers or asking him to follow them to a police station, preemptively attacked him and beat him up in the street and, by doing so, created an appearance of resistance. Moreover, no actual police officer to whom he had put up the alleged resistance had been identified. Furthermore, his rights guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention had been violated because he was prosecuted for simply being one of the demonstrators.

It is not painful when palpated. There is a bruise measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm on the front surface of the upper third part of the right leg of a pale greenish-blue colour.

He sought to have the relevant police order, which served as a basis for the police operation of 1 March 2008, declared unlawful and unfounded and the ensuing police actions declared unlawful. He submitted that he had participated in the demonstrations held from 20 February 2008 onwards. The demonstrations had been held in compliance with the Constitution and Article 11 of the Convention and involved no criminal behaviour. In the morning of 1 March 2008 armed police forces had suddenly invaded Freedom Square and started beating peaceful demonstrators. The police attack had been unjustified and failed to meet the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the Convention. The true purpose of the police operation, which was justified as an attempt to restore public order, was to launch political persecution of the supporters of Mr Ter ‑ Petrosyan, including himself, by provoking the demonstrators to engage in clashes, creating artificial charges of resistance to police and punishing them for exercising their right to freedom of assembly and for their political opinion. Thus, the exercise of his right to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly had been criminalised and he was facing unfounded and trumped-up charges as a result of unlawful police actions. Such interference was unlawful, did not pursue a legitimate aim and was not necessary in a democratic society.

He argued that the testimony of A.M., D.A., M.A., V.H. and H.B., who were also active demonstrators, would support his allegation that the actions of the police had been unlawful from the very outset, that on 1 March 2008 at around 6 a.m. he and they had been attacked by the police and other forces without prior warning and had been forcibly brought in, and that at 7 a.m. he had already been at the police station and could therefore not have been at Freedom Square.

The applicant lastly argued that testimony from S.A. and H.T., who were high-ranking police officials and had apparently given orders for the police operation, was important in order to assess the police actions of the morning of 1 March 2008. The prosecuting authority had failed to investigate the lawfulness of the police actions, including the excessive force used by the police that morning. However, only if these circumstances were investigated would it be possible to assess the charge against him. In this connection, it was also necessary to call and examine other PGS officers who had taken part in the police operation of the morning of 1 March 2008.

                "“In the period preceding 1 March 2008 intelligence information was received by the Armenian Police and the National Security Service that the demonstrators gathered at Yerevan ’ s Freedom Square had in their possession firearms, ammunition, clubs, rods and other objects for the purpose of causing physical injuries and violence. On 1 March 2008 at around 7 a.m. police officers demanded the persons gathered at Yerevan ’ s Freedom Square to allow them to verify the above information by inspecting the area. The mentioned lawful demand of the police was announced out loud several times. Some of the people gathered at Freedom Square, including [the applicant], had already been informed several hours in advance about the planned police operation. The police officers of the Patrol Guard Service brigade of the Armenian Police, with the aim of preserving public order in that area, approached Freedom Square where [the applicant], in front of the statue of Hovhannes Tumanyan, hit the victim, [police officer A.Arsh.], twice on the head with a stick, causing light damage to his health accompanied by a brief deterioration of health, after which he disappeared in the crowd. [Police officer A.Aru., the second victim,] saw the act committed by [the applicant]. [Police officer A.Aru.] continued his duty in the area near the [Yerevan Press Building] situated at Arshakunyats Street, where he once again noticed [the applicant] and tried to bring him in. [The applicant], disobeying [police officer A.Aru. ’ s] lawful order to appear at the police station, assaulted [him] in a non-health-threatening way by pushing, pulling and kicking [him], and tried to escape in a random taxi. [Police officers A.A., E.R. and H.S.], who were on duty at that time in the same area, noticed the incident and brought [the applicant] in to Kentron Police Station, during which a bladed weapon – a knife – fell from [the applicant ’ s] pocket, as well as two mobile telephones and a bunch of keys.",

                "85. In establishing the above findings, the Yerevan Criminal Court relied on the same evidence on which the indictment was based, plus the statements of the police officers made in court (see paragraphs 72 and 75 - 80 above). It found the applicant ’ s submissions to be unreliable and an attempt to avoid criminal responsibility."

                "86. On 10 November 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal in which he argued, inter alia, that the charge against him was trumped-up and politically motivated; that he had been ill-treated both at the time of his apprehension and at the police station and that no investigation had been carried out into his allegations of ill-treatment; that the interference with his freedom of peaceful assembly had been unlawful, unjustified and accompanied with use of excessive force by the police; that the only witnesses in the case were police officers who, being interested in the outcome of the case because of the brutal and unlawful force used against the demonstrators, including his ill-treatment, were not impartial and trustworthy witnesses and had made contradictory statements which were then coordinated towards the end of the investigation and which constituted the sole basis for his conviction; and that the principle of equality of arms had not been respected since his request to call and examine witnesses on his behalf had been groundlessly dismissed. Thus, the entire case was based on police testimony, while he was not allowed to defend himself effectively and to summon any impartial witnesses, including those who were by his side on the morning of 1 March 2008. The applicant contested the reliability of the evidence provided by police officers H.S., E.R. and A.A., pointing, inter alia, to the fact that their statements made in court differed, while those made during the investigation had been identical in wording. Moreover, it appeared from their statements that they had been arresting different demonstrators from different locations, all at the same time, which cast doubt on the veracity of their statements. As regards the statements of police officers A.Arsh. and A.Aru., they concerned events which had taken place in a chaotic situation early in the morning when it was still dark, which cast doubt on the reliability of that evidence. The police officers had effectively refused to answer any questions in court, limiting their answers to either “I do not remember” or “I do not know”. The trial court had failed to make any assessment of the police actions at Freedom Square, including their lawfulness and proportionality, without which the charge against him could not receive a fair determination. What had happened in reality was that the police officers had initiated an unlawful clash with the demonstrators and then rounded up all the activists, many of whom had also been subjected to ill-treatment. The alleged inspection of the scene had been simply a pretext to conceal the police officers ’ real intention, which had been to disperse the peaceful demonstration. The applicant alleged that he had been known to the authorities and was persecuted for being a supporter of Mr Ter-Petrosyan and because of a critical speech he had made on the first day of the demonstrations. He had initially been charged with resisting unidentified police officers, until about five months later when a new charge had emerged of him assaulting another police officer in a different location, namely at Freedom Square. Moreover, there were multiple contradictions regarding the time of his apprehension, which in later police statements was alleged to have happened at around 7.30-8 a.m. This was, however, an attempt by the prosecution to link him to the assault on police officer A.Arsh. which, according to the final official version, had taken place at around 7.15 a.m. However, it was a well-established fact that the police operation of 1 March 2008 had taken place at around 6 a.m. and, moreover, according to the relevant record, at around 6.30 a.m. he had already been at Kentron Police Station. The applicant also argued that, if he was suspected of assaulting police officer A.Arsh. on 1 March 2008, he should have been presented for identification as early as on 2 March 2008. Instead, photo identification was performed only about five months later. The evidence regarding the knife was not credible and he had never even been questioned in that connection. The applicant relied on, inter alia, Articles 3, 5, 6, 10 and 11 of the Convention."

On 10 December 2008 the Criminal Court of Appeal examined the applicant ’ s appeal through an expedited procedure and decided on the same day to dismiss it, relying on the same evidence as the Yerevan Criminal Court. In doing so, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant ’ s argument that his conviction was based solely on the statements of police officers who were not impartial witnesses, finding that the fact that the victims and witnesses in the case were police officers did not diminish the probative value of their statements and it was unacceptable to view this as a predetermining or prejudicial circumstance. Furthermore, the criminal case was based also on a number of expert conclusions, the records of inspection of the scene and the records of the applicant ’ s photo identification. As regards the applicant ’ s claim that his allegations of ill-treatment had not been investigated, the Court of Appeal stated that, according to a decision of the investigating authority, it was still necessary to carry out a comprehensive investigation – within the scope of criminal case no. 62202608 – into the circumstances under which injuries had been sustained by persons, including the applicant, who had participated in the mass disorder of 1-2 March 2008.

            ],
            [
                "123. On 18 December 2009 the Court of Cassation adopted a decision in an unrelated criminal case, examining questions concerning initial deprivation of liberty under the CCP. The Court of Cassation firstly pointed out that there were two procedures for depriving a person of his liberty on suspicion of having committed an offence, namely “arrest” (Articles 128 ‑ 133 of the CCP) and “detention” (Articles 137-142 of the CCP). Nevertheless, taking into account the peculiarities of the arrest procedure, the procedure for depriving a person of his liberty on a reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence might include an initial stage of certain duration, during which a person might have no procedural status, due to the lack of certainty in the rules of criminal procedure. In particular, it followed from the wording of Article 128 of the CCP that the arrest procedure consisted of four consecutive actions: (a) the de facto deprivation of a person ’ s liberty; (b) bringing him before the competent authority; (c) drawing up a record of his arrest; and (d) informing him about that record. Hence, a person could obtain the status of an “arrestee” only after the completion of the fourth and final action, namely after he was informed about the record of his arrest before the prosecuting authority. Prior to that moment, a person, while being de facto taken into custody and brought before the prosecuting authority, could not have the status of an “arrestee”, even if brought before the relevant authority on a reasonable suspicion of his having committed an offence. If the relevant authority continued and completed the arrest procedure in respect of a person brought before it, then the start of the arrest period would be calculated from the moment that person had been taken into custody, albeit retroactively. Hence, a person taken into custody and brought before the relevant authority, prior to being informed about the record of his arrest, could not be aware with sufficient certainty about his status. Moreover, while the record was not drawn up, he could be released without even obtaining the status of an “arrestee”. The Court of Cassation therefore concluded that the procedures for depriving a person of liberty on a suspicion of having committed an offence were not limited to “arrest” and “detention” but also included the procedure of taking into custody and bringing before the relevant authority. Consequently, a person deprived of his liberty, along with the status of an “arrestee” and a “detainee”, could also have an initial legal status which could be conditionally called the status of a “brought-in person”. The fact that “bringing-in” was given, by the legislature, relative independence as a procedure was evidenced by Article 180 § 2 of the CCP which included, among the actions allowed, the possibility “to bring persons in on a suspicion of having committed an offence”.

                "“ 3.2.1 The Freedom Square Operation (6.40 a.m. on 1 March 2008)",
                "The 1 March events started with the forcible termination of the peaceful sit-in at Freedom Square. At 6.40 a.m., police officers wearing anti-riot gear and carrying shields and batons attacked the demonstrators who were at Freedom Square. ...",
                "A. Lawfulness of the Demonstration ( from 20 February to 1 March at Freedom Square)",
                "... From a formal point of view, the demonstration that lasted from 21 February to 1 March did not comply with the requirements of law, because the Mayor of Yerevan had neither been notified nor taken note of a demonstration to be held. At the same time thousands of persons spontaneously went to Freedom Square at varying hours to protest against the manner in which the election had been conducted and its official results, a matter that affects the interests of all Armenians and their collective right to form a government through expression of their free will. It is explicitly stated in the OSCE/ODIHR report : “From 21 February to early morning on 1 March protesters held a peaceful, though not formally [authorised], assembly (and tent camp) in Freedom Square in Yerevan and conducted numerous peaceful processions. Speakers at the assembly announced that their aim was to annul and repeat the election. Until 1 March, the authorities overall tolerated the protests .”",
                "The official results of the election were not received with unequivocal trust of the population... The movement led by [ Mr Ter-Petrosyan] organised a protest campaign against vote fraud and violence, demanding a fair recount. From 20 February to 1 March 2008 a sizeable proportion of Armenia ’ s population gathered at Freedom Square to peacefully protest against the conduct of the election and its official results ... [President Robert Kocharyan] declared at one of his press conferences : “The unauthorised demonstrations were not terminated by the police for nine consecutive days only for one reason: I prohibited them to do so. The reason was the post-election recount and the appeal process. I believed that a dispersal of demonstrations would be perceived as an attempt by the authorities to undermine the recount or the appeal process.”",
                "B. Lawfulness of the 1 March Operation from the Perspective of Criminal Procedure",
                "... the 1 March intervention was justified with the argument that on 29 February the police and the National Security Service had received intelligence information according to which arms were building up at Freedom Square. In order to render the situation harmless, in the morning of 1 March the police undertook an operation intended to seize those socially-dangerous materials.",
                "The campaign headquarters of [Mr Ter-Petrosyan] and the opposition Heritage Party ... both insist that the objective of the measures of the morning of 1 March was, under the disguise of an inspection of the area, to terminate by force the peaceful demonstrations that had been ongoing for ten days, to remove the persons participating in the sit-in and to ban further demonstrations at Freedom Square.",
                "A comprehensive and complete investigation will ultimately show which of these hypotheses is true. However, a number of issues may be raised at this point already:",
                "- There are certain contradictions in the statements released by the Prosecutor General ’ s Office. For instance, it was mentioned in the request lodged by the Prosecutor General on 4 March seeking approval to bring charges against four Members of Parliament and to remand them in custody: “the objective of the police was to carry out an operation aimed at seizing arms, which deteriorated into a clash”, while something else was mentioned in the press release issued by the Prosecutor General ’ s Office on 1 March: “the objective of the police was to terminate forcibly the assembly at around 6 a.m. on 1 March”. Which is the truth?",
                "- According to the official account of events, the attempt of the police officers performing their official duties to inspect the area was met by an aggressive attack by the participants of the sit-in. In view of such developments, an operative on ‑ the ‑ spot decision was made to take appropriate measures as prescribed by law. A logical question arises: how did it happen that at around 6.30 a.m., in a matter of just minutes, the police was able to mobilise numerous units, wearing anti-riot gear and carrying shields and batons, who attacked the demonstrators, if the only objective was to perform an inspection of the area?",
                "- Given the highly politicised nature of the situation, one would expect the law ‑ enforcement officers to videotape the operation, in particular, its launch, especially taking into account that they were accompanied by cameramen who later videotaped the arms seized. Therefore, the launch of the operation, as videotaped by them, must be rigorously analysed. There are concerns in this connection over the confiscation of the videotapes of [two media outlets] and the smashing of the ... camcorder [of a third media outlet], all of which were videotaping in that area in the morning of 1 March. Moreover, freelance photographer of Aravot daily ... was beaten and the photos he had taken were taken away. What was the police hiding? If everything was done in accordance with the law, the police should have been the most interested in everything being videotaped and [shown in the media]..",
                "- In the morning of 1 March, and later on the same day in the vicinity of the French Embassy, no shots were fired during the first half of the day. No firearms were used by the demonstrators. According to the 1 March press release of the Prosecutor General ’ s Office ..., grenades were found at Freedom Square in the morning, which raises a question: why were they not used? If the fleeing demonstrators indeed left pistols behind, as presented by public television channel, then how did it happen that during their dispersal, which included use of force and resistance, not a single shot was fired? Moreover, on the same day, in the vicinity of the French Embassy, the demonstrators were collecting stones and similar objects in order to “arm” themselves.",
                "- On 29 February [the President of Armenia, Robert Kocharyan] stated ... that among available solutions was the “cleaning of the Square” by the police. ... In [Armenia] the police and the National Security Service are under the de facto control of [the President]. Moreover, the government-controlled media asserted for several days that it was necessary to clean Opera Square ...",

Without any prior warning, the police officers started pouring water over the demonstrators, hitting them with electric shocks and then with batons. Numerous demonstrators were tortured. ...",

It is noteworthy that, to date, not a single criminal case has been initiated against any police officer, even for excessive use of physical force and of special means.",
                "- There were two police cordons at Freedom Square: one right on the square and the other one along the four adjacent streets. The purpose of those cordons was to keep everyone out so that the demonstration ended ...",
                "- Not all the persons gathered at Freedom Square were purported criminals. Among them were many demonstrators; therefore, the police operation directly resulted in the forcible termination of the demonstration ... According to eyewitness accounts, the demonstrators were chased far beyond Freedom Square. Some eyewitnesses claim that at the beginning there was not even a single gap and the demonstrators could not escape the blockade. Such allegations must be investigated with a particular focus on analysing the existing videotapes and eyewitness accounts.",
                "- ... While it is true that every day prior to 1 March the police announced over loudspeakers that the demonstration was unlawful and ordered the demonstrators to end it, no such order was made in the morning of 1 March. No time-limit was given to the demonstrators to end the demonstration [as required by section 14 of the Assemblies, Rallies, Marches and Demonstrations Act] ...",
                "- Regarding the events of the early morning of 1 March, it is still unknown what information had been received about the buildup of arms at Freedom Square. ... [All] the events held by [Mr Ter-Petrosyan] from 20 February had been entirely peaceful, which was even confirmed by senior officials of various international organisations ... ”",

Although the ad hoc committee which observed this election considered that it was “administered mostly in line with Council of Europe standards”, it found a number of violations and shortcomings, the most important of which were: unequal campaign conditions for the candidates, the lack of transparency of the election administration and a complaints and appeals process that did not give complainants access to an effective legal remedy. In addition, a number of cases of electoral fraud were witnessed.",

The Parliamentary Assembly regrets that the violations and shortcomings observed did nothing to restore the currently lacking public confidence in the electoral process and raised questions among a part of the Armenian public with regard to the credibility of the outcome of the election.

The Assembly deplores the clashes between the police and the protesters and the escalation of violence on 1 March 2008 which resulted in 10 deaths and about 200 people being injured. The exact circumstances that led to the tragic events of 1 March, as well as the manner in which they were handled by the authorities, including the imposition of a state of emergency in Yerevan from 1 to 20 March 2008 and the alleged excessive use of force by the police, are issues of considerable controversy and should be the subject of a credible independent investigation.",

While the outbreak of public resentment culminating in the tragic events of 1 March 2008 may have been unexpected, the Assembly believes that the underlying causes of the crisis are deeply rooted in the failure of the key institutions of the state to perform their functions in full compliance with democratic standards and the principles of the rule of law and the protection of human rights. More specifically",
                "6.3. despite successful legislative reforms, the courts still lack the necessary independence to inspire the public ’ s trust as impartial arbiters including in the context of the electoral process; this explains the low number of election-related complaints filed with them. The same lack of judicial independence is also reflected in the fact that the courts do not appear to question the necessity of keeping people in detention pending trial and generally respond favourably to requests by the prosecutors without properly weighing up the grounds for this, as required by Article 5, paragraph 3, of the European Convention on Human Rights ...;",
                "6.4. in the absence of adequate judicial control, the arrest and continuing detention of persons on seemingly artificial charges, after contesting the fairness of the presidential election or their participation in the protest afterwards can only point to the political motivation of such acts.

The project was undertaken to systematically gather information about compliance of the monitored trials with relevant domestic and international fair trial standards, as well as to identify possible shortcomings in the criminal justice system. For this purpose, between April 2008 and July 2009, the project staff monitored 93 criminal cases involving a total of 109 defendants.",
                "Many of the monitored cases revealed shortcomings with regard to a genuine procedural equality between prosecution and defence, contrary to the fair trial guarantees contained in national and international standards. Judges at times tended to treat the parties unequally, displaying openly friendly attitudes towards the prosecution and openly hostile attitudes towards the defence. In numerous trials, judges did not allow the defence to reasonably present their case and/or confront the prosecution witnesses. ... A related problematic issue encountered in a significant number of cases is the overreliance on incriminating police testimonies, which also casts doubts over the existence of equality of arms in the monitored cases. In several cases, statements of police witnesses were the primary basis for convictions, sometimes despite apparent procedural violations, contradictions and the lack of corroborating evidence. ...",
                "Defence lawyers regularly motioned the courts to summon witnesses, order forensic expertise, and introduce other additional evidence. Courts were generally reluctant to grant motions, often without any reasoning, although national legislation obliges the courts to give reasoning for these rulings. Such unsubstantiated denials of motions put the defence at a serious legal disadvantage, depriving it of an opportunity to present their cases on equal footing with the prosecution. As a result, in at least 44 monitored first instance cases the witness testimonies heard by the courts supported only the prosecution ’ s version of events. The defence was effectively prevented from access to potentially exonerating evidence and the opportunity to refute the testimony of prosecution witnesses. ...",
                "The use of testimonies by police officers was a prominent feature of several observed trials. Of 234 witnesses called by the prosecution in the monitored cases, 125 witnesses were police officers. The monitors reported 19 separate cases where charges were based on incriminating statements given by police officers. ... In 17 cases the testimony of police witnesses was the only witness testimony given in court and became the primary basis for court decisions. Results of the monitoring of these cases give rise to several concerns. Of the 19 cases featuring police witnesses, 13 defendants were charged with resistance to the police [under Article 316 of the CC]. Some of the police officers giving witness testimony in these cases were also recognized as victims. At least six defendants made allegations of police misconduct or brutality against them at the time of apprehension. These allegations were not investigated and no tainted evidence was excluded by the judges. In these circumstances, national law and international fair trial standards would create an expectation for the courts to make every effort to obtain and examine all relevant evidence and give the accused an effective opportunity to challenge the prosecution ’ s evidence. The courts, however, did not appear to make such an effort. Monitoring data indicates that judges readily accepted the testimonies of police witnesses and did not ask for corroborating evidence. In some cases, police testimonies were accepted by the judges even when there were significant contradictions between the pre-trial testimonies of these witnesses and their statements at trial, and when there were clear inconsistencies between the testimonies of different officers in the same case. At the same time, judges did not ask the prosecution to supply evidence corroborating the police testimonies and denied motions of the defence to summon witnesses ... While some of these motions were denied without any reasoning, in other instances judges told the defence that there was no need to invite witnesses whose ... statements ... had no substantial significance for the case or that the suggested witnesses would not provide impartial testimony because of their links with the defendant.”",

Armenia, no. 40094/05, § 162, 2 October 2012 ). Thus, the investigation into serious allegations of ill-treatment must be both prompt and thorough.

They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see El-Masri, cited above, § 183 ). While there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating use of lethal force or allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Mocanu and Others v.

His so- called “bringing-in” ( բերման ենթարկելը ), including the record drawn up in that respect, had been unlawful. Moreover, during that period he was questioned as a witness in the absence of a lawyer. The legal provisions regulating and defining the procedures of “ bringing - in ” and “ arrest ”, relied on by the Government, failed to meet the requirements of certainty and foreseeability. In particular, in accordance with Article 128 of the CCP, as interpreted by the Court of Cassation in its decision of 18 December 2009 (see paragraph 123 above), the procedural status of a suspect was effective only from the moment when the record of his arrest was drawn up. Thus, the procedure of “ bringing - in ”, which was an initial stage of deprivation of liberty of a suspect largely practised in Armenia, lacked legal certainty. Article 153 of the CCP, which defined the concept of “bringing - in ”, was not applicable in his case, while the only other Article of the CCP which mentioned that procedure was Article 180 § 2. As a result, after having been “brought - in ” at 6.30 a.m. on 1 March 2008, he was kept in a state of uncertainty as a non-suspect in a police cell until, at 10 .30 p.m., the record of his arrest was drawn up. The lack of legal certainty had also been acknowledged by the Court of Cassation in its above-mentioned decision, whereby it attempted to add some certainty to the status of those who, like the applicant, were brought in but no record of arrest was drawn up to enable them to obtain the status of a suspect. The applicant lastly submitted that he had been taken into custody at around 6.30 a.m. on 1 March 2008 but taken before a judge only at 7 p.m. on 4 March 2008. Thus, he had been kept at the police station for an extra twelve and a half hours, in excess of the maximum 72 ‑ hour period for arrest allowed by Article 129 of the CCP.

Until then he had the procedural status of a “ brought -in person ” ( բերվածի կարգավիճակ ). During that period the applicant, as a “ brought -in person ”, could be questioned about the circumstances of his bringing - in and those giving rise to the reasonable suspicion. As a “ brought - in person ”, he had the right to remain silent and to be questioned in the presence of his lawyer. Furthermore, according to Article 86 § 5, a witness had the right not to testify against himself. The record of the applicant ’ s questioning of 1 March 2008 showed that he had been informed of his rights as a witness, including the right not to testify, and that he had availed himself of that right."

The Court reiterates that an arrest or detention under sub-paragraph (c) must, like any deprivation of liberty under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, be “lawful” and “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law”. Those two expressions, which overlap to an extent, refer essentially to domestic law and lay down the obligation to comply with its substantive and procedural rules. That is not, however, sufficient; Article 5 § 1 of the Convention also requires that domestic law itself be compatible with the rule of law. This in particular means that a law which permits deprivation of liberty must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application. It also means that an arrest or detention must be compatible with the aim of Article 5 § 1, which is to prevent arbitrary deprivation of liberty (see Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC], no. 72508/13, § 186, ECHR 2017 (extracts)). It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 § 1 and the notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 67, ECHR 2008-...)."

The Court notes, however, that the Government did not contest the applicant ’ s submission that he had been taken to the police station at around 6.30 a.m. on 1 March 2008 and, as already indicated, since there is evidence in the case file which supports this account of events, it has no reasons not to accept 6.30 a.m. as the time when the applicant was taken to Kentron Police Station."

A question therefore arises as to whether the applicant was deprived of his liberty during that period and, if so, whether his deprivation of liberty complied with the requirement of “lawfulness” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. Furthermore, in so far as the applicant complained, among other things, that he had been brought before a judge after the expiry of the maximum 72-hour time-limit permitted by domestic law and had not been released on the expiry of that period as required by domestic law, the Court notes that this complaint does not, as such, raise the question of whether the applicant was “brought promptly before a judge” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. Rather, the primary question raised is whether the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty during the period before the court ’ s detention order was in compliance with the specific requirements of domestic law applicable to that period of deprivation of liberty. Therefore, in so far as the complaint concerns the “lawfulness” of the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty during that period, it similarly falls to be examined under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Farhad Aliyev v.

The Court therefore has no reasons to doubt that between 6.30 a.m. and 10.30 p.m. on 1 March 2008 the applicant was deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.

Furthermore, the Government admitted that the applicant ’ s “ arrest ” had been effected on an immediate suspicion of his having committed an offence, as provided by Article 129 of the CCP (see paragraph 104 above). The Government argued, however, that the applicant ’ s “arrest” within the meaning of those provisions was effective only from 10.30 p.m. on 1 March 2008, that is the moment when the record of his arrest was presented to him. Until then he was formally neither “arrested ” nor a “suspect” within the meaning of domestic law but had the status of a “brought -in person”, having been apparently put through a pre-arrest procedure called “bringing-in”."

The Court notes, however, that none of the Articles of the CCP cited by the Government – or indeed any other Article of the CCP – contains any rules concerning the alleged status of a “brought-in person”, including an explanation of such a notion and of any rights and obligations arising from that status. The only formal status – recognised by the CCP – of a person arrested on suspicion of having committed an offence was that of a suspect under Article 62 of the CCP (see paragraph 101 above). The Court further notes that the only Article of the CCP that prescribed a procedure called “bringing -in” was Article 153 which, however, did not apply to a person taken into custody on suspicion of having committed an offence and concerned a different type of situation, that is when a person was taken forcibly before the investigating authority because of a failure to appear upon the latter ’ s summons (see paragraph 110 above).

It is true that Article 180 § 2 of the CCP, relied on by the Government, also mentioned the possibility of “ bringing a person in ” on suspicion of their having committed an offence (see paragraph 111 above). However, firstly, that Article concerned specifically cases in which authorities were called upon to investigate crime reports, as opposed to a situation like the applicant ’ s, in which a person was taken into custody on an immediate suspicion of having committed an offence. It is therefore questionable that that provision, which moreover was never cited in any of the documents related to the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty, was applicable in his case. Secondly, even assuming that this provision was applicable, it is doubtful that it satisfied the principle of legal certainty. In particular, it is not clear what was meant by the phrase “persons may be brought in ” on a suspicion of having committed an offence and what procedure this implied, given that the only procedure for short-term deprivation of liberty of a person on suspicion of their having committed an offence was defined under the CCP as “arrest”. In that sense, the wording of Article 180 § 2 appears to be in conflict with other relevant provisions of the CCP, including Articles 6, 34, 62, 128 and 129 (see paragraphs 109, 100, 101, 103 and 104 above)."

                "172. The Court also notes that the concept of a “brought-in person” appears to have been developed for the first time by the Court of Cassation in its decision of 18 December 2009 (see paragraph 123 above), taken after the circumstances of the present case. Nothing suggests that, prior to that decision, the relevant provisions of the CCP, including Articles 128 and 180, had been interpreted – whether separately or in combination with each other – by the domestic courts in such a manner as to provide for a pre ‑ arrest procedure called “bringing-in”. Nor do the particular circumstances of the applicant ’ s case suggest that his deprivation of liberty before 10.30 p.m. on 1 March 2008 was pursuant to such a procedure. In particular, the only document which mentioned that the applicant was “ brought in ” was a record entitled “record of bringing- in ”, a handwritten document drawn up at some point after the applicant had been taken to the police station (see paragraph 24 above). However, according to Article 131.1 of the CCP, the only record which was to be drawn up in such cases was the record of a suspect ’ s arrest and there was no mention in the CCP of a “record of bringing- in” ( see paragraph 106 above). Thus, the record in question lacked any basis in domestic law. Furthermore, during that period the applicant was questioned as a witness (see paragraph 32 above). No explanation has been provided by the Government as to why the applicant was formally treated as a witness, assuming that he allegedly had the status of a so-called “brought-in person” during that period."
            ],
            [
                "173. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is nothing in law or the particular circumstances of the applicant ’ s case to support the Government ’ s explanation regarding the initial hours of the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty. Having regard to those circumstances, the Court notes that, although the applicant was de facto deprived of his liberty and taken to the police station at around 6.30 a.m. on 1 March 2008, a formal record of his arrest was not drawn up until 10.30 p.m. on the same day. During that entire period the applicant was not treated formally as an arrested person and the domestic provisions applicable to arrested persons were not applied to him. He was questioned as a witness and his status was formalised and he was considered to be “arrested” and consequently a “suspect” only sixteen hours after his forced appearance at the police station. Not only was this in breach of the requirement under Article 131.1 of the CCP that a record of a suspect ’ s arrest be drawn up within three hours after bringing him before the relevant authority (see paragraph 106 above), but it also left the applicant without any sense of certainty as to his personal liberty and security and deprived him of all the rights enjoyed by an arrested suspect under the CCP, including the right to have a lawyer and to inform his family immediately (see paragraph 102 above). Moreover, the record of the applicant ’ s arrest, once drawn up, indicated 10.30 p.m. as the starting point of his arrest, as opposed to the time when the applicant had been de facto deprived of his liberty, thereby effectively leaving the initial sixteen hours of the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty formally unacknowledged. Even accepting that a short period may elapse between a person ’ s de facto arrest and the formalising of that person ’ s status as an arrested person (see Farhad Aliyev, cited above, § 165), the Court draws a distinction between the starting point of an arrest with the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention and the formalities that are to be followed in order to formalise that procedure. It would be unacceptable to link the starting point of a person ’ s arrest to the implementation and completion of such formalities rather than the moment from which a person is de facto deprived of his liberty. Such excessive formalism cannot be compatible with the letter and spirit of Article 5 of the Convention and is bound to lead to arbitrary deprivation of liberty."

            [
                "174. The Court further notes that, where there was a suspicion that a person had committed an offence, domestic law authorised the law ‑ enforcement authorities to arrest and keep in custody the suspected or accused person with the purpose of initiating or furthering an investigation and bringing him before a judge authorised to rule on his continued detention. Article 129 § 2 of the CCP stated that a person ’ s arrest might not exceed 72 hours from the moment of being taken into custody (see paragraph 104 above). Furthermore, Article 132 § 1 (3) of the CCP unequivocally required an arrested person ’ s release, if no court order to detain him or her was issued within those 72 hours (see paragraph 107 above). Accordingly, beyond the initial 72 -hour period, an arrested person could be detained only on the basis of a court order remanding him or her in custody. In the present case, the applicant was taken into custody within the meaning of Article 129 of the CCP at around 6.30 a.m. on 1 March 2008, whereas the court hearing concerning his detention took place at 7 p.m. on 4 March 2008 (see paragraph 43 above). Accordingly, prior to being brought before a judge, the applicant remained in police custody for at least 84 hours, that is about twelve and a half hours in excess of the maximum period permitted by domestic law. Such a continued arrest without a judicial order for the time exceeding the 72-hour period prescribed by Article 129 § 2 of the CCP was incompatible with the domestic law and, therefore, unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Farhad Aliyev, cited above, § 168)."

The Court notes that the applicant ’ s complaints relate to the lawfulness of two short periods of his arrest, the one preceding the drawing up of the record of his arrest and the one following the expiry of the initial 72 hours of his arrest until he was brought before a court. These periods lasted about 1 6 hours and 12 hours respectively. The Government suggested that, prior to being brought before a judge on 4 March 2008, the applicant should have raised these complaints before the courts, resorting to the procedures prescribed by Articles 103 and 290 of the CCP."

As regards Article 290, the Government did not provide any details of the redress which the applicant would be able to obtain by resorting to this procedure. In any event, from their observations it follows that the applicant was supposed to resort to this procedure while still in police custody. The same can be assumed from the wording of that provision, which spoke about the possibility of “ [ putting] an end to a violation of a person ’ s rights and freedoms ” and therefore applied to situations in which an alleged violation was still ongoing. Having regard to the overall circumstances of the applicant ’ s arrest and in the absence of any concrete examples and explanations by the Government, the Court does not consider that the Government demonstrated convincingly that this was an effective and accessible remedy capable of providing redress and offering reasonable prospects of success in the circumstances of the case."

However, the courts in question were not called upon to decide on the particular aspects of the lawfulness of the applicant ’ s short-term arrest, but rather to examine the investigator ’ s application and to rule on the question of whether there were sufficient grounds to detain the applicant.

The police officers had not been trustworthy and impartial witnesses because their own actions had been unlawful, including the brutal attack on the demonstrators and his subsequent ill-treatment. Thus, the alleged resistance to police had happened in circumstances where he himself had been subjected to ill-treatment. The police at various levels of command had been heavily involved in the pre- and post-election events, either unlawfully or within their official capacity, and the letter of 27 March 2008 of the Deputy Chief of the Armenian Police had served as a sort of instruction on how to testify in trials against the demonstrators. Since these trials concerned the standoff between the authorities and the opposition, no police officer could have been unbiased and impartial when testifying before the courts and actually all those who had testified against members of the opposition like himself had been promoted in office shortly thereafter. There had been instances of police officers making openly false statements, however, none of them had been held responsible. In support of the latter allegation the applicant submitted a copy of a judgment in another demonstrator ’ s case, in which police officers had testified that the demonstrator in question had resisted them at the time of arrest, until a video recording emerged showing that the police officers in question had not even been there at the time of that demonstrator ’ s arrest."

In the context of taking evidence, the Court has paid particular attention to compliance with the principle of equality of arms, which is one of the fundamental aspects of a fair hearing and which implies that the applicant must be “afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent” (see Kasparov and Others v.

The Court has previously held that in circumstances where the applicant ’ s conviction was based primarily on the assumption of his being in a particular place at a particular time, the principle of equality of arms and, more generally, the right to a fair trial, imply that the applicant should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to challenge the assumption effectively (see Popov, cited above, § 183, and Polyakov v. Russia, no. 77018/01, § 36, 29 January 2009). When a request by a defendant to examine witnesses is not vexatious, is sufficiently reasoned, is relevant to the subject matter of the accusation and could arguably have strengthened the position of the defence or even led to his acquittal, the domestic authorities must provide relevant reasons for dismissing such a request (see Topić v.

While the domestic courts, in convicting the applicant, referred to some evidence other than the statements of the police officers, the only evidence which directly implicated the applicant in the commission of such acts and provided their details was the statements in question, including those of police officers A.Arsh., A.Aru., H.S., E.R., and A.A.

It found that, in those proceedings, the courts had accepted the submissions of the police readily and unequivocally and had denied the applicants any opportunity to adduce any proof to the contrary. It held that in the dispute over the key facts underlying the charges where the only witnesses for the prosecution were the police officers who had played an active role in the contested events, it was indispensable for the courts to use every reasonable opportunity to check their incriminating statements (see Kasparov and Others, cited above, § 64; Navalnyy and Yashin v.

The circumstances underlying the charges against the applicant, including those surrounding the police operation at Freedom Square and his alleged assaults on the two police officers, were disputed by the parties. However, the domestic courts, presented with two irreconcilable versions of events, failed to check the factual allegations made by the police officers and decided to base their judgments exclusively on the version put forward by them, accepting their submissions readily and unequivocally, while denying the applicant the possibility of adducing any proof to the contrary. The applicant ’ s requests to have a number of witnesses called and examined in court, which were sufficiently substantiated and of direct relevance to the charges against him, were all dismissed with either no or very brief and unconvincing reasoning. The Court finds this particularly problematic, taking into account the existence of a number of significant ambiguities, inconsistencies and contradictions in the materials of the criminal case, including in the witness testimony, regarding such important issues as the time, purpose and conduct of the police operation and the time and circumstances of the applicant ’ s arrest, as well as the fact that the evidence on which the charges of assaults were mainly based had come to light as a result of the applicant ’ s identification by the two police officers in question more than five months after the alleged incidents, which significantly diminished the reliability of that evidence. This is even more so in view of the fact that the disputed incidents appear to have taken place rather early in the day when it was not quite light, and – at least the one at Freedom Square – in very chaotic circumstances involving hundreds of demonstrators and police officers. Even if the persons whom the applicant sought to call as witnesses could have shed light primarily on the events at Freedom Square, the Court considers that such evidence could, nevertheless, have allowed the applicant to challenge all the charges against him, in view of the close link, both temporal and consequential, between the various acts imputed to him."

All of the applicant ’ s arguments and submissions remained practically unaddressed by the domestic courts, regardless of their strength and relevance, including those pointing out the above-mentioned inconsistencies in the materials of the criminal case and casting doubt on the quality of certain evidence. This includes the fairly strong and substantiated argument which the applicant raised regarding the pre-trial statements of police officers E.R., H.S. and A.A. being identical word for word, as well as in conflict with the statements made by those witnesses in court. The domestic courts did not address this argument and did not take it into account when relying on that witness testimony as a basis for the applicant ’ s conviction despite the reliability, credibility and personal integrity of those witnesses being seriously in doubt. Had the applicant ’ s argument been successful, it would have been capable of influencing a fair tribunal ’ s overall assessment of whether there had been sufficiently strong evidence to prove the applicant ’ s guilt (see, mutatis mutandis, Huseyn and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 35485/05 and 3 others, § 205, 26 July 2011). It is noteworthy that the testimony of the police officers in question was the sole evidence on which the applicant ’ s conviction for illegally carrying a bladed weapon was based, as well as forming a decisive part of the evidence relied on in convicting the applicant of assaulting police officer A.Aru. at Arshakunyats Street. The Court has previously held that inconsistencies between a witness ’ s own statements given at various times, as well as serious inconsistencies between different types of evidence produced by the prosecution, give rise to a serious ground for challenging the credibility of the witness and the probative value of his or her testimony; as such, this type of challenge constitutes an objection capable of influencing the assessment of the factual circumstances of the case based on that evidence and, ultimately, the outcome of the trial (see ibid., § 206).

Their unreserved endorsement of the police version of events, failure to address properly any of the applicant ’ s submissions and refusal to examine the defence witnesses without proper regard to the relevance of their statements can be said to have led to a limitation of the defence rights incompatible with the guarantees of a fair hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, Kasparov and Others, cited above, § 66 )."

He had been accused of resisting unidentified police officers and several months later, in order to justify the proceedings against him, a false hypothesis had been advanced, according to which after fleeing from Freedom Square, about 30 minutes later he had been in an area a few kilometres away, near the Yerevan Press Building, where he had resisted the same police officer whom he had encountered at Freedom Square and had been arrested.

An army of thousands of police officers had launched an unlawful and unjustified attack on peaceful demonstrators, accompanied with use of excessive force, thereby artificially provoking a clash with opposition supporters in order to initiate criminal cases against them and carry out State-sponsored persecution.

Thus, it should not be interpreted restrictively. As such, this right covers both private meetings and meetings in public places, whether static or in the form of a procession; in addition, it can be exercised by individual participants and by the persons organising the gathering (see Djavit An v.

Furthermore, while technically it was the camp which was broken up as a result of the police operation in question, the camp was part of a much bigger assembly which had been going on at Freedom Square since 20 February 2008, attracting thousands of people, and which is at the heart of the present case. The Government argued that the assembly in question was not peaceful, alleging that the authorities had obtained evidence that weapons and ammunition were to be distributed to the demonstrators on 1 March 2008 in order to instigate mass disorder and that the demonstrators had been the first to attack the police at Freedom Square."

Moldova (no. 2), no. 25196/04, § 23, 2 February 2010 ). It notes at the outset that there is no evidence to suggest that the demonstrations held at Freedom Square from 20 February 2008, in protest against the conduct of the presidential election which many opposition supporters believed to have been flawed, involved incitement to violence or any acts of violence prior to the police operation conducted in the early morning of 1 March 2008. As to the Government ’ s allegation that the authorities had obtained evidence suggesting that the demonstrators had been planning to arm themselves in order to instigate mass disorder, the Court notes that the Government have failed to produce the evidence in question or even to provide any relevant details or explanations. The courts examining the applicant ’ s criminal case did not scrutinise any such evidence either and simply relied on the letter of 27 March 2008 of the Deputy Chief of the Armenian Police which in its turn referred, in very broad terms, to “intelligence information received” (see paragraph 22 above). The nature and source of the alleged intelligence information, however, are unclear and appear never to have been revealed or examined at any stage of the proceedings. The Court further notes that no evidence has been produced by the Government linking the weapons allegedly found at Freedom Square, including pistols, grenades and “ hedgehog-like ” sharp objects, to any of the demonstrators (see paragraph 14 above). Nor is there any evidence to suggest that any firearms, explosives or bladed weapons were used by the demonstrators during the police operation at Freedom Square, which is somewhat surprising given the allegation that they were armed with such weapons and intended to start an armed riot."

The Court notes, at the same time, that the applicant did not deny that there had been scuffles between the demonstrators and the police during the police operation at Freedom Square. However, the mere fact that acts of violence occur in the course of a gathering cannot, of itself, be sufficient to find that its organisers had violent intentions ( see Karpyuk and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 30582/04 and 32152/04, § 202, 6 October 2015 ). The Court has previously examined a number of cases where the demonstrators had engaged in acts of violence and found that the demonstrations in question had been within the scope of Article 11 of the Convention on the basis that the organisers of these assemblies had not expressed violent intentions and there were no grounds to believe that the assemblies were not meant to be peaceful (see Nurettin Aldemir and Others v. Turkey, nos. 32124/02, 32126/02, 32129/02, 32132/02, 32133/02, 32137/02 and 32138/02, § 45, 18 December 2007; Protopapa v. Turkey, no. 16084/90, § 104, 24 February 2009; Uzunget and Others v.

Furthermore, where both sides – demonstrators and police – were involved in violent acts, it is sometimes necessary to examine who started the violence and whether the applicant personally was among those responsible for the initial acts of aggression which contributed to the deterioration of the assembly ’ s initial peaceful character (see Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, § 157, 12 June 2014)."

                "232. The Government alleged in the present case that the demonstrators had been the first to attack the police, which proved that they had had violent intentions. The applicant, however, contested such an account of events, both before this Court and the domestic courts (see, by contrast, Primov and Others, cited above, § 158 ) and claimed that, in fact, the exact opposite had happened and the police had been the first to attack the peaceful demonstrators camping at Freedom Square, brutally dispersing the assembly and intentionally provoking clashes. The Court notes that the Government ’ s allegation appears to be based on the official account of events as provided in the above-mentioned letter of the Deputy Chief of the Armenian Police (see paragraph 22 above). Those findings, however, do not appear to have been reached as a result of any impartial and independent investigation and seem to be based entirely on the testimony of the police officers who had played an active role in the events of 1-2 March 2008, including the confrontation at Freedom Square, and were, moreover, alleged to have used excessive force against the demonstrators. The findings in question are not backed by any objective evidence and, moreover, appear to contradict a number of other materials of the criminal case, including the decision to institute criminal case no. 62202508 and several other documents, from which it appears that the clash at Freedom Square between the demonstrators and the police may in fact have been the consequence of certain unspecified measures taken by the police, aimed at forcibly terminating the demonstration, as opposed to it being a preemptive attack by the demonstrators as alleged by the Government (see paragraphs 15, 28, 29, 30 and 39 above). It is noteworthy that the courts examining the applicant ’ s criminal case did not in any way address the circumstances of the clash, including the question of who initiated it, omitting from their judgments any relevant details. Even the applicant ’ s disputed assault on police officer A.Arsh. was presented as a sporadic act, without any assessment of whether the violence was premeditated or a spontaneous development (see paragraph 84 above). It is true that the applicant was also found to have carried a clasp knife, which may suggest that he had had violent intentions. However, taking into account the manner in which that finding was reached and the evidence on which it was based (see paragraphs 208 - 210 above ), as well as the absence of any evidence or even a suggestion that the applicant ever tried to put the alleged knife to use, the Court does not consider this, in the particular circumstances of the case, to be a sufficient and reliable element to deprive him of the protection of Article 11 of the Convention. The Court lastly notes that there are a number of credible reports produced by various international and domestic bodies regarding the events of 1 March 2008 which allege that the demonstrations at Freedom Square were peaceful and cast doubt on the official account of events, including the circumstances of the clash between the demonstrators and the police (see paragraphs 124, 125, 129, 131, 132 and 134 above). Lastly, the Government, while referring to the testimony of a person called V.N., did not, however, provide any details or explanation regarding the identity of that person, his alleged involvement in the events of 1-2 March 2008 or the relevance of his testimony to the applicant ’ s particular case."

                "234. The Court further notes that the Government did not dispute the existence of an interference, other than arguing that the assembly had not been peaceful. It also notes that the police operation in question effectively resulted in a dispersal of the assembly at Freedom Square and therefore interfered with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of assembly. Furthermore, the punitive measures taken afterwards included the applicant ’ s prosecution and detention for a number of acts allegedly committed during the assembly at Freedom Square, including publicly inciting a violent overthrow of the government, publicly insulting public officials, inciting disobedience of the police officers ’ orders to end the assembly and assaulting a police officer, the latter being the only charge that resulted in the applicant ’ s conviction (for similar instances of interferences see, for example, Balçık and Others v. Turkey, no. 25/02, §§ 41-42, 29 November 2007; Nurettin Aldemir and Others, cited above, §§ 34-35; Protopapa, cited above, § 104; Gafgaz Mammadov v. Azerbaijan, no. 60259/11, §§ 52-53, 15 October 2015; and Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, §§ 171-172 ). It is true that the applicant was also convicted of two other acts, namely assaulting another police officer on Arshakunyats Street and carrying a knife, which per se do not appear to be directly related to the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly. The Court notes, however, that those acts also were found to have been committed in the context of the applicant ’ s participation in the same assembly and the confrontation between the demonstrators and the police that ensued. The Court therefore finds it hard, in the light of the case as a whole, to dissociate those events from the rest of the applicant ’ s case under Article 11 of the Convention and is prepared to assume that the entirety of the facts on which the applicant ’ s prosecution and conviction were based can be regarded, on arguable grounds, as an instance of an “interference” with his right to freedom of peaceful assembly."

The applicant contested that account of events and claimed that the purpose of the police operation had been to terminate the assembly. He disputed the factual basis for his prosecution and conviction and alleged that he had not done anything illegal either during the assembly or its dispersal and the criminal case against him had been politically motivated and fabricated in order to punish him for being an opposition supporter and taking an active part in the demonstrations."

The Court has emphasised on many occasions that it is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case. As a general rule, where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court ’ s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and it is for the latter to establish the facts on the basis of the evidence before them. Though the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and remains free to make its own appreciation in the light of all the material before it, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by the domestic courts (see Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, § 180, ECHR 2011 (extracts), and Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09 and 2 others, § 61, ECHR 2012 ).

In the case of Hakobyan and Others, the Court found that during a period when opposition rallies had been held in protest against the results of the presidential election of 2003 there had been an administrative practice of deterring or preventing opposition activists from participating in those rallies, or punishing them for having done so, by resorting to the procedure of short-term imprisonment under the Code of Administrative Offences, including on such grounds as using foul language or disobeying police orders in circumstances unrelated to the rallies. Finding that the applicants, three opposition supporters, had fallen victim to that practice, the Court rejected the factual basis for their convictions on those grounds and concluded that the true reason for their imprisonment was to prevent or discourage them from participating in the ongoing opposition protests (see Hakobyan and Others, cited above, §§ 90-99 )."

                "243. The Court notes several similarities between the present case and the case of Hakobyan and Others. Firstly, it similarly concerns a period of increased political sensitivity in Armenia involving opposition rallies held in protest against an allegedly unfair presidential election result (compare with Hakobyan and Others, cited above, § 90). The response of the authorities that followed, including the arrests and detention of scores of opposition supporters, was condemned by the PACE and was described as a “ de facto crackdown on the opposition”. The charges brought against many of them were suspected to have been “artificial and politically motivated”, especially those based solely on police evidence (see paragraphs 125 and 127 above). It appears also from one of the reports by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights that the authorities may have been collecting information on the participants in the opposition rallies (see paragraph 130 above). Moreover, the applicant ’ s name specifically appeared in one of the Commissioner ’ s reports regarding the events in question (see paragraph 131 above). Secondly, the proceedings against the applicant were conducted in a very similar manner. The entire case against him was similarly based exclusively on police testimony and the findings of fact made by the domestic courts similarly appear to have been a mere and unquestioned recapitulation of the circumstances as presented in that testimony, lacked details and were strikingly succinct (see paragraphs 208 - 210 above and paragraph 249 below and compare with Hakobyan and Others, cited above, § 98). Such similarities, including the above-mentioned reports by various Council of Europe bodies, are a cause for grave concern and call for special vigilance and scrutiny on the part of the Court in dealing with the applicant ’ s particular case."

                "244. The Court notes that following the presidential election of 19 February 2008 large crowds, including opposition leaders and supporters, gathered from 20 February 2008 at Freedom Square on a daily basis to take part in a political debate on a matter of serious public concern, namely the conduct and the result of the presidential election which many believed to have been flawed. There is no dispute between the parties that the assembly was conducted without prior notification as required under domestic law (see paragraph 119 above). The Court reiterates in this connection that, although it is not a priori contrary to the spirit of Article 11 if, for reasons of public order and national security, a High Contracting Party requires that the holding of meetings be subject to authorisation, an unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation, does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see, among other authorities, Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 39 and 42, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIV, and Kasparov and Others, cited above, § 91). The appropriate “degree of tolerance” cannot be defined in abstracto : the Court must look at the particular circumstances of the case and particularly the extent of the “disruption of ordinary life” (see Primov and Others, cited above, § 145)."
            ],

                "245. The Court has already held that the assembly at Freedom Square was peaceful and nothing suggests that it was not intended to be so (see paragraph 233 above). Indeed, it appears that the authorities allowed the assembly, including a camp which the demonstrators had set up, to proceed and did not make any attempts to break it up for nine days, until it was terminated as a result of the police operation conducted in the early morning of 1 March 2008. As already indicated above, the circumstances of the police operation in question, including its purpose and conduct, are disputed by the parties. The Court is, however, mindful of its finding that the Government have failed to produce any convincing evidence in support of their version of events to suggest that arms were to be distributed to the demonstrators on 1 March 2008. Furthermore, the Government have not provided any evidence or details regarding the planning, organisation and command of the operation in question, including who ordered and oversaw it, the specific police units and the number of police officers involved and the specific measures taken. At the same time, it appears that this was a very large - scale operation involving several hundred police officers and different police forces, including riot police. An operation of such magnitude would have undoubtedly required a certain amount of time to plan and organise and it is unclear how this was done in less than 24 hours, if it is to be believed that the alleged intelligence information was received by the police on the day preceding the operation, namely 29 February 2008. Lastly, as already indicated above, it appears from the decision to institute criminal case no. 62202508 and several other documents, including testimony of police officers who had allegedly participated in the police operation, that the sole purpose of the operation was to disperse the assembly at Freedom Square and that the measures taken by the police that morning were aimed at achieving that objective (see 15, 28, 29, 30 and 39 ). This version of events, however, was – at first partly and later completely – abandoned by the investigation and an inspection for weapons was presented as the sole purpose of the police operation (see the decisions to bring charges against the applicant of 3 March and 5 August 2008 in paragraphs 41 and 68 above ). No explanation has been provided by the authorities or the Government for such striking contradictions. The Court, however, finds it hard to believe that this could have been a simple omission and, in fact, it gives an impression of a deliberate attempt to cover up, or at the very least not to reveal, the main, if not the only, purpose of the police operation. In sum, the Court does not find the official explanation of the purpose of the police operation of 1 March 2008 to be sufficiently credible and, having regard to all the materials in its possession, has no reason to doubt that the objective of the police intervention in the early morning of 1 March 2008 was to disperse the camp and those present at Freedom Square and to prevent the further conduct of the assembly."

                "246. The Government argued that the dispersal had been justified because the authorities had tolerated the assembly long enough and therefore it had not been unreasonable to disperse it. It is true that the assembly had lasted nine days, apparently without any significant interruption or intervention by the authorities. This reason alone, however, was not sufficient, in the Court ’ s opinion, to break up the assembly without any specific evidence that it posed a real danger to public order or constituted an intentional serious disruption by the demonstrators to ordinary life and to the activities lawfully carried out by others to a more significant extent than that caused by the normal exercise of the right of peaceful assembly (see, by contrast, Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 173, and the cases cited therein). It does not appear that the assembly caused any intentional or even unintentional obstruction of traffic. Nor was its purpose to obstruct the lawful exercise of an activity by others but to have a debate and to create a platform for expression on a public matter of major political importance which was directly related to the functioning of a democracy and was of serious concern to large segments of the Armenian society. Therefore, a greater degree of tolerance should have been demonstrated in the present case than that shown by the authorities. The Court does not find the Government ’ s reference to the case of Cisse v. France to be relevant since, in contrast to that case, no justification for the dispersal of the assembly has been put forward by the Government in the present case other than its duration (see Cisse, cited above, §§ 51-52)."

Some of those reports allege also that no prior order was given by the police for the demonstrators to disperse (see paragraphs 124 and 134 above).

As regards the punitive measures taken against the applicant, the Court notes that the applicant was arrested – apparently shortly after the dispersal of the assembly – at a location about 2 km away from Freedom Square, namely at Grigor Lusavorich Street near the Yerevan circus, where he had fled after the assembly had been dispersed. It was alleged by the arresting officers that they had witnessed the applicant resist and disobey some unidentified police officers near the circus and this was indicated as one of the reasons for taking him into custody. More importantly, however, as the second reason the officers noted that the applicant had organised unauthorised demonstrations at Freedom Square in support of Mr Ter ‑ Petrosyan (see paragraphs 24, 27 and 28 above). It is unclear, however, on what grounds the arresting officers, who had apprehended the applicant at a considerable distance from Freedom Square, assumed that he had participated in and, moreover, organised the opposition demonstrations. This suggests that the officers either knew the applicant as an active demonstrator or at the very least had followed him from Freedom Square. Later that day the investigator indicated Articles 225.1 § 2 and 316 § 2 of the CC as the grounds for the applicant ’ s arrest, which prescribed penalties for somewhat different acts, namely inciting disobedience of an order to end an unlawful assembly and assaulting a public official in a life- and health-threatening way. While the record of the applicant ’ s arrest contained no factual information whatsoever to back those suspicions, it can, nevertheless, be inferred from the charges later brought against the applicant that those suspicions concerned the assembly at Freedom Square and acts which the applicant was believed to have committed during its dispersal (see paragraphs 34 and 41 above). Again, it is not clear on what grounds the applicant was presumed to have participated in the assembly at Freedom Square and, moreover, committed certain unlawful acts in that context, especially since at that point he had not yet even been questioned in connection with those events."
            ],
            [
                "250. The Court further notes that the applicant was subsequently charged and detained under the above-mentioned Articles 225.1 § 2 and 316 § 2, as well as Articles 301 and 318 § 1 of the CC which prescribed penalties for making calls for a violent overthrow of the government and publicly insulting public officials (see paragraph 41 above). The Court notes, however, that no specific evidence or factual background was provided for any of those charges, presumably committed by the applicant during the assembly and its dispersal. While the decision to bring charges and the applicant ’ s detention order did mention that he had organised and conducted demonstrations which involved calls for a violent overthrow of the government and insults addressed at public officials and that he had later disobeyed and assaulted police officers (see paragraphs 41 and 45 above), none of those documents referred to any evidence or contained any relevant factual details. It was not specified whether the applicant himself made any calls and insults and, if he did, the nature of such calls and insults. Nor were the nature and method of infliction of the alleged assaults mentioned, or the identity of any alleged victims of such assaults. The same applies to the alleged incitement to disobedience. In sum, the facts on which the charges were based were not backed by any evidence, were drafted in very general and abstract terms, without any specific details of the acts allegedly committed by the applicant, and appeared to amount to a mere citation of the relevant Articles of the CC. It therefore appears that the applicant was prosecuted and detained for simply having actively participated in, and possibly organised, the assembly at Freedom Square as opposed to having committed any specific reprehensible act in its course. Moreover, it appears from the circumstances of the applicant ’ s arrest, as described above, that he may have been known to the authorities as an active demonstrator. The same appears from the memorandum of the Chief of Kentron Police Station which stated that the applicant had been taken into custody for being an “activist” of the assembly at Freedom Square (see paragraph 30 above ). The Court considers that the dispersal of the peaceful assembly and subsequent rounding -up and detention of its activists or other peaceful participants without any evidence that they had personally committed any reprehensible acts, as happened in the applicant ’ s case, cannot be regarded as a measure “necessary in a democratic society”."
            ],
            [
                "251. The Court notes that the applicant was prosecuted and detained on such grounds for at least five months until most of the charges against him were dropped, mostly for lack of evidence (see paragraphs 67 above). Practically at the same time, new evidence and charges emerged and the applicant was accused of two assaults on police officers and illegally carrying a knife. The applicant alleged that those charges had been artificial and fabricated in order to convict him at all cost for being an opposition activist. The Court notes that the applicant ’ s allegations do not appear to be without merit and points out the following. Firstly, the manner in which the criminal case against the applicant was initially conducted and the fact that, as already indicated above, he was prosecuted and detained for almost five months for basically taking an active part in the demonstrations in itself raises questions regarding the motives of the applicant ’ s prosecution. Secondly, it is unclear why no charges were brought against the applicant for such a long period of time if a knife had indeed been found in his possession on the very first day of his arrest. The same applies to the applicant ’ s alleged assault on a police officer at Arshakunyats Street (which was earlier described as “resistance and disobedience to police officers ”). While this allegation was raised already at the time of his arrest, no investigative measures were taken during that entire period to obtain any evidence in that connection, including establishing the identity of any victims. Nor were there any attempts made to obtain evidence in support of the charge of assault at Freedom Square; all this despite the fact that police officers A.Arsh. and A.Aru. appear to have given their testimony as early as on 2 and 11 March 2008 respectively (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Thirdly, as already noted above, according to the relevant PACE reports, charges against opposition supporters based solely on police evidence could have been “artificial and politically motivated” (see paragraphs 125 and 127 above)."

                "252. While all of the above-mentioned is a cause for grave concern, the Court, nevertheless, is not in a position, nor is it its duty, to determine whether the charges against the applicant were substantiated and it was the duty of the domestic courts to check the veracity of the underlying facts. The Court reiterates in this connection that the obligation to provide reasons for a decision is an essential procedural safeguard under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, as it demonstrates to the parties that their arguments have been heard, affords them the possibility of objecting to or appealing against the decision, and also serves to justify the reasons for a judicial decision to the public. This general rule, moreover, translates into specific obligations under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention, by requiring domestic courts to provide “relevant” and “sufficient” reasons for an interference. This obligation enables individuals, amongst other things, to learn about and contest the reasons behind a court decision that limits their freedom of expression or freedom of assembly, and thus offers an important procedural safeguard against arbitrary interference with the rights protected under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention (see Gülcü, cited above, § 114 )."

                "253. The Court finds that the domestic courts did not properly fulfil this obligation in the present case when convicting the applicant of certain violent acts and illegally carrying a knife. It is mindful of its findings above regarding the manner in which the applicant ’ s trial was conducted and the facts underlying the charges against him were established (see paragraphs 208 - 210 above). It notes that the resulting judgments were a mere recapitulation of the indictment against the applicant, which in its turn was based entirely on the testimony of the police officers concerned. Moreover, the facts, as established by the domestic courts, lacked detail and were full of ambiguities. Such important facts as the circumstances of the clashes between the demonstrators and the police at Freedom Square were completely ignored and not even mentioned, even though those circumstances, including an assessment of the police actions, were of direct relevance for the charges against the applicant. Some crucial contradictions remained unaddressed and unexplained, including the fact as to how it was possible for the applicant to commit the imputed acts at a time when, according to the relevant record, he was already in police custody. The domestic courts, therefore, failed to carry out a thorough and objective establishment of the facts underlying the charges against the applicant and to demonstrate the rigour and scrutiny which, in the particular circumstances of the case and given the overall context, were required of them in order to ensure an effective implementation of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly guaranteed by Article 11. In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the reasons adduced by the domestic courts to justify the interference were genuinely “relevant and sufficient”, which stripped the applicant of the procedural protection that he enjoyed by virtue of his rights under Article 11 (see, mutatis mutandis, Gülcü, cited above, § 114 ). Nor can it be said that the courts based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts."

Furthermore, the dispersal of the assembly and the punitive measures taken against the applicant could not but have the effect of discouraging him from participating in political rallies. Undoubtedly, those measures also had a serious potential to deter other opposition supporters and the public at large from attending demonstrations and, more generally, from participating in open political debate ( see, mutatis mutandis, Gafgaz Mammadov, cited above, § 67)."

Of course, the act committed by R.S. has never been approved by the authorities of Azerbaijan, for that act he was arrested by the Hungarian court, and we believe that this corresponds to committed act. But there is one question that Azerbaijani society has discussed for several years.... At that time, the Hungarian court treated R.S. too cruelly, and imposed an inadequate punishment on him, under heavy pressure from Armenians, including the pressure of the representatives of some pro-Armenian diaspora, and foreign organizations... For a crime committed by R.S., European countries, Azerbaijan, and Armenia itself and others impose a punishment of fifteen years, and after serving half the sentence, a prisoner, falling under an amnesty for good behaviour, is released. Therefore punishment passed by Hungarian court for eight and a half years has continuously been assessed by Azerbaijani people as inadequate decision... The result is obvious, and today, after eight and a half years of serving the sentence, the Azerbaijani society regards R.S.’ release as a just act. In fact, the President of Azerbaijan pardoned R.S. using both the opinion formed during that time, and possibility, created by the Azerbaijani law as well... Azerbaijani authorities and socio-political circles do not assess the act committed by R.S. as heroic... We believe that R.S. had to answer for what he did, and he did answer.

There ICJ drew a clear distinction between the legal situation immediately following the seizure of the United States embassy and its personnel by the militants, and that created by a decree of the Iranian State which expressly approved and maintained the situation.",

The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation created by the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its diplomatic and consular staff as hostages. The approval given to these facts by the Ayatollah Khomeini and other organs of the Iranian State, and the decision to perpetuate them, translated continuing occupation of the Embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of that State.’",
                "(5) As regards State practice, the capture and subsequent trial in Israel of Adolf Eichmann may provide an example of the subsequent adoption of private conduct by a State. On 10 May 1960, Eichmann was captured by a group of Israelis in Buenos Aires. He was held in captivity in Buenos Aires in a private home for some weeks before being taken by air to Israel. Argentina later charged the Israeli Government with complicity in Eichmann’s capture, a charge neither admitted nor denied by Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir, during the discussion in the Security Council of the complaint. She referred to Eichmann’s captors as a ‘volunteer group’. Security Council resolution 138 (1960) of 23 June 1960 implied a finding that the Israeli Government was at least aware of, and consented to, the successful plan to capture Eichmann in Argentina. It may be that Eichmann’s captors were ‘in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of’ Israel, in which case their conduct was more properly attributed to the State under article 8. But where there are doubts about whether certain conduct falls within article 8, these may be resolved by the subsequent adoption of the conduct in question by the State.",
                "(6) The phrase ‘acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own’ is intended to distinguish cases of acknowledgement and adoption from cases of mere support or endorsement. ICJ in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case used phrases such as ‘approval’, ‘endorsement’, ‘the seal of official governmental approval’ and ‘the decision to perpetuate [the situation]’. These were sufficient in the context of that case, but as a general matter, conduct will not be attributable to a State under article 11 where a State merely acknowledges the factual existence of conduct or expresses its verbal approval of it. In international controversies, States often take positions which amount to ‘approval’ or ‘endorsement’ of conduct in some general sense but do not involve any assumption of responsibility. The language of ‘adoption’, on the other hand, carries with it the idea that the conduct is acknowledged by the State as, in effect, its own conduct. Indeed, provided the State’s intention to accept responsibility for otherwise non-attributable conduct is clearly indicated, article 11 may cover cases where a State has accepted responsibility for conduct of which it did not approve, which it had sought to prevent and which it deeply regretted. However such acceptance may be phrased in the particular case, the term ‘acknowledges and adopts’ in article 11 makes it clear that what is required is something more than a general acknowledgement of a factual situation, but rather that the State identifies the conduct in question and makes it its own.",
                "(8) The phrase ‘if and to the extent that’ is intended to convey a number of ideas. First, the conduct of, in particular, private persons, groups or entities is not attributable to the State unless under some other article of chapter II or unless it has been acknowledged and adopted by the State. Secondly, a State might acknowledge and adopt conduct only to a certain extent. In other words, a State may elect to acknowledge and adopt only some of the conduct in question. Thirdly, the act of acknowledgment and adoption, whether it takes the form of words or conduct, must be clear and unequivocal.",

Finally, the Court observes that none of the situations, other than those referred to in Articles 4 and 8 of the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility, in which specific conduct may be attributed to a State, matches the circumstances of the present case in regard to the possibility of attributing the genocide at Srebrenica to the Respondent. The Court does not see itself required to decide at this stage whether the ILC’s Articles dealing with attribution, apart from Articles 4 and 8, express present customary international law, it being clear that none of them apply in this case. The acts constituting genocide were not committed by persons or entities which, while not being organs of the FRY, were empowered by it to exercise elements of the governmental authority (Art. 5), nor by organs placed at the Respondent’s disposal by another State (Art. 6), nor by persons in fact exercising elements of the governmental authority in the absence or default of the official authorities of the Respondent (Art. 9); finally, the Respondent has not acknowledged and adopted the conduct of the perpetrators of the acts of genocide as its own (Art. 11).",

In determining the question as to whether the illegal conduct of the individuals can somehow be attributed to SFOR, the Trial Chamber refers to the principles laid down in the Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (‘ILC’) on the issue of ‘Responsibilities of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’. These Draft Articles were adopted by the ILC at its fifty-third session in 2001. The Trial Chamber is however aware of the fact that any use of this source should be made with caution. The Draft Articles were prepared by the International Law Commission and are still subject to debate amongst States. They do not have the status of treaty law and are not binding on States. Furthermore, as can be deduced from its title, the Draft Articles are primarily directed at the responsibilities of States and not at those of international organisations or entities. As Draft Article 57 emphasises,",

As indicated in Article I of Annex 1-A to the Dayton Agreement, IFOR (SFOR) is a multinational military force. It ‘may be composed of ground, air and maritime units from NATO and non-NATO nations’ and ‘will operate under the authority and subject to the direction and political control of the North Atlantic Council.’ For the purposes of deciding upon the motions pending in the present case, the Chamber does not deem it necessary to determine the exact legal status of SFOR under international law. Purely as general legal guidance, it will use the principles laid down in the Draft Articles insofar as they may be helpful for determining the issue at hand.",
                "64. The Trial Chamber observes that both Parties use the same and similar criteria of ‘acknowledgement’, ‘adoption’, ‘recognition’, ‘approval’ and ‘ratification’, as used by the ILC. The question is therefore whether on the basis of the assumed facts SFOR can be considered to have ‘acknowledged and adopted’ the conduct undertaken by the individuals ‘as its own’. It needs to be re-emphasised in this context that it cannot be deduced from the assumed facts that SFOR was in any way, directly or indirectly, involved in the actual apprehension of the accused in the FRY or in the transfer of the accused into the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Nor has it in any way been argued or suggested that SFOR instructed, directed or controlled such acts. What can be concluded from the assumed facts is merely that the Accused was handed over to an SFOR unit after having been arrested in the FRY by unknown individuals and brought into the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. From the perspective of SFOR, the Accused had come into contact with SFOR in the execution of their assigned task. In accordance with their mandate and in light of Article 29 of the Statute and Rule 59 bis, they were obliged to inform the Prosecution and to hand him over to its representatives. From these facts, the Trial Chamber can readily conclude that there was no collusion or official involvement by SFOR in the alleged illegal acts.”"

Although the procedural obligation under Article 2 will in principle only be triggered for the Contracting State under whose jurisdiction the deceased was to be found at the time of death, ‘special features’ in a given case will justify departure from this approach, according to the principles developed in Rantsev, §§ 243-44.

Inspired by the general principle of de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court (see Ladygin v. Russia (dec.), no. 35365/05, 30 August 2011). The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case (see Gagliano Giorgi, cited above, § 55). The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant’s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev, cited above, and Eon v. France, no. 26118/10, § 34, 14 March 2013). However, the applicant’s subjective perception alone cannot suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage.

It was, at least in part, a direct result of the Azerbaijani authorities’ failure to assess R.S.’s capacity to withstand such a situation that had led to his vast over-reaction in the face of various “humiliations” (as he perceived them) and his commission of a gruesome murder.

That threshold is not limited to the mere “approval” and “endorsement” of the act in question, which, in the words of the ILC Commentary, “do not involve any assumption of responsibility” (ibid.) – Article 11 of the Draft Articles explicitly and categorically requires the “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of that act (see paragraph 34 above). The differentiation between the mere “approval” and “endorsement” of the act in question – which, on the one hand, in and of themselves do not bring about the responsibility of a respective State for that act, and, on the other hand, its “acknowledgment” and “adoption” as a threshold that must be reached for that responsibility to be invoked, has also been endorsed in the case-law of the ICTY (see paragraph 37 above). Moreover, the two conditions – “acknowledgment” and “adoption” – are cumulative, as stems directly from the wording of Article 11 of the Draft Articles, and, in addition, require that the State “acknowledges” and “adopts” the act “as its own”, which again demonstrates the very stringent requirements set by that provision. The Court furthermore observes that, according to the ILC Commentary, such an act of “acknowledgment” and “adoption” must, importantly, be “clear and unequivocal”, whether it takes the form of words or conduct (see paragraph 35 above)."

In this context, the Court is mindful of the evolution of international law on State responsibility and is conscious that the case-law on this particular issue is scarce and that further developments may therefore be expected in this area (see, mutatis mutandis, Jones and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 34356/06 and 40528/06, § 213, 14 January 2014).

Each of those measures certainly constituted, individually and cumulatively, the subsequent “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s acts by various institutions and the highest officials of the State, and that “approval” and “endorsement” strongly resonated with the feelings of Azerbaijani society at large. In particular, such measures as awarding R.S eight years’ salary arrears or promoting him within the military are indications of not only the State’s explicit, clear and unequivocal “endorsement” of the crimes committed by him, but also of their appreciation of R.S.’s conduct at the time when he was in the military service of the State of Azerbaijan."

The applicants argued that such glorifying statements – including those contained in the special section dedicated to R.S. on the official webpage of the President of Azerbaijan (see paragraph 25 above) – amounted to Azerbaijan’s “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of R.S.’s crimes as its own.

                "118. The Court now turns to the assessment of the impugned measures from the standpoint of whether they constituted not the mere “approval” and “endorsement” by the State of Azerbaijan of the criminal acts committed by R.S., but also their “acknowledgment” and “adoption” in the sense of Article 11 of the Draft Articles. Although not decisive for the Court’s assessment, it is of importance that R.S.’s criminal acts were purely private acts of a criminal nature, and not related, whether directly or indirectly, with any State action at the time when they were committed (see paragraph 111 above). It has not escaped the Court’s attention that the impugned measures – in particular the granting of salary arrears and promoting R.S. in rank within the military – were undertaken by the State of Azerbaijan. That being so, the legal question before the Court in its examination of the applicants’ complaints under the substantive limb of Article 2 remains whether the very fact that the impugned measures were taken by the State of Azerbaijan allows for their categorisation – within the context of the factual circumstances, as submitted and argued by the parties, and in accordance with the standards of international law as it stood at the material time and stands today (see paragraphs 114-116 above) – in such a manner as to justify the Court in concluding that the respective State not only manifestly demonstrated its “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s acts, but in fact “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” them as acts not just, strictly speaking, perpetrated by R.S., but in fact as having been perpetrated by the State itself. Having most thoroughly examined the nature and scope of the impugned measures within the overall context in which they were taken and in the light of international law, the Court is unable to conclusively find that such “clear and unequivocal” “acknowledgement” and “adoption” indeed took place. In substance those measures can be interpreted not so much as the State’s “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of R.S.’s criminal acts, as such, but rather as having the purpose of publicly addressing, recognising and remedying R.S.’s adverse personal, professional and financial situation, which the authorities of Azerbaijan perceived, unjustifiably in the Court’s view, as being the consequence of the allegedly flawed criminal proceedings in Hungary (see paragraph 106 above). It follows that, although the Court considers it beyond any doubt that by their actions various institutions and highest officials of the State of Azerbaijan “approved” and “endorsed” the criminal acts of R.S., applying the very high threshold set by Article 11 of the Draft Articles – as interpreted and applied by international tribunals, in particular the ICJ and the ICTY (see paragraphs 36-37 above) – the Court cannot but conclude that, on the facts of the case, as presented by the applicants, it has not been convincingly demonstrated that the State of Azerbaijan “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” “as its own” R.S.’s deplorable acts, thus assuming, as such, responsibility for his actual killing of G.M. and the preparations for the murder of the first applicant. The Court places emphasis on the fact that this assessment is undertaken on the basis of the very stringent standards set out by the existing rules of international law, as they stood at the material time and stand today, from which the Court sees no reason or possibility to depart in the present case. Therefore, contrary to what was argued by the applicants, the present case cannot be considered fully comparable to the ICJ’s United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case."

Lastly, the applicants claimed that Azerbaijan had failed to properly regulate military service requirements and in particular had failed to establish R.S.’s mental state prior to sending him into an environment in which he would inevitably be called upon to interact with representatives of the Armenian military. Admittedly, in cases where crimes have been committed by police officers acting outside of their official duties, the Court has already held that the member States of the Council of Europe are expected to set high professional standards within their law-enforcement systems and ensure that the persons serving in these systems meet the requisite criteria (see Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, § 290; and Gorovenky and Bugara v. Ukraine, nos. 36146/05 and 42418/05, § 38, 12 January 2012). The Court accepts that similar standards may apply to members of the armed forces. However, having regard to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court is not convinced that the private acts of R.S. could have been foreseen by his commanding officers or should be held imputable to the Azerbaijani State as a whole, just because that individual happened to be its agent. Indeed, the impugned acts were so flagrantly abusive and so far removed from R.S.’s official status as a military officer that, on the facts of the case, his most serious criminal behaviour cannot engage the State’s substantive international responsibility. What is more, nothing in the case file suggests that the procedure in Azerbaijan for the recruitment of members of the armed forces and the monitoring of their compliance with professional standards at the time that R.S. was sent on his mission – including their continued mental fitness to serve – had been inadequate."

It was worth noting that the said declaration was one of five such declarations made on the same date, alongside one (so entitled) “reservation”. Logic would suggest that Azerbaijan had distinguished between “declarations” and “reservations” and that the declaration in question had not in fact been intended as a reservation. In any event, the declaration was not applicable in the circumstances in question, as it referred to persons transferred by Azerbaijan and not those transferred to it.

Indeed, pursuant to the preamble to the Transfer Convention, its main aims are to promote justice and the social rehabilitation of sentenced persons.

In the Court’s opinion, in view of the extremely tense political situation between the two countries, the authorities should have been all the more cautious, given that the victims of the crimes in the present case were of Armenian origin (see in this sense the European Parliament’s resolution cited at paragraph 42 above)."

In particular, the Hungarian courts explained that R.S. himself had initially asked for an interpreter from Hungarian into Russian and that – once he had complained about not understanding that language to the necessary degree – they had conducted an in-depth analysis of the disadvantage at which this may have put him in the proceedings against him. In the end, they concluded that it was proven that R.S. had a good command of Russian and that, in any event, at his request he had subsequently been provided with interpreters and translations of documents into his native language (see paragraph 15 above)."

In particular, the Court is satisfied that R.S.’s mental capacities had been thoroughly assessed during his trial in Hungary by a number of medical experts and that he was found to have been mentally able to understand the dangers and consequences of his actions at the time of the offences (see paragraph 15 above).

Although the reply of the Azerbaijani authorities was admittedly incomplete and worded in general terms – which in turn could have aroused suspicion as to the manner of the execution of R.S.’s prison sentence and prompted them to further action, as concluded by the Hungarian Commissioner for Fundamental Rights (see paragraph 24 above) – no tangible evidence has been adduced before the Court by the parties in the present case to show that the Hungarian authorities unequivocally were or should have been aware that R.S. would be released upon his return to Azerbaijan.

Under Articles 21 and 23 of the Vienna Convention, a reservation established with regard to another party modified those provisions to the same extent for that other party in its relations with the State expressing the reservation question, and any claim to the contrary would run against the fundamental principle of the sovereign equality of States. Azerbaijan could not, therefore, avoid the legal effects of its own reservation. Its decision regarding the pardon of R.S. should have been agreed with the competent authorities of Hungary. If the Court accepted that the declaration of Azerbaijan constituted an interpretative declaration and not a reservation, it would show the understanding of the Republic of Azerbaijan to be that the correct interpretation of Article 12 implied that the consent of the sentencing State must be sought.

Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy’s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment ( see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 145, and Timishev v. Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, § 56, ECHR 2005).

Secondly, R.S. was not only reinstated to his post in the military, he was also promoted in military rank in a public ceremony shortly after his return to Azerbaijan. Moreover, he received a flat in Baku, together with salary arrears in respect of the entire period that he had spent in prison (even though the latter measure was provided under the domestic law only in respect of acquitted persons – see paragraph 28 above). As already stated, the Government did not indicate a domestic legal basis for all of those additional measures (see paragraph 169 above), which were understandably perceived as constituting rewards for R.S.’s actions (see paragraph 172 above).

A vast number of those letters were still viewable on that webpage, all of them thanking the President for pardoning R.S. on the basis that they agreed with his having killed his Armenian victim. While it is true that the President himself had never posted anything in that section, its mere existence and the reason therefor pointed to the idea that R.S. had been pardoned because his attack had been of an ethnic nature and that the granting of the pardon could be perceived as an important step in the process of legitimising and glorifying R.S.’s actions."

The Court is mindful of the difficulty faced by the applicants in proving such bias beyond a reasonable doubt, given that the facts in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the Azerbaijani authorities.

In the Court’s view, the two statements provided by the Azerbaijani Government are therefore not sufficient to refute the overwhelming body of evidence submitted by the applicants indicating that the various measures leading to R.S.’s virtual impunity, coupled with the glorification of his extremely cruel hate crime, had a causal link to the Armenian ethnicity of his victims."

This obligation requires the Contracting States to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court, whether it is conducting a fact-finding investigation or performing its general duties as regards the examination of applications. A failure on a Government’s part to submit any such information that is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicants’ allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 of the Convention (see Medova v. Russia, no. 25385/04, § 76, 15 January 2009, and Timurtaş v. Turkey, no. 23531/94, §§ 66 and 70, ECHR 2000 ‑ VI)."

Turning to the present case, the Court first of all observes that the applicants’ complaint under Article 38 of the Convention relates to the alleged failure of the respondent Governments to comply with a request for documents submitted by the applicants’ own lawyers, and not by the Court. It further notes that, following the Court’s request for additional information (see paragraph 5 above), both respondent Governments submitted the requested documents within the requisite time-limit, including the presidential pardon decision concerning R.S. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Court is aware of no further document which the Azerbaijani or the Hungarian Governments could have furnished for a proper and effective examination of the present application, but failed to do so.

The Court finds no reason to rule otherwise in the circumstances of the present case, which concerns the applicant ’ s allegations that his administrative detention had been unlawful as it had been in breach of domestic law (see paragraph 46 below). The Court considers that genuine respect for human rights requires it to continue examination of the complaint in this case. The Court rejects the Government ’ s contention that the applicant ’ s allegations as regards his placement in the police car and the nature of restrictions imposed therein falls outside the scope of the present case. The Court has examined those issues above as they pertain to the question of whether the applicant was deprived of liberty (see paragraphs 38-41).

By contrast to Mr Čamans, in respect of whom no procedural record was drawn up (see Čamans and Timofejeva, cited above, §§ 59 and 128), a measure of “administrative detention” was imposed on the present applicant.

The Court finds no reason to rule otherwise in the circumstances of the present case, which concerns the applicant ’ s allegations that his administrative detention had been unlawful as it had been in breach of domestic law (see paragraph 46 below). The Court considers that genuine respect for human rights requires it to continue examination of the complaint in this case.

On this last point, the Court stresses that where deprivation of liberty is concerned it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, §§ 91 ‑ 92, and Del Río Prada v.

In order to do that the Court must examine whether the applicant ’ s detention in the police car was authorised under any of the legal grounds provided for in Article 252(1) of the Code, on the basis of which the applicant was administratively detained by the police. It has not been argued, and the Court cannot find any indication in the case material to conclude otherwise, that any of the following legal grounds – the need to halt an ongoing administrative offence, to determine the identity of the offender, or to enforce another decision (see paragraph 26 above) – could be invoked to justify the applicant ’ s detention. The applicant ’ s detention report expressly referred to the fact that he was being detained “with a view to drawing up an administrative-offence report”, which was also the legal ground for detention laid down in Article 252(1) of the Code (see paragraphs 7 and 26 above).

In the domestic proceedings the applicant raised an argument that he had been detained in breach of domestic law as he had not been taken anywhere (see paragraph 23 above). The Regional Court, however, did not address this argument but referred to Article 256 of the Code (see paragraph 25 above), which laid down the procedure for “examination of persons” and “inspection of objects” (see paragraph 27 above). There is no information in the case material, however, that the legal basis for the applicant ’ s administrative detention by the police had been “examination of persons” or “inspection of objects” on site. Furthermore, no note was made about such examination or inspection in the administrative-detention report, nor any separate report drawn up in that respect as required by Article 256(4) of the Code (see paragraph 27 above).

In view of the lack of any explanation from the domestic courts as to how that legal ground for administrative detention was applicable to the applicant ’ s case, the Court finds that the applicant could not have foreseen that he would be detained on the site of the offence in the circumstances of the present case. Moreover, the different legal provisions invoked by the domestic authorities and the respondent Government to justify the applicant ’ s administrative detention attest to the lack of clarity as to the actual legal basis applicable.

While the size of the fine was indeed modest, and the applicant did not advance any arguments to demonstrate that it had been significant to him in the light of his personal situation, his subjective perception of the alleged violation was that he had experienced a chilling effect of the administrative-offence proceedings that would affect the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly in the future (see paragraph 25 above). The Court reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, is one of the foundations of such a society (see, among other authorities, Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], nos. 29580/12 and 4 others, § 98, 15 November 2018). In cases concerning freedom of assembly the Court, when applying the admissibility criterion contained in Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention, should take due account of the importance of this freedom and exercise a careful scrutiny (compare, in the context of Article 10, Sylka v. Poland ( dec. ), no. 19219/07, § 28, 3 June 2014; see also, in the context of Article 11, Berladir and Others v. Russia, no. 34202/06, § 34, 10 July 2012, and Öğrü v.

Considering that the applicant was subjected to administrative-offence proceedings for his participation in a peaceful assembly, the alleged violation of Article 11 of the Convention in the present case concerns, in the Court ’ s view, “important questions of principle”. The Court is thus satisfied that the applicant suffered a significant disadvantage as a result of the administrative-offence proceedings against him regardless of pecuniary interests and does not deem it necessary to consider in the context of its analysis of the Government ’ s objection whether respect for human rights compels it to examine the case or whether it has been duly considered by a domestic tribunal (see, mutatis mutandis, M.N. and Others v.

Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant ’ s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In other words, the absence of any “significant disadvantage” can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant. However, the applicant ’ s subjective perception cannot alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, with further references, C.P. v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ) no. 300/11, § 42, 6 September 2016). A violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest (see Korolev v. Russia ( dec. ), no. 25551/05, 1 July 2010)."

In considering whether the applicant has suffered a “significant disadvantage” in the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that he complained before it about the administrative-offence proceedings against him that had been instituted following his participation, together with six other people, in a flash mob and had resulted in a fine of EUR 22."

The Court cannot agree with this assertion for the reason that the domestic courts fined the applicant for his failure to notify the authorities of his intention to hold a static demonstration. This measure, unlike the fine imposed on the applicant in Zwinkels (cited above, §§ 3 and 6), was thus directly linked to the crux of the application at hand."

                "31. While the size of the fine was indeed modest, and the applicant did not advance any arguments to demonstrate that it had been significant to him in the light of his personal situation, his subjective perception of the alleged violation was that he had experienced a chilling effect of the administrative-offence proceedings that would affect the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly in the future (see paragraph 25 above). The Court reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, is one of the foundations of such a society (see, among other authorities, Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], nos. 29580/12 and 4 others, § 98, 15 November 2018). In cases concerning freedom of assembly the Court, when applying the admissibility criterion contained in Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention, should take due account of the importance of this freedom and exercise a careful scrutiny (compare, in the context of Article 10, Sylka v. Poland ( dec. ), no. 19219/07, § 28, 3 June 2014; see also, in the context of Article 11, Berladir and Others v. Russia, no. 34202/06, § 34, 10 July 2012, and Öğrü v. Turkey, no. 19631/12, § 18, 17 October 2017). Considering that the applicant was subjected to administrative-offence proceedings for his participation in a peaceful assembly, the alleged violation of Article 11 of the Convention in the present case concerns, in the Court ’ s view, “important questions of principle”. The Court is thus satisfied that the applicant suffered a significant disadvantage as a result of the administrative-offence proceedings against him regardless of pecuniary interests and does not deem it necessary to consider in the context of its analysis of the Government ’ s objection whether respect for human rights compels it to examine the case or whether it has been duly considered by a domestic tribunal (see, mutatis mutandis, M.N. and Others v. San Marino, no. 28005/12, § 39, 7 July 2015)."

                "35. Even though the Government have not contested before the Court the applicant ’ s allegation that there had been an interference with his right to freedom of peaceful assembly, the Court considers it appropriate to emphasise the following. It has been the Court ’ s constant approach to regard the notion of an assembly as an autonomous concept (ibid.). Given the format of the gathering that the applicant has described as a flash mob, the Court considers that it fell within the notion of “peaceful assembly” contained in Article 11. The applicant intended to take part in this assembly and never denied it; even if he did not consider it a “public event” or a “static demonstration” subject to notification under the applicable national law, he had been exercising his right to freedom of peaceful assembly under Article 11 of the Convention. In the Court ’ s view, the dispersal of the assembly and the ensuing sanctions constituted “a restriction”, within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 11, and thus an interference with his right to freedom of peaceful assembly as protected by the first paragraph of this Article (ibid., § 108). It thus remains for the Court to be ascertained whether the interference was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 of Article 11, and was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of the aim or aims in question (see Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 102, ECHR 2015)."

The Court observes that the police dispersed the assembly of seven people and a fine was imposed on the applicant following the administrative-offence proceedings on the sole grounds that no prior notification of a static demonstration had been given to the authorities. The Government asserted that the applicant ’ s actions had constituted a static demonstration subject to prior notification (see paragraph 22 above). The applicant stressed both at the national level and before the Court that the assembly he had taken part in could not be regarded as a static demonstration within the meaning of the Public Events Act. The main controversy between the parties thus lies in whether the Public Events Act was applicable to the assembly in the form of a flash mob – were it not so, the applicant should not have been sanctioned for the breach of the rules on organising a static demonstration under Article 20.2 § 2 of the CAO."

The Court observes that the definition of a static demonstration under the Public Events Act (see paragraphs 17 ‑ 18 above) is broad to the extent that a vast array of social situations may fall under it. Any stationary gathering in public – no matter how small and short, irrespective of its purpose or context, and regardless of its potential to cause disruption to ordinary life – of two or more people (solitary static demonstrations being exempt from the prior-notification requirement) holding any object that could be regarded as “a means of visual expression” may be declared unlawful unless a document containing a lengthy list of elements (see paragraph 19 above) has been submitted to the authorities no later than three days before the gathering."

The Court has already pointed out that the Russian regulatory framework governing public gatherings provides for a broad interpretation of what constitutes a gathering subject to notification and allocates to the authorities excessively wide discretion in imposing restrictions on such gatherings through rigid enforcement (see Navalnyy, cited above, § 150). Regardless of whether an assembly in the form of a flash mob falls within the scope of the Public Events Act, it is essential for the Court to establish whether the applicant ’ s right to peaceful assembly has been respected. In view of its findings below it is unnecessary to decide whether the interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of assembly was “prescribed by law” or pursued one or more legitimate aims (see, mutatis mutandis, Mătăsaru v. the Republic of Moldova, nos. 69714/16 and 71685/16, § 32, 15 January 2019).

In doing so it will assess whether these measures answered a pressing social need."

Under the Court ’ s well ‑ established case-law, an unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation, does not necessarily justify an interference with a person ’ s right to freedom of assembly. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public demonstrations, since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (ibid., § 150)."

The Government suggested that the applicant ’ s aim in organising the flash mob had been to test whether his actions would be considered as a protest activity in order to provoke a conflict with the authorities (see paragraph 23 above). What is salient to the Court is the fact that nothing in the actions of the applicant and the other participants in the flash mob could be described as incitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles. They did not do anything capable of causing disorder or disruption to ordinary life. Indeed, seven people standing in silence with their mouths sealed with adhesive tape and holding blank sheets of paper hardly represent a threat to public order. However, the domestic authorities did not show the requisite degree of tolerance towards their peaceful gathering despite the absence of any risk of insecurity or disturbance, seemingly in disregard of what the Court has emphasised on numerous occasions, namely that the enforcement of rules governing public assemblies should not become an end in itself (see Kudrevičius and Others, § 155, and Navalnyy, § 144, both cited above)."

When finding the applicant guilty of the administrative offence under Article 20.2 § 2 of the CAO, the justice of the peace and the Presnenskiy District Court did not assess the level of disturbance the assembly had caused, if any. They merely observed that the applicant had failed to comply with the prior-notification requirement in respect of the social situation that, in their view, had doubtlessly amounted to a static demonstration (see paragraphs 10 and 12 above). The Court reiterates that the proportionality principle demands that a balance be struck between the requirements of the purposes listed in Article 11 § 2 on the one hand, and those of the free expression of opinions by word, gesture or even silence by persons assembled on the streets or in other public places, on the other (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 144). It considers that the domestic judicial bodies in the course of the administrative-offence proceedings against the applicant did not seek to strike this balance giving the preponderant weight to the formal unlawfulness of the presumed static demonstration."

The Court further points out that it has previously held that the offence set out in Article 20.2 § 2 of the CAO should be classified as “criminal”, regard being had to the general nature of the offence, and given that the purpose of the sanction is punitive and deterrent in nature, all of which is a characteristic of the criminal sphere (see Mikhaylova v. Russia, no. 46998/08, §§ 57-69, 1 9 November 2015, and Navalnyy, cited above, § 79). Accordingly, the applicant was subject to sanctions which, although classified as administrative under domestic law, were “criminal” within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 § 1, thereby attracting the application of this provision under its “criminal” head. However, a peaceful demonstration should not, in principle, be rendered subject to the threat of a criminal sanction and notably to deprivation of liberty. Where the sanctions imposed on a demonstrator are criminal in nature, they require particular justification. The freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that a person cannot be subject to a sanction – even one at the lower end of the scale – for participation in a demonstration which has not been prohibited, so long as that person does not her or himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Navalnyy, cited above, § 145)."

Even assuming that they were relevant, they are not sufficient to show that the interference complained of was “necessary in a democratic society” ( ibid., § 146).
