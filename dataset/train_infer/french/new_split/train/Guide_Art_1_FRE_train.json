                "70. With regard to the Lithuanian authorities’ responsibility, the Court observes that there is no dispute that all the decisions complained of by the applicants in the present case were taken by Lithuanian border officials. It is therefore evident that the actions complained of by the applicants were imputable to Lithuania and thereby fell within its jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention. Nor is there any dispute that at the time when the applicants were refused entry into Lithuania (April and May 2017), their asylum applications were not yet under consideration in Poland – asylum proceedings in Poland were only initiated at the beginning of 2018 (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). Accordingly, there are no grounds to exclude the responsibility of Lithuania for examining the applicant’s asylum applications lodged in April and May 2017 (see the relevant EU law in paragraph 59 above)."

In 2009 he decided to leave Chechnya and applied for international protection in Poland, and later moved to Austria. However, in 2010 he had to return to Chechnya. There, he started working in the State security system, where he participated in counter-terrorism operations and provided security to the highest officials of Chechnya. He quit that job in October 2015, but before that he and his mother were asked if he was planning to join illegal armed groups in Syria. In February 2017 he was taken to the headquarters of the department at which he worked and asked to become an informer; he refused. In March 2017 two police officers came to his home and forcefully took him to a police station, where he was again asked to become an informer and again he refused. Afterwards he was tortured – he was given electric shocks and beaten on the kidneys, head and other parts of his body.

Nevertheless, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3 of the Convention where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned faces a real risk of being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the receiving country. In such circumstances, Article 3 implies an obligation not to expel the individual to that country (see Paposhvili v.

By virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the guaranteed rights and freedoms is laid on the national authorities, who are thus required to examine the applicants’ fears and to assess the risks they would face if removed to the receiving country, from the standpoint of Article 3. The machinery of complaint to the Court is subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. This subsidiary character is articulated in Article 13 and Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. Accordingly, in cases of this kind, the authorities’ obligation under Article 3 to protect the integrity of the persons concerned is fulfilled primarily through appropriate procedures allowing such examination to be carried out (ibid., §§ 184-85, and the cases cited therein)."

It is a matter for the State carrying out the return to ensure that the intermediary country offers sufficient guarantees to prevent the person concerned being removed to his or her country of origin without an assessment of the risks faced.

However, it is not disputed that they also wrote “azul’” in Cyrillic – a word often used by Chechen asylum seekers to mean “asylum” – on all the seven decisions refusing them entry into Lithuania (see paragraphs 11 and 88 above). The Government argued that the border guards had not been required to know the Russian language or understand Cyrillic script, nor had they been obliged to verify what had been written in the place of the signature (see paragraph 93 above). The Court firstly observes that the Government have not provided any information on whether any of the border guards who were on duty at the Medininkai border checkpoint on that day could actually speak Russian or read Cyrillic. It also observes that the Medininkai checkpoint is located on the border with Belarus, where Russian is one of the official languages, and that according to the Schengen Borders Code, member States shall encourage border guards to learn the languages necessary for carrying out their tasks (see Article 16 § 1 of the Code, cited in paragraph 57 above). In any event, assuming that none of the border guards at the Medininkai checkpoint spoke Russian, the Court then cannot accept the Government’s argument that the applicants “had not in any way expressed willingness to seek asylum” (see paragraph 93 above), as those border guards would not have been able to understand the applicants’ oral requests made in Russian. In this connection, the Court underlines the importance of interpretation in order to ensure access to the asylum procedure (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, § 301). It also refers to the requirement under the Asylum Procedures Directive for the authorities to make arrangements for interpretation (see paragraph 60 above), and the UNHCR recommendations to the same effect (see paragraph 52 above).

However, border guards did not accept those applications and did not forward them to a competent authority for examination and status determination, as required by domestic law (see paragraph 30 above; see also the Asylum Procedures Directive cited in paragraph 60 above). Furthermore, border guards’ reports to their senior officers did not make any mention of the applicants’ wish to seek asylum on any of the three occasions (see paragraphs 12, 16 and 20 above) – there were no references to the writing of “azul’” on the decisions, nor to the written asylum application. There was also no indication either in those reports or in any other documents submitted to the Court that the border guards had attempted to clarify what was the reason – if not seeking asylum – for the applicants’ presence at the border without valid travel documents. Nor does it appear that there was any assessment at all of whether it was safe to return the applicants – a family with five very young children – to Belarus, which is not a Contracting Party to the European Convention on Human Rights and, according to publicly available information, cannot be assumed to be a safe third country for Chechen asylum seekers (see paragraphs 64-65 above)."

It is therefore evident that measures which the Government claimed constituted adequate safeguards against the arbitrary removal of asylum seekers – such as the supervision of border guards by superior officers or the monitoring of borders by non-governmental organisations (see paragraphs 96 and 97 above) – were not effective in the present case."

In the light of the above-mentioned case-law it appears that if the investigative or judicial authorities of a Contracting State institute their own criminal investigation or proceedings concerning a death which has occurred outside the jurisdiction of that State, by virtue of their domestic law ..., the institution of that investigation or those proceedings is sufficient to establish a jurisdictional link for the purposes of Article 1 between that State and the victim ’ s relatives who later bring proceedings before the Court ...",

Although the procedural obligation under Article 2 will in principle only be triggered for the Contracting State under whose jurisdiction the deceased was to be found at the time of death, ‘ special features ’ in a given case will justify departure from this approach, according to the principles developed in Rantsev, §§ 243-44.

He contested the allegation that he could have left Kyiv for Moscow of his own will and pointed out that his “disappearance” had occurred during an interval in the consultation with the HIAS; he had left some of his personal belongings at the NGO ’ s office and some in a locker at the Kyiv railway station. Those belongings had been handed in to the police and had then been given to the applicant ’ s counsel. He alleged that his abductors had deviated from the shortest route to Moscow by at least 330 km, according to the Ukrainian border-control stamp in his passport; at the same time, there was no stamp by the Russian border control in his passport. The first applicant also pointed out that at the time of his entry into Russia he had been on the “wanted” list and would have been detained if he had tried to enter in a regular way. He contended that neither the Ukrainian nor the Russian authorities had properly investigated his abduction despite the ample evidence, including witness statements. Moreover, the Ukrainian authorities had acknowledged that the investigation had been deficient when in 2014 they had quashed the decision of 7 December 2012 and ordered its resumption.

Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev v.

By presenting witness statements from the HIAS staff the applicant made a prima facie case of abduction, possibly associated with inhuman or degrading treatment during his transfer to Russia, which placed the Russian authorities under an obligation to investigate it. If they could not take any practical steps towards an inquiry for lack of territorial jurisdiction, it was their obligation to seek the assistance of the Ukrainian authorities (see Güzelyurtlu and Others, cited above, §§ 232- 33), but this has not been done.

The Court considers that the time of rest thus afforded to the first applicant was far from adequate (see also paragraphs 254 - 255 below). However, in the present case the information available about the intensity of the hearing schedule does not, by itself or in combination with other elements known about the conditions of the first applicant ’ s detention and the medical care provided to him, allow the Court to conclude that it attained the threshold of severity required to characterise it as degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention."

However, according to the official version, it was the first applicant who presented himself on 21 October 2012 to surrender and confess. Moreover, at the time of his journey to Ukraine in October 2012 he did not have the status of a suspect in a criminal case and was not subject to any preventive measure; his absence from his registered address at the time when the authorities decided to bring charges was not in breach of any rule or undertaking. It appears that the courts did not perform a thorough assessment of the information provided by the police and did not question their contradictory allegations as regards the first applicant ’ s previous attempts to flee. As to the applicant ’ s lack of fixed employment and the fact that he was not registered at his de facto address in Moscow, the Court considers that the domestic courts did not provide a satisfactory explanation as to why these circumstances constituted an obstacle to applying other preventive measures, in particular house arrest."

Certainly, if released, he could have accessed the file under the same arrangements as persons to whom pre-trial detention had never been applied.

In particular, he had repeatedly travelled to other regions and abroad and had often been absent from his address and unreachable by telephone. Moreover, he had been charged with and convicted of an administrative offence for having taken part in an unauthorised stationary demonstration on 27 October 2012; then, on 15 December 2012 he had been arrested at an opposition rally; and on 13 January 2013 he had attempted to set some merchandise on fire during a public event while calling for protest actions.

In particular, house arrest is considered, in view of its degree and intensity, to amount to deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention. The Court has held that this type of deprivation of liberty requires relevant and sufficient reasons, just as with pre-trial detention. It has specified that the notions of “degree” and “intensity” in its case-law, as criteria for the applicability of Article 5, refer only to the degree of restrictions on liberty of movement, not to differences in comfort or in the internal regime in different places of detention. Thus, the Court would apply the same criteria for deprivation of liberty, irrespective of the place where the applicant was detained ( ibid., §§ 104 and 113-14)."

The Court observes that the second applicant ’ s detention under house arrest was justified by his failure to comply with the previous preventive measure, namely the undertaking not to leave Moscow and to behave properly, in particular with reference to his participation in public events, seeing that, on at least one occasion, he had been given an administrative sanction for a breach of the procedure for holding public events. Although the second applicant considered the latter sanction unlawful and irrelevant for the preventive measure in question, the Court notes that the criminal charges in the present case related to disorder during a public event; the reference to the applicant ’ s conduct at assemblies during the period when he was subjected to the undertaking was thus pertinent for the assessment of the risk of his reoffending. Therefore, at least one of the grounds relied on by the authorities could be said to have genuinely conformed to the purpose of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 § 1 (c), and it does not appear there was any element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 69, ECHR 2008, and the cases cited therein). There was thus no violation of Article 5 § 1 in this respect. Whether there were grounds which were “relevant” and “sufficient” to justify the house arrest is a question to be examined under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see Buzadji, cited above, § 61)."

Although the risks of his influencing witnesses, continuing criminal activity, destroying evidence and obstructing the course of the criminal proceedings were also listed among the grounds, the court did not indicate any specific facts showing the emergence of those risks. The gravity of the charges, the second applicant ’ s possession of a travel passport, his wife ’ s and children ’ s temporary residence in Ukraine and his connections were referred to in a general manner, and these circumstances had already existed at the time when the original preventive measure of an undertaking rather than detention was ordered.

In finding the second applicant in breach of the undertaking the domestic court first noted his frequent absences from his home address and his trips to other regions and abroad, and concluded that there was a risk of his absconding. This finding was based solely on one report stating that a police officer had been unable to reach the applicant in order to summon him to receive the indictment on 26 October 2012. However, it appears from the parties ’ submissions that on that date the second applicant attended the indictment procedure in person. Accordingly, even if on one occasion three days previously the applicant had not answered a telephone call, this was of no consequence to the course of the investigation. Moreover, there is nothing in the case file to corroborate the allegation that the difficulty in contacting the second applicant was a recurring problem or that the applicant had travelled beyond Moscow ’ s city limits in breach of the undertaking. Accordingly, the risk of his absconding was not sufficiently demonstrated in the judicial decision imposing house arrest."

Secondly, in relation to the alleged breach of the undertaking to display proper behaviour, the court relied on information about the second applicant ’ s participation in at least three opposition rallies, one of which resulted in an administrative conviction for holding a public event not compliant with the procedure established by law; on that basis it established the existence of a risk of his reoffending. As found above, the second applicant ’ s participation in and conduct at public events could legitimately be taken into account, in view of the nature of the accusations in the criminal case (see paragraph 214 above). Despite the applicant ’ s disagreement with the administrative conviction, the court deciding on the preventive measure was not required to reassess the administrative charges determined by another competent court. For the purpose of his initial two-month detention, the reference to a final judgment could be regarded as “relevant” and “sufficient”. However, the five subsequent decisions ultimately extending his house arrest to a period of over seventeen months reiterated the reasons given in the original order without a fresh assessment of their continued relevance and sufficiency. In particular, it remained unexplained why the court ’ s original assessment that the risk of reoffending could be suitably curbed by a two-month period of detention had to be reviewed. The extensions did not mention any circumstances arising during the first two months of the house arrest indicating the applicant ’ s intention to reoffend or any external reasons pointing to the persistence of this particular risk. Moreover, the courts systematically rejected the applicant ’ s offer of bail without stating reasons beyond a formulaic indication that this would not suffice as a preventive measure."

The applicants specified that they had not challenged the judge because of the numerous warnings given to the lawyers throughout the hearing when they had made procedural applications such as requests to examine certain witnesses.

The Court observes that the criminal proceedings initially conducted against three co-defendants, namely both applicants and L., were divided into two separate criminal cases, one of which – against L. –resulted in the latter ’ s conviction in accelerated proceedings based on plea bargaining. Subsequently, L. testified at the applicants ’ trial as a witness, which the applicants considered to have undermined the overall fairness of the hearing in their criminal case. The Court has previously examined complaints about the absence of safeguards associated with similar procedures and summarised the relevant principles applicable to the establishment of facts and the use of co-defendants ’ statements as witness testimony in disjoined sets of proceedings (see Navalnyy and Ofitserov v. Russia, nos. 46632/13 and 28671/14, §§ 96-101 and 105-05, 23 February 2016), holding as follows:",

The Court accepts that in complex criminal proceedings involving several persons who cannot be tried together, references by the trial court to the participation of third parties, who may later be tried separately, may be indispensable for the assessment of the guilt of those on trial. Criminal courts are obliged to establish the facts of the case relevant for the assessment of the legal responsibility of the accused as accurately and precisely as possible, and they cannot present established facts as mere allegations or suspicions. This also applies to facts related to the involvement of third parties, though if such facts have to be introduced, the court should avoid giving more information than necessary for the assessment of the legal responsibility of those accused in the trial before it. Even if the law expressly states that no inferences about the guilt of a person can be drawn from criminal proceedings in which he or she has not participated, judicial decisions must be worded so as to avoid any potential pre ‑ judgment about the third party ’ s guilt in order not to jeopardise the fair examination of the charges in the separate proceedings (see Karaman, cited above, §§ 64 ‑ 65 ).",
                "104. The Court has previously highlighted the first and most obvious guarantee to be secured when co-accused are tried in separate sets of proceedings, notably the courts ’ obligation to refrain from any statements that may have a prejudicial effect on the pending proceedings, even if they are not binding (see Karaman, cited above, §§ 42-43 and 64-56 ) ...",

The second requirement for the conduct of concurrent proceedings is that the quality of res judicata would not be attached to facts admitted in a case to which the individuals were not party.

The Court observes that, contrary to the above requirements, in the present case the decision to disjoin the case against L. did not involve an assessment of the countervailing interests or consultation of the applicants with a view to giving them an opportunity to object to the cases being separated. It finds that L. ’ s conviction following the use of plea bargaining and accelerated proceedings compromised his credibility as a witness in the applicants ’ case because he was compelled to maintain the statements he had made in order to negotiate the reduction of his sentence while not being bound by the witness oath."

The Court recalls its previous finding that even if the courts were obliged to base their assessment exclusively on the material and testimony presented at the hearing, this provision required the court to remain concordant with the previous judgment (see Navalnyy and Ofitserov, cited above, § 236) which holds true in this case. The Court considers that both L. and the domestic courts had an obvious incentive to remain concordant with the findings made in the accelerated proceedings even though those findings had not been scrutinised in an adversarial manner."

This particular courtroom arrangement has already been examined by the Court from the standpoint of Articles 3 and 6 of the Convention (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, §§ 127 and 148- 53 respectively). It found that although the conditions in hearing room no. 635 of Moscow City Court did not attain the minimum level of severity to constitute a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, they amounted to a disproportionate restriction of the defendants ’ rights to participate effectively in the proceedings and to receive practical and effective legal assistance. In particular, the defendants were separated from the rest of the hearing room by glass, a physical barrier which to some extent reduced their direct involvement in the hearing and made it impossible for them to have confidential exchanges with legal counsel. However, the trial court did not seem to recognise the impact of these courtroom arrangements on their defence rights, and did not take any measures to compensate for these limitations."

Only on one occasion, on 20 March 2014, had the court adjourned the hearing on the basis that the first applicant needed rest after having been transferred to another detention facility.

It observes that the first applicant and his lawyers made numerous detailed and specific complaints alleging that he could not concentrate on the hearing because of exhaustion and sleep deprivation. The courts, however, considered that the schedule was reasonable on the basis of the time the applicant spent in court. They did not take into consideration the time the first applicant spent being transferred, although they accepted the report from the detention facility indicating the drop-off time as 10.15 p.m., implying that this left him seven hours and forty-five minutes before the pick-up for the next day ’ s hearing. Moreover, lengthy transfers in poor conditions to and from courts appear to have been common in Moscow at the material time (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, §§ 103-11). The cumulative effect of exhaustion caused by lengthy prison transfers leaving less than eight hours of rest, repeated for four days a week over a period of more than four months, must have seriously undermined the first applicant ’ s ability to follow the proceedings, make submissions, take notes and instruct his lawyers. While the Court accepts the domestic court ’ s reasons for expediting the proceedings, it considers that in this case insufficient consideration was given to the first applicant ’ s requests for a less intensive hearing schedule."

The time constraints complicating the planning of the funeral attendance was not a sufficient reason for refusing it. It is typical for funerals to be fixed at very short notice and they are generally regarded as a matter of urgency. In this case, it would have been physically possible for the first applicant to arrive at the funeral, which was held on the following day in the same city. The fact that the request came from the Ombudsperson rather than from the applicant should not have mattered because it was clear from her letter that the request had been initiated by the applicant ’ s counsel (see paragraph 144 above). In the Court ’ s view, the decision to refuse the first applicant leave was taken in a manner incompatible with the State ’ s duty to carry out an individualised evaluation of his particular situation and to demonstrate that the restriction of his right to attend a relative ’ s funeral was “necessary in a democratic society”."

They claimed that the authorities ’ last ‑ minute change of the meeting layout had caused the stand-off between the protesters and the police and some isolated clashes, but not riots. The Court has previously examined the events at issue in relation to complaints about disruptive security measures implemented at the site of the meeting at Bolotnaya Square (see Frumkin v. Russia, no. 74568/12, §§ 7-41 and 102 ‑ 30, 5 January 2016, and Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, §§ 169-71). It found, in particular, that the sit-in had begun because of the unexpected change of the venue layout, of which the police had not informed the organisers. It also found that the authorities had made an insufficient effort to communicate with the assembly organisers to resolve the tension caused by the confusion about the venue layout, and that breaking through the police cordon was not confirmed to have been the organisers ’ desired outcome (see Frumkin, cited above, §§ 113-16 and 128)."

The Court also observes, turning to the specific facts of this case, that the judgment of 24 July 2014 referred to surveillance material obtained undercover, in particular audio recordings of conversations, the content of which was partly contested by the applicants. The same judgment also relied on the content of the film Anatomy of Protest, Part Two, which was based on footage of which the provenance and reliability were contested by the applicants during the trial. In the proceedings before the Court the parties did not make detailed submissions as regards these pieces of evidence. Noting that the domestic courts examined them in adversarial proceedings in which the applicants were able to scrutinise and challenge the impugned evidence, the Court is not required to substitute its own assessment of the content and the probative value of these recordings for that of the domestic courts, or to call into question the facts established on the basis of them (see, inter alia, Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, § 29, Series A no. 269, and Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 169, ECHR 2015).

Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, § 77, ECHR 2001-IX). The guarantees of Article 11 of the Convention therefore apply to all gatherings except those where the organisers and participants have such intentions, incite violence or otherwise reject the foundations of a democratic society (see Sergey Kuznetsov v. Russia, no. 10877/04, § 45, 23 October 2008; Alekseyev v. Russia, nos. 4916/07, 25924/08 and 14599/09, § 80, 21 October 2010; Fáber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 37, 24 July 2012; Gün and Others v.

It therefore dismisses the first applicant ’ s complaint as incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention."

No witnesses at the trial stated that he had taken part in any violent acts or encouraged them; on the contrary, he insisted on a “strictly peaceful” form of conduct. It is noteworthy that the first applicant was not acting on the second applicant ’ s instructions when deciding to break through the police cordon (see witness testimony by State Duma Deputy Ilya Ponomarev, paragraph 129 above).

The Court has found that Article 11 of the Convention is applicable to the second applicant ’ s complaint about his prosecution and criminal conviction for organising mass disorder during the assembly at Bolotnaya Square (see paragraph 285 above). Accordingly, these measures constituted an interference with the exercise of the freedom of assembly (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, § 172). The Court will therefore examine whether the interference was “prescribed by law”, pursued a legitimate aim and was “necessary in a democratic society”, as required by Article 11 § 2 of the Convention."

As in previous cases, the Court considers that the applicability of this provision was not entirely inconceivable and that it has no grounds to disagree with the domestic courts ’ assessment of the situation made within the margin of their judicial discretion (ibid., §§ 173-75). It therefore finds that the second applicant ’ s criminal conviction was “prescribed by law”.

As stated in paragraph 279 above, the Court, having observed the parties ’ submissions in the present case, maintains its conclusion that the tensions at Bolotnaya Square arose because of the authorities ’ unannounced change of the venue layout in order to prevent illegal campsites from being set up in the park at Bolotnaya Square (see Frumkin, cited above, § 106). It also considers it sufficiently established that the tension escalated into clashes because of the law-enforcement officials ’ failure to communicate with the assembly organisers to resolve the dispute about the placement of the police cordon ( ibid., §§ 112-15 and 126). However, the judgment in respect of the second applicant attributed responsibility for the violence to the protesters, and to him personally as one of the organisers, without assessing to what extent the authorities had contributed to the deterioration of the assembly ’ s peaceful character."

He demanded airtime on Russia ’ s main television channels, called for the presidential inauguration of Mr Putin to be cancelled and for new elections to be held and called on the assembly participants to stay at the meeting venue for an indefinite protest action. He may also have encouraged the setting-up of campsites supposedly inspired by the “Occupy” movement. These calls, in particular for overstaying the allocated time-slot of the assembly and for setting up a campsite, were clearly illegal as they would have been in breach of the established rules on holding a public assembly."

On the contrary, he repeatedly called on the participants to remain calm and peaceful. The fact that certain protesters may have committed violent acts does not affect the assessment of the second applicant ’ s conduct in the absence of evidence that they had been incited by him. The mere fact that the second applicant was one of the event organisers is not sufficient to hold him responsible for the conduct of the attendees (see Mesut Yıldız and Others v. Turkey, no. 8157/10, § 34, 18 July 2017 )."

Neither could the second applicant ’ s violent intentions be inferred from the circumstances underlying the related set of charges examined in the same set of proceedings, namely preparation of the organisation of acts of mass disorder (other than the one at Bolotnaya Square). In particular, no such intentions were apparent from the fundraising activities which he carried out before and after 6 May 2012 in order to finance opposition rallies, training sessions for activists and media campaigns. The recordings of negotiations examined at the trial and referred to in the judgment contained no reference to armed or other forceful methods of exerting political pressure on the authorities. In particular, the proposal to block railway lines made in the conversations recorded undercover and relied on by the domestic judgment was attributed to the first applicant, and in any event the extent of violence involved in that proposal was not assessed. The domestic judgments thus left open the question whether the “political instability” allegedly promoted by the second applicant carried an element of violence in the sense of riots or mass disorder, as opposed to advocating political change by peaceful means. The domestic courts therefore omitted a crucial element of the balancing exercise which is required by the proportionality principle when imposing sanctions for unlawful conduct at assemblies (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, §§ 142-44, and Gülcü v. Turkey, no. 17526/10, §§ 110 ‑ 17, 19 January 2016 )."

Where the sanctions imposed on demonstrators are criminal in nature, they require particular justification (see Rai and Evans v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), nos. 26258/07 and 26255/07, 17 November 2009). A peaceful demonstration should not, in principle, be rendered subject to the threat of a criminal sanction, and notably to deprivation of liberty (see Akgöl and Göl v. Turkey, nos. 28495/06 and 28516/06, § 43, 17 May 2011, and Gün and Others, cited above, § 83 ).

Although it is triggered by acts concerning the substantive aspects of Article 2, it can give rise to a finding of a separate and independent “interference”. In this sense it can be considered to be a detachable obligation, arising out of Article 2 and capable of binding the State, even when the substantive act took place before the critical date (see Šilih, cited above, § 159, and Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, § 138, 18 September 2009)."

However, having regard to the principle of legal certainty, the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction as regards compliance with the procedural obligation of Article 2 in respect of deaths that occur before the critical date is not open-ended. Firstly, it is clear that where the death occurred before the critical date, only procedural acts and/or omissions occurring after that date can fall within the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction. Secondly, there must exist a genuine connection between the death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State for the procedural obligations imposed by Article 2 to come into effect. Thus a significant proportion of the procedural steps required by this provision – which include not only an effective investigation into the death of the person concerned, but also the institution of appropriate proceedings for the purposes of determining the cause of death and holding those responsible to account – will have been, or ought to have been, carried out after the critical date. However, the Court would not exclude that in certain circumstances the connection could also be based on the need to ensure that the guarantees and underlying values of the Convention are protected in a real and effective manner ( Šilih, cited above, §§ 161-163)."

Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, § 148, ECHR 2013)."

The authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death, or identify the person or people responsible, will risk falling foul of this standard.

During the questioning, which lasted for three hours, R.S. gave a detailed account of the events.

As for the Armenian participants in the language course, R.S. said they had provoked and mocked him and the Azerbaijani flag on several occasions, which was why he had decided to buy an axe and kill them on the anniversary of the beginning of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region (for general background information, see Chiragov and Others v.

There ICJ drew a clear distinction between the legal situation immediately following the seizure of the United States embassy and its personnel by the militants, and that created by a decree of the Iranian State which expressly approved and maintained the situation.",
                "‘ The policy thus announced by the Ayatollah Khomeini, of maintaining the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its inmates as hostages for the purpose of exerting pressure on the United States Government was complied with by other Iranian authorities and endorsed by them repeatedly in statements made in various contexts. The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation created by the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its diplomatic and consular staff as hostages. The approval given to these facts by the Ayatollah Khomeini and other organs of the Iranian State, and the decision to perpetuate them, translated continuing occupation of the Embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of that State.’",
                "(5) As regards State practice, the capture and subsequent trial in Israel of Adolf Eichmann may provide an example of the subsequent adoption of private conduct by a State. On 10 May 1960, Eichmann was captured by a group of Israelis in Buenos Aires. He was held in captivity in Buenos Aires in a private home for some weeks before being taken by air to Israel. Argentina later charged the Israeli Government with complicity in Eichmann’s capture, a charge neither admitted nor denied by Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir, during the discussion in the Security Council of the complaint. She referred to Eichmann’s captors as a ‘volunteer group’. Security Council resolution 138 (1960) of 23 June 1960 implied a finding that the Israeli Government was at least aware of, and consented to, the successful plan to capture Eichmann in Argentina. It may be that Eichmann’s captors were ‘in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of’ Israel, in which case their conduct was more properly attributed to the State under article 8. But where there are doubts about whether certain conduct falls within article 8, these may be resolved by the subsequent adoption of the conduct in question by the State.",
                "(6) The phrase ‘acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own’ is intended to distinguish cases of acknowledgement and adoption from cases of mere support or endorsement. ICJ in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case used phrases such as ‘approval’, ‘endorsement’, ‘the seal of official governmental approval’ and ‘the decision to perpetuate [the situation]’. These were sufficient in the context of that case, but as a general matter, conduct will not be attributable to a State under article 11 where a State merely acknowledges the factual existence of conduct or expresses its verbal approval of it. In international controversies, States often take positions which amount to ‘approval’ or ‘endorsement’ of conduct in some general sense but do not involve any assumption of responsibility. The language of ‘adoption’, on the other hand, carries with it the idea that the conduct is acknowledged by the State as, in effect, its own conduct. Indeed, provided the State’s intention to accept responsibility for otherwise non-attributable conduct is clearly indicated, article 11 may cover cases where a State has accepted responsibility for conduct of which it did not approve, which it had sought to prevent and which it deeply regretted. However such acceptance may be phrased in the particular case, the term ‘acknowledges and adopts’ in article 11 makes it clear that what is required is something more than a general acknowledgement of a factual situation, but rather that the State identifies the conduct in question and makes it its own.",
                "(8) The phrase ‘if and to the extent that’ is intended to convey a number of ideas. First, the conduct of, in particular, private persons, groups or entities is not attributable to the State unless under some other article of chapter II or unless it has been acknowledged and adopted by the State. Secondly, a State might acknowledge and adopt conduct only to a certain extent. In other words, a State may elect to acknowledge and adopt only some of the conduct in question. Thirdly, the act of acknowledgment and adoption, whether it takes the form of words or conduct, must be clear and unequivocal.",
                "(9) The conditions of acknowledgement and adoption are cumulative, as indicated by the word ‘and’. The order of the two conditions indicates the normal sequence of events in cases in which article 11 is relied on. Acknowledgement and adoption of conduct by a State might be express (as for example in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case), or it might be inferred from the conduct of the State in question.”"

Finally, the Court observes that none of the situations, other than those referred to in Articles 4 and 8 of the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility, in which specific conduct may be attributed to a State, matches the circumstances of the present case in regard to the possibility of attributing the genocide at Srebrenica to the Respondent. The Court does not see itself required to decide at this stage whether the ILC’s Articles dealing with attribution, apart from Articles 4 and 8, express present customary international law, it being clear that none of them apply in this case. The acts constituting genocide were not committed by persons or entities which, while not being organs of the FRY, were empowered by it to exercise elements of the governmental authority (Art. 5), nor by organs placed at the Respondent’s disposal by another State (Art. 6), nor by persons in fact exercising elements of the governmental authority in the absence or default of the official authorities of the Respondent (Art. 9); finally, the Respondent has not acknowledged and adopted the conduct of the perpetrators of the acts of genocide as its own (Art. 11).",

In determining the question as to whether the illegal conduct of the individuals can somehow be attributed to SFOR, the Trial Chamber refers to the principles laid down in the Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (‘ILC’) on the issue of ‘Responsibilities of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’. These Draft Articles were adopted by the ILC at its fifty-third session in 2001. The Trial Chamber is however aware of the fact that any use of this source should be made with caution. The Draft Articles were prepared by the International Law Commission and are still subject to debate amongst States. They do not have the status of treaty law and are not binding on States. Furthermore, as can be deduced from its title, the Draft Articles are primarily directed at the responsibilities of States and not at those of international organisations or entities. As Draft Article 57 emphasises,",

                "61. In the present context, the focus should first be on the possible attribution of the acts of the unknown individuals to SFOR. As indicated in Article I of Annex 1-A to the Dayton Agreement, IFOR (SFOR) is a multinational military force. It ‘may be composed of ground, air and maritime units from NATO and non-NATO nations’ and ‘will operate under the authority and subject to the direction and political control of the North Atlantic Council.’ For the purposes of deciding upon the motions pending in the present case, the Chamber does not deem it necessary to determine the exact legal status of SFOR under international law. Purely as general legal guidance, it will use the principles laid down in the Draft Articles insofar as they may be helpful for determining the issue at hand.",
                "64. The Trial Chamber observes that both Parties use the same and similar criteria of ‘acknowledgement’, ‘adoption’, ‘recognition’, ‘approval’ and ‘ratification’, as used by the ILC. The question is therefore whether on the basis of the assumed facts SFOR can be considered to have ‘acknowledged and adopted’ the conduct undertaken by the individuals ‘as its own’. It needs to be re-emphasised in this context that it cannot be deduced from the assumed facts that SFOR was in any way, directly or indirectly, involved in the actual apprehension of the accused in the FRY or in the transfer of the accused into the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Nor has it in any way been argued or suggested that SFOR instructed, directed or controlled such acts. What can be concluded from the assumed facts is merely that the Accused was handed over to an SFOR unit after having been arrested in the FRY by unknown individuals and brought into the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. From the perspective of SFOR, the Accused had come into contact with SFOR in the execution of their assigned task. In accordance with their mandate and in light of Article 29 of the Statute and Rule 59 bis, they were obliged to inform the Prosecution and to hand him over to its representatives. From these facts, the Trial Chamber can readily conclude that there was no collusion or official involvement by SFOR in the alleged illegal acts.”"

In the light of the above-mentioned case-law it appears that if the investigative or judicial authorities of a Contracting State institute their own criminal investigation or proceedings concerning a death which has occurred outside the jurisdiction of that State, by virtue of their domestic law ..., the institution of that investigation or those proceedings is sufficient to establish a jurisdictional link for the purposes of Article 1 between that State and the victim’s relatives who later bring proceedings before the Court ...",

Where no investigation or proceedings have been instituted in a Contracting State, according to its domestic law, in respect of a death which has occurred outside its jurisdiction, the Court will have to determine whether a jurisdictional link can, in any event, be established for the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 to come into effect in respect of that State. Although the procedural obligation under Article 2 will in principle only be triggered for the Contracting State under whose jurisdiction the deceased was to be found at the time of death, ‘special features’ in a given case will justify departure from this approach, according to the principles developed in Rantsev, §§ 243-44. However, the Court does not consider that it has to define in abstracto which ‘special features’ trigger the existence of a jurisdictional link in relation to the procedural obligation to investigate under Article 2, since these features will necessarily depend on the particular circumstances of each case and may vary considerably from one case to the other.”"

Inspired by the general principle of de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court (see Ladygin v. Russia (dec.), no. 35365/05, 30 August 2011). The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case (see Gagliano Giorgi, cited above, § 55).

It was evident from the domestic proceedings that R.S. had clearly intended to murder the first applicant with an axe, as he had done to G.M. He had only been prevented from doing so by a locked door and ultimately the intervention of the Hungarian police, who had disarmed him.

That threshold is not limited to the mere “approval” and “endorsement” of the act in question, which, in the words of the ILC Commentary, “do not involve any assumption of responsibility” (ibid.) – Article 11 of the Draft Articles explicitly and categorically requires the “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of that act (see paragraph 34 above). The differentiation between the mere “approval” and “endorsement” of the act in question – which, on the one hand, in and of themselves do not bring about the responsibility of a respective State for that act, and, on the other hand, its “acknowledgment” and “adoption” as a threshold that must be reached for that responsibility to be invoked, has also been endorsed in the case-law of the ICTY (see paragraph 37 above). Moreover, the two conditions – “acknowledgment” and “adoption” – are cumulative, as stems directly from the wording of Article 11 of the Draft Articles, and, in addition, require that the State “acknowledges” and “adopts” the act “as its own”, which again demonstrates the very stringent requirements set by that provision.

Each of those measures certainly constituted, individually and cumulatively, the subsequent “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s acts by various institutions and the highest officials of the State, and that “approval” and “endorsement” strongly resonated with the feelings of Azerbaijani society at large. In particular, such measures as awarding R.S eight years’ salary arrears or promoting him within the military are indications of not only the State’s explicit, clear and unequivocal “endorsement” of the crimes committed by him, but also of their appreciation of R.S.’s conduct at the time when he was in the military service of the State of Azerbaijan."

The Court now turns to the assessment of the impugned measures from the standpoint of whether they constituted not the mere “approval” and “endorsement” by the State of Azerbaijan of the criminal acts committed by R.S., but also their “acknowledgment” and “adoption” in the sense of Article 11 of the Draft Articles. Although not decisive for the Court’s assessment, it is of importance that R.S.’s criminal acts were purely private acts of a criminal nature, and not related, whether directly or indirectly, with any State action at the time when they were committed (see paragraph 111 above). It has not escaped the Court’s attention that the impugned measures – in particular the granting of salary arrears and promoting R.S. in rank within the military – were undertaken by the State of Azerbaijan. That being so, the legal question before the Court in its examination of the applicants’ complaints under the substantive limb of Article 2 remains whether the very fact that the impugned measures were taken by the State of Azerbaijan allows for their categorisation – within the context of the factual circumstances, as submitted and argued by the parties, and in accordance with the standards of international law as it stood at the material time and stands today (see paragraphs 114-116 above) – in such a manner as to justify the Court in concluding that the respective State not only manifestly demonstrated its “approval” and “endorsement” of R.S.’s acts, but in fact “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” them as acts not just, strictly speaking, perpetrated by R.S., but in fact as having been perpetrated by the State itself. Having most thoroughly examined the nature and scope of the impugned measures within the overall context in which they were taken and in the light of international law, the Court is unable to conclusively find that such “clear and unequivocal” “acknowledgement” and “adoption” indeed took place. In substance those measures can be interpreted not so much as the State’s “acknowledgment” and “adoption” of R.S.’s criminal acts, as such, but rather as having the purpose of publicly addressing, recognising and remedying R.S.’s adverse personal, professional and financial situation, which the authorities of Azerbaijan perceived, unjustifiably in the Court’s view, as being the consequence of the allegedly flawed criminal proceedings in Hungary (see paragraph 106 above). It follows that, although the Court considers it beyond any doubt that by their actions various institutions and highest officials of the State of Azerbaijan “approved” and “endorsed” the criminal acts of R.S., applying the very high threshold set by Article 11 of the Draft Articles – as interpreted and applied by international tribunals, in particular the ICJ and the ICTY (see paragraphs 36-37 above) – the Court cannot but conclude that, on the facts of the case, as presented by the applicants, it has not been convincingly demonstrated that the State of Azerbaijan “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” “as its own” R.S.’s deplorable acts, thus assuming, as such, responsibility for his actual killing of G.M. and the preparations for the murder of the first applicant. The Court places emphasis on the fact that this assessment is undertaken on the basis of the very stringent standards set out by the existing rules of international law, as they stood at the material time and stand today, from which the Court sees no reason or possibility to depart in the present case. Therefore, contrary to what was argued by the applicants, the present case cannot be considered fully comparable to the ICJ’s United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case."

Admittedly, in cases where crimes have been committed by police officers acting outside of their official duties, the Court has already held that the member States of the Council of Europe are expected to set high professional standards within their law-enforcement systems and ensure that the persons serving in these systems meet the requisite criteria (see Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, § 290; and Gorovenky and Bugara v. Ukraine, nos. 36146/05 and 42418/05, § 38, 12 January 2012). The Court accepts that similar standards may apply to members of the armed forces. However, having regard to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court is not convinced that the private acts of R.S. could have been foreseen by his commanding officers or should be held imputable to the Azerbaijani State as a whole, just because that individual happened to be its agent. Indeed, the impugned acts were so flagrantly abusive and so far removed from R.S.’s official status as a military officer that, on the facts of the case, his most serious criminal behaviour cannot engage the State’s substantive international responsibility. What is more, nothing in the case file suggests that the procedure in Azerbaijan for the recruitment of members of the armed forces and the monitoring of their compliance with professional standards at the time that R.S. was sent on his mission – including their continued mental fitness to serve – had been inadequate."

The applicants emphasised that the issues of deterrence and the prevention and suppression of offences were inextricably linked to the question of punishment, all of which were highly relevant to the case, given its very high profile, both nationally and internationally. Such a profile meant that the Azerbaijani authorities’ failure to act in an appropriate way to ensure that others were deterred from committing similar offences had magnified the effects of the case.

It was worth noting that the said declaration was one of five such declarations made on the same date, alongside one (so entitled) “reservation”.

In the Court’s opinion, in view of the extremely tense political situation between the two countries, the authorities should have been all the more cautious, given that the victims of the crimes in the present case were of Armenian origin (see in this sense the European Parliament’s resolution cited at paragraph 42 above)."

First of all, in the absence of any proof other than an affidavit lodged by R.S.’s defence lawyer (see paragraph 13 above), it is difficult to seriously question the fairness of criminal proceedings conducted in another Council of Europe Member State. Indeed, R.S. was afforded a criminal trial in Hungary before courts at two judicial instances, which delivered well-reasoned decisions. In particular, the Hungarian courts explained that R.S. himself had initially asked for an interpreter from Hungarian into Russian and that – once he had complained about not understanding that language to the necessary degree – they had conducted an in-depth analysis of the disadvantage at which this may have put him in the proceedings against him. In the end, they concluded that it was proven that R.S. had a good command of Russian and that, in any event, at his request he had subsequently been provided with interpreters and translations of documents into his native language (see paragraph 15 above)."

In any event, there is insufficient evidence that any procedural omission – if indeed there had been one – was not subsequently offset by procedural safeguards or that such an omission rendered the entire proceedings against him unfair (see, mutatis mutandis, Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, § 262, ECHR 2016).

In particular, the Court is satisfied that R.S.’s mental capacities had been thoroughly assessed during his trial in Hungary by a number of medical experts and that he was found to have been mentally able to understand the dangers and consequences of his actions at the time of the offences (see paragraph 15 above). The subsequent decision by the Azerbaijani authorities to promote R.S. to a higher military rank would clearly suggest that he was deemed fit to continue to serve in the military and therefore did not suffer from a serious mental condition."

The Azerbaijani Government did not provide any explanation as to why R.S. had been granted those benefits, nor did they indicate the legal basis for such actions apart from citing the applicable regulation on military promotion (see paragraph 30 above).

Discrimination on account of, inter alia, a person’s ethnic origin is a form of racial discrimination. Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy’s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment ( see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 145, and Timishev v. Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, § 56, ECHR 2005). The Court has also held that no difference in treatment which is based exclusively or to a decisive extent on a person’s ethnic origin is capable of being objectively justified in a contemporary democratic society built on the principles of pluralism and respect for different cultures (see Timishev, cited above, § 58)."

As to the burden of proof in this sphere, the Court reiterates that in the proceedings before it there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. Proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see Nachova, cited above, § 147)."

The Court has further recognised that Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (see Aktaş v. Turkey, no. 24351/94, § 272, ECHR 2003 ‑ V). In certain circumstances, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation on how the events in question occurred (see Al Nashiri v. Romania, no. 33234/12, §§ 492-493, 31 May 2018, and the cases cited therein). Finally, having recognised that proving racial motivation will often be extremely difficult in practice (see, among many other authorities, Mižigárová v. Slovakia, no. 74832/01, § 120, 14 December 2010), the Court did not rule out requiring a respondent Government to disprove an arguable allegation of discrimination in certain cases of alleged discrimination and, if they fail to do so, find a violation of Article 14 of the Convention on that basis (see Nachova, cited above, § 157; Stoica v. Romania, no. 42722/02, § 130, 4 March 2008; and Adam v. Slovakia, no. 68066/12, § 91, 26 July 2016).",

At the outset, the Court observes that the Hungarian courts convicted R.S. of committing an exceptionally cruel murder and of making preparations for another murder; moreover, the sole motive for those crimes was the Armenian nationality of his victims (see paragraph 15 above). The ethnic bias in respect of R.S.’s crimes was thus fully investigated and highlighted by the Hungarian courts, and the Court sees no reasons to question those conclusions. Nor did the applicants in the present case complain of a failure to investigate racist motives for R.S.’s crimes. In fact, the applicants submitted under Article 14 of the Convention that the Armenian ethnic origin of the victims had not only been the main reason for the said crimes, but also for the various subsequent actions of the Azerbaijani authorities, including the pardoning and glorification of the perpetrator. In that respect, the applicants’ discrimination complaint differs significantly from complaints typically raised under the procedural limb of Articles 2 or 3 in other cases concerning discriminatory violence (compare with, among many other authorities, Lakatošová and Lakatoš v. Slovakia, no. 655/16, § 65, 11 December 2018; Ciorcan and Others v. Romania, nos. 29414/09 and 44841/09, § 152, 27 January 2015; and Angelova and Iliev, cited above, § 107)."

                "214. The Court has already found that the Azerbaijani authorities’ actions in the present case constituted a breach of the procedural limb of Article 2 (see paragraph 172 above). Faced with the applicants’ complaint of a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 2, as formulated, the Court’s task is to establish whether or not the Armenian ethnic origin of R.S.’s victims and the nature of his crimes played a role in the measures taken by the Azerbaijani authorities following his return to Azerbaijan."

Firstly, R.S. was pardoned immediately upon his return to Azerbaijan; there is nothing in the case file to indicate that a formal request to this end was ever made, and nor is there any indication that there ensued any kind of reflection process or legal procedure for the pardon (see paragraph 29 above). Secondly, R.S. was not only reinstated to his post in the military, he was also promoted in military rank in a public ceremony shortly after his return to Azerbaijan. Moreover, he received a flat in Baku, together with salary arrears in respect of the entire period that he had spent in prison (even though the latter measure was provided under the domestic law only in respect of acquitted persons – see paragraph 28 above). As already stated, the Government did not indicate a domestic legal basis for all of those additional measures (see paragraph 169 above), which were understandably perceived as constituting rewards for R.S.’s actions (see paragraph 172 above). Nor have they provided any past examples of other convicted murderers who received analogous benefits upon their release following a presidential pardon."

It also deplores the fact that a large majority of those statements expressed particular support for the fact that R.S.’s crimes had been directed against Armenian soldiers, congratulated him on his actions and called him a patriot, a role model and a hero."

The applicants also drew the Court’s attention to the fact that a special page on the website of the President of Azerbaijan had been created, labelled “Letters of Appreciation regarding [R.S.]”, where individuals could express their congratulations on his release and pardon (see paragraph 102 above). A vast number of those letters were still viewable on that webpage, all of them thanking the President for pardoning R.S. on the basis that they agreed with his having killed his Armenian victim. While it is true that the President himself had never posted anything in that section, its mere existence and the reason therefor pointed to the idea that R.S. had been pardoned because his attack had been of an ethnic nature and that the granting of the pardon could be perceived as an important step in the process of legitimising and glorifying R.S.’s actions."

                "218. In the light of the above, and bearing in mind that the present case concerns one of the most fundamental rights guaranteed by the Convention, the Court is satisfied that the applicants have put forward sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences as to make a convincing prima facie case that the measures taken by the Azerbaijani authorities in respect of R.S. were racially motivated. The Court is mindful of the difficulty faced by the applicants in proving such bias beyond a reasonable doubt, given that the facts in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the Azerbaijani authorities. The Court considers that, given the particular circumstances of the present case, it was therefore incumbent on the respondent Government to disprove the arguable discrimination allegation made by the applicants (see paragraph 212 above)."

Having already examined those arguments in the context of the applicants’ complaint under the procedural limb of Article 2 and dismissed them as unconvincing (see paragraphs 165-168 above), the Court sees no reason to hold otherwise in the context of the present complaint."

The Azerbaijani Government also submitted two statements made by public officials in support of their contention that their actions in respect of R.S. had not been discriminatory (see paragraph 26 above). At this juncture, the Court reiterates that the present case does not merely concern R.S.’s pardon, but more generally the hero’s welcome accorded to him, the various benefits granted to him, and the unquestionable approval of his actions expressed by high-ranking officials and by Azerbaijani society as a whole (see paragraph 169 above). In the Court’s view, the two statements provided by the Azerbaijani Government are therefore not sufficient to refute the overwhelming body of evidence submitted by the applicants indicating that the various measures leading to R.S.’s virtual impunity, coupled with the glorification of his extremely cruel hate crime, had a causal link to the Armenian ethnicity of his victims."

This obligation requires the Contracting States to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court, whether it is conducting a fact-finding investigation or performing its general duties as regards the examination of applications. A failure on a Government’s part to submit any such information that is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicants’ allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 of the Convention (see Medova v.

                "15. Between January and April 2008, the Klaipėda Seaport Police questioned as witnesses the sailors who had worked on the Vega with V.B. The sailors testified that V.B., who was a refrigerator mechanic, worked in the machinery section of the ship, where the refrigerators were placed. There had been frequent fires in the machinery section of the ship during the voyage by the Vega. When fires broke out, there was a strong smell of fumes. When there was a fire in the machinery section, the air conditioning in the ship ’ s cabins did not work, and the temperature would rise as high as 50 ˚C. In the run up to 24 October 2007, the ship had been preparing to have goods loaded. For that reason, V.B. had worked for about a week prior to his death in the machinery section preparing refrigerators for the shipment. The applicant ’ s husband was seen working in the machinery section both with and without a gas mask. In the week before his death, V.B. had worked intensively and rested little. No repairs in the machinery section had been carried out until V.B. ’ s death. After the death, the ship had been repaired in a Brazilian port, after which there had been no smell of gas in the machinery section. The witnesses also stated that V.B. had not complained about his health or stated that he had any heart problems."

The SLI held that the reasons for V.B. ’ s death were not connected to his work. The SLI discontinued its investigation, on the grounds that V.B. ’ s death certificate had indicated that he had died of a heart attack, and that the authorisation to preserve his body had read that there had been no indication against such an action. When examining the applicant ’ s complaint, the SLI had obtained internal correspondence between Limarko and the Vega, which showed that the working conditions on the ship had been hard – the ship ’ s machinery, including the main engine, would often break down, and the engine emitted combustion gases into the ship; there had also been frequent fires. However, according to the SLI, V.B. ’ s duties did not include repairs to the main engine or extinguishing fires, and he had not done such jobs. The SLI did not have any other proof that the working conditions on the Vega had been harmful. The SLI also observed that they had not performed any readings on the ship, because they had not been able to check it when it was at sea."

The prosecutor held that no crime had taken place and that the applicant ’ s husband had died of a heart attack, when ‘ the ship was on a voyage in the Atlantic Ocean near the Brazilian port of Imbituba ’. The prosecutor also relied on the testimony given by an expert, V. A. during the hearing in April 200 8 before the Klaipėda Regional Administrative Court (see paragraph 49 below). On the basis of V.B. ’ s medical record of 15 June 2001 that expert had testified that V.B. had a partial blockage of the nerve in the heart which makes the heart contract. If the nerve did not work properly, heart arrhythmia could occur, which could in turn cause a heart attack. The position of V.B. ’ s body was typical of someone who had died of a heart attack. According to that expert, fire could cause a heart attack if a person had been in a smoky environment or a closed space, and there had been a lack of oxygen. However, a heart attack would happen at a slower pace than a person would die of suffocation. Death from a heart attack caused by a fire could not take a day or week to happen.",

In particular, the applicant submitted that the SLI ’ s decision not to treat the death as an accident at work had been hasty. The applicant was also dissatisfied that the SLI had not inspected the Vega itself, nor had it questioned the crew members, who could have confirmed the unsafe working conditions on board. There had also been no autopsy, nor any test for toxins in her husband ’ s skin or hair. The body had been embalmed too quickly, without such examinations. The applicant further submitted that Lithuanian diplomats had not been present when the body had been embalmed. The applicant also pointed out that her husband had been healthy: he had been examined by a doctors ’ commission in April 2007 and that that conclusion was valid for one year; moreover, her husband had not complained about any heart issue. The applicant also maintained that even local journalists in the town in Brazil where V.B. ’ s death had been given as a heart attack had not been able to find contact data for doctor P. C.

She had also asked for documents confirming whether it had been verified that V.B. could have died of poisoning by combustion gases; for the questioning of doctor V.G. , who had signed the conclusion of the doctors ’ commission ( of April 200 7 ) as to V.B. ’ s health; and for other investigative actions. Given that the applicant had had the status of a victim, the prosecutor had been under an obligation to take a decision on those requests. However, he had ignored the applicant ’ s requests for three months, until he had taken the decision to discontinue the criminal investigation, which had been in breach of Article 178 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( see paragraph 52 below )."

It emphasised that what was at issue was a criminal investigation into charges of a violation of requirements to protect health and safety at work. Having examined the pre-trial investigation material, the regional court concluded that the kind of breaches alleged by the applicant had not been properly examined during the criminal investigation. Furthermore, as could be seen from the SLI ’ s report of 27 March 2008, the inquiry performed by that body had not been sufficiently comprehensive either (see paragraph 1 7 above). Accordingly, it could not be stated that the pre-trial investigation into the circumstances of V.B. ’ s death had been performed thoroughly. In the opinion of the Klaipėda Regional Court, it was therefore vital to continue the pre-trial investigation and to eliminate the doubts raised by the applicant as to the reliability of the results of the medical examination of V.B. ’ s body, and to establish whether V.B. had indeed worked in harmful conditions during the voyage, including whether regulations on hours of work had been observed. Should breaches of working conditions be established, it was also necessary to order a forensic expert to perform an objective investigation and to establish whether such breaches had had any impact on V.B. ’ s death. Without a comprehensive examination of those aspects, it had not been reasonable or lawful to discontinue the pre-trial investigation."

The applicant considered that had there been a fast and thorough investigation, then the experts could have been given more information which in turn could have helped establish the real cause of V.B. ’ s death. Firstly, she was dissatisfied that the pre-trial investigation had been twice discontinued by the prosecutor, which had further unreasonably delayed the criminal inquiry. The applicant also pointed out that although the fact of death had been brought to the Lithuanian authorities ’ attention as early as in autumn 2007, the experts had been ordered to establish the cause of death only in spring 2010. There had also been unjustified delays in preparing a request to the Brazilian authorities for legal assistance. Lastly, the applicant emphasised that her husband ’ s employer, the shipping company Limarko, had destroyed the ship ’ s logbooks, in spite of the investigators ’ request to provide them for examination. The investigation therefore had been inept."

The length of the pre-trial investigation had been caused by the complexity and scope of the case, which had demanded many investigative acts, some of which had been extremely time-consuming. The investigators had had to question a large number of witnesses, who had also worked at sea for long periods. Contrary to the applicant ’ s submission, the shipping company had provided investigators with all the available documentation from the Vega, except for certain materials which had been destroyed by the company due to the sale of the ship. As to the request for legal assistance, there had been objective reasons for it taking several months to send it out after it had been prepared. Firstly, because of the specific rules on asking for legal assistance, and, secondly, because of the need to translate the documents into Portuguese, when there were few competent translators for such work in Lithuania. In addition, the investigators had also relied on the findings of the domestic administrative courts, which had separately looked at the issue of whether the applicant ’ s husband ’ s death could be recognised as a workplace accident. In the view of the Government, if the administrative courts had had any doubts about V.B. ’ s death being due to natural causes, then those courts would have stayed proceedings until the criminal case, pending at the time of the administrative court proceedings, had been decided."

The respondent Government have not argued that the investigation into the death of the applicant ’ s husband did not attract Lithuania ’ s responsibility because he died when ‘ the ship was on a voyage in the Atlantic Ocean near the Brazilian port of Imbituba ’ (see paragraph 19 above). Be that as it may, the Court has already recognised that instances of the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction by a State to include cases involving the activities on board of ships registered in, or flying the flag of, that State (see Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others (dec.) [GC], no. 52207/99, § § 59-61, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII, and Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, § 65, ECHR 2010). In the instant case the Court observes that the Vega belonged to a Lithuanian company Limarko, the ship was registered in the Register of Ships of the Republic of Lithuania and sailed under a Lithuanian flag (see paragraphs 6, 33, 44 and 53 above). Under Lithuanian legislation, the Vega ’ s captain exercised exclusive control over the ship while it was on a voyage (see, mutatis mutandis, Medvedyev, cited above, § § 6 5-67 ). The relations between the ship ’ s crew and the captain, including those related to safety at work, were determined by Lithuanian laws (see paragraph 53 above). The Court therefore considers that the special features of this case do not absolve Lithuania from an obligation to carry out an effective investigation (see Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, no. 25965/04, § § 243-247, ECHR 2010 (extracts))."

Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, § 159, 9 April 2009). However, it would emphasise that this obligation may differ, both in content and in terms of its underlying rationale, depending on the particular situation that has triggered it (see Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy [GC], no. 32967/96, § 51, ECHR 2002-I, and Banks and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 21387/05, 6 February 2007). The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility ( see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 137, ECHR 2002-IV)."

In as much as different considerations apply in cases such as the present one, in which the death has not been caused by use of force or similar direct official action, the standard against which the investigation ’ s effectiveness is to be assessed may be less exacting. However, even in such situations, those concerned are entitled to an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to its effectiveness ( see Jasinskis v. Latvia, no. 45744/08, § 73, 21 December 2010, and the case-law cited therein). In that regard, the Court would point out that this is not an obligation of result, but of means (see, among other authorities, Emars v. Latvia, no. 22412/08, § 76, 1 8 November 2014; Mulini v. Bulgaria, no. 2092/08, § 42, 20 October 2015 ), and that Article 2 does not entail the right to have others prosecuted or sentenced for an offence, or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence (see Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, §§ 94 and 96, ECHR 2004-XII). Nevertheless, in this context the Court also recalls that the authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see Kalicki v. Poland, no. 46797/08, § 51, 8 December 2015 ). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death, or identify the person or persons responsible, will risk falling foul of this standard (see Olszewscy v. Poland, no. 99/12, § 68, 3 November 2015 ). Whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see Rantsev, cited above, § 232).",

                "68. The Court acknowledges at the outset that there was no evidence that V.B. died as a result of the use of force. However, as noted above (see paragraph 6 7 above ), this does not preclude the existence of an obligation to investigate his death under Article 2. In light of the ambiguous and unexplained circumstances surrounding V.B. ’ s death and the allegations of fires and leaks of gases on the Vega in the period leading up to his death, the Court observes that a procedural obligation of effective criminal inquiry did arise in respect of the Lithuanian authorities to investigate the circumstances of V.B. ’ s death (see paragraphs 5 1 and 5 2 above). By necessity, the investigation was required to consider not only the immediate circumstance of V.B. ’ s heart attack but also the broader context of V.B. ’ s working conditions on the Vega, in order to assess whether there was a link between the allegations of hazardous working conditions and V.B. ’ s death."
            ],
            [
                "69. Contrary to what has been suggested by the Government, the Court does not attach particular weight to the fact that the circumstances of the applicant ’ s work on the Vega, and the possible causes of his death, were examined in two separate sets of court proceedings – criminal and administrative. It is true that the administrative proceedings dealt with the question of whether the death of the applicant ’ s husband could be considered as a work accident. Those proceedings terminated with the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s conclusion of 5 February 2009, dispelling the applicant ’ s version of events (see paragraph 50 above). That being so, for the Court it is sufficient to note that on 20 March 2009, when the administrative court proceedings were already over, the Klaipėda Regional Court held that the criminal investigation as to the true cause of V.B. ’ s death had not been thorough. In fact, to dispel any remaining doubts, the prosecutor was ordered to continue the pre-trial investigation, and a number of investigative measures were conducted afterwards (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above)."
            ],
            [
                "70. As to the adequacy of the criminal investigation, the Court accepts that the ship ’ s captain and other members of its crew examined the scene and that photographs were taken. The following day, the Brazilian police took statements from the captain and the chief engineer (see paragraph 7 above). Aside from those actions, as the applicant rightly noted to the Lithuanian criminal court (see paragraph 2 1 above), her husband ’ s body was quickly embalmed the same day without her being asked whether she wished any further investigative actions to be taken. As a result, the experts could subsequently only discuss hypothetical possible causes for V.B. ’ s death, given that the lack of an autopsy prevented them from stating with certainty that he had died of a heart attack (see paragraphs 40-42 above). On this point the Court also notes that the ship ’ s captain performs the role of an investigative officer if a criminal act takes place on his ship (see paragraph 53 above). Whilst acknowledging that it was mostly not within the captain ’ s competence to decide what investigative measures the Brazilian authorities should have undertaken before embalming the body, it cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that a heart attack as the cause of death was opportune in the face of the overall suspicions of hazardous work conditions on that ship. That being so, and whilst any possible failure to undertake investigative measures on 24 or 25 October 2007 on Brazilian territory is mostly not down to the Lithuanian ship ’ s captain and thus not down to the Lithuanian authorities (see paragraph 53 above), it also transpires from the facts of the case that there were numerous deficiencies once the investigation into the circumstances of the applicant ’ s husband ’ s death was conducted in Lithuania."
            ],
            [
                "71. Turning to the criminal investigation, the Court firstly shares the applicant ’ s view, also confirmed by the Klaipėda Regional Court, that on 29 December 2007 the Lithuanian prosecutor acted hastily in discontinuing the criminal proceedings, essentially relying only on what by then appears to have been a fairly limited amount of evidence, and quickly accepting the fact that V.B. had died of heart attack, as had been indicated in V.B. ’ s Brazilian death certificate (see paragraphs 1 3 and 1 4 above)."
            ],
            [
                "72. The Court also observes that after the criminal case had been returned for further investigation, in 2009 the Klaipėda Seaport Police eventually asked the SLI to provide information on whether the Vega had been inspected. It is particularly striking to note the SLI ’ s answer that they had not inspected the ship after V.B. ’ s death, which had taken place nearly two years before (see paragraphs 24 and 27 above). Although the applicant strongly believed that her husband had not died of natural causes, but had been a victim of poisoning by combustion gases, and abundant evidence about those gases and fires on the ship had been brought to the attention of the Lithuanian authorities as early as in spring 2008 (see paragraphs 1 5-17 above ), the Lithuanian authorities made no effort to instruct the Limarko company to bring the ship back to Lithuania, where it could be properly examined, whereas Article 76 of the Code of Criminal Procedure appears to grant the prosecutor exactly that right (see paragraph 5 2 above). In that connection, the Court further notes that documents and medical experts have established, on the one hand, that the applicant ’ s husband was healthy, and that there were no obstacles to him serving on board a ship; on the other hand, those experts also concluded that in the absence of documents about the gases it was not possible to say that those gases were not the cause of V.B. ’ s death (see paragraphs 19 in fine, 30 and 40 above)."
            ],
            [
                "73. The Court further observes that on 10 September 2008 the applicant submitted a written request to the prosecutor to take particular actions to find out about the working conditions on the Vega at the material time. The prosecutor ignored her requests, which was recognised by the Klaipėda City District Court (see paragraph 2 2 above). Furthermore, although the applicant had as early as July 2009 alerted the prosecutor to the fact that Limarko intended to sell the Vega, and had asked the prosecutor to make sure that relevant documents would not be lost, her request again did not receive a timely response from the Lithuanian authorities. As a result, when half a year later the Klaipėda Seaport Police finally asked Limarko to submit documents regarding the Vega ’ s machinery section, the company confirmed that the ship had been sold to a third party, and the relevant logbooks had been destroyed (see paragraphs 28, 33 and 34 above). That being so, the Court finds that the Lithuanian authorities failed to secure all the relevant evidence, given the value of such evidence in helping to clarify matters which were central to the investigation. The Court also considers that even if the applicant had been granted victim status at the beginning of the criminal investigation, her participation appears to have been limited to being able only to gain access to the investigation file (see paragraphs 12, 20 and 32 above). Accordingly, the Lithuanian authorities failed to ensure that the applicant was able to participate effectively in the proceedings, despite her constant and strenuous efforts to remain involved."

                "74. Finally, the Court turns to the question of legal assistance. It cannot but note that it took the Lithuanian authorities some eight months to prepare and send such a request to the Brazilian authorities (see paragraphs 36 and 37 above). In any case, given that the request was sent more than three years after the death and after the opening of the pre-trial investigation, it is not astounding that no relevant information was received from the Brazilian authorities (see paragraph 38 above). That notwithstanding, the Court cannot but hold that the Lithuanian prosecutors once again simply accepted the lack of information as a fact, without considering whether it was necessary, for example, to submit another request for legal assistance to their Brazilian colleagues (see, mutatis mutandis, Rantsev, cited above, § 241). In this context the Court also is not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument about difficulties in finding a translator from Portuguese language in Lithuania."

The investigating authority had inspected the place of the alleged abduction immediately after the report, and had questioned Ms B., who had submitted the report, Mr S., who had witnessed someone being pushed into a black van, and their colleague Ms R., who had not seen or heard anything noteworthy and had only learned about the incident from Mr R.; it had also questioned residents of the neighbourhood, who had said that they had not seen anyone being pushed into a car; the investigating authority had also made enquiries with the Ministry of the Interior in Kyiv, the Security Service of Ukraine and the State Border Guard Service to establish the first applicant ’ s whereabouts. The State Border Guard Service had reported that the applicant had crossed the border on the same day in a normal way, his passage had been recorded in the official database, he had presented his passport and he had not made any complaints of abduction to the border guards. The investigating authority had also made an enquiry with Interpol and learned that on 21 October 2012 the first applicant had been detained in Moscow. As to the alleged absence of a border-crossing record at the Russian checkpoint, the Ukrainian authorities were not able to comment as this related to matters that would have taken place in Russian territory and under the authority of the Russian Federation.

The question of using the park at Bolotnaya Square was not raised because the declared number of participants was 5,000, whereas over 20,000 people could be accommodated in the open area of the square and the embankment, and [the organisers] had known that in advance.

[ The witness Mr Deynichenko ] had known that at the beginning of the march the event organisers, including Mr Udaltsov, had discussed between them that they were not going to turn towards the meeting venue but would stop and try to break the cordon to proceed to Bolshoy Kamennyy bridge.",

The park was cordoned off and guarded ... if necessary, by a decision of the operational headquarters, the venue allocated for the meeting could be significantly extended at the expense of the park [at Bolotnaya Square].

He had reached an agreement with the officers of the Moscow Department of the Interior that the cordon would be moved back, but the organisers who had filed the notice [of the event] should have signed the necessary documents. However, those who had called for a sit-in, including Mr Udaltsov, refused [to stand up] to go to the offices of the Moscow Department of the Interior to sign the necessary documents, although he (Mr Gudkov ) had proposed several times that they should do so ...",

Gudkov he had conducted negotiations with the police ... an agreement had been reached that the cordon at the Malyy Kamennyy bridge would be moved back and the access to the park would be opened up, but at that point some young men in hoodies among the protesters began first to push the citizens onto the cordon provoking the [same] response; after that the cordon was broken, the [police] began the arrests and mass disorder ensued.",

He passed this information on to Mr Udaltsov by phone, [and he] replied that they were standing up and heading towards the stage ... he knew that on 6 May 2012 [some] citizens had brought several tents to Bolotnaya Square, but Mr Udaltsov had not informed him about the need to put up tents during the public event.",

                "188. In the light of the above-mentioned case-law it appears that if the investigative or judicial authorities of a Contracting State institute their own criminal investigation or proceedings concerning a death which has occurred outside the jurisdiction of that State, by virtue of their domestic law ..., the institution of that investigation or those proceedings is sufficient to establish a jurisdictional link for the purposes of Article 1 between that State and the victim ’ s relatives who later bring proceedings before the Court ...",
                "190. Where no investigation or proceedings have been instituted in a Contracting State, according to its domestic law, in respect of a death which has occurred outside its jurisdiction, the Court will have to determine whether a jurisdictional link can, in any event, be established for the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 to come into effect in respect of that State. Although the procedural obligation under Article 2 will in principle only be triggered for the Contracting State under whose jurisdiction the deceased was to be found at the time of death, ‘ special features ’ in a given case will justify departure from this approach, according to the principles developed in Rantsev, §§ 243-44. However, the Court does not consider that it has to define in abstracto which ‘ special features ’ trigger the existence of a jurisdictional link in relation to the procedural obligation to investigate under Article 2, since these features will necessarily depend on the particular circumstances of each case and may vary considerably from one case to the other.”"

As regards Russia, the first applicant alleged that it had been responsible for the acts of the unidentified perpetrators of the abduction because he believed that they were Russian State agents carrying out official duties. Moreover, his continued deprivation of liberty after crossing the Russian border and his alleged ill-treatment leading to his writing a statement confessing to having organised acts of mass disorder had taken place in the territory of the Russian Federation.

Ukraine had territorial jurisdiction over the first applicant at the time of his alleged abduction and ill-treatment on the way to the Russian border. Accordingly, if the first applicant made an arguable claim that he had been deprived of his liberty and ill-treated within their territory, the Ukrainian authorities had a duty to investigate that claim.

However, in February 2015 the Government submitted a fresh set of observations and stated that the decision of 7 December 2012 had been quashed by the Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine and that the criminal investigation into the first applicant ’ s alleged abduction was pending (see paragraph 141 above)."

He contested the allegation that he could have left Kyiv for Moscow of his own will and pointed out that his “disappearance” had occurred during an interval in the consultation with the HIAS; he had left some of his personal belongings at the NGO ’ s office and some in a locker at the Kyiv railway station. Those belongings had been handed in to the police and had then been given to the applicant ’ s counsel. He alleged that his abductors had deviated from the shortest route to Moscow by at least 330 km, according to the Ukrainian border-control stamp in his passport; at the same time, there was no stamp by the Russian border control in his passport. The first applicant also pointed out that at the time of his entry into Russia he had been on the “wanted” list and would have been detained if he had tried to enter in a regular way. He contended that neither the Ukrainian nor the Russian authorities had properly investigated his abduction despite the ample evidence, including witness statements. Moreover, the Ukrainian authorities had acknowledged that the investigation had been deficient when in 2014 they had quashed the decision of 7 December 2012 and ordered its resumption.

This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev v.

By presenting witness statements from the HIAS staff the applicant made a prima facie case of abduction, possibly associated with inhuman or degrading treatment during his transfer to Russia, which placed the Russian authorities under an obligation to investigate it.

Russia, nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, § 110, 4 October 2016). The Court observes that, according to both parties, the hearings were conducted four days a week, from about 11 a.m. to about 5 p.m. However, this did not include the time the first applicant spent during the transfer between the detention facility and the court. During the trial he regularly complained about his early departures from the detention facility – as early as 6 a.m. – and late arrivals after the hearings, typically after 11 p.m., but sometimes after midnight, and asked the court to reduce the frequency of the hearings, to transfer him to another detention facility or to apply a non ‑ custodial preventive measure. The Government did not comment on the applicant ’ s submissions about his early pick-up and late drop-off times. It appears from the detention facility ’ s report that the drop-off time was 10.15 p.m., which means that the first applicant had seven hours and forty ‑ five minutes before the pick-up for the next day ’ s hearing. The Court considers that the time of rest thus afforded to the first applicant was far from adequate (see also paragraphs 254 - 255 below). However, in the present case the information available about the intensity of the hearing schedule does not, by itself or in combination with other elements known about the conditions of the first applicant ’ s detention and the medical care provided to him, allow the Court to conclude that it attained the threshold of severity required to characterise it as degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention."

The court also considered that the first applicant was likely to continue his criminal activity because he had been intercepted at the stage of preparing the crime. It took into account the police reports stating that the applicant had previously fled and had been placed on the “wanted” list. In the extension orders the courts continued to rely on the information that he had previously tried to flee, that he did not have employment or a permanent income, and that he did not live at his registered address in Irkutsk. In some extension orders they relied also on the gravity of the charges and his previous prosecution for other criminal offences. The extensions ordered after the end of the investigation also indicated that the extension was necessary to allow the first applicant access to the criminal case file.

Moreover, at the time of his journey to Ukraine in October 2012 he did not have the status of a suspect in a criminal case and was not subject to any preventive measure; his absence from his registered address at the time when the authorities decided to bring charges was not in breach of any rule or undertaking. It appears that the courts did not perform a thorough assessment of the information provided by the police and did not question their contradictory allegations as regards the first applicant ’ s previous attempts to flee.

The Court has held that this type of deprivation of liberty requires relevant and sufficient reasons, just as with pre-trial detention. It has specified that the notions of “degree” and “intensity” in its case-law, as criteria for the applicability of Article 5, refer only to the degree of restrictions on liberty of movement, not to differences in comfort or in the internal regime in different places of detention. Thus, the Court would apply the same criteria for deprivation of liberty, irrespective of the place where the applicant was detained ( ibid., §§ 104 and 113-14)."

Although the second applicant considered the latter sanction unlawful and irrelevant for the preventive measure in question, the Court notes that the criminal charges in the present case related to disorder during a public event; the reference to the applicant ’ s conduct at assemblies during the period when he was subjected to the undertaking was thus pertinent for the assessment of the risk of his reoffending. Therefore, at least one of the grounds relied on by the authorities could be said to have genuinely conformed to the purpose of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 § 1 (c), and it does not appear there was any element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 69, ECHR 2008, and the cases cited therein). There was thus no violation of Article 5 § 1 in this respect.

This finding was based solely on one report stating that a police officer had been unable to reach the applicant in order to summon him to receive the indictment on 26 October 2012. However, it appears from the parties ’ submissions that on that date the second applicant attended the indictment procedure in person. Accordingly, even if on one occasion three days previously the applicant had not answered a telephone call, this was of no consequence to the course of the investigation. Moreover, there is nothing in the case file to corroborate the allegation that the difficulty in contacting the second applicant was a recurring problem or that the applicant had travelled beyond Moscow ’ s city limits in breach of the undertaking.

As found above, the second applicant ’ s participation in and conduct at public events could legitimately be taken into account, in view of the nature of the accusations in the criminal case (see paragraph 214 above). Despite the applicant ’ s disagreement with the administrative conviction, the court deciding on the preventive measure was not required to reassess the administrative charges determined by another competent court. For the purpose of his initial two-month detention, the reference to a final judgment could be regarded as “relevant” and “sufficient”. However, the five subsequent decisions ultimately extending his house arrest to a period of over seventeen months reiterated the reasons given in the original order without a fresh assessment of their continued relevance and sufficiency. In particular, it remained unexplained why the court ’ s original assessment that the risk of reoffending could be suitably curbed by a two-month period of detention had to be reviewed. The extensions did not mention any circumstances arising during the first two months of the house arrest indicating the applicant ’ s intention to reoffend or any external reasons pointing to the persistence of this particular risk.

Secondly, the judge ’ s appointment had resulted in a strict deadline for completing the trial at first instance and giving judgment, and that could have motivated the judge to reject the applicants ’ requests to examine witnesses in order to be able to finish the case before taking up his new office. The applicants specified that they had not challenged the judge because of the numerous warnings given to the lawyers throughout the hearing when they had made procedural applications such as requests to examine certain witnesses. The judge had considered some of these applications an abuse of process and potentially punishable, and this had discouraged the defence counsel from raising important procedural points, including the judge ’ s lack of independence and impartiality."

The Court reiterates that, in principle, it is competent to examine whether the domestic legal provisions on the establishment and competence of judicial organs have been complied with. However, having regard to the general principle that it is primarily for the national courts themselves to interpret the provisions of domestic law, the Court finds that it may not question their interpretation unless it is arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see Molla Sali v. Greece [GC], no. 20452/14, § 1 49, 19 December 2018). In the present case, the Court has no grounds for finding that the appointment of Judge Z. to a superior court precluded him from continuing to hear the case under examination before the new appointment had taken effect.

In so far as the applicants argued that Z. might subsequently be involved in the case at the appeal stage, the Court notes that he was appointed to the Military Section of the Supreme Court, whereas the applicants ’ case would be heard by the Criminal Section.

The Court observes that the decision on Z. ’ s appointment was taken on 18 June 2014, four months after the beginning of the trial and about one month before its end, including two final weeks when the court was deliberating in private, preparing the text of the judgment. The material in the case file contains no indication that Judge Z. ’ s appointment affected his conduct, in particular his approach to dealing with witnesses and evidence in the proceedings.

The judge had therefore decided to reject the applicants ’ request, considering that the court had heard the submissions of other participants in the trial.

As for the first applicant ’ s complaint about the court ’ s refusal to call and examine his former legal counsel F. as a witness, the Government submitted that F. had been given the status of witness in the criminal proceedings which had subsequently been joined with the proceedings in which he had acted as the first applicant ’ s defence counsel. Therefore, he had been unable to continue as defence counsel in the joined case. At the same time, in the same proceedings he had been prevented from testifying about circumstances which were covered by the client-lawyer privilege.

The clinic had replied on 1 April 2014 that no medical leave had been given to the second applicant. On the same day the court had ordered the applicant to attend the hearing and he had been brought to the court; his ability to stand trial had been assessed by a doctor called to the courtroom, and the second applicant had stated that he did not require medical assistance.

The Court accepts that in complex criminal proceedings involving several persons who cannot be tried together, references by the trial court to the participation of third parties, who may later be tried separately, may be indispensable for the assessment of the guilt of those on trial. Criminal courts are obliged to establish the facts of the case relevant for the assessment of the legal responsibility of the accused as accurately and precisely as possible, and they cannot present established facts as mere allegations or suspicions. This also applies to facts related to the involvement of third parties, though if such facts have to be introduced, the court should avoid giving more information than necessary for the assessment of the legal responsibility of those accused in the trial before it. Even if the law expressly states that no inferences about the guilt of a person can be drawn from criminal proceedings in which he or she has not participated, judicial decisions must be worded so as to avoid any potential pre ‑ judgment about the third party ’ s guilt in order not to jeopardise the fair examination of the charges in the separate proceedings (see Karaman, cited above, §§ 64 ‑ 65 ).",

Moreover, lengthy transfers in poor conditions to and from courts appear to have been common in Moscow at the material time (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, §§ 103-11).

Whereas Article 8 does not guarantee an unconditional right to leave to attend a relative ’ s funeral, and even though a detainee by the very nature of his situation may be subjected to various limitations of his rights and freedoms, every such limitation must be nevertheless justifiable as being “necessary in a democratic society” (see Lind, § 94, and Feldman, § 34, both cited above). The authorities can refuse an individual the right to attend the funeral of his parents only if there are compelling reasons for such refusal and if no alternative solution can be found (see Płoski v.

In the instant case the Russian authorities did not give any consideration to the first applicant ’ s requests referring to his mother ’ s serious illness and, after she died, they considered that they did not have sufficient time to make the necessary arrangements for him to attend the funeral. The latter refusal was not based on the assessment of his individual situation, in particular the fact that he had not been given an opportunity to see his mother before her death. The time constraints complicating the planning of the funeral attendance was not a sufficient reason for refusing it. It is typical for funerals to be fixed at very short notice and they are generally regarded as a matter of urgency. In this case, it would have been physically possible for the first applicant to arrive at the funeral, which was held on the following day in the same city. The fact that the request came from the Ombudsperson rather than from the applicant should not have mattered because it was clear from her letter that the request had been initiated by the applicant ’ s counsel (see paragraph 144 above). In the Court ’ s view, the decision to refuse the first applicant leave was taken in a manner incompatible with the State ’ s duty to carry out an individualised evaluation of his particular situation and to demonstrate that the restriction of his right to attend a relative ’ s funeral was “necessary in a democratic society”."

In particular, the proposal to block railway lines made in the conversations recorded undercover and relied on by the domestic judgment was attributed to the first applicant, and in any event the extent of violence involved in that proposal was not assessed.

They contended that in its Banković and Others decision the Court had departed from its previous case-law on the scope of interpretation of Article 1 of the Convention. Since the jurisdiction issue in the applicants'case had been left unresolved in the admissibility decision, which pre-dated the Banković and Others decision, the Court should address itself in the first place to the compatibility ratione loci of the application."

In any event, it had already ruled on the admissibility of their complaints. On that account, the Government should be considered estopped from raising a new objection to admissibility at this late stage of the proceedings. The applicants, on the other hand, had addressed the issue of jurisdiction squarely both in their initial application and in their pre-admissibility pleadings. The Government never sought to rebut their claim that Turkey's jurisdiction was engaged on the facts of the case and confined themselves to challenging the admissibility of the application on the grounds set out in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention.

Thus, the Turkish Government can be said to have impliedly accepted the force of that argument and its application to the circumstances of the instant case. Likewise, the Court effectively accepted jurisdiction when it ruled on the issue of domestic remedies. For the applicants, it was inconceivable that the Court had not supposed Turkey's jurisdiction when ruling on admissibility. Its detailed examination of the general and political context as well as its cross-references to other judgments against Turkey is only intelligible on the basis that Turkey came within the terms of Article 1."

However, the scene of the impugned incident was ten kilometres to the south of Mount Medina, and thus beyond the zone of operations. The records of the armed forces showed that no Turkish soldiers were in the area indicated by the applicants. For the Government, the mere presence of Turkish armed forces for a limited time and for a limited purpose in northern Iraq was not synonymous with “jurisdiction”.

During those military operations, the Turkish Government deployed in excess of 35,000 ground troops, backed up by tanks, helicopters and F- 16 fighter aircraft ( Turkey: Anti ‑ Kurdish Offensive, Keesing's Record of World Events, News Digest for March 1995). Given the degree of control enjoyed by the Turkish armed forces of the area, the Turkish Government had de facto authority over northern Iraq and its inhabitants, as opposed to de jure sovereignty. The circumstances of the applicants'case were different from those in the Banković case since the deceased shepherds had been deliberately targeted, murdered and mutilated by Turkish armed forces.

                "48. At the outset, the Court notes that the area in which the acts complained of took place was partly situated in the neutral UN buffer zone. Solomos Solomou violated the ceasefire lines and entered the buffer zone. To this limited extent, he bears responsibility for the tragic course taken by the demonstration (see, mutatis mutandis, Isaak (dec.), cited above). Moreover, the flag pole on which the victim was climbing when he was shot was situated in the “TNRC” territory. In this connection, the Court also notes that the UNFICYP report, submitted by the third -party intervener (see paragraph 36 above), confirms that the killing of Solomos Solomou was the result of the “use of force by Turkish or Turkish - Cypriot military personnel”."

With other persons, he entered the UN buffer zone near the spot of the killing. A road passed the buffer zone at that point, leading to checkpoints guarded by the Cypriot National Guard on the southern side and by officials of the “ Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ” ( “ TRNC ” ) on the northern side. At the Turkish checkpoint there were two military sentry boxes, one on either side of the road leading into the occupied territory. There was also a Turkish flag on a pole situated just behind the Turkish sentry box. Near the sentry box there was a Turkish observation post on a two - storey house."

Solomos Solomou and a handful of other demonstrators ran to the Turkish side of the buffer zone, pursued by UNFICYP personnel. Solomos Solomou crossed the barbed wire at the Turkish ceasefire line and entered the occupied territory. He was pursued by a British soldier from UNFICYP, who attempted to pull him back."

While he was approximately three metres up the pole he was hit by five shots fired by at least three persons from the Turkish side and was fatally injured. He died almost instantly.

Booth caught the male person at this stage and held him by the shirt with one hand. The male person then broke free of this hold and run around the eastern side of the sentry box where I briefly lost sight of him. I next saw this person attempting to climb on the top of the sentry box which was unsuccessful. I then turned my back and attempted to prevent another person from going towards the TCFL. I heard a shot fired and turned around and saw the same male person attempting to climb a flagpole on the Turkish side of the TCFL.",

The male person then slid down the flagpole where I lost sight of him. The same police officer was firing at this time.",

After a token effort by CYPOL, the demonstrators broke through the line with ease and approached the Southern barrier of the buffer zone. This barrier was manned by members of BRITCON and AUSCON.

At this stage, I saw a red flare overhead that had been fired from a southerly direction towards the Turkish side. When the demonstrators reached an area about 30 metres from the Turkish lines, they commenced to throw a barrage of rocks at the Turkish soldiers and police and at a building situated on the eastern side of the entrance barrier. All attempts to negotiate with the demonstrators by the UN personnel within the buffer zone failed both verbally and physically.",

This Turkish officer was standing in the middle of the road facing in a southerly direction about 30 metres distance from the buffer zone barrier. I then saw two other Turkish army soldiers step out of some bushes on the western side of the barrier, about 25 metres away, and started firing their rifles in the direction of the male person on the flagpole. At this stage I saw an amount of blood appear on the male person ’ s neck just below the jaw line on the left hand side. The male then appeared to slide back down the flagpole onto the ground.

For example applications have been brought by a deceased person ’ s wife ( Aytekin v. Turkey, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ VII), a deceased person ’ s mother ( Çiçek v.

Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, § 311, ECHR 2004 ‑ VII ). Furthermore, the words “within their jurisdiction” in Article 1 of the Convention must be understood to mean that a State ’ s jurisdictional competence is primarily territorial (see Banković and Others v.

Turkey, no. 31821/96, §§ 68 and 71, 16 November 2004 ). According to the relevant principles of international law, a State ’ s responsibility may be engaged where, as a consequence of military action – whether lawful or unlawful – that State in practice exercises effective control of an area situated outside its national territory. The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention derives from the fact of such control, whether it be exercised directly, through its armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration ( see Loizidou, cited above, § 52 )."

M. v. Denmark, no. 17392/90, Commission decision of 14 October 1992, Decisions and Reports ( DR ) 73, p. 193; and Illich Sanchez Ramirez v. France, no. 28780/95, Commission decision of 24 June 1996, DR 86, p. 155 ).

Moreover, the exceptions provided in paragraph 2 of Article 2 were not relevant in Mr Solomou ’ s situation. No person had been in danger from the use of unlawful violence by him. There had been no question of effecting a lawful arrest or of preventing an escape. The trespassing of the ceasefire line by one unarmed man could not amount to an insurrection or a riot.",

The Court reiterates that Article 2, which safeguards the right to life and sets out those circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified, ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention, to which no derogation is permitted. Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective ( see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, §§ 146-147)."

The use of force, however, must be no more than \"absolutely necessary\" for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) ( ibid., § 148 )."

In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see, among others, the following judgments: Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, § 161; Ribitsch v.

The burden of proof is thus shifted to the Government and if they fail in their arguments, issues will arise under Article 2 and/or Article 3 (see Toğcu v.

None of the members of UNFICYP who testified about the events of 14 August 1996 mentioned the existence of a crossfire before the shooting of Mr Solomou. On the contrary, Lance Bombardier Sanders, Garda O ’ Reilly, Acting Station Sergeant Hayward and Garda Brennan clearly stated that, from different positions, two soldiers in Turkish uniform and a man in civilian clothes standing on the balcony of the Turkish observation post had aimed their weapons at Solomos Solomou and had fired in his direction while he was climbing the flagpole.

The deceased was unarmed and had not attacked anyone; he was climbing a pole and smoking a cigarette, two actions which were not compatible with violent action against other individuals. Nor can it be argued that he was, at the material time, “lawfully detained” or that the use of force was “absolutely necessary” to “effect a lawful arrest”. Indeed, even assuming that the fact that he had crossed the ceasefire line could justify depriving him of his liberty, it is obvious that he could hardly have escaped from the control of the security forces and that the authorities could have awaited his descent from the flagpole before arresting him. In this connection, the Court attaches a certain weight to the fact that, according to the eyewitnesses, the opening of fire was totally unwarranted and not even preceded by a warning shot."

In the context of the present case, the only question to be addressed is whether the actual killing of Solomos Solomou amounted to a violation of Article 2 of the Convention. At the same time, the Court cannot ignore the fact that, as has also been acknowledged by the third - party intervener (see paragraph 24 above), the demonstrators had sticks and iron bars and were seen throwing stones at the Turkish forces. This led to a situation of tension and to a risk of potentially more violent developments."

The first shots were directed at him and not at the other demonstrators. Under these circumstances, they could hardly be described as measures aimed at calming the violent behaviour of the other demonstrators, who were still in the UN buffer zone. In this context, the Court reiterates that the use of force should be “absolutely necessary” for pursuing one or more of the aims laid down in paragraph 2 of Article 2 and that a potential illegal or violent action from a group of persons cannot, as such, justify the immediate shooting and killing of one or more other individuals who are not themselves posing a threat."

The obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State ’ s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, also requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see, mutatis mutandis, the McCann and Others, cited above, § 161; and Kaya v. Turkey, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, § 105). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v. Turkey [GC] no. 22277/93, § 63, ECHR 2000-VII). The Court recalls that the obligations of the State under Article 2 cannot be satisfied merely by awarding damages. The investigations required under Article 2 of the Convention must be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Bazorkina v. Russia, no. 69481/01, § 117, 27 July 2006 )."

The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (see, for example, Kaya, cited above, § 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible ( Oğur, cited above, § 88). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (with regard to autopsies, see, for example, Salman v.

Thus, the Turkish Government can be said to have impliedly accepted the force of that argument and its application to the circumstances of the instant case. Likewise, the Court effectively accepted jurisdiction when it ruled on the issue of domestic remedies. For the applicants, it was inconceivable that the Court had not supposed Turkey's jurisdiction when ruling on admissibility. Its detailed examination of the general and political context as well as its cross-references to other judgments against Turkey is only intelligible on the basis that Turkey came within the terms of Article 1."

In the Court's opinion, and notwithstanding the requirements of Rule 55 of the Rules of Court, the Government cannot be considered precluded from raising the jurisdiction issue at this juncture. That issue is inextricably linked to the facts underlying the allegations. As such, it must be taken to have been implicitly reserved for the merits stage. It would add that it cannot accept the applicants'arguments that the Court had accepted that Turkey had jurisdiction when it ruled on the admissibility of the application.

However, no Turkish soldiers had been present in the area indicated by the applicants. During this military operation Turkish troops had advanced to Mount Medina. However, the scene of the impugned incident was ten kilometres to the south of Mount Medina, and thus beyond the zone of operations. The records of the armed forces showed that no Turkish soldiers were in the area indicated by the applicants. For the Government, the mere presence of Turkish armed forces for a limited time and for a limited purpose in northern Iraq was not synonymous with “jurisdiction”. Turkey did not exercise effective control of any part of Iraq and it had to be concluded that Turkey could not be held responsible for the acts imputed to it in the instant application."

As regards the video recording of statements made by the KDP Chief of the Amedi region, Mr Shookri Newayi, during a press conference held in Dohouk, the Government observed that the KDP office in Ankara had been contacted with a view to verifying the reliability of the statements made by Mr Nerwayi and to ascertaining the outcome of the investigations carried out by the local authorities. The KDP office replied that Mr Nerwayi was the contact person for the KDP with the Turkish army, that no accusations had been made against the Turkish army and that no investigation had been conducted into the incident (see paragraph 46 above). The KDP's letter also stated that at the relevant time the PKK had been active in the region and that there had been many confrontations between the KDP and the PKK.

The applicants maintained that Turkey's ground operations in northern Iraq were sufficient to constitute “effective overall control” ( within the meaning of the Loizidou judgment ) of the area where the breaches of their relatives'human rights occurred. In their official statements on the conduct of military operations in northern Iraq at the relevant time, the Turkish authorities accepted that the area was under the authority of the Turkish State, and hence within its jurisdiction (see Government Statement. Subject: Military Operation in Northern Iraq. Permanent Mission of Turkey to the United Nations Office of the Press Counsellor, 20 March 1995 ). During those military operations, the Turkish Government deployed in excess of 35,000 ground troops, backed up by tanks, helicopters and F- 16 fighter aircraft ( Turkey: Anti ‑ Kurdish Offensive, Keesing's Record of World Events, News Digest for March 1995). Given the degree of control enjoyed by the Turkish armed forces of the area, the Turkish Government had de facto authority over northern Iraq and its inhabitants, as opposed to de jure sovereignty. The circumstances of the applicants'case were different from those in the Banković case since the deceased shepherds had been deliberately targeted, murdered and mutilated by Turkish armed forces. In their opinion, the fact that the decision ‑ making process that led to the military operation in northern Iraq took place in Turkey lent further weight to their submission that Turkey exercised jurisdiction at the relevant time."

Accordingly, the seven Iraqi shepherds were brought within the jurisdiction of the respondent State by virtue of the de minimis protection afforded by the Geneva Conventions.

Moldova and Russia ([GC], no. 48787/99, ECHR 2004-VII, §§ 330-331).",
                "It further stated that it was not its task to indicate which measures the authorities had to take in order to comply with their obligations most effectively, but that it had to verify that the measures actually taken were appropriate and sufficient in the present case. When faced with a partial or total failure to act, the Court’s task was to determine to what extent a minimum effort was nevertheless possible and whether it should have been made. Determining that question was especially necessary in cases concerning an alleged infringement of absolute rights such as those guaranteed by Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (ibid. § 334).",
                "The Court noted that until 2001, the Moldovan authorities had taken various measures aimed at obtaining the applicants’ release and that as a result, Mr Ilaşcu was released in May 2001. It considered that even after Mr Ilaşcu’s release in May 2001, it was within the power of the Moldovan Government to take measures to secure to the applicants their rights under the Convention. It further noted that the negotiations for a settlement of the situation in Transdniestria, in which the Russian Federation was acting as a guarantor State, had been on-going since 2001 without any mention of the applicants or without any measure being taken or considered by the Moldovan authorities to secure the applicants their Convention rights, although it was within the power of the Moldovan Government to take such measures (ibid., §§ 350 and 351).",
                "The Court therefore held that Moldova’s responsibility was capable of being engaged under the Convention on account of its failure to discharge its positive obligations with regard to the acts complained of which occurred after May 2001 (ibid., § 352)."

                "11. As to the Russian Federation, the Court found that all of the acts committed by the Russian soldiers with regard to the applicants before the ratification of the Convention by the Russian Federation, including their transfer into the charge of the Transdniestrian separatist regime, in the context of the Russian authorities’ collaboration with that illegal regime, were capable of engaging responsibility for the acts of that regime (ibid., § 385).",
                "Turning to the question whether that responsibility was still engaged at the time of the ratification of the Convention by the Russian Federation, the Court found that the “MRT”, which had been set up in 1991-1992 with the support of the Russian Federation and was vested with organs of power and its own administration, remained “under the effective authority, or at the very least under the decisive influence of the Russian Federation, and in any event, it survives by virtue of the military, economic, financial and political support given to it by the Russian Federation” (ibid., § 392).",
                "It therefore held that there was a continuous and uninterrupted link of responsibility on the part of the Russian Federation for the applicants’ fate, as the Russian Federation’s policy of support for the regime and collaboration with it continued beyond 5 May 1998, the date of entry into force of the Convention in respect of the Russian Federation, and after that date the Russian Federation had made no attempt to put an end to the applicants’ situation brought about by its agents, and did not act to prevent the violations allegedly committed after 5 May 1998. In the light of these findings, it considered it to be of little consequence that since 5 May 1998 the agents of the Russian Federation have not participated directly in the events complained of in that application (ibid., § 393).",

In conformity with the relevant principles of international law governing State responsibility, the responsibility of a Contracting Party could also arise when as a consequence of military action - whether lawful or unlawful - it exercises effective control of an area outside its national territory. The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control whether it be exercised directly, through its armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration (see Loizidou v.

Thus, having effective overall control over northern Cyprus, Turkey ’ s responsibility could not be confined to the acts of its own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but should also be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survived by virtue of Turkish military and other support. It followed that, in terms of Article 1 of the Convention, Turkey ’ s “jurisdiction” should be considered to extend to securing the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which she had ratified, and that violations of those rights were imputable to Turkey (see Cyprus v.

The Court found it to be established that from the early days of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, Armenia had had a significant and decisive influence over Nagorno Karabakh, that the two entities were highly integrated in virtually all important matters and that this situation persisted to this day. In other words, Nagorno Karabakh and its administration survived by virtue of the military, political, financial and other support given to it by Armenia which, consequently, exercised effective control over Nagorno Karabakh and the surrounding territories.

The group was accompanied by lieutenant V.G. and captain D.H. (hereafter, officers V.G. and D.H.). After the contest, the servicemen had been taken to a post office, outside which an argument had erupted between officers V.G. and D.H. on one side and Suren Muradyan on the other. Officer V.G. claimed that a watch that Suren Muradyan was wearing belonged to him and had been lost some days before, during a table tennis match. Officers V.G. and D.H. had both started swearing at Suren Muradyan. Officer V.G. had then grabbed Suren Muradyan ’ s hand and removed the watch.

Officers V.G. and D.H. did not believe him and gave him a deadline to reveal the identity of that person. They further claimed that a second watch had been lost and ordered Suren Muradyan to find and bring it within the same deadline. Officer D.H. had threatened that, if he failed to do so, he would get into trouble. After the incident the group had walked to the bus to return to the military unit.

According to its conclusions, it had been possible for the doctors of the military unit not to discover the injuries which led to Suren Muradyan ’ s death since there were no visible traces of injuries on the surface of the skin. The enlarged spleen might have been caused by malaria and the injury sustained by Suren Muradyan might have brought about the sub - capsular bleeding which later led to a ruptured spleen and acute internal bleeding. Referring to the fact that no malaria agents were discovered in Suren Muradyan ’ s blood sample by the parasitological examination of 4 August 2002, the experts attributed this to the fact that agents could be detected at the stage of the disease when the sick person experiences shivering and fever accompanied by high temperature. The opinion lastly stated that, given that no malaria agents had been discovered, not specific but symptomatic treatment had to be prescribed, and in fact had been provided in full."

The opinion further stated that usually a doctor was obliged to deliver a diagnosis after having carefully examined the patient. Suren Muradyan ’ s medical file contained his complaints but no indication of results of any such examination. If on 29 July 2002 Suren Muradyan ’ s spleen had already been enlarged, it would have been possible to detect this through palpation and to transfer him to hospital.

The Senior Assistant to the General Prosecutor concluded that the arguments raised by the applicant had been examined in the course of a thorough and objective investigation by the Military Prosecutor ’ s Office and his challenge was therefore unfounded."

The hospital doctor had carried out all the examinations and tests which he was obliged to in such circumstances.

Serviceman G.M. had started crying and after leaving the office he had asked Suren Muradyan and serviceman K.E. whether they had also been beaten, to which both of them replied “ no ”.

Thereafter Suren Muradyan ’ s fellow servicemen called [military unit doctor S.G.]. The latter came, also failed to diagnose Suren Muradyan ’ s real illness and, having given some anti-fever injections and several paracetamol pills, left. Hence, Suren Muradyan remained ill in the military unit until 3 August 2002, which was also in violation of Order no. 586 of the Minister of Defence of 29 May 2000, namely Suren Muradyan was transferred to hospital later than the prescribed 7 days, as a result of which it was impossible to save [his] life.",

The applicant referred, in particular, to a witness statement by his son ’ s fellow serviceman, according to which his son had woken up in the night of 24 July and complained that he was feeling ill. The same followed from the findings of the post-mortem examination, according to which the initial bruising had been inflicted 8-10 days before death. Furthermore, 24 July was the last day of the deadline fixed by the officers. The investigating authority was deliberately ignoring this evidence and had failed to clarify what had happened on that day, while the proceedings had been perfunctory and not objective and aimed to lead the case into an impasse and not to punish the murderers. The applicant further referred to the fact that serviceman G.M. had admitted that he had been ill-treated by officer K.Z. in his office. It followed from the decision of the General Prosecutor ’ s Office of 24 November 2004 that the same had happened to his son. The accused, officer V.G., had also admitted in court that he had been outside officer K.Z. ’ s office when the latter ill-treated Suren Muradyan and that he had heard him scream. Furthermore, no explanation had been given for the second bruising and abrasion on the forehead sustained by his son 1-2 days before his death. The applicant further complained that the Regional Court had failed to clarify what was meant by the “well-known beating of Suren Muradyan” referred to in the letter of the Head of the National Security Service of Nagorno Karabakh, as well as the circumstances and perpetrators of this beating.

Civil society actors and human rights activists mentioned to the Commissioner that the prevailing customs within the military, which have reportedly favoured impunity among certain military commanders, corruption and penetration of criminal activities in the army – combined with the prevalence of sub-standard living conditions, including lack of adequate food and clothing – have contributed to the occurrence of serious human rights violations in the armed forces that are not related to military operations.",

The Commissioner believes that there is a need to exercise strong and firm political will of the country ’ s top leadership to eliminate all such practices, which not only violate human rights but also dishonour the military.",

Furthermore, his son had never given his consent to perform compulsory military service in Nagorno Karabakh, as envisaged by the said Agreement.

Accordingly, the responsibility of Contracting States can be engaged by acts and omissions of their authorities which produce effects outside their own territory. In conformity with the relevant principles of international law governing State responsibility, the responsibility of a Contracting Party could also arise when as a consequence of military action - whether lawful or unlawful - it exercises effective control of an area outside its national territory. The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control whether it be exercised directly, through its armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration (see Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 18 December 1996, § 52, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ VI, and Catan and Others v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia [GC], nos. 43370/04, 8252/05 and 18454/06, §§ 104-106, ECHR 2012 (extracts) )."

Thus, having effective overall control over northern Cyprus, Turkey ’ s responsibility could not be confined to the acts of its own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but should also be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survived by virtue of Turkish military and other support. It followed that, in terms of Article 1 of the Convention, Turkey ’ s “jurisdiction” should be considered to extend to securing the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which she had ratified, and that violations of those rights were imputable to Turkey (see Cyprus v.

Armenia – it made a similar statement of principle as regards Armenia ’ s general responsibility under the Convention. The Court found it to be established that from the early days of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, Armenia had had a significant and decisive influence over Nagorno Karabakh, that the two entities were highly integrated in virtually all important matters and that this situation persisted to this day. In other words, Nagorno Karabakh and its administration survived by virtue of the military, political, financial and other support given to it by Armenia which, consequently, exercised effective control over Nagorno Karabakh and the surrounding territories. The Court concluded that the matters complained of came within the jurisdiction of Armenia for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention (see Chiragov and Others v. Armenia [GC], no. 13216/05, §§ 169-186, 16 June 2015). Thus, the Court considers that, by exercising effective control over Nagorno Karabakh and the surrounding territories, Armenia is under an obligation to secure in that area the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention and its responsibility under the Convention cannot be confined to the acts of its own soldiers or officials operating in Nagorno Karabakh but is also engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survives by virtue of Armenian military and other support (see Zalyan and Others, cited above, §§ 214-215, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Djavit An v.

In order to shield the perpetrators, they put forward a false account of his son ’ s fatal injury, namely that it had been sustained as a result of an accidental light blow, and utilised the entire investigative machinery, including the medical expertise, to make that account look plausible, despite having numerous pieces of disproving evidence.

In order to establish whether the State satisfactorily discharged its obligation to account for Suren Muradyan ’ s death, the Court must first have regard to the investigation carried out by the authorities and the conclusions reached by them. It notes in this respect that it is undisputed between the parties that Suren Muradyan died as a result of an injury to his spleen which initially resulted in its sub-capsular rupture and later in a full rupture and acute bleeding. It appears that medical negligence may also have contributed to his death. As regards the fatal injury, the authorities carried out an official investigation into this fact and concluded that it had been sustained on 21 July 2002 when officer V.G., during a public argument with Suren Muradyan, briskly shook his hand, as a result of which their hands – apparently accidentally – hit or touched the left side of Suren Muradyan ’ s abdomen and caused the sub-capsular rupture of the spleen. The Court, however, has doubts about this explanation of Suren Muradyan ’ s fatal injury in view of a number of serious flaws in the conduct of the investigation that led to those conclusions."

On the day following his death, namely 5 August 2002, the investigator ordered a post ‑ mortem examination, including an autopsy, to be carried out by a forensic medical expert. The expert started the post-mortem examination on the next day and on that day informed the investigator that Suren Muradyan had died as a result of an injury to his spleen involving old and new bruises. The investigator then decided to institute criminal proceedings under the relevant Article of the Criminal Code on account of intentional infliction of grave bodily harm resulting in the victim ’ s death, taking into account that “Suren Muradyan had been subjected to ill ‑ treatment” (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). However, it does not appear that the investigating authority made genuine attempts to pursue actively this line of inquiry and to give a proper assessment to the relevant circumstances, despite having a number of concrete leads.

First, as early as on 7 August 2002 the investigating authority, having interviewed a number of witnesses, obtained evidence suggesting that Suren Muradyan had had a conflict with two officers of the same military unit, V.G. and D.H. The conflict had started with an argument on 21 July 2002 because of an allegedly stolen watch and Suren Muradyan had been given a deadline to comply with certain demands and had allegedly been threatened that he “would get into trouble” and “would be punished” if he failed to do so. Furthermore, a few days later (around 23-25 July 2002), apparently when the deadline expired, he was taken by those officers on several occasions to the headquarters, including officer K.Z. ’ s office, where the threats allegedly continued. This also appears to be the period when Suren Muradyan started to feel unwell (see paragraphs 7, 22 and 23 above). Despite all this evidence which pointed to possible wrongdoing on the part of officers D.H., V.G. and K.Z., they were not immediately isolated and were not questioned until two, three and ten days later respectively (see paragraphs 24 and 28 above). The Court notes that, while there is no evidence to suggest that these officers colluded with each other, the mere fact that appropriate steps were not taken to reduce the risk of such collusion amounts to a significant shortcoming in the adequacy of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramsahai and Others, cited above, § 330 )."

Second, as regards the actual interviews conducted with those officers, the investigating authority, while having eyewitness evidence suggesting that there had been no obvious acts of physical abuse in respect of Suren Muradyan during the argument of 21 July 2002, nevertheless chose to focus its attention primarily on that argument without making any serious attempts to clarify the circumstances of Suren Muradyan ’ s subsequent visits to the headquarters. No detailed questions were posed to the officers in an attempt to inquire about any possible ill-treatment to which Suren Muradyan might have been subjected during those visits. The denial of any ill-treatment on their part was readily accepted without further inquiries, while in some case the interviews were largely confined to the taking of written statements where the officers were simply asked to recount the events of 21 July 2002 (see paragraphs 24, 25, 27, 28, 33 and 68 above)."

Third, there were two other servicemen, K.E. and G.M., involved in the same events and summoned to the headquarters together with Suren Muradyan, who could have potentially provided crucial information to the investigation. It is true that both of them, when questioned as witnesses, denied having any knowledge of Suren Muradyan having been subjected to ill-treatment during the visits to the headquarters (see paragraphs 23, 26, 37 and 47 above). However, it cannot be ruled out that their testimony was constrained and they did not speak out for fear of reprisals, given that those implicated were their superiors at the military unit where they continued to perform their military service, including such high ‑ ranking officers as the acting commander of the unit, who was also its deputy commander. The investigating authority did not, however, consider taking any appropriate measures to address this possible problem, such as, for example, applying a protective measure under Articles 98 and 98.1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by changing the place of service of the said witnesses and thereby guaranteeing their safety from any possible reprisals (see paragraph 115 above)."

Fourth, the Court notes the ambiguity in the medical expert M.B. ’ s findings concerning the date of the first and main bruising sustained by Suren Muradyan which was crucial to the investigation. In particular, the expert concluded that this bruising had been sustained “more than about 8 ‑ 10 days” before death (see paragraph 30 above). Thus, on the one hand, the expert indicated a specific timeframe, namely 8-10 days, but, on the other hand, appears to have suggested that the bruising could have been sustained at any given point before that timeframe, thereby providing a very ambiguous answer to a crucial question and significantly diminishing the probative value of this evidence. The investigating authority failed to clarify this issue, including what the medical expert meant by “ more than about 8 ‑ 10 days” (emphasis added), as well as the reasons why it had not been possible to indicate a more specific timeframe for the bruising while it was possible to do so in respect of the second bruising sustained in the same area (1-2 days before death)."

What is particularly striking is that officer K.Z. was actually implicated in inflicting violence in the context of the same story on one of the other two servicemen, G.M., who had been summoned to K.Z. ’ s office together with Suren Muradyan for the same purpose. No importance was given to this fact and the authorities readily accepted the narrative in which only serviceman G.M., but not Suren Muradyan, had fallen victim to acts of violence (see paragraphs 90 and 92 above). There was no change in the course of the investigation even after two witnesses, K.B. and H.G., who had had contact with Suren Muradyan not long before his death, explicitly stated that they had been told by him that he had been ill-treated by officers V.G., D.H. and K.Z.

The Court notes that it was not until almost two years later that one of the implicated officers alleged that he had not previously told the whole truth and that there had actually been some accidental contact with Suren Muradyan ’ s abdomen during the argument of 21 July 2002 (see paragraph 64 above). The investigating authority readily accepted this allegation, even if there was no objective evidence to support it, and the entire subsequent investigation, including all the medical expertise, appears to have been geared towards justifying the narrative that the first bruising and the sub-capsular rupture of the spleen had been sustained as a result of that accidental contact.

It is therefore not surprising that the experts considered that blow to be the origin of the said injuries.

As regards the second bruising in the area of Suren Muradyan ’ s spleen which was sustained 1-2 days before his death, it does not appear that any meaningful attempts were made to investigate the origin of that bruising either, including its possible link to the spleen rupture. It appears that it was believed to have been sustained as a result of Suren Muradyan ’ s fall at the hospital (see paragraph 46 and 71 above ). However, such justification completely ignored the fact that the bruising in question had been found to have been sustained by Suren Muradyan 1-2 days before his death, whereas the fall at the hospital apparently happened less than two hours before his death (see paragraph 15 and 30 above). Furthermore, it is not clear on what ground the investigating authority found it to be established that Suren Muradyan ’ s hand had been under his belly when he had fallen at the hospital (see paragraph 69 above)."

Thus, it appears from the contents of these documents that the authorities had at least sufficient evidence to believe that Suren Muradyan had been beaten, but failed or were unwilling to act on that evidence.

However, the Court considers that the imposition of disciplinary penalties in respect of those found liable for the incident could be considered to have constituted an admission by the State ’ s superior military command of the failure to protect the life of the applicant ’ s son and hence an acknowledgement of the breach.

In particular, the civil claim filed by the Military Prosecutor against H.G. in the course of the latter ’ s trial expressly stated that the sum of AMD 2,250,000 paid to Gegham Sergoyan ’ s family had been intended to cover funeral expenses and further included the insurance benefit in the event of death (see paragraph 31 above). Notably, this amount was to be recovered from H.G. as compensation for expenses paid from public funds with regard to Gegham Sergoyan ’ s medical treatment and payments made to the family after this death. In these circumstances, the Court is not able to accept the Government ’ s argument that the amount of AMD 2,250,000 could be considered to have constituted compensation for non-pecuniary damage paid to the applicant by the State."

In the above-mentioned case of Poghosyan and Baghdasaryan the Court has already found that the absence of the possibility at the relevant time to claim compensation for non-pecuniary damage suffered as a result of ill-treatment was contrary to the requirements of Article 13 of the Convention (see Poghosyan and Baghdasaryan, cited above, §§ 47-48). The Court considers that the possibility for the applicant to apply for compensation for non-pecuniary damage suffered as a result of the breach of his son ’ s right to life should have been all the more available to him. Since no such avenue had been available to him under the law as it stood at the material time, the applicant was deprived of an effective remedy. In the Court ’ s view, the possibility of obtaining an enforceable award of compensation for moral damage suffered as a result of the authorities ’ failure to protect the right to life of one ’ s child is an essential element of an effective remedy under Article 13 for a bereaved parent."

However, unlike in previous cases concerning alleged breaches of the Convention by the “MRT”, the Moldovan authorities in the present case were not limited to only fulfilling their positive obligations as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. The case is different in that, while not having control over the local authorities in Bender which disconnected prison no. 8 from the utilities, the Moldovan authorities had full control over that prison itself and the detainees there throughout the relevant period. They could have taken measures in the prison itself to cope with the effects of the disconnection from the utilities or they could have transferred the prisoners to other prisons at any time. By choosing to continue to detain the applicants in prison no. 8 without immediate action taken to ensure basic conditions of detention, the Moldovan authorities knowingly exposed them to the conditions which prevailed there after the disconnection from all utilities. In addition to the above-mentioned positive obligations, it was therefore also the direct responsibility of the Moldovan authorities to prevent or redress the alleged violation of the applicants ’ rights in that prison."

Besides, it notes that the Moldovan Government do not object to applying a similar approach in the present case. Therefore, it finds that Moldova has jurisdiction for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention, but that its responsibility for the acts complained of is to be assessed in the light of the above-mentioned positive obligations (see Ilaşcu and Others, cited above, § 335)."

However, unlike in previous cases concerning alleged breaches of the Convention by the “MRT”, the Moldovan authorities in the present case were not limited to only fulfilling their positive obligations as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. The case is different in that, while not having control over the local authorities in Bender which disconnected prison no. 8 from the utilities, the Moldovan authorities had full control over that prison itself and the detainees there throughout the relevant period. They could have taken measures in the prison itself to cope with the effects of the disconnection from the utilities or they could have transferred the prisoners to other prisons at any time. By choosing to continue to detain the applicants in prison no. 8 without immediate action taken to ensure basic conditions of detention, the Moldovan authorities knowingly exposed them to the conditions which prevailed there after the disconnection from all utilities. In addition to the above-mentioned positive obligations, it was therefore also the direct responsibility of the Moldovan authorities to prevent or redress the alleged violation of the applicants ’ rights in that prison."

In the same vein, the Court does not consider the lodging of a complaint in Moldovan courts against another country without the latter ’ s consent to be involved as a defendant (see paragraph 30 above) to be a remedy.

Insofar as the Government submitted that the applicants were warned about the conditions of detention in prison no. 8 and agreed to them before being transferred there, the Court reiterates at the outset that Article 3 of the Convention enshrines one of the most fundamental values of democratic society. It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim ’ s behaviour ( Muršić v. Croatia [GC], no. 7334/13, § 96, ECHR 2016). The Government ’ s submission could raise the question whether a waiver of the right under Article 3 is possible, notwithstanding the absolute nature of the prohibition. However, even assuming that such a waiver might be possible, the circumstances of the present case do not permit the conclusion that there has been any valid waiver. Indeed, the applicants were deprived of their liberty, and thus within the power of the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, M.S. v. Belgium, no. 50012/08, § 124, 31 January 2012). As the Court has held with respect to the waiver of certain procedural rights, a waiver must be of the applicant ’ s own free will and must be established in an unequivocal manner and attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see, among others, Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 135, 17 September 2009). However, the Government did not clarify the nature of the guarantees which would assure a free decision by the applicants."
